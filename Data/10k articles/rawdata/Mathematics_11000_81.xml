      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16190">In [[mathematics]], the '''Alexander polynomial''' is a [[knot invariant]] which assigns a [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients to each knot type.  [[James Waddell Alexander II]] discovered this, the first [[knot polynomial]], in 1923.  In 1969, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] showed a version of this polynomial, now called the '''Alexander–Conway polynomial''', could be computed using a [[skein relation]], although its significance was not realized until the discovery of the [[Jones polynomial]] in 1984.  Soon after Conway's reworking of the Alexander polynomial, it was realized that a similar skein relation was exhibited in Alexander's paper on his polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander describes his skein relation toward the end of his paper under the heading "miscellaneous theorems", which is possibly why it got lost.  [[Joan Birman]] mentions in her paper ''New points of view in knot theory'' (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 28 (1993), no. 2, 253–287) that Mark Kidwell brought her attention to Alexander's relation in 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Let ''K'' be a [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] in the [[3-sphere]].  Let ''X'' be the infinite [[covering space|cyclic cover]] of the [[knot complement]] of ''K''.  This covering can be obtained by cutting the knot complement along a [[Seifert surface]] of ''K'' and gluing together infinitely many copies of the resulting manifold with boundary in a cyclic manner.  There is a [[deck transformation|covering transformation]] ''t'' acting on ''X''.  Consider the first homology (with integer coefficients) of ''X'', denoted &lt;math&gt;H_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  The transformation ''t'' acts on the homology and so we can consider &lt;math&gt;H_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the ring of [[Laurent polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.  This is called the '''Alexander invariant''' or '''Alexander module'''.

The module is finitely presentable; a [[presentation matrix]] for this module is called the '''Alexander matrix'''.  If the number of generators, ''r'', is less than or equal to the number of relations, ''s'', then we consider the ideal generated by all ''r'' by ''r'' minors of the matrix; this is the zero'th [[Fitting ideal]] or '''Alexander ideal''' and does not depend on choice of presentation matrix.  If ''r &gt; s'', set the ideal equal to 0.  If the Alexander ideal is [[principal ideal|principal]], take a generator; this is called an Alexander polynomial of the knot.  Since this is only unique up to multiplication by the Laurent monomial &lt;math&gt;\pm t^n&lt;/math&gt;, one often fixes a particular unique form.  Alexander's choice of normalization is to make the polynomial have a positive [[constant term]].

Alexander proved that the Alexander ideal is nonzero and always principal.  Thus an Alexander polynomial always exists, and is clearly a knot invariant, denoted &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The Alexander polynomial for the knot configured by only one string is a polynomial of t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and then it is the same polynomial for the mirror image knot. Namely, it can not distinguish between the knot and one for its mirror image.

==Computing the polynomial==
The following procedure for computing the Alexander polynomial was given by J. W. Alexander in his paper.

Take an [[oriented]] diagram  of the knot with ''n'' crossings; there are ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 regions of the knot diagram. To work out the Alexander polynomial, first one must create an [[incidence matrix]] of size (''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2).  The ''n'' rows correspond to the ''n'' crossings, and the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 columns to the regions. The values for the matrix entries are either 0, 1, −1, ''t'', −''t''.

Consider the entry corresponding to a particular region and crossing. If the region is not adjacent to the crossing, the entry is 0. If the region is adjacent to the crossing, the entry depends on its location. The following table gives the entry, determined by the location of the region at the crossing from the perspective of the incoming undercrossing line.

: on the left before undercrossing: −''t''
: on the right before undercrossing: 1
: on the left after undercrossing: ''t''
: on the right after undercrossing: −1

Remove two columns corresponding to adjacent regions from the matrix, and work out the determinant of the new ''n'' by ''n'' matrix.  Depending on the columns removed, the answer will differ by multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\pm t^n&lt;/math&gt;.  To resolve this ambiguity, divide out the largest possible power of ''t'' and multiply by −1 if necessary, so that the constant term is positive.  This gives the Alexander polynomial.

The Alexander polynomial can also be computed from the [[Seifert matrix]].

After the work of J. W. Alexander, [[Ralph Fox]] considered a copresentation of the knot group &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^3\backslash K)&lt;/math&gt;, and introduced non-commutative differential calculus {{harvtxt|Fox|1961}}, which also permits one to compute &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Detailed exposition of this approach about higher Alexander polynomials can be found in the book {{harvtxt|Crowell|Fox|1963}}.

==Basic properties of the polynomial==

The Alexander polynomial is symmetric: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t^{-1}) = \Delta_K(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all knots K.

: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the [[Poincaré duality|Poincaré Duality isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt; \overline{H_1 X} \simeq \mathrm{Hom}_{\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]}(H_1 X, G) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of the field of fractions of &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, considered as a &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;-module, and where &lt;math&gt;\overline{H_1 X}&lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;-module to &lt;math&gt;H_1 X&lt;/math&gt; ie: as an abelian group it is identical to &lt;math&gt;H_1 X&lt;/math&gt; but the covering transformation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; acts by &lt;math&gt;t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore, the Alexander polynomial evaluates to a unit on 1: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(1)=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the fact that the knot complement is a homology circle, generated by the covering transformation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  More generally if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a 3-manifold such that &lt;math&gt;rank(H_1 M) = 1&lt;/math&gt; it has an Alexander polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Delta_M(t)&lt;/math&gt; defined as the order ideal of its infinite-cyclic covering space.  In this case &lt;math&gt;\Delta_M(1)&lt;/math&gt; is, up to sign, equal to the order of the torsion subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H_1 M&lt;/math&gt;.

It is known that every integral Laurent polynomial which is both symmetric and evaluates to a unit at 1 is the Alexander polynomial of a knot (Kawauchi 1996).

==Geometric significance of the polynomial==

Since the Alexander ideal is principal, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)=1&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] the commutator subgroup of the knot group is [[perfect group|perfect]] (i.e. equal to its own [[commutator subgroup]]).

For a [[topologically slice]] knot, the Alexander polynomial satisfies the Fox–Milnor condition &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t) = f(t)f(t^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some other integral Laurent polynomial.

Twice the [[Seifert surface|knot genus]] is bounded below by the degree of the Alexander polynomial.

[[Michael Freedman]] proved that a knot in the 3-sphere is [[topologically slice]]; i.e., bounds a "locally-flat" topological disc in the 4-ball, if the Alexander polynomial of the knot is trivial (Freedman and Quinn, 1990).

{{harvtxt|Kauffman|1983}} describes the first construction of the Alexander polynomial via state sums derived from physical models. A survey of these topic and other connections with physics are given in {{harvtxt|Kauffman|2001}}.

There are other relations with surfaces and smooth 4-dimensional topology. For example, under certain assumptions, there is a way of modifying a smooth [[4-manifold]] by performing a [[surgery theory|surgery]] that consists of removing a neighborhood of a two-dimensional torus and replacing it with a knot complement crossed with ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The result is a smooth 4-manifold homeomorphic to the original, though now the [[Seiberg–Witten invariant]] has been modified by multiplication with the Alexander polynomial of the knot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv&lt;!-- Deny Citation Bot--&gt;|arxiv = dg-ga/9612014 |title = Knots, Links, and 4-Manifolds  |last1 = Fintushel|first1 = Ronald|last2 = Stern|first2 = Ronald J|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knots with symmetries are known to have restricted Alexander polynomials. See the symmetry section in (Kawauchi 1996). Nonetheless, the Alexander polynomial can fail to detect some symmetries, such as strong invertibility.

If the [[knot complement]] fibers over the circle, then the Alexander polynomial of the knot is known to be ''monic'' (the coefficients of the highest and lowest order terms are equal to &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;). In fact, if &lt;math&gt;S \to C_K \to S^1&lt;/math&gt; is a fiber bundle where &lt;math&gt;C_K&lt;/math&gt; is the knot complement, let &lt;math&gt;g : S \to S&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[monodromy]], then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t) = {\rm Det}(tI-g_*)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_*\colon H_1 S \to H_1 S&lt;/math&gt; is the induced map on homology.

==Relations to satellite operations==

If a knot &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[satellite knot]] with pattern knot &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; (there exists an embedding &lt;math&gt;f : S^1 \times D^2 \to S^3&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K=f(K')&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times D^2 \subset S^3&lt;/math&gt; is an unknotted solid torus containing &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t) = \Delta_{f(S^1 \times \{0\})}(t^a) \Delta_{K'}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; is the integer that represents &lt;math&gt;K' \subset S^1 \times D^2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H_1(S^1\times D^2) = \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples: For a connect-sum &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{K_1 \# K_2}(t) = \Delta_{K_1}(t) \Delta_{K_2}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is an untwisted [[Satellite knot|Whitehead double]], then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Alexander–Conway polynomial==
Alexander proved the Alexander polynomial satisfies a skein relation.  [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] later rediscovered this in a different form and showed that the skein relation together with a choice of value on the unknot was enough to determine the polynomial.  Conway's version is a polynomial in ''z'' with integer coefficients, denoted &lt;math&gt;\nabla(z)&lt;/math&gt; and called the '''Alexander–Conway polynomial''' (also known as '''Conway polynomial''' or '''Conway–Alexander polynomial''').

Suppose we are given an oriented link diagram, where &lt;math&gt;L_+, L_-, L_0&lt;/math&gt; are link diagrams resulting from crossing and smoothing changes on a local region of a specified crossing of the diagram, as indicated in the figure.  [[Image:Skein (HOMFLY).svg|200px|center]]

Here are Conway's skein relations:

* &lt;math&gt;\nabla(O) = 1&lt;/math&gt; (where O is any diagram of the unknot)
* &lt;math&gt;\nabla(L_+) - \nabla(L_-) = z \nabla(L_0)&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship to the standard Alexander polynomial is given by &lt;math&gt;\Delta_L(t^2) = \nabla_L(t - t^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;\Delta_L&lt;/math&gt; must be properly normalized (by multiplication of &lt;math&gt;\pm t^{n/2}&lt;/math&gt;) to satisfy the skein relation &lt;math&gt;\Delta(L_+) - \Delta(L_-) = (t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2}) \Delta(L_0)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this relation gives a Laurent polynomial in ''t&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

See [[knot theory]] for an example computing the Conway polynomial of the trefoil.

==Relation to Floer homology==

Using pseudo-holomorphic curves, {{harvtxt|Ozsvath|Szabo|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Rasmussen|2003}} associated a bigraded abelian group, called knot Floer homology, to each isotopy class of knots. The graded [[Euler characteristic]] of knot Floer homology is the Alexander polynomial. While the Alexander polynomial gives a lower bound on the genus of a knot, {{harvtxt|Ozsvath|Szabo|2004b}} showed that knot Floer homology detects the genus. Similarly, while the Alexander polynomial gives an obstruction to a knot complement fibering over the circle, {{harvtxt|Ni|2007}} showed that knot Floer homology completely determines when a knot complement fibers over the circle. The knot Floer homology groups are part of the Heegaard Floer homology family of invariants; see [[Floer homology]] for further discussion.

{{Other uses|Annuity (disambiguation)}}
Under [[European Union law]], an '''annuity''' is a financial contract which provides an income stream in return for an initial payment with specific parameters. It is the opposite of a [[Settlement (finance)|settlement funding]].  A [[Swiss annuity]] is not considered a European annuity for tax reasons.

==Immediate annuity==
An immediate annuity is an annuity for which the time between the contract date and the date of the first payment is not longer than the time interval between payments. A common use for an immediate annuity is to provide a [[pension]] to a retired person or persons.

It is a [[financial contract]] which makes a series of payments with certain characteristics:
* either level or fluctuating periodical payments
* made annually, or at more frequent intervals{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=75}}
* in advance or arrears
* duration may be:
**fixed (annuity certain)
**during the lifetime or one or more persons, possibly reduced after death of one person
**during the lifetime but not longer than a maximum number of years
**during the lifetime but not shorter than a minimum number of years

===Annuity certain===
An annuity certain pays the annuitant for a number of years designated. This option is not suitable for retirement income, as the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay.

===Life annuity===
A [[life annuity]] or lifetime immediate annuity is most often used to provide an income in old age (i.e., a [[pension]]). This type of annuity may be purchased from an [[insurance]] (Ireland and the UK, [[Life Assurance]]) company.

This annuity can be compared to a loan which is made by the purchaser to the issuing company, who then pay back the original capital with interest to the ''annuitant'' on whose life the annuity is based. The assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant but life annuities are payable until the death of the last surviving annuitant. In order to guarantee that the income continues for life, the investment relies on cross-subsidy. Because an ''annuity population'' can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the population's [[mean]] (average) age, those dying earlier will support those living longer ([[longevity insurance]]).

Cross-subsidy remains one of the most effective ways of spreading a given amount of capital and investment return over a lifetime without the risk of funds running out.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====Life annuity options====
Although this will reduce the available payments, an annuity can be arranged to continue until the death of the last survivor of two or more people. For example, many annuities continue to pay out (perhaps at a reduced rate) to the spouse of the main annuitant after his or her death, for as long as the spouse survives. The annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity. However, if the annuitant is in good health, it may be more beneficial to select the higher payout option on their life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor.

Other features such as a minimum guaranteed payment period irrespective of death, known as life with period certain, or ''escalation'' where the payment rises by inflation or a fixed rate annually can also be purchased.

Annuities with guaranteed periods are available from most providers. In such a product, if death takes place within the guaranteed period,  payments continue to be made to a nominated [[beneficiary]].

Impaired life annuities for [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] or those with a particular illness are also available from some insurance companies. Since the life expectancy is reduced, the annuity rate is better (i.e. a higher annuity for the same initial payment).  This can have the unfortunate appearance of one "betting against" the nominee.

Life annuities are priced based on the probability of the nominee surviving to receive the payments. [[Longevity insurance]] is a form of annuity that defers commencement of the payments until very late in life. A common [[longevity]] contract would be purchased at or before retirement but would not commence payments until 20 years after retirement. If the nominee dies before payments commence there is no payable benefit. This drastically reduces the cost of the annuity while still providing protection against outliving one's resources.

==Deferred annuity==
The second usage for the term ''annuity'' came into its own during the 1970s. This is a ''deferred annuity'' and is a vehicle for accumulating savings, and eventually distributing them either as an immediate annuity or as a lump-sum payment. Note that this is different from an immediate annuity.

Under the heading of deferred annuities, there are contracts which may be similar to 
*bank deposits in that they offer the buyer interest on their money and a guaranteed return of capital, or
*stock index funds or other stock funds (such as ETFs), where the growth or shrinkage of the account depends on the performance of the market.
Contracts may also be linked to other investments such as property (real estate) or government bonds, or any combination of the above selected by the investor or his advisors.
All varieties of deferred annuities owned by individuals have one thing in common in many jurisdictions: any increase in account values is ''not'' taxed until those gains are withdrawn. This is also known as tax-deferred growth.

To complete the definitions here, a deferred annuity where the benefits are fixed at outside, either in terms of a lump sum or an annuity, can be called a ''fixed deferred annuity''. A deferred annuity that permits allocations to stock or bond funds and for which the account value is not guaranteed to stay above the initial amount invested is called a ''variable annuity''. &lt;!--In the last ten years a new category of deferred annuities have emerged in the United States, called ''equity indexed annuities'' (EIAs). These policies are a hybrid of the two types of deferred annuities just described. The EIA offers a guarantee that the account value will never drop below the initial amount invested while also offering a chance to participate in the upside potential of any increase in the value of a major [[stock market index]], such as the [[S&amp;P 500]] or [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].--&gt;

By law, an annuity contract can only be issued by an insurance company. They are distributed by, and available for purchase from, duly licensed bank, stock brokerage, and insurance company representatives. Some annuities may also be purchased directly from the issuer, i.e., the insurance company writing the contract.

In a typical immediate annuity contract, an individual would pay a lump sum or a series of payments (sometimes called ''annuity considerations'') to an insurance company, and in return pay the annuitant a series of periodic payments for the rest of their life. The exact terms of an annuity product are set out in the [[contract]].

In common with other types of insurance contract, both immediate and deferred annuities will typically pay commission to the sales person (or ''advisor'').
&lt;!-- doesn't add any useful information There are two phases to a deferred annuity. 
The accumulation phase is the time between initial purchase and annuitization.

The annuitisation phase starts when the annuity is turned into a stream of payments. Before annuitisation, the deferred annuity contract may allow additional purchase premium payments to be added, increasing the contract's value. In a deferred annuity, the goal is to invest the premium payments in either guaranteed accounts or variable accounts and earn investment returns. These returns can then be withdrawn when desired depending on the features of the contract. --&gt;

A wide variety of features have been developed by annuity companies in order to make their products more attractive. These include death benefit options and living benefit options.&lt;!--

not generally true in Europe Deferred annuities are criticised and controversial, because they often generate a higher commission then other forms of investment, leading to suspicions or actual cases of conflict of interest. Of particular controversy are surrender charges, in which a certain percentage of the account value is taken by the insurance company as a fee in the case of early withdrawal. The charges may be applicable over a long time frame, say 7 or 10 years. Many of the deferred annuity controversies have come from these products being sold to people who need to spend all of their money within the lockup period. However, as most annuities allow you to take out up to 10% per year with no penalty, this point is moot for individuals who are taking an income below this amount from the annuity. --&gt;

==Investment considerations==

===Immediate annuities===

Because immediate annuities generally provide a series of guaranteed payments, the annuity company normally matches its liabilities with government bonds and other high grade bonds, and the market yield available on these bonds largely determines the retail pricing of the annuities. (The companies are usually required by law to invest their funds in this way, to reduce the risk of default.)

These investments are generally regarded as less risky than other investments, such as those linked to the [[stock market]], and probably offer a lower [[expected return]]. However fixed annuities do not protect the purchaser against the effects of inflation, which is a material risk.

For many elderly people, the financial risk of living longer than expected and running out of money is a bigger risk than investment risks such as exposure to a falling stock market. Immediate annuities protect against this risk.

===Deferred annuities===

Deferred pensions are often used as a savings vehicle by higher rate taxpayers, as in some jurisdictions they get higher rate tax relief on their pension contributions and their fund accumulates without investment returns being subject to tax. The proceeds will be taxed when they are taken as benefits, but maybe at a lower rate.  Those in lower tax brackets may be told to avoid deferred pensions because they may not be able to recoup the charges made by the annuity company. (In some jurisdictions, some or all of the proceeds must by law be applied to purchase a pension.)

==Actuarial considerations==
Actuarial formulae are used to model annuities and determine their price.

===Payment options for immediate annuities===
In technical language an annuity is said to be payable for an assigned ''status'', this being a general word chosen in preference to such words as "time", "term" or "period", because it may include more readily either a term of years certain, or a life or combination of lives. The ''magnitude'' of the annuity is the sum to be paid (and received) in the course of each year. Thus, if £100 is to be received each year by a person, he is said to have "an annuity of £100". If the payments are made half-yearly, it is sometimes said that he has "a half-yearly annuity of £100"; but to avoid ambiguity, it is more commonly said he has "an annuity of £100, payable by half-yearly instalments". An annuity is considered as accruing during each instant of the status for which it is enjoyed, although it is only payable at fixed intervals. If the enjoyment of an annuity is postponed until after the lapse of a certain number of years, the annuity is said to be ''deferred''. If an annuity, instead of being payable at the end of each year, half-year, etc., is payable in advance, it is called an ''annuity-due''. The holder of an annuity is called an ''annuitant'', and the person on whose life the annuity depends is called the ''nominee''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=75}}

Upon immediate annuitization, a wide variety of options are available in the way the stream of payments is paid. If the annuity is paid over a fixed period independent of any contingency, it is known as an ''annuity with period certain'', or just ''annuity certain''; if it is to continue for ever, it is called a ''perpetuity''; and if in the latter case it is not to commence until after a term of years, it is called a ''deferred perpetuity''. An annuity depending on the continuance of an assigned life or lives would commonly be called a ''life annuity'', but also known as a ''life-contingent annuity'' or simply ''lifetime annuity''; but more commonly the simple term "annuity" is understood to mean a life annuity, unless the contrary is stated.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=75}} The payments can also be paid over the lifetime of the nominee(s) or for a fixed period, whichever is longer. This is known as ''life with period certain''.

A hybrid of these is when the payments stop at death, but also after a predetermined number of payments, if this is earlier: known as a ''temporary life annuity''. The difference with the period certain annuity is that the period certain annuity will keep paying after the death of the nominee until the period is completed.

If not otherwise stated, it is always understood that an annuity is payable yearly, and that the annual payment (or rent, as it is sometimes called) is a single currency unit.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=75}}

Instances of perpetuities are the dividends upon the public stocks in England, France and some other countries. Thus, although it is usual to speak of £100 consols, the reality is the yearly dividend which the government pays by quarterly instalments. The practice of the French in this is arguably more logical. In speaking of their public funds (''rentes'') they do not mention the ideal capital sum, but speak of the annuity or annual payment that is received by the public creditor. Other instances of perpetuities are the incomes derived from the debenture stocks of railway companies, also the feu-duties commonly payable on house property in Scotland. The number of years' purchase which the perpetual annuities granted by a government or a railway company realize in the open market, forms a very simple test of the credit of the various governments or railways.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=75}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], the income from ''compulsory purchase annuities'' purchased with pension funds or by an employer immediately on retirement (a ''Hancock'' annuity) is treated as taxable income. The income from ''purchased life annuities'', bought by any other means, has an element which is considered return of capital, and only the excess over this is considered a gain that is subject to income tax. The element considered capital return is based on life expectancy and will therefore increase with age.

==Government incentives==
Because of cross-subsidy and the guarantees an annuity can give against running out of income and becoming dependent on state [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] in old age, annuities often have a favourable tax treatment, which may affect how attractive they are relative to other investments.

Immediate annuities are a compulsory feature of certain pension saving schemes in some countries, where the government grants tax deductions, provided that savings are paid into a fund which can only (or mainly) be withdrawn as an annuity. The [[Netherlands]] has such schemes and United Kingdom used to until [[A day]]. From 2003 the tax deduction in the Netherlands is only allowed if, without additional savings, the old age income would be less than 70% of the current income. The French government currently honors a very unusual debt contract: an annuity that was issued in 1738 and currently yields €1.20 per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_12.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Case of the Undying Debt'', November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the [[United Kingdom]] contributions into pension savings are generally net of income tax (i.e. tax relief is available), up to certain limits. On retirement if an annuity is not purchased, retirement income up until the age of 75 can be drawn from the pension fund by using ''pension income withdrawal'' commonly known as  ''income drawdown''. This is an unsecured pension as opposed to an annuity which is a secured backed pension. Unsecured pensions operate under age-related income limits calculated by the Government Actuarial Department to prevent the fund being eroded too fast. Before A-day, individuals could vary withdrawals between 35% and 100% of a maximum limit, recalculated every three years at what was known as the ''triennial review''. Following changes introduced by HMRC as part of the A-day legislation, individuals can now draw an income between zero and 120% of the "GAD rate". On reaching 75, the individual must then secure their pension fund by the purchase of an annuity, except that up to 25% of the fund can be taken as tax-free cash, also known as the [[Pension fund|pension commencement]] [[lump sum]], or enter into an alternatively secured pension (ASP). Under an ASP arrangement the rate of income must fall between 55% and 90% of the GAD rate for a 75-year-old. The GAD rates are subject to periodic review and are based on the return of a level, single life annuity paid monthly in arrears without any guarantee or value protection for an individual in good health. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} These rates are in turn largely dependent on long-term [[Gilt-edged securities|gilt]] yields and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] data.

Unsecured or alternatively secured pensions carry both the [[financial risk|investment risk]] of the invested pension fund and [[mortality drag]] that occurs from the loss of cross-subsidy and advancing average age expectancy that occurs in the time over which annuity purchase is delayed.

== Terminable annuities ==
Terminable annuities are employed in the system of British public finance as a means of reducing the [[National Debt]]. This result is attained by substituting for a perpetual annual charge (or one lasting until the capital which it represents can be paid off ''en bloc''), an annual charge of a larger amount, but lasting for a short term. The latter is so calculated as to pay off, during its existence, the capital which it replaces, with interest at an assumed or agreed rate, and under specified conditions. The practical effect of the substitution of a terminable annuity for an obligation of longer currency is to bind the present generation of citizens to increase its own obligations in the present and near future in order to diminish those of its successors. This end might be attained in other ways; for instance, by setting aside out of revenue a fixed annual sum for the purchase and cancellation of debt (Pitt's method, in intention), or by fixing the annual debt charge at a figure sufficient to provide a margin for reduction of the principal of the debt beyond the amount required for interest (Sir Stafford Northcote's method), or by providing an annual surplus of revenue over expenditure (the "Old Sinking Fund"), available for the same purpose. All these methods have been tried in the course of British financial history, and the second and third of them are still employed; but on the whole the method of terminable annuities has been the one preferred by chancellors of the exchequer and by parliament.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=75–76}}

Terminable annuities, as employed by the British government, fall under two heads:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}
# Those issued to, or held by private persons;
# those held by government departments or by funds under government control.
The important difference between these two classes is that an annuity under (1), once created, cannot be modified except with the holder's consent, i.e. is practically unalterable without a breach of public faith; whereas an annuity under (2) can, if necessary, be altered by interdepartmental arrangement under the authority of parliament. Thus annuities of class (1) fulfil most perfectly the object of the system as explained above; while those of class (2) have the advantage that in times of emergency their operation can be suspended without any inconvenience or breach of faith, with the result that the resources of government can on such occasions be materially increased, apart from any additional taxation. For this purpose it is only necessary to retain as a charge on the income of the year a sum equal to the (smaller) perpetual charge which was originally replaced by the (larger) terminable charge, whereupon the difference between the two amounts is temporarily released, while ultimately the increased charge is extended for a period equal to that for which it is suspended.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}

Annuities of class (1) were first instituted in 1808, but were later regulated by an act of 1829. They may be granted either for a specified life, or two lives, or for an arbitrary term of years; and the consideration for them may take the form either of cash or of government stock, the latter being cancelled when the annuity is set up.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}

Annuities (2) held by government departments date from 1863. They were created in exchange for permanent debt surrendered for cancellation, the principal operations having been effected in 1863, 1867, 1870, 1874, 1883 and 1899.

Annuities of this class do not affect the public at all, except of course in their effect on the market for government securities. They are merely financial operations between the government, in its capacity as the banker of savings banks and other funds, and itself, in the capacity of custodian of the national finances. Savings bank depositors are not concerned with the manner in which government invests their money, their rights being confined to the receipt of interest and the repayment of deposits upon specified conditions. The case is, however, different as regards forty millions of consols (included in the above figures), belonging to suitors in chancery, which were cancelled and replaced by a terminable annuity in 1883. As the liability to the suitors in that case was for a specified amount of stock, special arrangements were made to ensure the ultimate replacement of the precise amount of stock cancelled.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}

== Annuity calculations ==
The mathematical theory of life annuities is based upon a knowledge of the rate of mortality among mankind in general, or among the particular class of persons on whose lives the annuities depend, see [[actuarial present value]]. In practice simply tables may be used, which vary in different places, but which are easily accessible.

==History of calculating life annuities or pensions==
[[Abraham Demoivre]], in his ''Annuities on Lives'', put forth a very simple law of mortality: out of 86 children born alive, 1 will die every year until the last dies between the ages of 85 and 86. This law agreed sufficiently well at the Middle Ages of life with the mortality deduced from the best observations of his time; but, as observations became more exact, the approximation was found to be not sufficiently close. This was particularly the case when it was desired to obtain the value of joint life, contingent or other complicated benefits. Therefore, Demoivre's law is devoid of practical utility. No simple formula has sufficient accuracy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}

The rate of mortality at each age is, therefore, in practice usually determined by a series of figures deduced from observation; and the value of an annuity at any age is found from these numbers by means of a series of arithmetical calculations.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}

The first writer who is known to have attempted to obtain, on correct mathematical principles, the value of a life annuity, was [[Jan De Witt]], grand pensionary of Holland and West Friesland. Our knowledge of his writings on the subject is derived from two papers contributed by Frederick Hendriks to the ''Assurance Magazine'', vol. ii. (1852) p.&amp;nbsp;222, and vol. in. p.&amp;nbsp;93. The former of these contains a translation of De Witt's report upon the value of life annuities, which was prepared in consequence of the resolution passed by the states-general, on 25 April 1671, to negotiate funds by life annuities, and which was distributed to the members on 30 July 1671. The latter contains the translation of a number of letters addressed by De Witt to Burgomaster Johan Hudde, bearing dates from September 1670 to October 1671. The existence of De Witt's report was well known among his contemporaries, and Hendriks collected a number of extracts from various authors referring to it; but the report is not contained in any collection of his works extant, and had been entirely lost for 180 years, until Hendriks discovered it among the state archives of Holland in company with the letters to Hudde. It was the very first document on the subject that was ever written.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}

It appears that it had long been the practice in Holland for life annuities to be granted to nominees of any age, in the constant proportion of double the rate of interest allowed on stock; that is to say, if the towns were borrowing money at 6%, they would be willing to grant a life annuity at 12%, and so on. De Witt states that "annuities have been sold, even in the present century, first at six years' purchase, then at seven and eight; and that the majority of all life annuities now current at the country's expense were obtained at nine years' purchase"; but that the price had been increased in the course of a few years from eleven years' purchase to twelve, and from twelve to fourteen. He also states that the rate of interest had been successively reduced from 6-¼% to 5%, and then to 4%. The principal object of his report is to prove that, taking interest at 4%, a life annuity was worth at least sixteen years' purchase; and, in fact, that an annuitant purchasing an annuity for the life of a young and healthy nominee at sixteen years' purchase, made an excellent bargain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=76}}

He argues that it is more to the advantage, both of the country and of the private investor, that the public loans should be raised by way of grant of life annuities rather than perpetual annuities. It appears from De Witt's correspondence with Hudde, that the rate of mortality assumed was deduced from the mortality that had actually prevailed among the nominees on whose lives annuities had been granted in former years. De Witt appears to have come to the conclusion that the probability of death is the same in any half-year from the age of 3 to 53 inclusive; that in the next ten years, from 53 to 63, the probability is greater in the ratio of 3 to 2; that in the next ten years, from 63 to 73, it is greater in the ratio of 2 to 1; and in the next seven years, from 73 to 80, it is greater in the ratio of 3 to 1; and he places the limit of human life at 80. If a mortality table of the usual form is deduced from these suppositions, out of 212 persons alive at the age of 3, 2 will die every year up to 53, 3 in each of the ten years from 53 to 63, 4 in each of the next ten years from 63 to 73, and 6 in each of the next seven years from 73 to 80, when all will be dead.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=76–77}}

De Witt calculates the value of an annuity in the following way. Assume that annuities on 10,000 lives each ten years of age, which satisfy the Hm mortality table, have been purchased. Of these nominees 79 will die before attaining the age of 11, and no annuity payment will be made in respect of them; none will die between the ages of 11 and 12, so that annuities will be paid for one year on 9921 lives; 40 attain the age of 12 and die before 13, so that two payments will be made with respect to these lives. Reasoning in this way we see that the annuities on 35 of the nominees will be payable for three years; on 40 for four years, and so on. Proceeding thus to the end of the table, 15 nominees attain the age of 95, 5 of whom die before the age of 96, so that 85 payments will be paid in respect of these 5 lives. Of the survivors all die before attaining the age of 97, so that the annuities on these lives will be payable for 86 years. Having previously calculated a table of the values of annuities certain for every number of years up to 86, the value of all the annuities on the 10,000 nominees will be found by taking 40 times the value of an annuity for 2 years, 35 times the value of an annuity for 3 years, and so on—the last term being the value of 10 annuities for 86 years—and adding them together; and the value of an annuity on one of the nominees will then be found by dividing by 10,000. Before leaving the subject of De Witt, we may mention that we find in the correspondence a distinct suggestion of the law of mortality that bears the name of Demoivre. In De Witt's letter, dated 27 October 1671 (''Ass. Mag''. vol. iii. p.&amp;nbsp;107), he speaks of a "provisional hypothesis" suggested by Hudde, that out of 80 young lives (who, from the context, may be taken as of the age 6) about 1 dies annually. In strictness, therefore, the law in question might be more correctly termed Hudde's than Demoivre's.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=77}}

De Witt's report being thus of the nature of an unpublished state paper, although it contributed to its author's reputation, did not contribute to advance the exact knowledge of the subject; and the author to whom the credit must be given of first showing how to calculate the value of an annuity on correct principles is [[Edmund Halley]]. He gave the first approximately correct mortality table (deduced from the records of the numbers of deaths and baptisms in the city of Breslau), and showed how it might be employed to calculate the value of an annuity on the life of a nominee of any age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=77}} cites ''Phil. Trans''. 1693; ''Ass. Mag''. vol. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously to Halley's time, and apparently for many years subsequently, all dealings with life annuities were based upon mere conjectural estimates. The earliest known reference to any estimate of the value of life annuities rose out of the requirements of the [[Falcidian law]], which in 40 B.C. was adopted in the Roman Empire, and which declared that a testator should not give more than three-fourths of his property in legacies, so that at least one-fourth must go to his legal representatives. It is easy to see how it would occasionally become necessary, while this law was in force, to value life annuities charged upon a testator's estate. Aemilius Macer (A.D. 230) states that the method which had been in common use at that time was as follows:--From the earliest age until 30 take 30 years' purchase, and for each age after 30 deduct 1 year. It is obvious that no consideration of compound interest can have entered into this estimate; and it is easy to see that it is equivalent to assuming that all persons who attain the age of 30 will certainly live to the age of 60, and then certainly die. Compared with this estimate, that which was propounded by the praetorian prefect Ulpian was a great improvement. His table is as follows:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=77}}

Here also we have no reason to suppose that the element of interest was taken into consideration; and the assumption, that between the ages of 40 and 50 each addition of a year to the nominee's age diminishes the value of the annuity by one year's purchase, is equivalent to assuming that there is no probability of the nominee dying between the ages of 40 and 50. Considered, however, simply as a table of the average duration of life, the values are fairly accurate. At all events, no more correct estimate appears to have been arrived at until the close of the 17th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=77}}

The mathematics of annuities has been very fully treated in Demoivre's ''Treatise on Annuities'' (1725); Simpson's ''Doctrine of Annuities and Reversions'' (1742); P. Gray, ''Tables and Formulae''; Baily's ''Doctrine of Life Annuities''; there are also innumerable compilations of ''Valuation Tables'' and ''Interest Tables'', by means of which the value of an annuity at any age and any rate of interest may be found. See also the article [[interest]], and especially that on [[insurance]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=77}}

''Commutation tables'', aptly so named in 1840 by Augustus De Morgan (see his paper "On the Calculation of Single Life Contingencies," ''Assurance Magazine'', xii. 328), show the proportion in which a benefit due at one age ought to be changed, so as to retain the same value and be due at another age. The earliest known specimen of a commutation table is contained in William Dale's ''Introduction to the Study of the Doctrine of Annuities'', published in 1772. A full account of this work is given by F. Hendriks in the second number of the ''Assurance Magazine'', pp.&amp;nbsp;15–17. William Morgan's ''Treatise on Assurances'', 1779, also contains a commutation table. Morgan gives the table as furnishing a convenient means of checking the correctness of the values of annuities found by the ordinary process. It may be assumed that he was aware that the table might be used for the direct calculation of annuities; but he appears to have been ignorant of its other uses.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=77}}

The first author who fully developed the powers of the table was John Nicholas Tetens, a native of Schleswig, who in 1785, while professor of philosophy and mathematics at Kiel, published in the German language an ''Introduction to the Calculation of Life Annuities and Assurances''. This work appears to have been quite unknown in England until F. Hendriks gave, in the first number of the ''Assurance Magazine'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–20 (Sept. 1850), an account of it, with a translation of the passages describing the construction and use of the commutation table, and a sketch of the author's life and writings, to which we refer the reader who desires fuller information. It may be mentioned here that Tetens also gave only a specimen table, apparently not imagining that persons using his work would find it extremely useful to have a series of commutation tables, calculated and printed ready for use.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=77–78}}

The use of the commutation table was independently developed in England-apparently between the years 1788 and 1811—by George Barrett, of Petworth, Sussex, who was the son of a yeoman farmer, and was himself a village schoolmaster, and afterwards farm steward or bailiff. It has been usual to consider Barrett as the originator in England of the method of calculating the values of annuities by means of a commutation table, and this method is accordingly sometimes called Barrett's method. (It is also called the commutation method and the columnar method.) Barrett's method of calculating annuities was explained by him to Francis Baily in 1811, and was first made known to the world in a paper written by the latter and read before the Royal Society in 1812.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}

By what has been universally considered an unfortunate error of judgment, this paper was not recommended by the council of the Royal Society to be printed, but it was given by Baily as an appendix to the second issue (in 1813) of his work on life annuities and assurances. Barrett had calculated extensive tables, and with Baily's aid attempted to get them published by subscription, but without success; and the only printed tables calculated according to his manner, besides the specimen tables given by Baily, are the tables contained in Babbage's ''Comparative View of the various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives'', 1826.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}

In 1825 Griffith Davies published his ''Tables of Life Contingencies'', a work which contains, among others, two tables, which are confessedly derived from Baily's explanation of Barrett's tables.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}

Those who desire to pursue the subject further can refer to the appendix to Baily's ''Life Annuities and Assurances'', De Morgan's paper "On the Calculation of Single Life Contingencies," ''Assurance Magazine'', xii. 348-349; Gray's ''Tables and Formulae'' chap. viii.; the preface to Davies's ''Treatise on Annuities''; also Hendriks's papers in the ''Assurance Magazine'', No. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;1, and No. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;12; and in particular De Morgan's "Account of a Correspondence between Mr George Barrett and Mr Francis Baily," in the ''Assurance Magazine'', vol. iv. p.&amp;nbsp;185.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}

The principal commutation tables published in England are contained in the following works:--David Jones, ''Value of Annuities and Reversionary Payments'', issued in parts by the Useful Knowledge Society, completed in 1843; Jenkin Jones, ''New Rate of Mortality'', 1843; G. Davies, ''Treatise on Annuities'', 1825 (issued 1855); David Chisholm, ''Commutation Tables'', 1858; Nelson's ''Contributions to Vital Statistics'', 1857; Jardine Henry, ''Government Life Annuity Commutation Tables'', 1866 and 1873; ''Institute of Actuaries Life Tables'', 1872; R. P. Hardy, ''Valuation Tables'', 1873; and Dr William Farr's contributions to the sixth (1844), twelfth (1849), and twentieth (1857) ''Reports'' of the Registrar General in England (English Tables, I. 2), and to the ''English Life Table'', 1864.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}

The theory of annuities may be further studied in the discussions in the English ''Journal of the Institute of Actuaries''. The institute was founded in 1848, the first sessional meeting being held in January 1849. Its establishment has contributed in various ways to promote the study of the theory of life contingencies. Among these may be specified the following:--Before it was formed, students of the subject worked for the most part alone, and without any concert; and when any person had made an improvement in the theory, it had little chance of becoming publicly known unless he wrote a formal treatise on the whole subject. But the formation of the institute led to much greater interchange of opinion among actuaries, and afforded them a ready means of making known to their professional associates any improvements, real or supposed, that they thought they had made. Again, the discussions which follow the reading of papers before the institute have often served, first, to bring out into bold relief differences of opinion that were previously unsuspected, and afterwards to soften down those differences,--to correct extreme opinions in every direction, and to bring about a greater agreement of opinion on many important subjects. In no way, probably, have the objects of the institute been so effectually advanced as by the publication of its ''Journal''. The first number of this work, which was originally called the ''Assurance Magazine'', appeared in September 1850, and it has been continued quarterly down to the present time. It was originated by the public spirit of two well-known actuaries (Mr Charles Jellicoe and Mr Samuel Brown), and was adopted as the organ of the Institute of Actuaries in 1852, and called the ''Assurance Magazine and Journal of the Institute of Actuaries'', Mr Jellicoe continuing to be the editor,--a post he held until the year 1867, when he was succeeded by Mr T. B. Sprague (who contributed to the 9th edition of this Encyclopaedia an elaborate article on "Annuities," on which the above account is based). The name was again changed in 1866, the words "Assurance Magazine" being dropped; but in the following year it was considered desirable to resume these, for the purpose of showing the continuity of the publication, and it is now called the ''Journal of the Institute of Actuaries and Assurance Magazine''. This work contains not only the papers read before the institute (to which have been appended of late years short abstracts of the discussions on them), and many original papers which were unsuitable for reading, together with correspondence, but also reprints of many papers published elsewhere, which from various causes had become difficult of access to the ordinary reader, among which may be specified various papers which originally appeared in the ''Philosophical Transactions'', the ''Philosophical Magazine'', the ''Mechanics' Magazine'', and the ''Companion to the Almanac''; also translations of various papers from the French, German, and Danish. Among the useful objects which the continuous publication of the ''Journal'' of the institute has served, we may specify in particular two:--that any supposed improvement in the theory was effectually submitted to the criticisms of the whole actuarial profession, and its real value speedily discovered; and that any real improvement, whether great or small, being placed on record, successive writers have been able, one after the other, to take it up and develop it, each commencing where the previous one had left off.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=78}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">In [[linear algebra]] and related areas of [[mathematics]] a '''balanced set''', '''circled set''' or '''disk''' in a [[vector space]] (over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' with an [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] function &lt;math&gt;|\cdot |&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' such that for all [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\alpha| \leqslant 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha S \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha S := \{\alpha x \mid x \in S\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''balanced hull''' or '''balanced envelope''' for a set ''S'' is the smallest balanced set containing ''S''. It can be constructed as the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all balanced sets containing ''S''.

== Examples ==
* The open and closed [[open ball|balls]] centered at 0 in a [[normed vector space]] are balanced sets.
* Any subspace of a real or complex [[vector space]] is a balanced set.
* The [[cartesian product]] of a family of balanced sets is balanced in the [[product space]] of the corresponding vector spaces (over the same field ''K'').
* Consider &lt;math&gt;\Complex,&lt;/math&gt; the field of complex numbers, as a 1-dimensional vector space. The balanced sets are &lt;math&gt;\Complex&lt;/math&gt; itself, the empty set and the open and closed discs centered at zero. Contrariwise, in the two dimensional Euclidean space there are many more balanced sets: any line segment with midpoint at the origin will do. As a result, &lt;math&gt;\Complex&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt; are entirely different as far as their vector space structure is concerned.
* If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a semi-norm on a linear space &lt;math&gt;X,&lt;/math&gt; then for any constant &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; the set 
::&lt;math&gt;\{ x \in X \mid p(x) \leqslant c \}&lt;/math&gt; 
:is balanced.

== Properties ==

* The [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of balanced sets is a balanced set.
* The closure of a balanced set is balanced.
* The union of &lt;math&gt;\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; and the interior of a balanced set is balanced.
* A set is [[absolutely convex]] if and only if it is [[Convex set|convex]] and balanced

The matching is constructed by iteratively improving an initial empty matching along augmenting paths in the graph. Unlike [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] matching, the key new idea is that an odd-length cycle in the graph (blossom) is contracted to a single vertex, with the search continuing iteratively in the contracted graph.

A major reason that the blossom algorithm is important is that it gave the first proof that a maximum-size matching could be found using a polynomial amount of computation time. Another reason is that it led to a [[linear programming]] polyhedral description of the matching [[polytope]], yielding an algorithm for min-''weight'' matching.&lt;ref name = "weighted"&gt;

As elaborated by [[Alexander Schrijver]], further significance of the result comes from the fact that this was the first polytope whose proof of integrality "does not simply follow just from [[total unimodularity]], and its description was a breakthrough in [[polyhedral combinatorics]]."&lt;ref name="schrijver"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alexander|last=Schrijver|authorlink=Alexander Schrijver|title=Combinatorial Optimization: Polyhedra and Efficiency|publisher=Springer|series=Algorithms and Combinatorics|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Augmenting paths==

Given ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'') and a matching ''M'' of ''G'', a vertex ''v'' is '''exposed''' if no edge of ''M'' is incident with ''v''. A path in ''G'' is an '''alternating path''', if its edges are alternately not in ''M'' and in ''M'' (or in ''M'' and not in ''M''). An '''augmenting path''' ''P'' is an alternating path that starts and ends at two distinct exposed vertices. Note that the number of unmatched edges in an augmenting path is greater by one than the number of matched edges, and hence the total number of edges in an augmenting path is odd. A '''matching augmentation''' along an augmenting path ''P'' is the operation of replacing ''M'' with a new matching &lt;math&gt;M_1 = M \oplus P = ( M \setminus P ) \cup ( P \setminus M )&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Edmonds augmenting path.svg|500px|alt=Augmentation along a path]]

By [[Berge's lemma]], matching ''M'' is maximum if and only if there is no ''M''-augmenting path in ''G''.&lt;ref name = "matching book"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, either a matching is maximum, or it can be augmented. Thus, starting from an initial matching, we can compute a maximum matching by augmenting the current matching with augmenting paths as long as we can find them, and return whenever no augmenting paths are left. We can formalize the algorithm as follows:

    INPUT:  Graph ''G'', initial matching ''M'' on ''G''
    OUTPUT: maximum matching ''M*'' on ''G''
 A1 '''function''' ''find_maximum_matching''( ''G'', ''M'' ) : ''M*''
 A2     ''P'' ← ''find_augmenting_path''( ''G'', ''M'' )
 A3     '''if''' ''P'' is non-empty '''then'''
 A4          '''return''' ''find_maximum_matching''( ''G'', augment ''M'' along ''P'' )
 A5     '''else'''
 A6          '''return''' M
 A7     '''end if'''
 A8 '''end function'''

We still have to describe how augmenting paths can be found efficiently. The subroutine to find them uses blossoms and contractions.

==Blossoms and contractions==

Given ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'') and a matching ''M'' of ''G'', a ''[[blossom (graph theory)|blossom]]'' ''B'' is a cycle in ''G'' consisting of ''2k + 1'' edges of which exactly ''k'' belong to ''M'', and where one of the vertices ''v'' of the cycle (the ''base'') is such that there exists an alternating path of even length (the ''stem'') from ''v'' to an exposed vertex ''w''.

'''''Finding Blossoms:'''''
* Traverse the graph starting from an exposed vertex.
* Starting from that vertex, label it as an outer vertex "'''''o'''"''.
* Alternate the labeling between vertices being inner "'''''i'''"''  and outer "'''''o'''"'' such that no two adjacent vertices have the same label.
* If we end up with two adjacent vertices labeled as outer "'''''o'''"''  then we have an odd-length cycle and hence a blossom.

Define the '''contracted graph'''  ''G’'' as the graph obtained from ''G'' by [[edge contraction|contracting]] every edge of ''B'', and define the '''contracted matching''' ''M’'' as the matching of ''G’'' corresponding to ''M''.

[[File:Edmonds blossom.svg|500px|alt=Example of a blossom]]

''G’'' has an ''M’''-augmenting path [[if and only if]] ''G'' has an ''M''-augmenting path, and that any ''M’''-augmenting path ''P’'' in ''G’'' can be '''lifted''' to an ''M''-augmenting path in ''G'' by undoing the contraction by ''B'' so that the segment of ''P’'' (if any) traversing through ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is replaced by an appropriate segment traversing through ''B''.&lt;ref name = "tarjan notes"&gt;{{citation

  | contribution = Sketchy Notes on Edmonds' Incredible Shrinking Blossom Algorithm for General Matching

  | url = http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS105-Winter05/Handouts/tarjan-blossom.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more detail:

* if ''P’'' traverses through a segment ''u → v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; → w'' in ''G’'', then this segment is replaced with the segment ''u → ( u’ → ... → w’ ) → w'' in ''G'', where blossom vertices ''u’'' and ''w’'' and the side of ''B'', ''( u’ → ... → w’ )'', going from ''u’'' to ''w’'' are chosen to ensure that the new path is still alternating (''u’'' is exposed with respect to &lt;math&gt;M \cap B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ w', w \} \in E \setminus M&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:Edmonds lifting path.svg|500px|alt=Path lifting when ''P’'' traverses through ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', two cases depending on the direction we need to choose to reach ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'']]

* if ''P’'' has an endpoint ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the path segment ''u → v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''G’'' is replaced with the segment ''u → ( u’ → ... → v’ )'' in ''G'', where blossom vertices ''u’'' and ''v’'' and the side of ''B'', ''( u’ → ... → v’ )'', going from ''u’'' to ''v’'' are chosen to ensure that the path is alternating (''v’'' is exposed, &lt;math&gt;\{ u', u \} \in E \setminus M&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:Edmonds lifting end point.svg|500px|alt=Path lifting when ''P’'' ends at ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', two cases depending on the direction we need to choose to reach ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'']]

Thus blossoms can be contracted and search performed in the contracted graphs. This reduction is at the heart of Edmonds' algorithm.

==Finding an augmenting path==

The search for an augmenting path uses an auxiliary data structure consisting of a [[forest (graph theory)|forest]] ''F'' whose individual trees correspond to specific portions of the graph ''G''. In fact, the forest ''F'' is the same that would be used to find maximum matchings in [[bipartite graph]]s (without need for shrinking blossoms).
In each iteration the algorithm either (1) finds an augmenting path, (2) finds a blossom and recurses onto the corresponding contracted graph, or (3) concludes there are no augmenting paths. The auxiliary structure is built by an incremental procedure discussed next.&lt;ref name = "tarjan notes"/&gt;

The construction procedure considers vertices ''v'' and edges ''e'' in ''G'' and incrementally updates ''F'' as appropriate. If ''v'' is in a tree ''T'' of the forest, we let ''root(v)'' denote the root of ''T''. If both ''u'' and ''v'' are in the same tree ''T'' in ''F'', we let ''distance(u,v)'' denote the length of the unique path from ''u'' to ''v'' in ''T''.

===Examples===
The following four figures illustrate the execution of the algorithm. Dashed lines indicate edges that are currently not present in the forest. First, the algorithm processes an out-of-forest edge that causes the expansion of the current forest (lines B10 &amp;ndash; B12).

[[File:forest expansion.png|400px|alt=Forest expansion on line B10]]

Next, it detects a blossom and contracts the graph (lines B20 &amp;ndash; B21).

[[File:blossom contraction.png|400px|alt=Blossom contraction on line B21]]

Finally, it locates an augmenting path P′ in the contracted graph (line B22) and lifts it to the original graph (line B23). Note that the ability of the algorithm to contract blossoms is crucial here; the algorithm cannot find ''P'' in the original graph directly because only out-of-forest edges between vertices at even distances from the roots are considered on line B17 of the algorithm.

===Analysis===

The forest ''F'' constructed by the ''find_augmenting_path()'' function is an alternating forest.&lt;ref name = "kenyon report"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a tree ''T'' in ''G'' is an '''alternating tree''' with respect to ''M'', if
** ''T'' contains exactly one exposed vertex ''r'' called the tree root
** every vertex at an odd distance from the root has exactly two incident edges in ''T'', and

* a forest ''F'' in ''G'' is an '''alternating forest''' with respect to ''M'', if
** its connected components are alternating trees, and
** every exposed vertex in ''G'' is a root of an alternating tree in ''F''.

Each iteration of the loop starting at line B09 either adds to a tree ''T'' in ''F'' (line B10) or finds an augmenting path (line B17) or finds a blossom (line B20). It is easy to see that the running time is &lt;math&gt;O( |E||V|^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Micali and Vazirani&lt;ref name = "micali"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; show an algorithm that constructs maximum matching in &lt;math&gt;O( |E| |V|^{1 / 2} )&lt;/math&gt; time.

===Bipartite matching===

The algorithm reduces to the standard algorithm for matching in bipartite graphs&lt;ref name = "karp notes"/&gt; when ''G'' is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]]. As there are no odd cycles in ''G'' in that case, blossoms will never be found and one can simply remove lines B20 &amp;ndash; B24 of the algorithm.

===Weighted matching===

The matching problem can be generalized by assigning weights to edges in ''G'' and asking for a set ''M'' that produces a matching of maximum (minimum) total weight. The weighted matching problem can be solved by a combinatorial algorithm that uses the unweighted Edmonds's algorithm as a subroutine.&lt;ref name = "matching book"/&gt; Kolmogorov provides an efficient C++ implementation of this.&lt;ref name = blossom5&gt;{{citation

In [[mathematics]], a '''''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-semigroup''', also known as a '''strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup''', is a generalization of the [[exponential function]]. Just as exponential functions provide solutions of scalar linear constant coefficient [[ordinary differential equation]]s, strongly continuous [[semigroup]]s provide solutions of linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equations in [[Banach space]]s. Such differential equations in Banach spaces arise from e.g. [[delay differential equation]]s and [[partial differential equation]]s.

Formally, a strongly continuous semigroup is a representation of the semigroup ('''R'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;,+) on some [[Banach space]] ''X'' that is continuous in the [[strong operator topology]]. Thus, strictly speaking, a strongly continuous semigroup is not a semigroup, but rather a continuous representation of a very particular semigroup.

== Formal definition ==
A '''strongly continuous semigroup''' on a [[Banach space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a map
&lt;math&gt; T : \mathbb{R}_+ \to   L(X) &lt;/math&gt;
such that
# &lt;math&gt; T(0) = I &lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; ([[identity operator]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;)
# &lt;math&gt;\forall t,s \ge 0 : \ T(t + s) = T(t) T(s)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x_0 \in X: \ \|T(t) x_0 - x_0\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;t\downarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The first two axioms are algebraic, and state that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a representation of the semigroup &lt;math&gt;{(\mathbb{R}_+,+)}&lt;/math&gt;; the last is topological, and states that the map &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]] in the [[strong operator topology]].

== Infinitesimal generator ==
The '''infinitesimal generator''' ''A'' of a strongly continuous semigroup ''T'' is defined by

: &lt;math&gt; A\,x = \lim_{t\downarrow0} \frac1t\,(T(t)- I)\,x &lt;/math&gt;

whenever the limit exists. The domain of ''A'', ''D''(''A''), is the set of ''x∈X'' for which this limit does exist; ''D''(''A'') is a linear subspace and ''A'' is linear on this domain.&lt;ref&gt;Partington (2004) page 23&lt;/ref&gt;  The operator ''A'' is [[Closed operator|closed]], although not necessarily [[Bounded operator|bounded]], and the domain is dense in ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Partington (2004) page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongly continuous semigroup ''T'' with generator ''A''  is often denoted by the symbol ''e&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;''. This notation is compatible with the notation for [[matrix exponential]]s, and for functions of an operator defined via [[functional calculus]] (for example, via the [[spectral theorem]]).

== Uniformly continuous semigroup ==
A uniformly continuous semigroup is a strongly continuous semigroup ''T'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t \to 0^+} \| T(t) - I \| = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

holds. In this case, the infinitesimal generator ''A'' of ''T'' is bounded and we have

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D}(A)=X &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; T(t) = e^{At}:=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{A^k}{k!}t^k. &lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, any bounded operator

:&lt;math&gt;A \colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;

is the infinitesimal generator of a uniformly continuous semigroup given by

:&lt;math&gt; T(t) := e^{At}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, a linear operator ''A'' is the infinitesimal generator of a uniformly continuous semigroup if and only if ''A'' is a bounded linear operator.&lt;ref&gt;Pazy, A. "Semigroups of Linear Operators and Applications to Partial Differential Equations",p. 2. Springer,-Verlag, New York, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is a finite-dimensional Banach space, then any strongly continuous semigroup is a uniformly continuous semigroup. For a strongly continuous semigroup which is not a uniformly continuous semigroup the infinitesimal generator ''A'' is not bounded. In this case, &lt;math&gt;e^{At}&lt;/math&gt; does not need to converge.

==Abstract Cauchy problems==
Consider the abstract [[Cauchy problem]]:
:&lt;math&gt;u'(t)=Au(t),~~~u(0)=x,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a [[closed operator]] on a [[Banach space]] ''X'' and ''x∈X''. There are two concepts of solution of this problem:
* a continuously differentiable function ''u:[0,&amp;infin;)→X'' is called a '''classical solution''' of the Cauchy problem if ''u''(''t'') ∈ ''D''(''A'') for all ''t'' &gt; 0 and it satisfies the initial value problem,
* a continuous function ''u'':[0,∞) → ''X'' is called a '''mild solution''' of the Cauchy problem if

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^t u(s)\,ds\in D(A)\text{ and }A \int_0^t u(s)\,ds=u(t)-x.&lt;/math&gt;

Any classical solution is a mild solution. A mild solution is a classical solution if and only if it is continuously differentiable.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt et al. Proposition 3.1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The following theorem connects abstract Cauchy problems and strongly continuous semigroups.

'''Theorem&lt;ref&gt;Arendt et al. Theorem 3.1.12&lt;/ref&gt;''' Let ''A'' be a closed operator on a Banach space ''X''. The following assertions are equivalent:
# for all ''x∈X'' there exists a unique mild solution of the abstract Cauchy problem,
# the operator ''A'' generates a strongly continuous semigroup,
# the [[resolvent set]] of ''A'' is nonempty and for all ''x'' ∈ ''D''(''A'') there exists a unique classical solution of the Cauchy problem.
When these assertions hold, the solution of the Cauchy problem is given by ''u''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''(''t'')''x'' with ''T'' the strongly continuous semigroup generated by ''A''.

== Generation theorems ==
In connection with Cauchy problems, usually a [[linear operator]] ''A'' is given and the question is whether this is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup. Theorems which answer this question are called '''generation theorems'''. A complete characterization of operators that generate strongly continuous semigroups is given by the [[Hille-Yosida theorem]]. Of more practical importance are however the much easier to verify conditions given by the [[Lumer-Phillips theorem]].

== Special classes of semigroups ==

===Uniformly continuous semigroups===
The strongly continuous semigroup ''T'' is called '''uniformly continuous''' if the map ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''T''(''t'') is continuous from [0,&amp;nbsp;∞) to ''L''(''X'').

The generator of a uniformly continuous semigroup is a [[bounded operator]].

===Analytic semigroups===
{{Main|analytic semigroup}}

===Contraction semigroups===
{{Main|contraction semigroup}}

===Differentiable semigroups===
A strongly continuous semigroup ''T'' is called '''eventually differentiable''' if there exists a {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}} such that {{math|''T''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)''X''⊂''D''(''A'')}} (equivalently: {{math|''T''(''t'')''X'' ⊂ ''D''(''A'')}} for all {{math|''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and ''T'' is '''immediately differentiable''' if {{math|''T''(''t'')''X''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''D''(''A'')}} for all {{math|''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}}.

Every analytic semigroup is immediately differentiable.

An equivalent characterization in terms of Cauchy problems is the following: the strongly continuous semigroup generated by ''A'' is eventually differentiable if and only if there exists a {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0}} such that for all {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''}} the solution ''u'' of the abstract Cauchy problem is differentiable on {{math|(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;∞)}}. The semigroup is immediately differentiable if ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be chosen to be zero.

===Compact semigroups===
A strongly continuous semigroup ''T'' is called '''eventually compact''' if there exists a ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that ''T''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[compact operator]] (equivalently&lt;ref&gt;Engel and Nagel Lemma II.4.22&lt;/ref&gt; if ''T''(''t'') is a compact operator for all ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) . The semigroup is called '''immediately compact''' if ''T''(''t'') is a compact operator for all ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

===Norm continuous semigroups===
A strongly continuous semigroup is called '''eventually norm continuous''' if there exists a ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that the map ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''T''(''t'') is continuous from (''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;∞) to ''L''(''X''). The semigroup is called '''immediately norm continuous''' if ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be chosen to be zero.

Note that for an immediately norm continuous semigroup the map ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''T''(''t'') may not be continuous in ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (that would make the semigroup uniformly continuous).

Analytic semigroups, (eventually) differentiable semigroups and (eventually) compact semigroups are all eventually norm continuous.&lt;ref&gt;Engel and Nagel (diagram II.4.26)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stability ==

===Exponential stability===

The '''growth bound''' of a semigroup ''T'' is the constant

: &lt;math&gt; \omega_0 = \inf_{t&gt;0} \frac1t \log \| T(t) \|. &lt;/math&gt;

It is so called as this number is also the infimum of all real numbers ''ω'' such that there exists a constant ''M''  (≥&amp;nbsp;1) with

: &lt;math&gt;\|T(t)\| \leq Me^{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''t'' ≥ 0.

The following are equivalent:&lt;ref&gt;Engel and Nagel Section V.1.b&lt;/ref&gt;
#There exist M,ω&gt;0 such that for all ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0:  &lt;math&gt;\|T(t)\|\leq M{\rm e}^{-\omega t},&lt;/math&gt;
#The growth bound is negative: ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0,
#The semigroup converges to zero in the [[uniform operator topology]]: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty}\|T(t)\|=0&lt;/math&gt;,
#There exists a ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that &lt;math&gt;\|T(t_0)\|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;,
#There exists a ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that the [[spectral radius]] of ''T''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is strictly smaller than 1,
#There exists a ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[1,&amp;nbsp;∞) such that for all ''x∈X'': &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\|T(t)x\|^p\,dt&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;,
#For all ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[1,&amp;nbsp;∞) and all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'': &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\|T(t)x\|^p\,dt&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

A semigroup that satisfies these equivalent conditions is called '''exponentially stable''' or '''uniformly stable''' (either of the first three of the above statements is taken as the definition in certain parts of the literature). That the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' conditions are equivalent to exponential stability is called the '''Datko-Pazy theorem'''.

In case ''X'' is a [[Hilbert space]] there is another condition that is equivalent to exponential stability in terms of the [[resolvent operator]] of the generator:&lt;ref&gt;Engel and Nagel Theorem V.1.11&lt;/ref&gt; all ''λ'' with positive real part belong to the resolvent set of ''A'' and the resolvent operator is uniformly bounded on the right half plane, i.e. (''λI''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''A'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; belongs to the [[Hardy space]] &lt;math&gt;H^\infty(\mathbb{C}_+;L(X))&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the '''Gearhart-Pruss theorem'''.

The '''spectral bound''' of an operator ''A'' is the constant
:&lt;math&gt;s(A):=\sup\{{\rm Re}\lambda:\lambda\in\sigma(A)\}&lt;/math&gt;,
with the convention that ''s''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;∞ if the [[spectrum]] of ''A'' is empty.

The growth bound of a semigroup and the spectral bound of its generator are related by:&lt;ref&gt;Engel and Nagel Proposition IV2.2&lt;/ref&gt; ''s(A)≤ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(T)''. There are examples&lt;ref&gt;Engel and Nagel Section IV.2.7, Luo et al. Example 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; where ''s''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''). If ''s''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''), then ''T'' is said to satisfy the '''spectral determined growth condition'''. Eventually norm-continuous semigroups satisfy the spectral determined growth condition.&lt;ref&gt;Engel and Nagel Corollary 4.3.11&lt;/ref&gt; This gives another equivalent characterization of exponential stability for these semigroups:
*An eventually norm-continuous semigroup is exponentially stable if and only if ''s''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.
Note that eventually compact, eventually differentiable, analytic and uniformly continuous semigroups are eventually norm-continuous so that the spectral determined growth condition holds in particular for those semigroups.

=== Strong stability ===
A strongly continuous semigroup ''T'' is called '''strongly stable''' or '''asymptotically stable''' if for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'': &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty}\|T(t)x\|=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Exponential stability implies strong stability, but the converse is not generally true if ''X'' is infinite-dimensional (it is true for ''X'' finite-dimensional).

The following sufficient condition for strong stability is called the '''Arendt-Batty-Lyubich-Phong theorem''':&lt;ref&gt;Arendt and Batty, Lyubich and Phong&lt;/ref&gt; Assume that
# ''T'' is bounded: there exists a ''M''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 such that &lt;math&gt;\|T(t)\|\leq M&lt;/math&gt;,
# ''A'' has not [[residual spectrum]] on the imaginary axis, and
# The spectrum of ''A'' located on the imaginary axis is countable.
Then ''T'' is strongly stable.

If ''X'' is reflexive then the conditions simplify: if ''T'' is bounded, ''A'' has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis and the spectrum of ''A'' located on the imaginary axis is countable, then ''T'' is strongly stable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3495">In [[mathematics]], the method of '''clearing denominators''', also called '''clearing fractions''', is a technique for simplifying an [[equation]] equating two expressions that each are a sum of [[Rational function|rational expression]]s – which includes simple [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s.

== Example ==

Consider the equation

: &lt;math&gt; \frac x 6 + \frac y {15z} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[least common multiple|smallest common multiple]] of the two denominators 6 and 15''z'' is 30''z'', so one multiplies both sides by 30''z'':

: &lt;math&gt; 5xz + 2y = 30z. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The result is an equation with no fractions.

The simplified equation is not entirely equivalent to the original. For when we substitute {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0}} in the last equation, both sides simplify to 0, so we get {{nowrap|1=0 = 0}}, a mathematical truth. But the same substitution applied to the original equation results in {{nowrap|1=''x''/6 + 0/0 = 1}}, which is [[division by zero|mathematically meaningless]].

== Description ==
[[Without loss of generality]], we may assume that the [[right-hand side]] of the equation is 0, since an equation {{nowrap|1={{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} may equivalently be rewritten in the form {{nowrap|1={{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − {{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}.

So let the equation have the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{P_i}{Q_i} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to determine a common denominator {{mvar|D}} of these fractions – preferably the [[least common denominator]], which is the least common multiple of the {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

This means that each {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a factor of {{mvar|D}}, so {{nowrap|1={{mvar|D}} = {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} for some expression {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} that is not a fraction. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_i}{Q_i} = \frac{R_i P_i}{R_i Q_i} = \frac{R_i P_i} D \,,&lt;/math&gt;

provided that {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not assume the value 0 – in which case also {{mvar|D}} equals 0.

So we have now

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{P_i}{Q_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i P_i} D = \frac 1 D \sum_{i=1}^n R_i P_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Provided that {{mvar|D}} does not assume the value 0, the latter equation is equivalent with

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n R_i P_i = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the denominators have vanished.

As shown by the provisos, care has to be taken not to introduce [[Zero of a function|zero]]s of {{mvar|D}} – viewed as a function of the [[unknown (mathematics)|unknown]]s of the equation – as [[spurious solution]]s.

==Example 2==

Consider the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x(x+1)}+\frac{1}{x(x+2)}-\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The least common denominator is {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}({{mvar|x}} + 1)({{mvar|x}} + 2)}}.

Following the method as described above results in

:&lt;math&gt;(x+2)+(x+1)-x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying this further gives us the solution {{nowrap|1={{mvar|x}} = −3}}.

It is easily checked that none of the zeros of {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}({{mvar|x}} + 1)({{mvar|x}} + 2)}} – namely {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = 0}}, {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = −1}}, and {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = −2}} – is a solution of the final equation, so no spurious solutions were introduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1839">In [[mathematical logic]], '''cointerpretability''' is a [[binary relation]] on [[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theories]]: a formal theory ''T'' is '''cointerpretable''' in another such theory ''S'', when the language of ''S'' can be translated into the language of ''T'' in such a way that ''S'' proves every formula whose translation is a [[theorem]] of ''T''. The "translation" here is required to preserve the logical structure of formulas. 

This concept, in a sense dual to [[interpretability]], was introduced by {{harvtxt|Japaridze|1993}}, who also proved that, for theories of [[Peano arithmetic]] and any stronger theories with effective [[axiomatization]]s, cointerpretability is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;-conservativity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1616">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''connected category''' is a [[category (category theory)|category]] in which, for every two objects ''X'' and ''Y'' there is a [[finite sequence]] of objects
:&lt;math&gt;X = X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{n-1}, X_n = Y&lt;/math&gt;
with morphisms

A stronger notion of connectivity would be to require at least one morphism ''f'' between any pair of objects ''X'' and ''Y''. Any category with this property is connected in the above sense.

A [[small category]] is connected [[if and only if]] its underlying graph is [[connected graph|weakly connected]], meaning that it is connected if one disregard the direction of the arrows.

Each category ''J'' can be written as a disjoint union (or [[coproduct]]) of a collection of connected categories, which are called the '''connected components''' of ''J''. Each connected component is a [[full subcategory]] of ''J''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">In [[coding theory]], a '''covering code''' is a set of elements (called ''codewords'') in a space, with the property that every element of the space is within a fixed distance of some codeword. 

== Definition  ==

Let &lt;math&gt;q\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; be [[integers]].
A [[code]] &lt;math&gt;C\subseteq Q^n&lt;/math&gt; over an [[alphabet]] ''Q'' of size |''Q''| = ''q'' is called
''q''-ary ''R''-covering code of length ''n''
if for every word &lt;math&gt;y\in Q^n&lt;/math&gt; there is a [[codeword]] &lt;math&gt;x\in C&lt;/math&gt;
such that the [[Hamming distance]] &lt;math&gt;d_H(x,y)\leq R&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, the [[spheres]] (or [[ball (mathematics)|balls]] or rook-domains) of [[radius]] ''R''
with respect to the Hamming [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] around the codewords of ''C'' have to exhaust
the [[Wikt:finite|finite]] [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;Q^n&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[covering radius]] of a code ''C'' is the smallest ''R'' such that ''C'' is ''R''-covering.
Every [[perfect code]] is a covering code of minimal size.

== Example ==

''C'' = {0134,0223,1402,1431,1444,2123,2234,3002,3310,4010,4341} is a 5-ary 2-covering code of length 4.&lt;ref&gt;P.R.J. Östergård, Upper bounds for ''q''-ary covering codes, ''[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]]'', 37 (1991), 660-664&lt;/ref&gt;

== Covering problem ==

The [[determination]] of the minimal size &lt;math&gt;K_q(n,R)&lt;/math&gt; of a ''q''-ary ''R''-covering code of length ''n'' is a very hard problem. In many cases, only [[upper and lower bounds]] are known with a large gap between them.
Every construction of a covering code gives an upper bound on ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''R'').
Lower bounds include the sphere covering bound and 
Rodemich’s bounds &lt;math&gt;K_q(n,1)\geq q^{n-1}/(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_q(n,n-2)\geq q^2/(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;E.R. Rodemich, Covering by rook-domains, ''[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]]'', 9 (1970), 117-128&lt;/ref&gt;
The covering problem is closely related to the packing problem in &lt;math&gt;Q^n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the determination of the maximal size of a ''q''-ary ''e''-[[Error detection and correction|error correcting]] code of length ''n''.

== Football pools problem ==
A particular case is the '''football pools problem''', based on [[football pool]] betting, where the aim is to predict the results of ''n'' football matches as a home win, draw or away win, or to at least predict  {{nowrap|''n'' - 1}} of them with multiple bets.  Thus a ternary covering, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'',1), is sought.  

If &lt;math&gt;n=\tfrac12 (3^k-1)&lt;/math&gt; then 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''-''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are needed, so for ''n'' = 4, ''k'' = 2, 9 are needed; for ''n'' = 13, ''k'' = 3, 59049 are needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://alexandria.tue.nl/repository/freearticles/593454.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The best bounds known as of 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sztaki.hu/~keri/codes/3_tables.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; are

In this array, the numbers in the first row are all one, the numbers in the second row are the [[odd number]]s, the numbers in the third row are the [[centered square number]]s, and the numbers in the fourth row are the [[centered octahedral number]]s. Alternatively, the same numbers can be arranged in a [[triangular array]] resembling [[Pascal's triangle]], also called the '''tribonacci triangle''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A008288|name=Square array of Delannoy numbers D(i,j) (i &gt;= 0, j &gt;= 0) read by antidiagonals}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which each number is the sum of the three numbers above it:

==Central Delannoy numbers==
The '''central Delannoy numbers''' ''D''(''n'') = ''D''(''n'',''n'') are the numbers for a square ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' grid.  The first few central Delannoy numbers (starting with ''n''=0) are:

==Computation==

===Delannoy numbers===
For &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; diagonal (i.e. northeast) steps, there must be &lt;math&gt; m-k &lt;/math&gt; steps in the &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; direction and &lt;math&gt; n-k &lt;/math&gt; steps in the &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; direction in order to reach the point &lt;math&gt; (m, n) &lt;/math&gt;; as these steps can be performed in any order, the number of such paths is given by the [[multinomial coefficient]]
&lt;math&gt; \binom{m+n-k}{k , m-k , n-k} = \binom{m+n-k}{m} \binom{m}{k} &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, one gets the closed-form expression

:&lt;math&gt; D(m,n) = \sum_{k=0}^{\min(m,n)} \binom{m+n-k}{m} \binom{m}{k} . &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative expression is given by

:&lt;math&gt; D(m,n) = \sum_{k=0}^{\min(m,n)} \binom{m}{k} \binom{n}{k} 2^k . &lt;/math&gt;

And also

:&lt;math&gt; D(m,n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(m,k), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; A(m,k) &lt;/math&gt; is given with {{OEIS|id=A266213}}.

The basic [[recurrence relation]] for the Delannoy numbers is easily seen to be
:&lt;math&gt;D(m,n)=\begin{cases}1 &amp;\text{if }m=0\text{ or }n=0\\D(m-1,n) + D(m-1,n-1) + D(m,n-1)&amp;\text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This recurrence relation also leads directly to the [[generating function]]

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{m,n = 0}^\infty D(m, n) x^m y^n = (1 - x - y - xy)^{-1} . &lt;/math&gt;

===Central Delannoy numbers===
Substituting &lt;math&gt; m = n &lt;/math&gt; in the first closed form expression above, replacing &lt;math&gt; k \leftrightarrow n-k &lt;/math&gt;, and a little algebra, gives

:&lt;math&gt; D(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+k}{k} , &lt;/math&gt;

while the second expression above yields

:&lt;math&gt; D(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 2^k . &lt;/math&gt;

The central Delannoy numbers satisfy also a three-term recurrence relationship among themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peart |first1=Paul |last2=Woan |first2=Wen-Jin |title=A bijective proof of the Delannoy recurrence |year=2002 |journal=Congressus Numerantium |volume=158 |pages=29–33 |issn=0384-9864 |zbl=1030.05003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n D(n) = 3(2n-1)D(n-1) - (n-1)D(n-2) , &lt;/math&gt;

and have a generating function

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n = 0}^\infty D(n) x^n = (1-6x+x^2)^{-1/2} . &lt;/math&gt;

The leading asymptotic behavior of the central Delannoy numbers is given by

:&lt;math&gt; D(n) = \frac{c \, \alpha^n}{\sqrt{n}} \, (1 + O(n^{-1})) &lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt; \alpha = 3 + 2 \sqrt{2} \approx 5.828 &lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt; c = (4 \pi (3 \sqrt{2} - 4))^{-1/2} \approx 0.5727 &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8936">In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[partial differential equations]], '''Duhamel's principle''' is a general method for obtaining solutions to [[homogeneous differential equation|inhomogeneous]] linear evolution equations like the [[heat equation]], [[wave equation]], and [[vibrating plate]] equation. It is named after [[Jean-Marie Duhamel]] who first applied the principle to the inhomogeneous heat equation that models, for instance, the distribution of heat in a thin plate which is heated from beneath. For linear evolution equations without spatial dependency, such as a [[harmonic oscillator]], Duhamel's principle reduces to the method of [[variation of parameters]] technique for solving linear inhomogeneous [[ordinary differential equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz John, "Partial Differential Equations', New York, Springer-Verlag, 1982, 4th ed., 0387906096&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy underlying Duhamel's principle is that it is possible to go from solutions of the [[Cauchy problem]] (or initial value problem) to solutions of the inhomogeneous problem. Consider, for instance, the example of the heat equation modeling the distribution of heat energy ''u'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The initial value problem is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) - \Delta u(x,t) = 0 &amp;(x,t)\in \mathbf{R}^n\times (0,\infty)\\
u(x,0) = g(x) &amp; x\in \mathbf{R}^n
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is the initial heat distribution. By contrast, the inhomogeneous problem for the heat equation is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) -\Delta u(x,t) = f(x,t) &amp;(x,t)\in \mathbf{R}^n\times (0,\infty)\\
u(x,0) = 0 &amp; x\in \mathbf{R}^n
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
corresponds to adding an external heat energy ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'',''t'')''dt'' at each point. Intuitively, one can think of the inhomogeneous problem as a set of homogeneous problems each starting afresh at a different time slice ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. By linearity, one can add up (integrate) the resulting solutions through time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and obtain the solution for the inhomogeneous problem. This is the essence of Duhamel's principle.

==General considerations==
Formally, consider a linear inhomogeneous evolution equation for a function 
:&lt;math&gt;u:D\times(0,\infty)\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
with spatial domain ''D'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) -Lu(x,t) = f(x,t) &amp;(x,t)\in D\times (0,\infty)\\
u|_{\partial D} = 0 &amp;\\
u(x,0) = 0 &amp; x\in D,
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is a linear differential operator that involves no time derivatives.

Duhamel's principle is, formally, that the solution to this problem is
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t) = \int_0^t (P^sf)(x,t)\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;'' is the solution of the problem
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t - Lu = 0 &amp; (x,t)\in D\times (s,\infty)\\
u|_{\partial D} = 0 &amp;\\
u(x,s) = f(x,s) &amp; x\in D.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
The integrand is the retarded solution &lt;math&gt;P^sf&lt;/math&gt;, evaluated at time ''t'', representing the effect, at the later time ''t'', of an infinitesimal force &lt;math&gt;f(x,s)\,ds&lt;/math&gt; applied at time ''s''.

Duhamel's principle also holds for linear systems (with vector-valued functions ''u''), and this in turn furnishes a generalization to higher ''t'' derivatives, such as those appearing in the wave equation (see below). Validity of the principle depends on being able to solve the homogeneous problem in an appropriate function space and that the solution should exhibit reasonable dependence on parameters so that the integral is well-defined. Precise analytic conditions on ''u'' and ''f'' depend on the particular application.

==Examples==

===Wave equation===
The linear wave equation models the displacement ''u'' of an idealized dispersionless one-dimensional string, in terms of derivatives with respect to time ''t'' and space ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}-c^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=f(x,t).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f''(''x'',''t''), in natural units, represents an external force applied to string at the position (''x'',''t'').  In order to be a suitable physical model for nature, it should be possible to solve it for any initial state that the string is in, specified by its initial displacement and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=u_0(x),\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,0)=v_0(x).&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, we should be able to solve the equation with data specified on any ''t'' = ''constant'' slice:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,T)=u_T(x),\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,T)=v_T(x).&lt;/math&gt;

To evolve a solution from any given time slice ''T'' to ''T''+''dT'', the contribution of the force must be added to the solution.  That contribution comes from changing the velocity of the string by ''f''(''x'',''T'')''dT''.  That is, to get the solution at time ''T''+''dT'' from the solution at time ''T'', we must add to it a new (forward) solution of the ''homogeneous'' (no external forces) wave equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2}-c^2\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with the initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt;U(x,T)=0,\qquad \frac{\partial U}{\partial t}(x,T)=f(x,T)dT.&lt;/math&gt;

A solution to this equation is achieved by straightforward integration:

:&lt;math&gt; U(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\xi,T)\,d\xi\right)\,dT&lt;/math&gt;

(The expression in parenthesis is just &lt;math&gt;P^Tf(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; in the notation of the general method above.) So a solution of the original initial value problem is obtained by starting with a solution to the problem with the same prescribed initial values problem but with ''zero'' external force, and adding to that (integrating) the contributions from the added force in the time intervals from ''T'' to ''T''+''dT'':

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[u_0(x+ct)+ u_0(x-ct)\right]+ \frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} v_0(y) dy + \frac{1}{2c}\int_0^t\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\xi,T)\,d\xi\,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant-coefficient linear ODE===
Duhamel's principle is the result that the solution to an inhomogeneous, linear, partial differential equation can be solved by first finding the solution for a step input, and then superposing using [[Duhamel's integral]].
Suppose we have a constant coefficient, m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order inhomogeneous [[ordinary differential equation]].

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t)u(t) = F(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_t^j u(0) = 0, \; 0 \leq j \leq m-1 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t) := a_m \partial_t^m + \cdots + a_1 \partial_t + a_0,\; a_m \neq 0. &lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.

First let ''G'' solve

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t)G = 0, \; \partial^j_t G(0) = 0, \quad 0\leq j \leq m-2, \; \partial_t^{m-1} G(0) = 1/a_m. &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt; H = G \chi_{[0,\infty)} &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\chi_{[0,\infty)}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t) H = \delta &lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; u(t) = (H \ast F)(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_0^\infty G(\tau)F(t-\tau)\,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{-\infty}^t G(t-\tau)F(\tau)\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

solves the ODE.

===Constant-coefficient linear PDE===
More generally, suppose we have a constant coefficient inhomogeneous [[partial differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,D_x)u(t,x) = F(t,x) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; D_x = \frac{1}{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}. &lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.

First, taking the [[Fourier transform]] in ''x'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi)\hat u(t,\xi) = \hat F(t,\xi).&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that &lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt; is an m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order ODE in ''t''. Let &lt;math&gt;a_m &lt;/math&gt; be the coefficient of the highest order term of &lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt;.
Now for every &lt;math&gt;\xi &lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;G(t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt; solve

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi)G(t,\xi) = 0, \; \partial^j_t G(0,\xi) = 0 \; \mbox{ for } 0\leq j \leq m-2, \; \partial_t^{m-1} G(0,\xi) = 1/a_m. &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;H(t,\xi) = G(t,\xi) \chi_{[0,\infty)}(t) &lt;/math&gt;. We then have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) H(t,\xi) = \delta(t) &lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; \hat u(t,\xi) = (H(\cdot,\xi) \ast \hat F(\cdot,\xi))(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_0^\infty G(\tau,\xi)F(t-\tau,\xi)\,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{-\infty}^t G(t-\tau,\xi)F(\tau,\xi)\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

solves the PDE (after transforming back to ''x'').

In [[mathematics]], an '''element''', or '''member''', of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is any one of the distinct [[Mathematical object|objects]] that make up that set.

==Sets==
Writing &lt;math&gt;A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}&lt;/math&gt; means that the elements of the set {{mvar|A}} are the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Sets of elements of {{mvar|A}}, for example &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt;, are [[subset]]s of {{mvar|A}}.

Sets can themselves be elements. For example, consider the set &lt;math&gt;B = \{1, 2, \{3, 4\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. The elements of {{mvar|B}} are ''not'' 1, 2, 3, and&amp;nbsp;4.  Rather, there are only three elements of {{mvar|B}}, namely the numbers 1 and 2, and the set &lt;math&gt;\{3, 4\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The elements of a set can be anything. For example, &lt;math&gt;C = \{\mathrm{\color{red}red}, \mathrm{\color{green}green}, \mathrm{\color{blue}blue}\}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set whose elements are the colors {{red|red}}, {{green|green}} and {{blue|blue}}.

==Notation and terminology==
[[File:First usage of the symbol ∈.png|thumb|right|First usage of the symbol ϵ in the work {{lang|la|[[Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita]]|italic=yes}} by [[Giuseppe Peano]].]]
The [[heterogeneous relation |relation]] "is an element of", also called '''set membership''', is denoted by the symbol&amp;nbsp;"&lt;math&gt; \in &lt;/math&gt;". Writing

:&lt;math&gt;x \in A &lt;/math&gt;

means that "''x'' is an element of&amp;nbsp;''A''". Equivalent expressions are "''x'' is a member of&amp;nbsp;''A''", "''x'' belongs to&amp;nbsp;''A''", "''x'' is in&amp;nbsp;''A''" and "''x'' lies in&amp;nbsp;''A''". The expressions "''A'' includes ''x''" and "''A'' contains ''x''" are also used to mean set membership, however some authors use them to mean instead "''x'' is a [[subset]] of&amp;nbsp;''A''".&lt;ref name="schech"&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Eric Schechter]] |title= Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations |publisher= [[Academic Press]] |year= 1997|isbn= 0-12-622760-8 }} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Logician [[George Boolos]] strongly urged that "contains" be used for membership only and "includes" for the subset relation only.&lt;ref name="boolos"&gt;{{cite speech |title=24.243 Classical Set Theory (lecture) |author=[[George Boolos]] |date=February 4, 1992 |location=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the relation ϵ , the [[converse relation]] ϵ&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; may be written

:&lt;math&gt;A \ni x ,&lt;/math&gt; meaning "''A'' contains ''x''".

The [[negation]] of set membership is denoted by the symbol&amp;nbsp;"∉". Writing
:&lt;math&gt;x \notin A&lt;/math&gt; means that "''x'' is not an element of&amp;nbsp;''A''".

The symbol ϵ was first used by Giuseppe Peano 1889 in his work {{lang|la|[[Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita]]|italic=yes}}. Here he wrote on page X:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|la|Signum ϵ significat est. Ita a ϵ b legitur a est quoddam b; ...}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which means

&lt;blockquote&gt;The symbol ϵ means ''is''. So a ϵ b is read as a ''is a'' b; ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The symbol itself is a stylized lowercase Greek letter [[epsilon]] ("ε"), the first letter of the word {{wikt-lang|grc|ἐστί}}, which means "is".

The [[Unicode]] characters for these symbols are U+2208 ('element of'), U+2209 ('not an element of'), U+220B ('contains as member') and U+220C ('does not contain as member'). The equivalent [[LaTeX]] commands are "\in", "\notin", "\ni" and "\not\ni". [[Mathematica]] has commands "\[Element]", "\[NotElement]", "\[ReverseElement]" and "\[NotReverseElement]".

===Complement and converse===
Every relation ''R'' : ''U'' → ''V'' is subject to two [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s: complementation ''R'' → &lt;math&gt;\bar{R}&lt;/math&gt; and conversion ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;:''V'' → ''U''.
The relation ∈ has for its domain a universal set ''U'', and has the [[power set]] '''P'''(''U'') for its codomain or range. The complementary relation &lt;math&gt;\bar{\in} \ = \ \notin&lt;/math&gt; expresses the opposite of ∈. An element ''x'' ∈ ''U'' may have ''x'' ∉ ''A'', in which case ''x'' ∈ ''U'' \ ''A'', the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' in ''U''.

The [[converse relation]] &lt;math&gt;\in^T \ = \ \ni&lt;/math&gt; swaps the domain and range with ∈. For any ''A'' in '''P'''(''U''), &lt;math&gt;A \ni x&lt;/math&gt; is true when ''x'' ∈ ''A''.

==Cardinality of sets==
{{main|Cardinality}}
The number of elements in a particular set is a property known as [[cardinality]]; informally, this is the size of a set. In the above examples the cardinality of the set&amp;nbsp;''A'' is&amp;nbsp;4, while the cardinality of either of the sets ''B'' and ''C'' is&amp;nbsp;3. An infinite set is a set with an infinite number of elements, while a finite set is a set with a finite number of elements. The above examples are examples of finite sets. An example of an infinite set is the set of positive integers =&amp;nbsp;{&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;}.

==Examples==
Using the sets defined above, namely ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, 4 }, ''B'' = {1, 2, {3, 4}} and ''C'' = { red, green, blue }:
*2 ∈ ''A''
*{3,4} ∈ ''B''
*3,4 ∉ ''B''
*{3,4} is a member of ''B''
*Yellow ∉ ''C''
*The cardinality of ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{2,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;12} is finite and equal to&amp;nbsp;5.
*The cardinality of ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;11,&amp;nbsp;13,&amp;nbsp;...} (the [[prime numbers]]) is infinite&amp;nbsp;(proved by [[Euclid]]).

==Academic life==

Lawler came to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] as a graduate student in 1954, after a three-year undergraduate B.S. program in Mathematics at [[Florida State University]]. He received a master's degree in 1957,&lt;ref name="jcb"/&gt; and took a hiatus in his studies, during which he briefly went to law school and worked in the U.S. Army, at a grinding wheel company,&lt;ref name="old"&gt;{{citation|first=E.

Lawler'', [[SIAM Journal on Computing]] '''24'''(1), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Harvard in 1958, and completed his Ph.D. in 1962 under the supervision of Anthony G. Oettinger with a dissertation entitled ''Some Aspects of Discrete Mathematical Programming''.&lt;ref name="jcb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=25276|name=Eugene Leighton Lawler}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then became a faculty member at the [[University of Michigan]] until 1971, when he moved to Berkeley.&lt;ref name="jcb"/&gt; He retired in 1994, shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="karp"/&gt;

At Berkeley, Lawler's doctoral students included Marshall Bern, Chip Martel, Arvind Raghunathan, Arnie Rosenthal, Huzur Saran, [[David Shmoys]], and [[Tandy Warnow]].&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/stl-book/source/TCS-genealogy.txt Theoretical computer science academic genealogy], Ian Parberry, 1996, retrieved 2010-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Lawler was an expert on [[combinatorial optimization]] and a founder of the field,&lt;ref name="mp98"/&gt; the author of the widely used textbook ''Combinatorial Optimization: Networks and Matroids'' and coauthor of ''The Traveling Salesman Problem: a guided tour of combinatorial optimization''. He played a central role in rescuing the [[ellipsoid method]] for linear programming from obscurity in the West.&lt;ref name="jos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Soviet discovery rocks world of mathematics: Russian's surprise problem-solving discovery reported|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=November 7, 1979|first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote (with D. E. Wood) a heavily cited 1966 survey on [[branch and bound]] algorithms,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 9
 | year = 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NP-complete]]ness proofs for two of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]], [[directed graph|directed]] [[Hamiltonian cycle]] and [[3-dimensional matching]], were credited by Karp to Lawler.&lt;ref name="jos"/&gt; The NP-completeness of 3-dimensional matching is an example of one of Lawler's favorite observations, the "mystical power of twoness":&lt;ref name="jos"/&gt; for many combinatorial optimization problems that can be parametrized by an integer, the problem can be solved in [[polynomial time]] when the parameter is two but becomes NP-complete when the parameter is three. For 3-dimensional matching, the solvable parameter-2 version of the problem is [[matching (graph theory)|graph matching]]; the same phenomenon arises in the complexities of [[bipartite graph|2-coloring]] and [[graph coloring|3-coloring]] for graphs, in the matroid intersection problem for intersections of two or three matroids, and in [[2-SAT]] and [[3-SAT]] for [[satisfiability problem]]s. [[Jan Karel Lenstra|Lenstra]]&lt;ref name="jos"/&gt; writes that "Gene would invariably comment that this is why a world with two sexes has been devised."

During the 1970s, Lawler made great headway in systematizing algorithms for [[job shop scheduling]].&lt;ref name="jos"/&gt; His 1979 survey on the subject introduced the three-field [[notation for theoretic scheduling problems]], which (despite the existence of earlier notations) became standard in the study of scheduling algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the late 1980s, Lawler shifted his research focus to problems of [[computational biology]], including the reconstruction of [[evolutionary tree]]s and several works on [[sequence alignment]].&lt;ref name="jcb"/&gt;

==Social activism==
In Spring 1969, while on sabbatical in Berkeley, Lawler took part in a [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|protest against the Vietnam War]] that led to the arrests of 483 protesters, including Lawler;&lt;ref name="old"/&gt; [[Richard Karp]] bailed him out.&lt;ref name="karp"/&gt;
Karp recalls Lawler as "the social conscience of the CS Division, always looking out for the welfare of students and especially concerned for women, minorities and handicapped students".&lt;ref name="karp"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/BEARS/CS_Anniversary/karp-talk.html|title=A Personal View of Computer Science at Berkeley|first=Richard|last=Karp|authorlink=Richard Karp|year=2003|publisher=EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
A special issue of the journal ''[[Mathematical Programming]]'' (vol. 82, issues 1–2) was dedicated in Lawler's honor in 1998.&lt;ref name="mp98"&gt;{{citation|title=Preface|first1=Jan Karel|last1=Lenstra|author1-link=Jan Karel Lenstra|first2=David|last2=Schmoys|journal=[[Mathematical Programming]]|volume=82|issue=1–2|year=1998|page=1|doi=10.1007/BF01585862}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ACM Eugene L. Lawler Award]] is given by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] every two years for "humanitarian contributions within computer science and informatics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://awards.acm.org/lawler/ Eugene L. Lawler Award], ACM, retrieved 2010-09-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3701">In [[algebra]], the '''factor theorem''' is a theorem linking factors and [[Zero of a function|zeros]] of a [[polynomial]]. It is a [[special case]] of the [[polynomial remainder theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Michael|last=Sullivan|title=Algebra and Trigonometry|page=381|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1996|isbn=0-13-370149-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The factor theorem states that a polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a factor &lt;math&gt;(x - k)&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;f(k)=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a root).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=V K|last1=Sehgal|first2=Sonal|last2=Gupta|title=Longman ICSE Mathematics Class 10|page=119|publisher=Dorling Kindersley (India)|isbn=978-81-317-2816-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Factorization of polynomials==
{{Main|Factorization of polynomials}}
Two problems where the factor theorem is commonly applied are those of factoring a polynomial and finding the roots of a polynomial equation; it is a direct consequence of the theorem that these problems are essentially equivalent.

The factor theorem is also used to remove known zeros from a polynomial while leaving all unknown zeros intact, thus producing a lower degree polynomial whose zeros may be easier to find. Abstractly, the method is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=R. K.|last=Bansal|title=Comprehensive Mathematics IX|page=142|publisher=Laxmi Publications|isbn=81-7008-629-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Guess" a zero &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. (In general, this can be ''very hard'', but maths textbook problems that involve solving a polynomial equation are often designed so that some roots are easy to discover.)
# Use the factor theorem to conclude that &lt;math&gt;(x-a)&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute the polynomial &lt;math&gt; g(x) = f(x) \big/ (x-a) &lt;/math&gt;, for example using [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].
# Conclude that any root &lt;math&gt;x \neq a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; is a root of &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the [[polynomial degree]] of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is one less than that of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, it is "simpler" to find the remaining zeros by studying &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Find the factors of
: &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2.&lt;/math&gt;

To do this one would use trial and error (or the [[rational root theorem]]) to find the first x value that causes the expression to equal zero.  To find out if &lt;math&gt;(x - 1)&lt;/math&gt; is a factor, substitute &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt; into the polynomial above:
: &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2 = (1)^3 + 7(1)^2 + 8(1) + 2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= 1 + 7 + 8 + 2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= 18.&lt;/math&gt;

As this is equal to 18 and not 0 this means &lt;math&gt;(x - 1)&lt;/math&gt; is not a factor of &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;. So, we next try &lt;math&gt;(x + 1)&lt;/math&gt; (substituting &lt;math&gt;x = -1&lt;/math&gt; into the polynomial):
: &lt;math&gt;(-1)^3 + 7(-1)^2 + 8(-1) + 2.&lt;/math&gt;

This is equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;x-(-1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is to say &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;, is a factor, and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Root of a function|root]] of &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The next two roots can be found by algebraically dividing &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(x+1)&lt;/math&gt; to get a quadratic:

: &lt;math&gt;{x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2 \over x + 1} = x^2 + 6x + 2,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore &lt;math&gt;(x+1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 6x + 2&lt;/math&gt; are factors of &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2.&lt;/math&gt; Of these the quadratic factor can be further factored using the [[quadratic formula]], which gives as roots of the quadratic &lt;math&gt;-3\pm \sqrt{7}.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the three [[polynomial factorization|irreducible factors]] of the original polynomial are &lt;math&gt;x+1, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x-(-3+\sqrt{7}),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x-(-3-\sqrt{7}).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3549">The '''Fannes&amp;ndash;Audenaert inequality''' is a mathematical bound on the difference between the [[von Neumann entropy|von Neumann entropies]] of two [[density matrix|density matrices]] as a function of their [[trace distance]].  It was proved by Koenraad M. R. Audenaert in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Koenraad M. R. Audenaert, [http://iopscience.iop.org/1751-8121/40/28/S18/ "A sharp continuity estimate for the von Neumann entropy"], J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. '''40''' 8127 (2007).  Preprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610146 arXiv:quant-ph/0610146].&lt;/ref&gt; as an optimal refinement of Mark Fannes' original inequality, which was published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;M. Fannes, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7254x6466633837/ "A continuity property of the entropy density for spin lattice systems "], Communications in Mathematical Physics '''31''' 291&amp;ndash;294 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Fannes is a Belgian physicist specialised in mathematical quantum mechanics. He works at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|KU Leuven]]. Koenraad M. R. Audenaert is a Belgian physicist and civil engineer. He currently works at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]].

== Statement of inequality ==

For any two density matrices &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of dimensions &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;|S(\rho)-S(\sigma)| \le T \log (d-1) + H[\{T,1-T\}] &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;H[\{p_i\}] = - \sum p_i \log p_i &lt;/math&gt;

is the ([[Shannon entropy|Shannon]]) entropy of the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\{p_i\}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;S(\rho) = H[\{\lambda_i\}] &lt;/math&gt;

is the (von Neumann) entropy of a matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; with eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;T(\rho,\sigma) = \frac{1}{2}||\rho-\sigma||_{1} = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Tr} \left[ \sqrt{(\rho-\sigma)^\dagger (\rho-\sigma)} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace distance between the two matrices.  Note that the base for the [[logarithm]] is arbitrary, so long as the same base is used on both sides of the inequality.

Audenaert also proved that&amp;mdash;given only the trace distance ''T'' and the dimension&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;mdash;this is the ''optimal'' bound.  He did this by directly exhibiting a pair of matrices which saturate the bound for any values of ''T'' and&amp;nbsp;''d''.  The matrices (which are diagonal in the same basis, i.e. they commute) are

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \mathrm{Diag}(1-T, T/(d-1),\dots,T/(d-1)) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \mathrm{Diag}(1,0,\dots,0) &lt;/math&gt;

==Fannes' inequality and Audenaert's refinement==

The original inequality proved by Fannes was

:&lt;math&gt;|S(\rho)-S(\sigma)| \le 2T \log (d) -2T \log 2T &lt;/math&gt;

when &lt;math&gt;T \le 1/2e&lt;/math&gt;.  He also proved the weaker inequality

:&lt;math&gt;|S(\rho)-S(\sigma)| \le 2T \log (d) + 1 / (e \log 2) &lt;/math&gt;

which can be used for larger&amp;nbsp;''T''.

Fannes proved this inequality as a means to prove the [[Continuity (mathematics)|continuity]] of the [[von Neumann entropy]], which did not require an optimal bound.  The proof is very compact, and can be found in the textbook by Nielsen and Chuang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (book)|Quantum Computation and Quantum Information]]|last= Nielsen|first= Michael A|authorlink= |author2=Chuang, Isaac L|year= 2000|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= [[Cambridge]]; [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 978-0-521-63235-5|oclc= 43641333|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audenaert's proof of the optimal inequality, on the other hand, is significantly more complicated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6990">{{For|other theorems named after Pierre de Fermat|Fermat's theorem}}
In [[additive number theory]], [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]'s theorem on sums of two squares states that an [[Even and odd numbers|odd]] [[prime number|prime]] ''p'' can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;p = x^2 + y^2,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''x'' and ''y'' integers, [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt;p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The prime numbers for which this is true are called [[Pythagorean prime]]s.
For example, the primes 5, 13, 17, 29, 37 and 41 are all congruent to 1 [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4, and they can be expressed as sums of two squares in the following ways:

:&lt;math&gt;5 = 1^2 + 2^2, \quad 13 = 2^2 + 3^2, \quad 17 = 1^2 + 4^2, \quad 29 = 2^2 + 5^2, \quad 37 = 1^2 + 6^2, \quad 41 = 4^2 + 5^2.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, the primes 3, 7, 11, 19, 23 and 31 are all congruent to 3 modulo 4, and none of them can be expressed as the sum of two squares. This is the easier part of the theorem, and follows immediately from the observation that all squares are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.

[[Albert Girard]] was the first to make the observation, describing all positive integral numbers (not necessarily primes) expressible as the sum of two squares of positive integers; this was published in 1625.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Stevin]]. [https://archive.org/stream/larithmetiqvedes00stev#page/622/mode/2up ''l'Arithmétique de Simon Stevin de Bruges'', annotated by Albert Girard, Leyde 1625, p. 622].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Dickson, History of the Theory of Numbers, Vol. II,  Ch. VI, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement that every prime ''p'' of the form ''4n+1'' is the sum of two squares is sometimes called ''Girard's theorem''.&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Dickson, History of the Theory of Numbers, Vol. II,  Ch. VI, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Fermat wrote an elaborate version of the statement (in which he also gave the number of possible expressions of the powers of ''p'' as a sum of two squares)  in a letter to [[Marin Mersenne]] dated December 25, 1640: for this reason this version of the theorem is sometimes called ''Fermat's Christmas theorem.'' 

Since the [[Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity|Diophantus identity]] implies that the product of two integers each of which can be written as the sum of two squares is itself expressible as the sum of two squares, by applying Fermat's theorem to the prime factorization of any positive integer ''n'', we see that if all  the prime factors of ''n'' congruent to 3 modulo 4 occur to an even exponent, then ''n'' is expressible as a sum of two squares. The converse also holds.&lt;ref&gt;For a proof of the converse see for instance 20.1, Theorems 367 and 368, in: G.H. Hardy and E.M. Wright. An introduction to the theory of numbers, Oxford 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; This equivalence provides the characterization Girard guessed.

==Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares==
{{main|Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares}}

Fermat usually did not write down proofs of his claims, and he did not provide a proof of this statement. The first proof was found by [[Euler]] after much effort and is based on [[infinite descent]].  He announced it in two letters to [[Christian Goldbach|Goldbach]], on May 6, 1747 and on April 12, 1749; he published the detailed proof in two articles (between 1752 and 1755).&lt;ref&gt;De numerus qui sunt aggregata quorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 4 (1752/3), 1758, 3-40)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demonstratio theorematis FERMATIANI omnem numerum primum formae 4n+1 esse summam duorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 5 (1754/5), 1760, 3-13)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] gave a proof in 1775 that was based on his study of [[quadratic forms]]. This proof was simplified by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (art. 182). [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] gave at least two proofs based on the arithmetic of the [[Gaussian integer]]s. There is an elegant proof using [[Minkowski's theorem]] about convex sets. Simplifying an earlier short proof due to [[Roger Heath-Brown|Heath-Brown]] (who was inspired by [[Liouville]]'s idea), [[Don Zagier|Zagier]] presented a one-sentence proof of Fermat's assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

And more recently Christopher gave a [[Partition (number theory)| partition-theoretic]] proof.&lt;ref&gt;A. David Christopher. "A partition-theoretic proof of Fermat’s Two Squares Theorem", ''Discrete Mathematics'' '''339''':4:1410–1411 (6 April 2016) {{doi|10.1016/j.disc.2015.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related results==
Fermat announced two related results fourteen years later. In a letter to [[Blaise Pascal]] dated September 25,  1654 he announced the following two results for odd primes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;:

*&lt;math&gt;p = x^2 + 2y^2 \Leftrightarrow p\equiv 1\mbox{ or }p\equiv 3\pmod{8},&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;p= x^2 + 3y^2 \Leftrightarrow p\equiv 1 \pmod{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

He also wrote:
: ''If two primes which end in 3 or 7 and surpass by 3 a multiple of 4 are multiplied, then their product will be composed of a square and the quintuple of another square.''

In other words, if ''p, q'' are of the form 20''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 or 20''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, then ''pq'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Euler later extended this to the conjecture that
* &lt;math&gt;p = x^2 + 5y^2 \Leftrightarrow p\equiv 1\mbox{ or }p\equiv 9\pmod{20},&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;2p = x^2 + 5y^2 \Leftrightarrow p\equiv 3\mbox{ or }p\equiv 7\pmod{20}.&lt;/math&gt;

Both Fermat's assertion and Euler's conjecture were established by Lagrange.

A generalization of Fermat's theorem, the [[sum of two squares theorem]], characterizes the integers (not necessarily prime) that can be expressed as the sum of two squares. They are exactly the integers in which each prime that is congruent to 3 mod 4 appears with an even exponent in the prime factorization of the number.

'''Hilary Whitehall Putnam''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|t|n|ə|m}}; July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], and [[computer scientist]], and a major figure in [[analytic philosophy]] in the second half of the 20th century. He made significant contributions to [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], and [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;Casati R., "Hillary Putnam" in ''Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia'', ed. [[Gianni Vattimo]]. 2004. Garzanti Editori. Milan. {{ISBN|88-11-50515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Putnam was Cogan University Professor Emeritus at [[Harvard University]].

He was known for his willingness to apply an equal degree of scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws.&lt;ref name=King170&gt;King, P.J. ''One Hundred Philosophers: The Life and Work of the World's Greatest Thinkers''. Barron's 2004, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his own position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Ritchie|title=TPM: Philosopher of the Month|url=http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/phil_jun2002.htm|date=June 2002|archivedate=2011-07-09
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709060653/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/phil_jun2002.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the [[type physicalism|type-identity]] of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the [[multiple realizability]] of [[Mental event|the mental]], and for the concept of [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], an influential theory regarding the [[mind–body problem]].&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=LeDoux, J. |title=The Synaptic Self; How Our Brains Become Who We Are| publisher=Viking Penguin|location=New York|year=2002|isbn=88-7078-795-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy of language, along with [[Saul Kripke]] and others, he developed the [[causal theory of reference]], and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of [[externalism|semantic externalism]] based on a famous [[thought experiment]] called [[Twin Earth thought experiment|Twin Earth]].&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;P. Clark-B. Hale (eds.), "Reading Putnam", Blackwell, Cambridge (Massachusetts): Oxford 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy of mathematics]], he and his mentor [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] developed the "[[Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis]]", an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,&lt;ref&gt;Colyvan, Mark, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2004/entries/mathphil-indis/ "Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but "[[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical]]".&lt;ref name="PutBen"&gt;Putnam, H.

Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1964. 2nd ed., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[epistemology]], he is known for his critique of the well known "[[brain in a vat]]" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for [[skepticism|epistemological skepticism]], but Putnam challenges its coherence.&lt;ref name="BIV"&gt;Putnam, H.

In [[metaphysics]], he originally espoused a position called [[metaphysical realism]], but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called "[[internal realism]]",&lt;ref name="Human"&gt;Putnam, H. ''Realism with a Human Face''. Edited by James Conant. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career he remained committed to [[scientific realism]], roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. 2012. From Quantum Mechanics to Ethics and Back Again. In his (Au.), De Caro, M. and Macarthur D. (Eds.) "Philosophy in an Age of Science". Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of perception]] Putnam came to endorse [[direct realism]], according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. In the past, he further held that there are no mental representations, [[sense data]], or other intermediaries that stand between the mind and the world.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;Putnam, H.. ''The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, however, he rejected this further commitment, in favor of "[[transactionalism]]", a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve [[qualia]].&lt;ref name="putnamphil.blogspot.com"&gt;{{Cite web | title = What Wiki Doesn't Know About Me | last = Putnam | first = Hilary  | work = Sardonic comment | date = October 30, 2015 | accessdate = March 15, 2016 | url = http://putnamphil.blogspot.com/2014/10/what-wiki-doesnt-know-about-me-in-1976.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. 2012.

In his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in [[Pragmatism|American pragmatism]], [[Jewish philosophy]], and [[ethics]], thus engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in [[metaphilosophy]], seeking to "renew philosophy" from what he identifies as narrow and inflated concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Randall Auxier|Auxier, R.]], ''The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam'' ([[Chicago]]: [[Open Court Publishing Company]], 2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=adoKCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]]. Together with [[Martin Davis]] he developed the [[Davis–Putnam algorithm]] for the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]&lt;ref name="DandP"&gt;Davis, M. and Putnam, H. "A computing procedure for quantification theory" in ''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', 7:201–215, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of [[Hilbert's tenth problem]].&lt;ref name="Mat"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matiyesavic, Yuri |title=Hilbert's Tenth Problem|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge|year=1993|isbn=0-262-13295-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Hick"&gt;To appear in the "American Philosophers" edition of ''Literary Biography'', ed.

== Life ==
Putnam was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1926.  His father, [[Samuel Putnam]], was a scholar of Romance languages, columnist, and translator who wrote for the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', a publication of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], from 1936 to 1946 (when he became disillusioned with communism).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertram Wolfe|Wolfe, Bertram David]]. "Strange Communists I Have Known", Stein and Day, 1965, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of his father's commitment to [[communism]], Putnam had a secular upbringing, although his mother, Riva, was [[Jew]]ish.&lt;ref name=King170/&gt;  The family lived in France until 1934, when they returned to the United States, settling in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=King170/&gt;  Putnam attended [[Central High School of Philadelphia|Central High School]]; there he met [[Noam Chomsky]], who was a year behind him.  The two remained friends—and often intellectual opponents—for the rest of Putnam's life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert F. Barsky]], ''Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20031106040709/http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/2/7.html Ch. 2: Undergraduate Years. "A Very Powerful Personality"], [[MIT Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Putnam studied philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], receiving his [[B.A.]] degree and becoming a member of the [[Philomathean Society]], the oldest continually-existing collegiate literary society in the United States.&lt;ref name=King170/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt; He went on to do graduate work in philosophy at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref name=King170/&gt; and later at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|Philosophy Department]], where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1951 for a dissertation entitled ''The Meaning of the Concept of Probability in Application to Finite Sequences''.  Putnam's teacher [[Hans Reichenbach]] (his dissertation supervisor) was a leading figure in [[logical positivism]], the dominant school of philosophy of the day; one of Putnam's most consistent positions has been his rejection of logical positivism as self-defeating.&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt;

After teaching at [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]] (1951–52), [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (1953–61), and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (1961–65), he moved to Harvard in 1965. His wife, the philosopher [[Ruth Anna Putnam]], took a teaching position in philosophy at Wellesley College.&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt; Hilary and Ruth Anna were married on August 11, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/putnam-hilary-1926|title=Putnam, Hilary 1926- - Dictionary definition of Putnam, Hilary 1926- {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Anna,  descendant of a family with a long scholarly tradition in [[Gotha]] (her ancestor was the German classical scholar [[Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs]]), was born in [[Berlin]], Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Hortsch, Michael.

They had "no idea how to do it [themselves]", in the words of Ruth Anna. They therefore began to study Jewish ritual and Hebrew, and became more Jewishly interested, identified, and active. In 1994, Hilary Putnam celebrated a belated [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] service. His wife had a Bat Mitzvah service four years later.&lt;ref name="Globe"/&gt;

Hilary was a popular teacher at Harvard. In keeping with the family tradition, he was politically active.&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt; In the 1960s and early 1970s, he was an active supporter of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and an [[opposition to the Vietnam War|opponent]] of American military intervention in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt; In 1963, he organized one of the first faculty and student committees at MIT against the war.  Putnam was disturbed when he learned from reading the reports of [[David Halberstam]] that the U.S. was "defending" South Vietnamese peasants from the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Vietcong]] by poisoning their rice crops.&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt; After moving to Harvard in 1965, he organized campus protests and began teaching courses on [[Marxism]]. Hilary became an official faculty advisor to the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] and, in 1968, became a member of the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] (PLP).&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt;

He said that he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt;

In 1976, he was elected President of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. The following year, he was selected as Walter Beverly Pearson Professor of Mathematical Logic, in recognition of his contributions to the [[philosophy of logic]] and mathematics.&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt; While breaking with his radical past, Putnam never abandoned his belief that academics have a particular social and ethical responsibility toward society. He continued to be forthright and [[progressivism|progressive]] in his political views, as expressed in the articles "How Not to Solve Ethical Problems" (1983) and "Education for Democracy" (1993).&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt;

Putnam was a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]]. He retired from teaching in June 2000, but, as of 2009, he continued to give a seminar almost yearly at [[Tel Aviv University]]. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html The Spinoza Chair – Philosophy – University of Amsterdam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University and a founding patron of the small liberal arts college [[Ralston College]]. His corpus includes five volumes of collected works, seven books, and more than 200 articles.

== Philosophy of mind ==

=== Multiple realizability ===
[[File:Reduktionismus.png|thumb|right|An illustration of multiple realizability. ''M'' stands for mental and ''P'' stands for physical. It can be seen that more than one ''P'' can instantiate one ''M'', but not vice versa. Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows (''M1'' goes to ''M2'', etc.).]]

Putnam's best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of [[multiple realizability]].&lt;ref name="Bick"&gt;Bickle, John [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2002/entries/multiple-realizability/ "Multiple Realizability"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2006 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the [[type-identity theory]], it is not necessarily true that "[[Pain]] is identical to [[C-fibre]] firing." Pain, according to Putnam's papers, may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms, and yet they all experience the same mental state of "being in pain".

Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same [[animal cognition|mental states]] and properties. The answer to this puzzle had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially [[artificial intelligence|intelligent robots]] and other [[silicon-based life form]]s. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack the same [[neurochemistry]] as humans. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an "ambitious" and "highly implausible" conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability.&lt;ref name="MLR"&gt;Putnam, H. (1975) ''Mind, Language and Reality. Philosophical Papers, vol. 2''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. {{ISBN|88-459-0257-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is sometimes referred to as the "likelihood argument".&lt;ref name="Bick"/&gt;

Putnam formulated a complementary argument based on what he called "functional isomorphism". He defined the concept in these terms: "Two systems are functionally isomorphic if 'there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations'." In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first are exactly mirrored by the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability.&lt;ref name="MLR"/&gt; This argument is sometimes referred to as an "''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' argument".&lt;ref name="Bick"/&gt;

[[Jerry Fodor]], Putnam, and others noted that, along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general.&lt;ref name="MLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1974) "Special Sciences" in ''Synthese'', 28, pp. 97–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1980) "The Mind-Body Problem", ''Scientific American'', 244, pp. 124–132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]], which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.&lt;ref name="MLR"/&gt;

=== Machine state functionalism ===
The first formulation of such a functionalist theory was put forth by Putnam himself. This formulation, which is now called "machine-state functionalism", was inspired by analogies noted by Putnam and others between the mind and [[Turing machine]]s. The point, for functionalism is the nature of the states of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs, and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of a Turing machine state. Just as "state one" simply is the state in which, given a particular input, such-and-such happens, so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry "ouch", become distracted, wonder what the cause is, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Block, Ned |title=What is Functionalism | url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/functionalism.html|date=August 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rejection of functionalism ===
In the late 1980s, Putnam abandoned his adherence to functionalism and other [[computational theory of mind|computational theories of mind]]. His change of mind was primarily due to the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to the [[Internalism and externalism|externalism]] of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own [[Twin Earth thought experiment|Twin Earth]] [[thought experiment]] (see ''[[#Philosophy of language|Philosophy of language]]'').&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt; He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a [[universal Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary (1988). Representation and Reality. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Putnam's rejection of functionalism, it has continued to flourish and has been developed into numerous versions by thinkers as diverse as [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref name="Mar"&gt;Marhaba, Sadi. (2004) ''Funzionalismo''in "Enciclopedia Garzantina della Filosofia" (ed.) [[Gianni Vattimo]]. Milan: Garzanti Editori. {{ISBN|88-11-50515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern [[cognitive science]]&lt;ref name="Mar"/&gt; and is the dominant theory of mind in philosophy today.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Janet, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2004/entries/functionalism/ "Functionalism"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 Putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called "liberal functionalism". The view holds that "what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities".&lt;ref name="putnamphil.blogspot.com"/&gt; The specification of these capacities (1) may refer to what goes on outside the organism's "brain", (2) may include intentional idioms, and (3) need not describe a capacity to compute something or other.&lt;ref name="putnamphil.blogspot.com"/&gt;

== Philosophy of language ==

=== Semantic externalism ===
One of Putnam's contributions to [[philosophy of language]] is his claim that "meaning just ain't in the head". His views on meaning, first laid out in ''Meaning and Reference'' (1973), then in '' The Meaning of 'Meaning' '' (1975), use his famous "Twin Earth" thought experiment to illustrate that the meaning of terms are determined by factors outside the mind.

Twin Earth shows this, according to Putnam, since on Twin Earth everything is identical to Earth, except that its lakes, rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ whereas those of earth are filled with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Consequently, when an earthling, Fredrick, uses the Earth-English word "water", it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth-English word "water" when used by his physically identical twin, Frodrick, on Twin Earth. Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words, and since their words have different meanings, meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads. This led Putnam to adopt a version of [[semantic externalism]] with regard to meaning and mental content.&lt;ref name="BIV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLR"
/&gt;
The late philosopher of mind and language [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam, wrote that semantic externalism constituted an "anti-subjectivist revolution" in philosophers' way of seeing the world. Since the time of Descartes, philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience. Thanks to [[Saul Kripke]], Putnam, [[Tyler Burge]] and others, Davidson said, philosophy could now take the objective realm for granted and start questioning the alleged "truths" of subjective experience.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, D. (2001) ''Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-7078-832-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of meaning ===
Putnam, along with [[Saul Kripke]], [[Keith Donnellan]], and others, contributed to what is known as the [[causal theory of reference]].&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; In particular, Putnam maintained in ''The Meaning of "Meaning"'' that the objects referred to by [[natural kind]] terms—such as tiger, water, and tree—are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to [[Adam Smith]]'s economic division of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the "experts" in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term "lion" is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term "elm tree" is fixed by the community of botanists, and the reference of the term "table salt" is fixed as "NaCl" by chemists. These referents are considered [[rigid designator]]s in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community.&lt;ref name="MLR"/&gt;

Putnam specifies a finite sequence of elements (a vector) for the description of the meaning of every term in the language. Such a vector consists of four components:
# the object to which the term [[reference|refers]], e.g., the object individuated by the chemical formula H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O;
# a set of typical descriptions of the term, referred to as "the stereotype", e.g., "transparent", "colorless", and "hydrating";
# the semantic indicators that place the object into a general category, e.g., "natural kind" and "liquid";
# the syntactic indicators, e.g., "concrete noun" and "mass noun".

Such a "meaning-vector" provides a description of the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to that expression or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. However, since there is no possible algorithm that can determine which aspect—the stereotype or the reference—has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language.&lt;ref name="MLR"/&gt; Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions which must be considered, Putnam embraced a form of [[semantic holism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dell'Utri, Massimo. (2002) ''Olismo''. Quodlibet. Macerata. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of mathematics ==
Putnam made a significant contribution to [[philosophy of mathematics]] in the Quine–Putnam "indispensability argument" for [[mathematical realism]].&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;C. S. Hill (ed.), "The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam", Fayetteville, Arkansas 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is considered by [[Stephen Yablo]] to be one of the most challenging arguments in favor of the acceptance of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets.&lt;ref name="Ya"&gt;{{cite web|author=Yablo, S. | title=A Paradox of Existence| url=http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/apex.html#fn1|date=November 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the argument is as follows.

# One must have [[Ontology|ontological]] commitments to ''all'' entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities ''only'' (commonly referred to as "all and only").
# Mathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,
# One must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities.&lt;ref name="MMM"&gt;Putnam, H. ''Mathematics, Matter and Method. Philosophical Papers, vol. 1''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 2nd. ed., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the "only" part of "all and only". The assertion that "all" entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by [[confirmation holism]]. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the [[nominalism|nominalist]] who wishes to exclude the existence of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry]], but to include the existence of [[quark]]s and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.&lt;ref name="MMM"/&gt;

Putnam holds the view that mathematics, like physics and other empirical sciences, uses both strict logical proofs and "[[quasi-empirical]]" methods. For example, [[Fermat's last theorem]] states that for no [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; are there positive integer values of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' such that &lt;math&gt;x^n+y^n=z^n&lt;/math&gt;. Before this was proven for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; in 1995 by [[Andrew Wiles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= J J O'Connor and E F Robertson|title=Andrew Wiles summary|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Wiles.html|date=April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had been proven for many values of ''n''. These proofs inspired further research in the area, and formed a quasi-empirical consensus for the theorem. Even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proven theorem, it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas.&lt;ref name="PutBen"/&gt;

== Mathematics and computer science ==
Putnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; As a mathematician, Putnam contributed to the resolution of [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] in mathematics. This problem was settled by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] in 1970, with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam, [[Julia Robinson]] and [[Martin Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Barry Cooper]], ''Computability theory'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computability theory]], Putnam investigated the structure of the ramified [[analytical hierarchy]]&lt;!-- link is not quite appropriate: the ''ramified'' analytical hierarchy is not the same as the analytical hierarchy; but Wikipedia has nothing more specific, so I think it is better to link here than to yet-to-be-written article --&gt;, its connection with the [[Constructible universe|constructible hierarchy]] and its [[Turing degree]]s.  He showed that there exist many levels of the constructible hierarchy which do not add any subsets of the integers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |year=1963 |title=A note on constructible sets of integers |journal=Notre Dame J. Formal Logic |volume=4 |pages=270–273 |doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093957652 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, with his student [[George Boolos]], that the first such "non-index" is the [[Large countable ordinal|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; of ramified analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boolos |first1=George |last2=Putnam |first2=Hilary |year=1968 |title=Degrees of unsolvability of constructible sets of integers |journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=33 |pages=497–513 |doi=10.2307/2271357 |issue=4 |publisher=The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 33, No. 4 |jstor=2271357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (this is the smallest &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a model of full [[Second-order arithmetic|second-order comprehension]]), and also, together with a separate paper with [[Richard Boyd]] (another of Putnam's students) and [[Gustav Hensel (mathematician)|Gustav Hensel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=Richard |last2=Hensel |first2=Gustav |last3=Putnam |first3=Hilary |year=1969 |title=A recursion-theoretic characterization of the ramified analytical hierarchy |journal=Trans.

Soc. |volume=141 |pages=37–62 |doi=10.2307/1995087 |publisher=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 141 |jstor=1995087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; how the Davis–[[Andrzej Mostowski|Mostowski]]–[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Hyperarithmetical theory|hyperarithmetical]] hierarchy of arithmetical degrees can be naturally extended up to &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[computer science]], Putnam is known for the [[Davis–Putnam algorithm]] for the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; The algorithm finds if there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given [[Boolean expression]] so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of [[George Logemann]] and [[Donald W. Loveland]]. It became known as the [[DPLL algorithm]]. This algorithm is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.&lt;ref name="DandP"/&gt;

== Epistemology ==
[[File:Brainvat.png|thumb|right|A "[[brain in a vat]]"—Putnam uses this [[thought experiment]] to argue that skeptical scenarios are impossible.]]

In the field of [[epistemology]], Putnam is known for his "brain in a vat" thought experiment (a modernized version of [[Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]] hypothesis). The argument is that one cannot coherently state that one is a disembodied "brain in a vat" placed there by some "[[mad scientist]]".&lt;ref name="BIV"/&gt;

This follows from the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to the kinds of things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, experienced. So, if some person, Mary, were a "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a "brain" would not refer to a "real" brain, since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a "vat" would not refer to a "real" vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological [[externalism]]: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.&lt;ref name=BIV/&gt;

Putnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism, but [[metaphysical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H., ''Realism and Reason. Philosophical Papers, vol. 3.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, C. (1992), "On Putnam's Proof That We Are Not Brains-in-a-Vat", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Since realism of this kind assumes the existence of a gap between how man conceives the world and the way the world really is, skeptical scenarios such as this one (or [[René Descartes|Descartes']] [[evil demon]]) present a formidable challenge. Putnam, by arguing that such a scenario is impossible, attempts to show that this notion of a gap between man's concept of the world and the way it is, is in itself absurd. Man cannot have a "God's eye" view of reality. He is limited to his conceptual schemes. [[Metaphysical realism]] is therefore false, according to Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;Dell'Utri, M. (1990), "Choosing Conceptions of Realism: the Case of the Brains in a Vat", Mind 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphilosophy and ontology &lt;!--'Internal realism' redirects here--&gt; ==
In the late 1970s and the 1980s, stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some ideas of Quine, Putnam abandoned his long-standing defence of [[metaphysical realism]]—the view that the categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the conceptualizations of the human mind. He adopted a rather different view, which he called "'''internal realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;".&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. ''The Many Faces of Realism''. La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human"/&gt;

Internal realism was the view that, although the world may be ''causally'' independent of the human mind, the structure of the world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ''ontologically'' independent. The general idea is influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the [[Category (Kant)|categories of thought]].&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Curtis Brown |title=Internal Realism: Transcendental Idealism?|journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|issue=12|year=1988|pages=145–55.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with metaphysical realism, according to Putnam, was that it fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But how is it possible that the world "carves up" into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two "carvings" perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes.  In ''Reason, Truth, and History'', Putnam identified truth with what he termed "idealized rational acceptability." The theory, which owes something to [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]], is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.&lt;ref name="Human"/&gt;

[[Nelson Goodman]] had formulated a similar notion in ''Fact, Fiction and Forecast'' in 1956. In that work, Goodman went as far as to suggest that there is "no one world, but many worlds, each created by the human mind."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N. ''Fact, Fiction, and Forecast''. University of London: Athlone Press, 1954. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 1955. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965. 3rd. ed. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1973. 4th ed. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam rejected this form of [[social constructivism]], but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. No one of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the "one, true" description of the world. This does not imply [[relativism]], for Putnam, because not all descriptions are equally correct and the ones that are correct are not determined subjectively.&lt;ref name="Half"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Putnam, H.|title=A Half Century of Philosophy, Viewed from Within|journal=Daedalus|year=1997|volume=126|issue=1|pages=175–208|jstor=20027414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam renounced internal realism in his reply to [[Simon Blackburn]] in the volume ''Reading Putnam''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Clark and Bob Hale, eds., ''Reading Putnam''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons he gave up his "antirealism" are stated in the first three of his replies in "The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam", an issue of the journal ''Philosophical Topics'', where he gives a history of his use(s) of the term "internal realism", and, at more length, in his ''The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body and World'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;See also ''Philosophical Topics'' (vol. 20, Number 1, Spring 1992). And Hilary Putnam, "When 'Evidence Transcendence' is Not Malign", Journal of Philosophy, XCVIII, 11 (Nov. 2001), 594–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he abandoned internal realism, Putnam still resists the idea that any given thing or system of things can only be described in exactly one complete and correct way. He thus accepts "conceptual relativity" – the view that it may be a matter of choice or convention, e.g., whether mereological sums exist, or whether space-time points are individuals or mere limits. In other words, having abandoned internal realism Putnam came to accept metaphysical realism in simply the broad sense of rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our 'making' the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Wiki Catches Up a Bit | last = Putnam | first = Hilary  | work = Sardonic comment | date = November 9, 2015 | accessdate = March 15, 2016 | url = http://putnamphil.blogspot.com/2014/11/wiki-catches-up-bit-in-1976-when-i.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the influence of C. S. Peirce and [[William James]], Putnam also became convinced that there is no fact–value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.&lt;ref name="Half"/&gt;

== Neopragmatism and Wittgenstein ==
At the end of the 1980s, Putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as the "[[scientism]]" and the rejection of history that characterize modern [[analytic philosophy]]. He rejected internal realism because it assumed a "cognitive interface" model of the relation between the mind and the world. Putnam claimed that the very notion of truth would have to be abandoned by a consistent [[Eliminative materialism|eliminative materialist]].&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, ''The Last Superstition'', St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Under the increasing influence of James and the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], he adopted a [[direct realism|direct realist]] view of this relation.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, under the influence of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], he adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as nothing more than conceptual or linguistic confusions created by philosophers by using ordinary language out of its original context.&lt;ref name="Half"/&gt; In 2017 a book collecting articles on pragmatism by both Ruth Anna and Hilary Putnam was published, ''Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey'' (Harvard UP, 2017, {{ISBN|9780674967502}}).

Many of Putnam's most recent works have addressed the concerns of ordinary people, particularly their concerns about social problems.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Edward (1997). [http://www.piaget.org/GE/1997/GE-25-3.html#2 "Defending Experience: A Philosophy For The Post-Modern World"] in ''The Genetic Epistemologist: The Journal of the Jean Piaget Society'', Volume 25, Number 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he has written about the nature of [[democracy]], [[social justice]] and [[religion]]. He has discussed the ideas of the [[continental philosophy|continental philosopher]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], and has written articles influenced by "continental" ideas.&lt;ref name="Hick"/&gt;

== Death ==
Putnam died of [[mesothelioma]], a rare form of [[lung cancer]], at his home in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]] during the early hours of March 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?n=hilary-putnam&amp;pid=178040325|title=Boston Globe Obituaries|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?n=hilary-putnam&amp;pid=178040325&amp; HILARY PUTNAM Obituary – Brookline, MA | Boston Globe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Putnam himself may be his own most formidable philosophical adversary.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt; His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible.&lt;ref name="BandM"&gt;Bechtel, William and Mundale, Jennifer. ''Multiple Realizability Revisited'' in ''Philosophy of Science'' 66: 175–207.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[William Bechtel]] and Jennifer Mundale, to be able to conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or [[homology (biology)|homology]]) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species.&lt;ref name="BandM"/&gt; If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species).&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Sungsu. ''Testing Multiple Realizability: A Discussion of Bechtel and Mundale'' in ''Philosophy of Science''. 69: 606–610.&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by [[Jaegwon Kim]], [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[Robert Richardson (philosopher)|Robert Richardson]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Jaegwon. ''Multiple Realizability and the Metaphysics of Reduction'' on ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''. 52: 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David (1969). "Review of Art, Mind, and Religion." Journal of Philosophy, 66: 23–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Robert (1979). "Functionalism and Reductionism." Philosophy of Science, 46: 533–558.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, Patricia (1986). Neurophilosophy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main arguments against functionalism was formulated by Putnam himself: the [[Twin Earth thought experiment]]. However, there have been other criticisms. The [[Chinese room]] argument by [[John Searle]] (1980) is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action, without any interpretation or understanding, through the use of a purely functional system. In short, Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. The person is instructed, by people outside the room, to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. Further, suppose that the people outside the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside "knows" Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone. This thought experiment attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any [[semantics]] (meaning) or [[intentionality]] (aboutness). Thus, Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with the following of a set of syntactic rules. Thus, functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. (1980). "Minds, Brains and Programs", ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', vol.3. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20010221025515/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; Several other arguments against functionalism have been advanced by [[Ned Block]].&lt;ref&gt;Block, Ned. (1980b). "Troubles With Functionalism", in Block (1980a).&lt;/ref&gt;

Putnam has consistently adhered to the idea of [[semantic holism]], in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by [[Michael Dummett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Ernest Lepore]], and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we will never be able to master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence ''P'', since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and ''P'' is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that ''P'' means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence ''P'' derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of ''P''. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that ''P'' has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. and Lepore, E. ''Holism: A Shopper's Guide''. Blackwell. Oxford. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dummett, Michael. ''The Logical Basis of Metaphysics''. Harvard University Press. Cambridge (MA). 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penco, Carlo. ''Olismo e Molecularismo'' in ''Olismo'' ed. Massimo Dell'Utri. Quodlibet. Macerata. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[brain in a vat]] argument has also been subject to criticism.&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;Steinitz, Y. (1994), "Brains in a Vat: Different Perspectives", Philosophical Quarterly 44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crispin Wright]] argues that Putnam's formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived her entire life outside the vat—speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world—prior to her "envatment" by a mad scientist, when she wakes up inside the vat, her words and thoughts (e.g., "tree" and "grass") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world that they referred to before her envatment.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; In another scenario, a brain in a vat may be hooked up to a [[supercomputer]] that randomly generates perceptual experiences. In this case, one's words and thoughts would not refer to anything, and would therefore be devoid of content. Semantics would no longer exist and the argument would be meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Brueckner, A. (1986), "Brains in a Vat", Journal of Philosophy 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy of mathematics, [[Stephen Yablo]] has argued that the Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis does not demonstrate that mathematical entities are truly indispensable. The argumentation is sophisticated, but the upshot is that one can achieve the same logical results by simply adding to any statement about an abstract object the assumption "so-and-so is assumed (or hypothesized) to exist". For example, one can take the argument for indispensability described above and adjust it as follows:
: 1*. One must have ontological commitments to all and only the [abstract] entities for which, ''under the assumption that they exist'', their existence is indispensable to the best scientific theories.
: 2*. ''Under the assumption that they exist,'' the existence of mathematical entities is indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,
: 3*. ''Under the assumption that mathematical entities exist'', one must have ontological commitments to the existence of mathematical entities.&lt;ref name="Ya"/&gt;

Finally, Putnam's internal realism has been accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective [[idealism]]. If this is the case, it is subject to the traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of [[solipsism]]. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The '''history of the [[Church–Turing thesis]]''' ("thesis") involves the [[history]] of the development of the study of the nature of functions whose values are effectively calculable; or, in more modern terms, functions whose values are algorithmically computable. It is an important topic in modern mathematical theory and computer science, particularly associated with the work of [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]].

The debate and discovery of the meaning of "computation" and "recursion" has been long and contentious.  This article provides detail of that debate and discovery from [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] in 1889 through recent discussion of the meaning of "[[axiom]]".

==Peano's nine axioms of arithmetic==
In 1889, [[Giuseppe Peano]] presented his ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'', based on the work of [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]. [[Robert Soare|Soare]] proposes that the origination of "primitive recursion" began formally with the axioms of Peano, although
:"Well before the nineteenth century mathematicians used the principle of defining a function by induction. Dedekind 1888 proved, using accepted axioms, that such a definition defines a unique function, and he applied it to the definition of the functions m+n, m x n, and m&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on this work of Dedekind, Peano 1889 and 1891 wrote the familiar five [sic] axioms for the positive integers. As a companion to his fifth [sic] axiom, mathematical induction, Peano used definition by induction, which has been called ''primitive'' recursion (since [[Rózsa Péter|Péter]] 1934 and Kleene 1936) ... ."&lt;ref&gt;Soare 1996:5&lt;/ref&gt;

Observe that ''in fact'' [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] are ''9'' in number and axiom ''9'' is the recursion/induction axiom.&lt;ref&gt;cf: van Heijenoort 1976:94&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Subsequently the 9 were reduced to 5 as "Axioms 2, 3, 4 and 5 which deal with identity, belong to the underlying logic. This leaves the five axioms that have become universally known as "the Peano axioms ... Peano acknowledges (1891b, p. 93) that his axioms come from Dedekind ... ."&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1976:83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hilbert and the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]==
At the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1900 in Paris the famous mathematician [[David Hilbert]] posed a set of problems – now known as [[Hilbert's problems]] – his beacon illuminating the way for mathematicians of the twentieth century. Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems introduced the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (the "decision problem"). In his 2nd problem he asked for a proof that "arithmetic" is "[[consistent]]". [[Kurt Gödel]] would prove in 1931 that, within what he called "P" (nowadays called [[Peano Arithmetic]]), "there exist undecidable sentences [propositions]".&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1931a in (Davis 1965:6), 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:596)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, "the consistency of P is unprovable in P, provided P is consistent".&lt;ref&gt;Gödel’s theorem IX, Gödel 1931a in (Davis 1965:36)&lt;/ref&gt;  While Gödel’s proof would display the tools necessary for [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] to resolve the Entscheidungsproblem, he himself would not answer it.

It is within Hilbert's [[Hilbert's tenth problem|10th problem]] where the question of an "Entscheidungsproblem" actually appears.   The heart of matter was the following question: "What do we mean when we say that a function is 'effectively calculable'"?  The answer would be something to this effect: "When the function is calculated by a ''mechanical'' procedure (process, method)."  Although stated easily nowadays, the question (and answer) would float about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely.

Hilbert's original description of problem 10 begins as follows:
:"'''10. Determination of the solvability of a [[Diophantine equation]]'''.  Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with [[Integer|rational integral]] [[coefficient]]s: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.&lt;ref&gt;This translation, and the original text in German, appears in (Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007:1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;!--:"The Entscheidungsproblem [decision problem for [[First-order logic|first-order logic]]] is solved when we know a procedure that allows for any given [[logical expression]] to decide by finitely many operations its validity or satisfiability ... The Entscheidungsproblem must be considered the main problem of [[Mathematical logic|mathematical logic]]. ... The solution of the Entscheidungsproblem is of fundamental significance for the theory of all domains whose propositions could be developed on the basis of a finite number of [[Axiom|axioms]]"--&gt;
By 1922, the specific question of an "Entscheidungsproblem" applied to Diophantine equations had developed into the more general question about a "decision method" for ''any'' [[Formula|mathematical formula]]. &lt;!--, and H. Behmann stated that
:"... most general form of the Entscheidungsproblem [is] as follows:
::"A quite definite generally applicable prescription is required which will allow one to decide in a finite number of steps the truth or falsity of a given purely logical assertion ..."&lt;ref&gt;Gandy 1994:57 quoting Behmann&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Behmann remarks that ... the general problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding which mathematical propositions are true." (Gandy 1994:57) --&gt;
[[Martin Davis]] explains it this way: Suppose we are given a "calculational procedure" that consists of (1) a set of axioms and (2) a logical conclusion written in [[first-order logic]], that is—written in what Davis calls "[[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] rules of deduction" (or the modern equivalent of [[Boolean logic]]).  Gödel’s doctoral dissertation&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:592ff)&lt;/ref&gt; proved that Frege's rules were ''complete'' "... in the sense that every valid formula is provable".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:582&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that encouraging fact, could there be a generalized "calculational procedure" that would tell us whether a conclusion can be derived from its premises?  Davis calls such calculational procedures "[[algorithm]]s".  The Entscheidungsproblem would be an algorithm as well.  "In principle, an algorithm for [the] Entscheidungsproblem would have reduced all human deductive reasoning to brute calculation".&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:146&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words: Is there an "algorithm" that can tell us if ''any'' formula is "true" (i.e. an algorithm that always correctly yields a judgment "truth" or "falsehood"?)
:" ... it seemed clear to Hilbert that with the solution of this problem, the Entscheidungsproblem, that it should be possible in principle to settle all mathematical questions in a purely mechanical manner.  Hence, given unsolvable problems at all, if Hilbert was correct, then the Entscheidungsproblem itself should be unsolvable".&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:108&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed: What about our Entscheidungsproblem algorithm itself?  Can it determine, in a finite number of steps, whether it, itself, is “successful” and "truthful" (that is, it does not get hung up in an endless "circle" or "[[Control flow#Condition-controlled loops|loop]]", and it correctly yields a judgment "truth" or "falsehood" about its own behavior and results)?

==Three problems from Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems==
At the 1928 [[International Congress of Mathematicians|Congress]] [in [[Bologna|Bologna, Italy]]] [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] refines the question very carefully into three parts. The following is [[Stephen Hawking|Stephen Hawking's]] summary:
*"1. To prove that all true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''completeness''' of mathematics.
*"2. To prove that only true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''consistency''' of mathematics,
*"3. To prove the decidability of mathematics, that is, the existence of a '''decision procedure''' to decide the truth or falsity of any given mathematical proposition." &lt;ref&gt;Hawking 2005:1121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simple arithmetic functions irreducible to primitive recursion==
[[Gabriel Sudan]] (1927) and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] (1928) display [[Computable function|recursive functions]] that are not ''primitive'' recursive:

:"Are there [[recursion]]s that are not reducible to [[primitive recursion]]; and in particular can recursion be used to define a function which is not primitive recursive?

:"This question arose from a conjecture of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] in 1926 on the [[continuum problem]], and was answered [yes: there are recursions that are not primitive recursive] by Ackermann 1928."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:271&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kleene 1952:272-273&lt;/ref&gt; observes that [[Rózsa Péter]] (1935) simplified Ackermann's example ("cf. also Hilbert-[[Bernays]] 1934") and [[Raphael Robinson]] (1948). Péter exhibited another example (1935) that employed [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. Péter (1950) and Ackermann (1940) also displayed "[[transfinite recursion]]s", and this led Kleene to wonder:
:"... whether we can characterize in any exact way the notion of any "recursion", or the class of all "recursive functions."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:273&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene concludes&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kleene 1952:274&lt;/ref&gt; that all "recursions" involve (i) the formal analysis he presents in his §54 ''Formal calculations of [[primitive recursive function]]s'' and, (ii) the use of [[mathematical induction]]. He immediately goes on to state that indeed the Gödel-Herbrand definition does indeed "characterize all recursive functions" – see the quote in [[#Kleene 1935|1934, below]].

==Gödel's proof==
In 1930, mathematicians gathered for a mathematics meeting and retirement event for [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. As luck would have it,
:"at the very same meeting, a young Czech mathematician, [[Kurt Gödel]], announced results which dealt it &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Hilbert's opinion that all three answers were YES] a serious blow."&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 1983:92&lt;/ref&gt;

He announced that the answer to the first two of Hilbert's three questions of 1928 was NO.

Subsequently in 1931 Gödel published his famous paper [http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related {{nowrap|Systems I.}}''] In his preface to this paper Martin Davis delivers a caution:
:"The reader should be warned that [in this particular paper] what Gödel calls ''recursive functions''  are now called ''[[primitive recursive functions]]''. (The revised terminology was introduced by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1936 in (Davis 1965:237ff)&lt;/ref&gt;)."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gödel  expansion of "effective calculation"==
To quote [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] (1952), "The characterization of all "recursive functions" was accomplished in the definition of 'general recursive function' by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] 1934, who built on a suggestion of [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]" (Kleene 1952:274). Gödel delivered a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Princeton NJ. In a preface written by [[Martin Davis]]&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:39–40&lt;/ref&gt; Davis observes that
:"Dr. Gödel has stated in a letter that he was, at the time of these lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions ..."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:40&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawson states that these lectures were meant to clarify concerns that the "incompleteness theorems were somehow dependent on the particularities of formalization":&lt;ref&gt;(Dawson 1997:101)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Gödel mentioned [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann's]] example in the final section of his 1934 paper, as a way of motivating the concept of "general recursive function" that he defined there; but earlier in footnote 3, he had already conjectured (as "a heuristic principle") that all finitarily computable functions could be obtained through recursions of such more general sorts.

:"The conjecture has since elicited much comment. In particular, when Martin Davis undertook to publish Gödel's 1934 lectures [in Davis 1965:41ff] he took it to be a variant of [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]; but in a letter to Davis ...&lt;ref&gt;[246: "KG to Martin Davis, 15 February 1965, Quoted in Gödel 1986–, vol. I, p. 341"]&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel stated emphatically that that was "not true" because at the time of those lectures he was "not at all convinced" that his concept of recursion comprised "all possible recursions." Rather, he said, "The conjecture stated there only refers to the equivalence of 'finite (computation) procedure' and 'recursive procedure.'" To clarify the issue Gödel added a postscript to the lectures,&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1964 in (Davis 1965:247) also reprinted in (Gödel 1986, vol. I:369–371)&lt;/ref&gt; in which he indicated that what had finally convinced him that the intuitively computable functions coincided with those that were general recursive was [[Alan Turing|Alan Turing's]] work {{Harv|Turing|1937}}.
:"Gödel's reluctance to regard either general recursiveness or λ-definability as adequate characterization of the informal notion of effective computability has been examined in detail by several authors [Footnote 248: "See especially Davis 1982; Gandy 1980 and 1988; Sieg 1994"]. There is a consensus that, in fact, neither Gödel's nor [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] formalisms were so perspicuous or intrinsically persuasive as Alan Turing's analysis, and [[Wilfried Sieg]] has argued that the evidence in favor of Church's Thesis provided by the "confluence of different notions" (the fact that the systems proposed by Church, Gödel, [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and Alan Turing all turned out to have the same extension) is less compelling than has generally supposed. Hence, quite apart from Gödel's innate caution there were good reasons for his skepticism. But what, then, ''was'' he attempting to achieve through his notion of general recursiveness? ...

:"Rather, Gödel obtained his definition [of the class of general recursive functions] through modification of Herbrand's ideas ...; and Wilfried Sieg has argued that his real purpose in the final section of the 1934 paper [the lecture notes] was "''to disassociate recursive functions from &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Herbrand's] [[epistemological]]ly restricted notion of proof''" by specifying "''mechanical'' rules for deriving equations." What was more ''general'' about Gödel's notion of "general" recursiveness was, Sieg suggests, that Herbrand had intended only to characterize those functions that could be ''proved'' to be recursive by ''finitary'' means [250]."&lt;ref&gt;Italics in the original Dawson 1997:101–102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleene==
[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] and [[J. Barkley Rosser|Rosser]] transcribed [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] 1934 lectures in Princeton. In his paper ''General Recursive Functions of Natural Numbers''&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:236ff)&lt;/ref&gt; Kleene states:

:"A definition of general recursive function of natural numbers was suggested by [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]] to Gödel, and was used by Gödel with an important modification in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1934 ...&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:237)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A recursive function (relation) in the sense of Gödel ... will now be called a [[primitive recursive function]] (relation).&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:239)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church definition of "effectively calculable"==
[[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936) proved that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] was undecidable within the λ-calculus and Gödel-Herbrand's general recursion; moreover Church cites two theorems of [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene's]] that proved that the functions defined in the λ-calculus are identical to the functions defined by general recursion:
:"Theorem XVI. Every recursive function of positive integers is λ-definable.&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;
:"Theorem XVII. Every λ-definable function of positive integers is recursive.&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;
::"&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; ... .  In the form here it was first obtained by Kleene... .
::"&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; This result was obtained independently by the present author and S. C. Kleene at about the same time.

The paper opens with a very long footnote, 3. Another footnote, 9, is also of interest. Martin Davis states that "This paper is principally important for its explicit statement (since known as [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]) that the functions which can be computed by a finite algorithm are precisely the recursive functions, and for the consequence that an explicit unsolvable problem can be given":&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:88)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; As will appear, this definition of effective calculability can be stated in either of two equivalent forms, (1) ... λ-definable ... 2) ... recursive ... . The notion of λ-definability is due jointly to the present author and S. C. Kleene, successive steps towards it having been taken by the present author in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'', vol. 34 (1933), p. 863, and Kleene in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', vol. 57 (1935), p. 219. The notion of recursiveness in the sense of §4 below is due jointly to [[Jacques Herbrand]] and [[Kurt Gödel]], as is there explained. And the proof of equivalence of the two notions is due chiefly to Kleene, but also partly to the present author and to J. B. Rosser&lt;!-- , as explained below --&gt; ... . The proposal to identify these notions with the intuitive notion of effective calculability is first made in the present paper (but see the first footnote to §7 below).

:"With the aid of the methods of Kleene (''American Journal of Mathematics'', 1935), the considerations of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of λ-definability, without making use of the notion of recursiveness. On the other hand, since the results of the present paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, "General recursive functions of natural numbers") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of recursiveness, without making use of λ-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it."&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Footnote 9 is in section ''§4 Recursive functions'':
:" &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;This definition [of "recursive"] is closely related to, and was suggested by, a definition of recursive functions which was proposed by Kurt Gödel, in lectures at Princeton, N. J., 1934, and credited by him in part to an unpublished suggestion of Jacques Herbrand. The principal features in which present definition of recursiveness differs from Gödel's are due to S. C. Kleene.
:" In a forthcoming paper by Kleene to be entitled "General recursive functions of natural numbers," ... it follows ... that every function recursive in the present sense is also recursive in the sense of Gödel (1934) and conversely."&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:95)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time prior to Church's paper ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936) a dialog occurred between Gödel and Church as to whether or not λ-definability was sufficient for the definition of the notion of "algorithm" and "effective calculability".

In Church (1936) we see, under the chapter §7 ''The notion of effective calculability'', a footnote 18 which states the following:
:"&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;The question of the relationship between effective calculability and recursiveness (which it is here proposed to answer by identifying the two notions) was raised by Gödel in conversation with the author. The corresponding question of the relationship between effective calculability and λ-definability had previously been proposed by the author independently." &lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:100)&lt;/ref&gt;

By "identifying" Church means – not "establishing the identity of" – but rather "to cause to be or become identical", "to conceive as united" (as in spirit, outlook or principle) (vt form), and (vi form) as "to be or become the same".&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster 1983:identifying&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post and "effective calculability" as "natural law"==
[[Emil Leon Post|Post's]] doubts as to whether or not recursion was an adequate definition of "effective calculability", plus the publishing of [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper, encouraged him in the fall of 1936 to propose a "formulation" with "psychological fidelity": A worker moves through "a sequence of spaces or boxes"&lt;ref name=Post289&gt;Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:289)&lt;/ref&gt; performing machine-like "primitive acts" on a sheet of paper in each box. The worker is equipped with "a fixed ualterable set of directions".&lt;ref name="Post289"/&gt; Each instruction consists of three or four symbols: (1) an identifying label/number, (2) an operation, (3) next instruction j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;; however, if the instruction is of type (e) and the determination is "yes" THEN instruction j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;' ELSE if it is "no" instruction j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The "primitive acts"&lt;ref name="Post289"/&gt; are of only 1 of 5 types: (a) mark the paper in the box he's in (or over-mark a mark already there), (b) erase the mark (or over-erase), (c) move one room to the right, (d) move one room to the left, (e) determine if the paper is marked or blank. The worker starts at step 1 in the starting-room, and does what the instructions instruct them to do. (See more at [[Post–Turing machine]].)

This matter, mentioned in the introduction about "intuitive theories" caused Post to take a potent poke at Church:
:"The writer expects the present formulation to turn out to be logically equivalent to recursiveness in the sense of the Gödel-Church development.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Its purpose, however, is not only to present a system of a certain logical potency but also, in its restricted field, of psychological fidelity. In the latter sense wider and wider formulations are contemplated. On the other hand, our aim will be to show that all such are logically reducible to formulation 1. We offer this conclusion at the present moment as a ''working hypothesis''. And to our mind such is Church's identification of effective calculability with recursivness.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;" (italics in original)
::&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [he sketches an approach to a proof]
::&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; "Cf. Church, lock. cit, pp. 346, 356-358. Actually the work already done by Church and others carries this identification considerably beyond the working hypothesis stage. ''But to mask this identification under a definition hides the fact'' that a fundamental discovery in the limitiations of mathematicizing power of Homo Sapiens has been made ''and blinds us to the need of its continual verification''."&lt;ref&gt;italics added, Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:291)&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words Post is saying "Just because you ''defined'' it so doesn't ''make'' it truly so; your definition is based on no more than an intuition." Post was searching for more than a definition: "The success of the above program would, for us, change this hypothesis not so much to a definition or to an axiom but to a ''natural law''. Only so, it seems to the writer, can [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] theorem ... and Church's results ... be transformed into conclusions concerning all symbolic logics and all methods of solvability."&lt;ref&gt;Italics in original, Post in (Davis 1965:291)&lt;/ref&gt;

This contentious stance finds grumpy expression in [[Alan Turing]] 1939, and it will reappear with Gödel, [[Robin Gandy|Gandy]], and Sieg.

==Turing and computability==
[[Alan Turing|A. M. Turing's]] paper [http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/e-library/sources/tp2-ie.pdf ''On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem''] was delivered to the London Mathematical Society in November 1936. Again the reader must bear in mind a caution: as used by Turing, the word "computer" is a human being, and the action of a "computer" he calls "computing"; for example, he states "Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper" (p.&amp;nbsp;135). ''But'' he uses the word "computation"&lt;ref name=Turing118&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:118)&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of his machine-definition, and his definition of "computable" numbers is as follows:
:"The "computable" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means ... .According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:116)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is Turing's definition of his "machine?" Turing gives two definitions, the first a summary in ''§1 Computing machines'' and another very similar in §9.I derived from his more detailed analysis of the actions a human "computer". With regards to his definition §1 he says that "justification lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily limited",&lt;ref name=Turing117&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:117)&lt;/ref&gt; and he concludes §1 with the bald assertion of his proposed machine with his use of the word "all"

:"It is my contention that these operations [write symbol on tape-square, erase symbol, shift ''one'' square left, shift ''one'' square right, scan square for symbol and change machine-configuration as a consequence of ''one'' scanned symbol] include all those which are used in the computation of a number."&lt;ref name="Turing118"/&gt;

The emphasis of the word one in the above brackets is intentional. With regards to §9.I he allows the machine to examine ''more'' squares; it is this more-square sort of behavior that he claims typifies the actions of a computer (person):
:"The machine scans B squares corresponding to the B squares observed by the computer. In any move the machine can change a symbol on a scanned square or can change any one of the scanned squares to another square distant not more than L squares from one of the other scanned squares ... The machines just described do not differ very essentially from computing machines as defined in §2 [sic], and corresponding to any machine of this type a computing machine can be constructed to compute the same sequence, that is to say the sequence computed by the computer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:138)&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing goes on to define a "computing machine" in §2 is (i) "a-machine" ("automatic machine") as defined in §1 with the added restriction (ii): (ii) It prints two kinds of symbols – figures 0 and 1 – and other symbols. The figures 0 and 1 will represent "the sequence computed by the machine".&lt;ref name="Turing118"/&gt;

Furthermore, to define the if the ''number'' is to be considered "computable", the machine must print an infinite number of 0's and 1's; if not it is considered to be "circular"; otherwise it is considered to be "circle-free":
:"A number is computable if it differs by an integer from the number computed by a circle-free machine." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:119)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he doesn't call it his "thesis", Turing proposes a proof that his "computability" is equivalent to [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] "effective calculability":
:"In a recent paper Alonzo Church has introduced an idea of "effective calculability", which is equivalent to my "computability", but is very differently defined ... The proof of equivalence between "computability" and "effective calculability" is outlined in an appendix to the present paper."&lt;ref name="Turing117"/&gt;

The ''Appendix: Computability and effective calculability'' begins in the following manner; observe that he does ''not'' mention ''recursion'' here, and in fact his proof-sketch has his machine munch strings of symbols in the λ-calculus and the calculus munch "complete configurations" of his machine, and nowhere is recursion mentioned. The proof of the equivalence of machine-computability and recursion must wait for [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] 1943 and 1952:
:"The theorem that all effectively calculable (λ-definable) sequences are computable and its converse are proved below in outline."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:149)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandy (1960) seems to confuse this bold proof-sketch with [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]; see 1960 and 1995 below. Moreover a careful reading of Turing's definitions leads the reader to observe that Turing was asserting that the "operations" of his proposed machine in §1 are ''sufficient'' to compute ''any'' computable number, and the machine that imitates the action of a human "computer" as presented in §9.I is a variety of this proposed machine. This point will be reiterated by Turing in 1939.

==Turing identifies effective calculability with machine computation==
[[Alan Turing|Alan Turing's]] massive Princeton PhD thesis (under [[Alonzo Church]]) appears as ''Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals''. In it he summarizes the quest for a definition of "effectively calculable". He proposes a '''definition''' as shown in the boldface type that specifically identifies (renders identical) the notions of "machine computation" and "effectively calculable".

:"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematically expressible definition. Such a definition was first given by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] at Princeton in 1934 ... . These functions are described as "general recursive" by Gödel ... .  Another definition of effective calculability has been given by Church ... who identifies it with λ-definability. The author has recently suggested a definition corresponding more closely to the intuitive idea (Turing [1], see also [[Emil Leon Post|Post's]] [1]). It was stated above that '''"a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process". We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine'''. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to '''the author's definition of a computable function''', and to '''an identification of computability † with effective calculability'''. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene [3], Turing [2]&lt;/ref&gt;
::"† We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions. We do not restrict the values taken by a computable function to be natural numbers; we may for instance have computable [[propositional function]]s."&lt;ref&gt;boldface added, Turing 1939 in (Davis 1965:160)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a powerful expression. because "identicality" is actually an unequivocal statement of necessary and sufficient conditions, in other words there are no other contingencies to the identification" except what interpretation is given to the words "function", "machine", "computable", and "effectively calculable":
:: For all functions: IF "this function is computable by machine" THEN "this function is effectively calculable" AND IF "this function is effectively calculable" THEN "this function is computable by a machine."

==Rosser: recursion, λ-calculus, and Turing-machine computation identity==
J. B. Rosser's paper ''An Informal Exposition of Proofs of Gödel's Theorem and Church's Theorem''&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:223-230)&lt;/ref&gt; states the following:

:"'Effective method' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The simplest of these to state (due to [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and [[Alan Turing|Turing]]) says essentially that an effective method of solving a certain set of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.

::&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; One definition is given by [[Alonzo Church|Church]] in I [i.e. Church 1936 ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number theory'']. Another definition is due to [[Jacques Herbrand]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. It is stated in I, footnote 3, p. 346. The third definition was given independently in two slightly different forms by E. L. Post ... and A. M. Turing ... . The first two definitions are proved equivalent in I. The third is proved equivalent to the first two by A. M. Turing, ''Computability and λ-definability'' [''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', vol. 2 (1937), pp. 153-163]." &lt;ref&gt;quote and footnote from Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:225-226)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleene and ''Thesis I''==
[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] defines "general recursive" functions and "partial recursive functions" in his paper ''Recursive Predicates and Quantifiers''. The representing function, mu-operator, etc make their appearance. He goes on in §12 ''Algorithm theories'' to state his famous Thesis I, what he would come to call '''[[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]''' in 1952:

:"This heuristic fact, as well as certain reflections on the nature of symbolic algorithmic processes, led [[Alonzo Church|Church]] to state the following thesis&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;. The same thesis is implicitly in [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] description of computing machines&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.

::"''Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive.''

:"Since a precise mathematical definition of the term effectively calculable (effectively decidable) has been wanting, we can take this thesis, together with the principle already accepted to which it is converse, as a definition of it ... the thesis has the character of an hypothesis – a point emphasized by [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and by Church&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.
:::&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Church [1] [''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'']&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936a in (Davis 1965:88ff)&lt;/ref&gt;
:::&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Turing [1] [''On Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem''(1936)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}, in (Davis 1965:115ff)&lt;/ref&gt;
:::&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Post [1, p. 105],&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1936, ''Finite combinatory processes - Formulation 1'', The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Sep., 1936), pp. 103-105&lt;/ref&gt; and Church [2]  &lt;ref&gt;Church, 1938, ''The constructive second number class'', Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. vol. 44, Number 4, 1938, pp. 224-232]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleene and Church and Turing theses==
In his chapter §60, [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] defines the "[[Church–Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]" as follows:
:" ... heuristic evidence and other considerations led [[Alonzo Church|Church]] 1936 to propose the following thesis.
::"Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive.
:"This thesis is also implicit in the conception of a computing machine formulated by [[Alan Turing|Turing]] 1936-7 and Post 1936."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:300-301)&lt;/ref&gt;

On page 317 he ''explicitly'' calls the above thesis "Church's thesis":
:"§'''62. Church's thesis'''. One of the main objectives of this and the next chapter is to present the evidence for Church's thesis (Thesis I §60)." &lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:317)&lt;/ref&gt;

About Turing's "formulation", Kleene says:
:"Turing's formulation hence constitutes an independent statement of Church's thesis (in equivalent terms). [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] 1936 gave a similar formulation."&lt;ref&gt;Post 1936:321&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene proposes that what Turing showed: "Turing's computable functions (1936-1937) are those which can be computed by a machine of a kind which is designed, according to his analysis, to reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform, working according to preassigned instructions." &lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:321)&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation of Turing plays into [[Robin Gandy|Gandy's]] concern that a machine specification may not explicitly "reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform" – i.e. his two examples are (i) massively symbol-parallel computation and two-dimensional computation e.g. [[Conway's Game of Life|Conway's "game of life"]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Gandy 1978 in (Barwise et al 1980:125)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore there may be processes that can "compute more" than a [[Turing machine]] can. See 1980 below.

Kleene defines Turing's Thesis as follows:
:"§'''70. Turing's thesis'''. Turing's thesis that every function which would naturally be regarded as computable under his definition, i.e. by one of his machines, is equivalent to Church's thesis by Theorem XXX."

Indeed immediately before this statement, Kleene states the Theorem XXX:
::"Theorem XXX (= Theorems XXVIII + XXIX). The following classes of partial functions are coextensive, i.e. have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions, (c) the 1/1 computable functions. Similarly with l [lower-case L] completely defined assumed functions Ψ."

==Gödel, Turing machines, and effectively calculability==
To his 1931 paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions'', [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] added a ''Note added 28 August 1963'' which clarifies his opinion of the alternative forms/expression of "a [[formal system]]". He reiterates his opinions even more clearly in 1964 (see below):

:"''Note Added 28 August 1963''. In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that due to [[Alan Turing|A. M. Turing's]] work&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt; can now be given, a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible. That is, it can be proved rigorously that in every consistent formal system that contains a certain amount of finitary number theory there exist undecidable arithmetic propositions and that, moreover, the consistency of any such system cannot be proved in the system.

::"&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; See ''{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}'', p. 249.

:::"&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt; In my opinion the term "formal system" or "formalism" should never be used for anything but this notion. In a lecture at Princeton (mentioned in ''Princeton University 1946'', p. 11 [see Davis 1965, pp. 84-88 [i.e. Davis p. 84-88] ]), I suggested certain transfinite generalizations of formalisms, but these are something radically different from formal systems in the proper sense of the term, whose characteristic property is that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1963 in (van Heijenoort 1976:616)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gödel 1964''' – In Gödel's ''Postscriptum'' to his lecture's notes of 1934 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study|IAS at Princeton]],&lt;ref&gt;Due to the language difference, Gödel refers to the IAS as "AIS"&lt;/ref&gt; he repeats, but reiterates in even more bold terms, his less-than-glowing opinion about the efficacy of computability as defined by [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] λ-definability and recursion (we have to infer that both are denigrated because of his use of the plural "definitions" in the following). This was in a letter to Martin Davis (presumably as he was assembling ''The Undecidable''). The repeat of some of the phrasing is striking:

:"In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact, that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given, the existence of undecidable arithmetical propositions and the non-demonstrability of the consistence of a system in the same system can now be proved rigorously for ''every'' consistent formal system containing a certain amount of finitary number theory.

:"Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of "mechanical procedure" (alias "algorithm" or "computation procedure" or "finite combinatorial procedure"). This concept is shown to be equivalent to that of a "[[Turing machine]]".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas ... the concept of formal system, whose essence it is that reasoning is completely replaced by mechanical operations on formulas. (Note that the question of whether there exist finite ''non-mechanical'' procedures ... not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of "formal system" and of "mechanical procedure.

:"... if "finite procedure" is understood to mean "mechanical procedure", the question raised in footnote 3 can be answered affirmatively for recursiveness as defined in §9, which is equivalent to general recursiveness as defined today (see S. C. Kleene (1936) ...)" &lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:71-73)&lt;/ref&gt;

::" * See {{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} ... and the almost simultaneous paper by [[Emil Leon Post|E. L. Post]] (1936) ... . As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see A. Church 1936 ..."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:72)&lt;/ref&gt;

Footnote 3 is in the body of the 1934 lecture notes:
:"&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The converse seems to be true, if besides recursions according to the scheme (2) recursions of other forms (e.g., with respect to two variables simultaneously) are admitted. This cannot be proved, since the notion of finite computation is not defined, but it serves as a heuristic principle."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis does observe that "in fact the equivalence between his [Gödel's] definition [of recursion] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene's]] [1936] is not quite trivial. So, despite appearances to the contrary, footnote 3 of these lectures is not a statement of [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:40)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gandy: "machine computation", discrete, deterministic, and limited to "local causation" by light speed==

[[Robin Gandy]]'s influential paper titled ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appears in [[Jon Barwise|Barwise]] et al. Gandy starts off with an unlikely expression of [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]], framed as follows:

:"1. Introduction
:"Throughout this paper we shall use "calculable" to refer to some intuitively given notion and "computable" to mean "computable by a [[Turing machine]]"; of course many equivalent definitions of "computable" are now available.
:"''Church's Thesis. What is effectively calculable is computable.''
:" ... Both Church and Turing had in mind calculation by an abstract human being using some mechanical aids (such as paper and pencil)"&lt;ref&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:123)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Soare]] (1995, see below) had issues with this framing, considering [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper (1936) published prior to [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] "Appendix proof" (1937).

Gandy attempts to "analyze mechanical processes and so to provide arguments for the following:
:"Thesis M. What can be calculated by a machine is computable." &lt;ref&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:124&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandy "exclude[s] from consideration devices which are essentially analogue machines ... .The only physical presuppositions made about mechanical devices (Cf Principle IV below) are that there is a lower bound on the linear dimensions of every atomic part of the device and that there is an upper bound (the velocity of light) on the speed of propagation of change".&lt;ref name=Gandy126&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:126)&lt;/ref&gt; But then he restricts his machines even more:
:"(2) Secondly we suppose that the progress of calculation by a mechanical device may be described in discrete terms, so that the devices considered are, in a loose sense, digital computers.
:"(3) Lasty we suppose that the device is deterministic: that is, the subsequent behavior of the device is uniquely determined once a complete description of its initial state is given."&lt;ref name="Gandy126"/&gt;

He in fact makes an argument for this "Thesis M" that he calls his "Theorem", the most important "Principle" of which is "Principle IV: Principle of local causation":
:"Now we come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depended only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the ''principle of local causation.'' Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance."&lt;ref&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:135)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soare==
[[Robert Soare|Soare]]'s thorough examination of ''Computability and Recursion'' appears. He quotes [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] 1964 opinion (above) with respect to the "much less suitable" definition of computability, and goes on to add:
:"[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] wrote [1981b, p. 49], "[[Alan Turing|Turing's]] computability is intrinsically persuasive" but "λ-definability is not intrinsically persuasive" and "general recursiveness scarcely so (its author Gödel being at the time not at all persuaded) ... . Most people today accept Turing's Thesis"&lt;ref&gt;Soare 1996:13&lt;/ref&gt;

Soare's footnote 7 (1995) also catches [[Robin Gandy|Gandy's]] "confusion", but apparently it continues into Gandy (1988). This confusion represents a serious error of research and/or thought and remains a cloud hovering over his whole program:
:"&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Gandy actually wrote "Church's thesis" not "Turing's thesis" as written here, but surely Gandy meant the latter, at least intensionally, because Turing did not prove anything in 1936 or anywhere else about general recursive functions."&lt;ref&gt;Soare 1996:11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breger and problem of tacit axioms==
Breger points out a problem when one is approaching a notion "axiomatically", that is, an "axiomatic system" may have imbedded in it one or more ''tacit'' axioms that are unspoken when the axiom-set is presented.

For example, an active agent with knowledge (and capability) may be a (potential) fundamental axiom in any axiomatic system: "the know-how of a human being is necessary – a know-how which is not formalized in the axioms. ¶ ... Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how with the symbols is impossible ..."&lt;ref&gt;Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:221)&lt;/ref&gt;

He quotes [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]:
: "In a university lecture given in 1905, Hilbert considered it "absolutely necessary" to have an "axiom of thought" or "an axiom of the existence of an intelligence" before stating the axioms in logic. In the margin of the script, Hilbert added later: "the a priori of the philosophers." He formulated this axiom as follows: "I have the capacity to think of objects, and to denote them by means of simple symbols like ''a, b,..., x, y,...,'' so that they can be recognized unambiguously. My thought operates with these objects in a certain way according to certain rules, and my thinking is able to detect these rules by observation of myself, and completely to describe these rules" [(Hilbert 1905,219); see also (Peckhaus 1990, 62f and 227)]."&lt;ref&gt;brackets and references in original, Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:227)&lt;/ref&gt;

Breger further supports his argument with examples from [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) and [[Hermann Weyl]] (1930-1). He goes on to discuss the problem of then expression of an axiom-set in a particular language: i.e. a language known by the agent, e.g. German.&lt;ref&gt;Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, Breger gives a potent example of this in his paper (Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228-118))&lt;/ref&gt;

See more about this at [[Algorithm characterizations]], in particular [[John R. Searle|Searle]]'s opinion that outside any computation there must be an observer that gives meaning to the symbols used.

==Sieg and axiomatic definitions==
At the "Feferfest" – [[Solomon Feferman|Solomon Feferman's]] 70th birthday – [[Wilfried Sieg]] first presents a paper written two years earlier titled "Calculations By Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis", reprinted in (Sieg et al. 2002:390–409). Earlier Sieg published "Mechanical Procedures and Mathematical Experience"  (in George 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;71ff) presenting a history of "calculability" beginning &lt;!-- (approximately) --&gt; with [[Richard Dedekind]] and ending in the 1950s &lt;!-- (approximately) --&gt; with the later papers of [[Alan Turing]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]].  The Feferfest paper distills the prior paper to its major points and dwells primarily on [[Robin Gandy]]'s paper of 1980. Sieg extends Turing's "computability by string machine" (human "computor") as reduced to mechanism "computability by letter machine"&lt;ref&gt;Turing's thesis – cf drawing p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''parallel'' machines of Gandy.

Sieg cites more recent work including "Kolmogorov and Uspensky's work on algorithms" and (De Pisapia 2000), in particular, the [[Pointer machine|KU-pointer machine-model]]), and [[artificial neural network]]s&lt;ref name=Sieg399&gt;Sieig 2002:399&lt;/ref&gt; and asserts:
:"The separation of informal conceptual analysis and mathematical equivalence proof is essential for recognizing that the correctness of ''Turing's Thesis'' (taken generically) rests on two pillars; namely on the correctness of boundedness and locality conditions for computors, and on the correctness of the pertinent central thesis. The latter asserts explicitly that computations of a computor can be mimicked directly by a particular kind of machine. However satisfactory one may find this line of analytic argument, there are two weak spots: the looseness of the restrictive conditions (What are symbolic configurations? What changes can mechanical operations effect?) and the corresponding vagueness of the central thesis. We are, no matter how we turn ourselves, in a position that is methodologically still unsatisfactory ... ."&lt;ref name=Sieg399/&gt;

He claims to "step toward a more satisfactory stance ... [by] abstracting further away from particular types of configurations and operations ..."&lt;ref name=Sieg399/&gt;
:"It has been claimed frequently that Turing analyzed computations of machines. That is historically and systematically inaccurate, as my exposition should have made quite clear. Only in 1980 did Turing's student, Robin Gandy, characterize machine computations."&lt;ref name=Sieg399/&gt;

Whether the above statement is true or not is left to the reader to ponder. Sieg goes on to describe Gandy's analysis (see above 1980). In doing so he attempts to formalize what he calls "[[Gandy machine]]s" (with a detailed analysis in an Appendix). About the Gandy machines:
:"&lt;!-- Let me bring out the central points for Gandy machines. First, --&gt; ... the definition of a Gandy machine is an "abstract" mathematical definition that embodies &lt;!-- generally accepted --&gt;... properties of parallel computations&lt;!-- &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; ... Second, Gandy machines share with groups and topological spaces the general feature of '''abstract axiomatic definitions''', namely, that they '''admit a wide variety of different interpretations'''. Third, &lt;!-- the central fact, that --&gt;... the computations of any Gandy machine can be simulated by a letter machine, [and] is best understood as a representation theorem for the axiomatic notion. [boldface added]

&lt;!-- ::"&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;In (Lamport and Lynch) it is asserted that "the theory of sequential computing rests upon fundamental concepts of computability that are independent of any particular computational model." In contrast, it is claimed, no such fundamental concepts underlying distributed computing have yet been developed. That is followed by some informal observations (p. 1166): "Underlying almost all models of concurrent systems is the assumption that an execution consists of a set of discrete events, each affecting only part of the system's state. Events are grouped into processes, each process being a more or less completely sequenced set of events sharing some common locality in terms of what part of the state they affect. For a collection of autonomous processes to act as a coherent system, the processes must be synchronized ... .
 --&gt;
:"The axiomatic approach captures the essential nature of computation processes in an abstract way. The difference between the two types of calculators I have been describing is reduced to the fact that Turing computors modify one bounded part of a state, whereas Gandy machines operate in parallel on arbitrarily many bounded parts. The representation theorems guarantee that models of the axioms are computationally equivalent to [[Turing machines]] in their letter variety."&lt;ref&gt;Sieg 2002:404&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grave of James Stirling (1692-1770), detail.jpg|thumb|265px|Stirling's grave in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], Edinburgh, detail]]
[[File:Plaque to the Stirlings of Garden, Dunblane Cathedral.jpg|thumb|265px|Plaque to the Stirlings of Garden, [[Dunblane Cathedral]]]]
Stirling was born on 11 May 1692&lt;ref&gt;Monument to the Stirlings of Garden, Dunblane Cathedral&lt;/ref&gt; at Garden House near Stirling, the third son of [[Archibald Stirling, Lord Garden]].

At 18 years of age he went to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where, chiefly through the influence of the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1675–1732)|Earl of Mar]], he was nominated in 1711 to be one of Bishop Warner's exhibitioners (or [[Snell exhibitioner]]) at Balliol. In 1715 he was expelled on account of his correspondence with his cousins, who were members of the Keir and Garden families, who were noted [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], and had been accessory to the "[[Gathering of the Brig o' Turk]]" in 1708.

From Oxford he made his way to Venice, where he occupied himself as a professor of mathematics. In 1717 appeared his ''Lineae tertii ordinis Newtonianae, sive . . .'' (8vo, Oxford). While in Venice, also, he communicated, through [[Isaac Newton]], to the [[Royal Society]] a paper entitled "Methodus differentialis Newtoniana illustrata" (''Phil. Trans.'', 1718). Fearing assassination on account of having discovered a trade secret of the [[glassmaker]]s of Venice, he returned with Newton's help to London about the year 1725.

In London he remained for ten years, being most part of the time connected with an academy in Tower Street, and devoting his leisure to mathematics and correspondence with eminent mathematicians. In 1730 his most important work was published, the ''Methodus differentialis, sive tractatus de summatione et interpolatione serierum infinitarum'' (4to, London), which is something more than an expansion of the paper of 1718. In 1735, he communicated to the Royal Society a paper "On the Figure of the Earth, and on the Variation of the Force of Gravity at its Surface."

In the same year he was appointed manager for the [[Scots Mining Company]] at [[Leadhills]], where the [[Scots Mining Company House]] was built for him in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:732 |title=Scots Mining Company House |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next paper to the Royal Society was concerned, not with pure, but with applied sciences; specifically, a [[trompe]], i.e., a water-powered air compressor that was used by a Scottish lead mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stirling|first1=James|title=A description of a machine to blow fire by the fall of water|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|date=1744|volume=43|pages=315–317|url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/43/472-477/315.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1098/rstl.1744.0069}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is also connected with another practical undertaking, since grown to vast dimensions. The accounts of the city of [[Glasgow]] for 1752 show that the very first instalment of ten millions sterling spent in making Glasgow a seaport, viz. a sum of £28, 4s. 4d., was for a silver tea-kettle to be presented to "James Stirling, mathematician, for his service, pains, and trouble in surveying the river towards deepening it by locks."

Another edition of the ''Lineae tertii ordinis'' was published in Paris in 1797; another edition of the ''Methodus differentialis'' in London in 1764; and a translation of the latter into English by Halliday in London in 1749. A considerable collection of literary remains, consisting of papers, letters and two manuscript volumes of a treatise on weights and measures, are still preserved at Garden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">'''Jordan's theorem''' is a statement in finite [[group theory]]. It states that if a [[primitive permutation group]] ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and contains a ''p''-[[cyclic permutation|cycle]] for some [[prime number]] ''p'' &lt; ''n'' &amp;minus; 2, then ''G'' is either the whole symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or the [[alternating group]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The statement can be generalized to the case that ''p'' is a [[prime power]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4757">: ''This page is about Lagrange reversion. For inversion, see [[Lagrange inversion theorem]].''

In [[mathematics]], the '''Lagrange reversion theorem''' gives [[Series (mathematics)|series]] or [[formal power series]] expansions of certain [[implicitly defined function]]s; indeed, of compositions with such functions.

Let ''v'' be a function of ''x'' and ''y'' in terms of another function ''f'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;v=x+yf(v)&lt;/math&gt;
Then for any function ''g'', for small enough ''y'':
:&lt;math&gt;g(v)=g(x)+\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{y^k}{k!}\left(\frac\partial{\partial x}\right)^{k-1}\left(f(x)^kg'(x)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''g'' is the identity, this becomes
:&lt;math&gt;v=x+\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{y^k}{k!}\left(\frac\partial{\partial x}\right)^{k-1}\left(f(x)^k\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In 1770, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (1736–1813) published his power series solution of the implicit equation for ''v'' mentioned above. However, his solution used cumbersome series expansions of logarithms.&lt;ref&gt;Lagrange, Joseph Louis (1770) "Nouvelle méthode pour résoudre les équations littérales par le moyen des séries," ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Berlin'', vol. 24, pages 251–326. (Available on-line at: http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=41070 .)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lagrange, Joseph Louis, ''Oeuvres'', [Paris, 1869], Vol. 2, page 25; Vol. 3, pages 3–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) published a simpler proof of the theorem, which was based on relations between partial derivatives with respect to the variable x and the parameter y.&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, Pierre Simon de (1777) "Mémoire sur l'usage du calcul aux différences partielles dans la théories des suites," ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences de Paris,'' vol. , pages 99–122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, Pierre Simon de, ''Oeuvres'' [Paris, 1843], Vol. 9, pages 313–335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laplace's proof is presented in:
*Goursat, Édouard, ''A Course in Mathematical Analysis'' (translated by E.R. Hedrick and O. Dunkel) [N.Y., N.Y.: Dover, 1959], Vol. I, pages 404–405.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Hermite]] (1822–1901) presented the most straightforward proof of the theorem by using contour integration.&lt;ref&gt;Hermite, Charles (1865) "Sur quelques développements en série de fonctions de plusieurs variables," ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences des Paris'', vol. 60, pages 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermite, Charles, ''Oeuvres'' [Paris, 1908], Vol. 2, pages 319–346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermite's proof is presented in:
*Goursat, Édouard, ''A Course in Mathematical Analysis'' (translated by E. R. Hedrick and O. Dunkel) [N.Y., N.Y.: Dover, 1959], Vol. II, Part 1, pages 106–107.
*Whittaker, E.T. and G.N. Watson, ''A Course of Modern Analysis'', 4th ed. [Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1962] pages 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagrange's reversion theorem is used to obtain numerical solutions to [[Kepler's equation]].

==Simple proof==
We start by writing:

:&lt;math&gt; g(v) = \int \delta(y f(z) - z + x) g(z) (1-y f'(z)) \, dz&lt;/math&gt;

Writing the delta-function as an integral we have:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
g(v) &amp; = \iint \exp(ik[y f(z) - z + x]) g(z) (1-y f'(z)) \, \frac{dk}{2\pi} \, dz \\[10pt]
&amp; =\sum_{n=0}^\infty \iint \frac{(ik y f(z))^n}{n!} g(z) (1-y f'(z)) e^{ik(x-z)}\, \frac{dk}{2\pi} \, dz \\[10pt]
&amp; =\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^n\iint \frac{(y f(z))^n}{n!} g(z) (1-y f'(z)) e^{ik(x-z)} \, \frac{dk}{2\pi} \, dz
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The integral over ''k'' then gives &lt;math&gt;\delta(x-z)&lt;/math&gt; and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
g(v) &amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^n \left[ \frac{(y f(x))^n}{n!} g(x) (1-y f'(x))\right] \\[10pt]
&amp; =\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^n \left[ 
 \frac{y^n f(x)^n g(x)}{n!} - \frac{y^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\left\{ (g(x) f(x)^{n+1})' - g'(x) f(x)^{n+1}\right\} \right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging the sum and cancelling then gives the result:

:&lt;math&gt;g(v)=g(x)+\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{y^k}{k!}\left(\frac\partial{\partial x}\right)^{k-1}\left(f(x)^kg'(x)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1943">'''Lev M. Bregman''' (born 31 January 1941 in Leningrad) is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Israel]]i mathematician, most known for the [[Bregman divergence]] named after him.

Bregman received his M. Sc. in  mathematics in 1963 at [[Leningrad University]] and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1966 at the same institution, under the direction of his advisor Prof. [[J. V. Romanovsky]], for his thesis about relaxation methods for finding a common point of convex sets, which led to one of his most well-known publications.&lt;ref&gt;Brègman, L. M. A relaxation method of finding a common point of convex sets and its application to the solution of problems in convex programming. (Russian) Ž. Vyčisl. Mat. i Mat. Fiz. 7 1967 620–631.  MR215617 (35 #6457) 90.60 (65.00)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bregman's Theorem]], proving a 1963 conjecture of Henryk Minc, gives an upper bound on the permanent of a 0-1 matrix.

Bregman is currently employed at the [[Institute for Industrial Mathematics]], Beer-Sheva, Israel, after having spent one year at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], Beer-Sheva. Formerly, during 1966-1991, he was senior researcher at University of Leningrad.

Bregman is author of several text books and dozens of publications in international journals.

==Education and career==
Bhargava was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada to immigrant parents from [[India]] and he grew up primarily in [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  His mother Mira Bhargava, a mathematician at [[Hofstra University]], was his first mathematics teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/play-fields-math |title=At Play in the Fields of Math |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rediff.com/specials/2009/mar/21/fareed-zakaria-is-india-abroad-person-of-the-year.htm |title=Fareed Zakaria is India Abroad Person of the Year&amp;nbsp;— Rediff.com India News |publisher=News.rediff.com |date=2009-03-21 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed all of his high school math and computer science courses by age 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaabroad-digital.com/indiaabroad/personoftheyear/?pg=29 |title=India Abroad&amp;nbsp;— Archives 2003-2008 |publisher=Indiaabroad-digital.com |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Plainedge High School]] in [[North Massapequa, New York|North Massapequa]], and graduated in 1992 as the class [[valedictorian]]. He obtained his B.A. from [[Harvard University]] in 1996. For his research as an undergraduate, he was awarded the 1996 [[Morgan Prize]]. Bhargava went on to receive his doctorate from Princeton in 2001, supervised by [[Andrew Wiles]] and funded by a [[Hertz Fellowship]]. He was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 2001-02,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/ |title=Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars |publisher=Ias.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Harvard University in 2002-03. Princeton appointed him as a tenured Full Professor in 2003. He was appointed to the Stieltjes Chair in [[Leiden University]] in 2010.

Bhargava is also an accomplished [[tabla]] player, having studied under gurus such as [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/03/1208/1b.shtml |title=Bhargava strikes balance among many interests |publisher=Princeton.edu |date=2003-12-08 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied [[Sanskrit]] from his grandfather Purushottam Lal Bhargava,  a well-known scholar of Sanskrit and ancient Indian history.&lt;ref name="Fields Medal Winner Bhargava"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fields-medal-winner-bhargava-2014-8 |title=Fields Medal Winner Bhargava |publisher=Business Insider |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an admirer of Sanskrit poetry.&lt;ref name="TOI-20140818"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Interest-at-home-among-NRIs-resurrects-Sanskrit/articleshow/40354569.cms|title=Interest at home, among NRIs resurrects Sanskrit|last=Dasgupta|first=Sucheta|date=2014-08-18|work=Times of India|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
His PhD thesis generalized [[Gauss]]'s classical law for [[composition of binary quadratic forms]] to many other situations. One major use of his results is the parametrization of quartic and quintic orders in [[number field]]s, thus allowing the study of asymptotic behavior of arithmetic properties of these orders and fields.

His research also includes fundamental contributions to the [[representation theory]] of [[quadratic form]]s, to [[interpolation theory|interpolation problems]] and [[p-adic analysis]], to the study of [[ideal class group]]s of [[algebraic number field]]s, and to the [[arithmetic theory]] of [[elliptic curve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claymath.org/fas/research_fellows/Bhargava/ |title=Fellows and Scholars &amp;#124; Clay Mathematics Institute |publisher=Claymath.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short list of his specific mathematical contributions are:

*Fourteen new Gauss-style composition laws.
*Determination of the asymptotic density of [[discriminant]]s of quartic and [[number field|quintic number field]]s.
*Proofs of the first known cases of the [[Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet heuristics]] for [[ideal class group|class groups]].
*Proof of the [[15 theorem]], including an extension of the theorem to other number sets such as the odd numbers and the [[prime number]]s.

In financial [[econometrics]], the '''Markov-switching multifractal (MSM)''' is a model of asset returns developed by [[Laurent-Emmanuel Calvet|Laurent E. Calvet]] and Adlai J. Fisher that incorporates [[Stochastic Volatility|stochastic volatility]] components of [[Homogeneity (statistics)|heterogeneous durations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Calvet | first1 = L. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1016/S0304-4076(01)00069-0 | title = Forecasting multifractal volatility | journal = Journal of Econometrics | volume = 105 | pages = 27 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CF2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Calvet | first1 = L. E. | doi = 10.1093/jjfinec/nbh003 | title = How to Forecast Long-Run Volatility: Regime Switching and the Estimation of Multifractal Processes | journal = Journal of Financial Econometrics | volume = 2 | pages = 49–83 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; MSM captures the [[Outliers in statistics|outliers]], log-memory-like [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] persistence and power variation of [[financial return]]s. In currency and equity series, MSM compares favorably with standard [[Stochastic volatility|volatility models]] such as [[GARCH|GARCH(1,1)]] and FIGARCH both in- and out-of-sample. MSM is used by practitioners in the financial industry to forecast [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], compute [[Value at risk|value-at-risk]], and price [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]].

== MSM specification ==

The MSM model can be specified in both discrete time and continuous time.

=== Discrete time ===

Let &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt; denote the price of a financial asset, and let &lt;math&gt;r_t = \ln (P_t / P_{t-1})&lt;/math&gt; denote the return over two consecutive periods. In MSM, returns are specified as

:&lt;math&gt; r_t = \mu + \bar{\sigma}(M_{1,t}M_{2,t}...M_{\bar{k},t})^{1/2}\epsilon_t, &lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;  are constants and {&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_t&lt;/math&gt;} are independent standard Gaussians. Volatility is driven by the first-order latent Markov state vector:

:&lt;math&gt; M_t = (M_{1,t}M_{2,t}\dots M_{\bar{k},t}) \in R_+^\bar{k}. &lt;/math&gt;

Given the volatility state &lt;math&gt;M_t&lt;/math&gt;, the next-period multiplier &lt;math&gt;M_{k,t+1}&lt;/math&gt; is drawn from a fixed distribution {{mvar|M}} with probability &lt;math&gt;\gamma_k&lt;/math&gt;, and is otherwise left unchanged.

:{| 
|-
| &lt;math&gt;M_{k,t}&lt;/math&gt; drawn from distribution {{mvar|M}} || with probability &lt;math&gt;\gamma_k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;M_{k,t}=M_{k,t-1}&lt;/math&gt; || with probability &lt;math&gt;1-\gamma_k&lt;/math&gt;
|}
 
The transition probabilities are specified by

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_k = 1 - (1 - \gamma_1)^{(b^{k-1})} &lt;/math&gt;.

The sequence &lt;math&gt;\gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; is approximately geometric &lt;math&gt;\gamma_k \approx \gamma_1b^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; at low frequency. The marginal distribution {{mvar|M}} has a unit mean, has a positive support, and is independent of {{mvar|k}}.

==== Binomial MSM ====
In empirical applications, the distribution {{mvar|M}} is often a discrete distribution that can take the values &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2-m_0&lt;/math&gt; with equal probability. The return process &lt;math&gt;r_t&lt;/math&gt; is then specified by the parameters &lt;math&gt;\theta = (m_0,\mu,\bar{\sigma},b,\gamma_1)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the number of parameters is the same for all  &lt;math&gt;\bar{k}&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Continuous time ===

MSM is similarly defined in continuous time. The price process follows the diffusion:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dP_t}{P_t} = \mu dt + \sigma(M_t)\,dW_t,&lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(M_t) = \bar{\sigma}(M_{1,t}\dots M_{\bar{k},t})^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;W_t&lt;/math&gt; is a standard Brownian motion, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; are constants. Each component follows the dynamics:

:{| 
|-
| &lt;math&gt;M_{k,t}&lt;/math&gt; drawn from distribution {{mvar|M}} || with probability &lt;math&gt;\gamma_kdt&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;M_{k,t+dt}=M_{k,t}&lt;/math&gt; || with probability &lt;math&gt;1-\gamma_kdt&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The intensities vary geometrically with {{mvar|k}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_k = \gamma_1b^{k-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

When the number of components &lt;math&gt;\bar{k}&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity, continuous-time MSM converges to a multifractal diffusion, whose sample paths take a continuum of local Hölder exponents on any finite time interval.

== Inference and closed-form likelihood ==

When &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has a [[discrete probability distribution|discrete distribution]], the Markov state vector &lt;math&gt;M_t&lt;/math&gt; takes finitely many values &lt;math&gt;m^1,...,m^d \in R_+^{\bar{k}}&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, there are &lt;math&gt;d = 2^{\bar{k}}&lt;/math&gt; possible states in binomial MSM. The Markov dynamics are characterized by the transition matrix &lt;math&gt; A = (a_{i,j})_{1\leq i,j\leq d} &lt;/math&gt; with components &lt;math&gt;a_{i,j} = P\left(M_{t+1} = m^j| M_t = m^i\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
Conditional on the volatility state, the return &lt;math&gt;r_t&lt;/math&gt; has Gaussian density

:&lt;math&gt; f( r_t | M_t = m^i) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2(m^i)}}\exp\left[-\frac{(r_t-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2(m^i)}\right] .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conditional distribution ===

=== Closed-form Likelihood ===
The log likelihood function has the following analytical expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln L(r_1,\dots,r_T;\theta) = \sum_{t=1}^{T}\ln[\omega(r_t).(\Pi_{t-1}A)].&lt;/math&gt;
 
[[Maximum likelihood estimation|Maximum likelihood]] provides reasonably precise estimates in finite samples.&lt;ref name=CF2004/&gt;

=== Other estimation methods ===

== Forecasting ==

Given &lt;math&gt;r_1,\dots,r_t&lt;/math&gt;, the conditional distribution of the latent state vector at date &lt;math&gt;t+n&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\Pi}_{t,n} = \Pi_tA^n.\,&lt;/math&gt;
 
MSM often provides better volatility forecasts than some of the best traditional models both in and out of sample.

== Applications ==

=== Multiple assets and value-at-risk ===
Extensions of MSM to multiple assets provide reliable estimates of the value-at-risk in a portfolio of securities.&lt;ref name="Calvet 2006 179–215"/&gt;

=== Asset pricing ===
In financial economics, MSM has been used to analyze the pricing implications of multifrequency risk. The models have had some success in explaining the excess volatility of stock returns compared to fundamentals and the negative skewness of equity returns. They have also been used to generate multifractal jump-diffusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Calvet |first1=Laurent E.|last2=Fisher |first2=Adlai J.|title=Multifractal volatility theory, forecasting, and pricing|year=2008|publisher=Academic Press|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=9780080559964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related approaches ==

MSM is a stochastic volatility model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Stephen J|title=Modelling financial time series|year=2008|publisher=World Scientific|location=New Jersey|isbn=9789812770844|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wiggins | first1 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5854">'''Mathnasium''' (also '''Mathnasium Learning Center''') is an education brand and supplemental learning franchise consisting of over 900 learning centers in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia that provides instruction in [[mathematics]] to students in pre-kindergarten through high school. The curriculum employs the Mathnasium Method, a proprietary system that was developed over 35 years by co-founder [[Lawrence Martinek]]. 
==History==
Martinek, a Los Angeles-based mathematics educator, began developing the Mathnasium Method early in his teaching career by writing his own supplemental materials to school curricula. In 1985, Martinek published ''Math Tips for Parents'', a guide for parents and teachers based on his own experiences and his work with his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestmathtips.com/parents/ Math Help, Tutors, Learning Centers, Tutoring Programs and Services &amp;#124; Mathnasium.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Martinek argues that students build confidence and mastery in mathematics through successful encounter and interaction with carefully selected materials. Martinek based the Mathnasium Method on the premise that a student's dislike of math stems from the frustration and embarrassment of not understanding math the way it is taught in the classroom. He emphasizes that an approach combining oral, visual, mental, and written modalities helps children to develop [[number sense]].

Mathnasium was founded in 2002 by Larry Martinek, David Ullendorf, and Peter Markovitz. The first center opened in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]], and continues to be one of a small number of centers owned by Mathnasium, LLC.
In June 2010, Mathnasium announced the opening of the 200th U.S. location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathnasium.com/franchising/press1.html Tutoring Business Franchises &amp;#124; Math, Children and Education Franchise Opportunities &amp;#124; Mathnasium.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224084430/http://mathnasium.com/franchising/press1.html |date=2012-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Mathnasium announced the 300th U.S. location. The 400th location opened in September 2013. There are currently Mathnasium centers in 16 countries.  As of March 11, 2017, there are 800 Mathnasium locations within the United States.

==Programs==
The Mathnasium approach first revolves around an assessment to determine what a student does and does not know. Next, a personalized and prescriptive learning program is made. Each student follows the program with the help of specially trained Mathnasium math instructors who provide instruction and encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shelby-utica.patch.com/articles/kids-learn-math-their-own-way-at-mathnasium Kids Learn Math Their Own Way at Mathnasium - Business - Shelby-Utica, MI Patch]&lt;/ref&gt; For proof of progress, Mathnasium relies on the students' report cards, independent tests, and parent testimony to measure the speed and magnitude of improvement in math skills, numerical thinking, and attitude. Mathnasium separates levels of instruction into early education, elementary school, middle school, and high school. Students advance to a new level of study when they demonstrate mastery of the subject through completing mastery checks, where students have to answer a worksheet of problems correctly without help from instructors. One instructor typically works with four students at a time, and students are encouraged to bring in homework and get help on it as well. To encourage students, work they complete counts towards prizes, and they also can have chances to be entered into drawings for bigger prizes, such as gift cards. Instructors also grade student work and make sure that each worksheet is correct, which reinforces the Mathnasium method of focusing on getting the process correct.

==Events==
In 2011, Mathnasium hosted a national TriMathlon, a math competition held at 160 participating Mathnasium locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thealternativepress.com/articles/mathnasium-holds-first-trimathlon-day Mathnasium Holds First TriMathlon Day - Chatham NJ News - The Alternative Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Over 4000 students competed in three challenges: The Counting Game, Magic Squares, and the Mental Math Workout. Along with medals and prizes for local 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners, each participant received a certificate for achievement for their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lubbockonline.com/education/2010-10-26/math-triathlon-competitors-took-home-prizes Math Triathlon competitors took home prizes &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; National TriMathlon winners were selected from the top three scores in each grade level from all participating Mathnasium locations. The 12 national winners received honors and more than $10,000 in cash prizes.

In [[mathematics]] and [[computing]], the '''method of complements''' is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in [[mechanical calculator]]s and is still used in modern [[computers]].

The ''nines' complement'' of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number ''y'' (the [[subtrahend]]) from another number ''x'' (the [[minuend]]) two methods may be used:

In the first method the nines' complement of ''x'' is added to ''y''. Then the nines' complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.
 
In the second method the nines' complement of ''y'' is added to ''x'' and one is added to the sum.  The leading digit  '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the ''ten's complement.''

The method of complements can be extended to other number bases ([[radix|radices]]); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, represent negative numbers in base 2 or [[Binary number|binary arithmetic]] and test underflow and overflow in calculation.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.fit.edu/~wds/classes/adm/Lectures/TensComplement.pdf Florida Tech]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Numeric complements==
&lt;!-- linked here from [[Midy's theorem]] --&gt;

The '''radix complement''' of an ''n'' digit number ''y'' in [[radix]] ''b'' is, by definition, &lt;math&gt;b^n-y&lt;/math&gt;.  The radix complement is most easily obtained by adding 1 to the '''diminished radix complement''', which is &lt;math&gt;(b^n-1)-y&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;(b^n-1)&lt;/math&gt; is the digit &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt; repeated ''n'' times (because &lt;math&gt;b^n-1 = (b-1)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}+...+b+1)=(b-1)b^{n-1}+...+(b-1)&lt;/math&gt;; see also [[Geometric series|Geometric series Formula]]), the diminished radix complement of a number is found by complementing each digit with respect to &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt; (that is, subtracting each digit in ''y'' from &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt;).

The subtraction of ''y'' from ''x'' may be performed as follows. 
Adding the diminished radix complement of ''x'' to ''y'' results in the value &lt;math&gt;b^n-1-x + y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b^n -1-(x-y)&lt;/math&gt; which is the diminished radix complement of &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt;, except for possible padding digits &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt;. The diminished radix complement of this is the value &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, adding the radix complement of ''y'' to ''x'' results in the value &lt;math&gt;x+b^n-y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x-y+b^n&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming ''y ≤ x'' , the result will always be greater or equal to &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt; and dropping the initial '1' is the same as subtracting &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt;, making the result &lt;math&gt;x-y+b^n-b^n&lt;/math&gt; or just &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt;, the desired result.

In the [[decimal]] numbering system, the radix complement is called the ''ten's complement'' and the diminished radix complement the ''nines' complement''. In [[Binary numeral system|binary]], the radix complement is called the ''two's complement'' and the diminished radix complement the ''ones' complement''. The naming of complements in other bases is similar.  Some people, notably [[Donald Knuth]], recommend using the placement of the apostrophe to distinguish between the radix complement and the diminished radix complement.  In this usage, the ''four's complement'' refers to the radix complement of a number in base four while ''fours' complement'' is the diminished radix complement of a number in base 5. However, the distinction is not important when the radix is apparent (nearly always), and the subtle difference in apostrophe placement is not common practice. Most writers use ''one's'' and ''nine's complement'', and many style manuals leave out the apostrophe, recommending ''ones'' and ''nines complement''.

The nines' complement  of a decimal digit is the number that must be added to it to produce 9; the complement of 3 is 6, the complement of 7 is 2, and so on, see table. To form the nines' complement of a larger number, each digit is replaced by its nines' complement.

Consider the following subtraction problem:

   873  (x, the minuend)
 - 218  (y, the subtrahend)

=== First method ===
We compute the nines' complement of the minuend, 873. Add that to the subtrahend 218, then calculate the nines' complement of the result.

   126  (nines' complement of x)
 + 218  (y, the subtrahend)

{{=}}
   344
Now calculate the nines' complement of the result

   344 (result)
   655 (nine's complement of result, the correct answer)

=== Second method ===

We compute the nines' complement of 218, which is 781. Because 218 is three digits long, this is the same as subtracting 218 from 999.

Next, the sum of ''x'' and the nines' complement of ''y'' is taken:

   873  (x)
 + 781  (nines' complement of y = 999-y)

{{=}}
  1654  (999 + x-y)
 
The leading "1" digit is then dropped, giving 654.

  1654
 -1000  -(999 + 1)

{{=}}
   654  (x-y-1)

This is not yet correct. We have essentially added 999 to the equation in the first step. Then we removed 1000 when we dropped the leading 1 in the result 1654 above. This will thus make the answer we get (654) one less than the correct answer &lt;math&gt;(x-y)&lt;/math&gt;. To fix this, we must add 1 to our answer:

  654
   +1

{{=}}
  655  (x-y)

Adding a 1 gives 655, the correct answer to our original subtraction problem.

=== Magnitude of numbers ===

In the following example the result of the subtraction has fewer digits than ''x'':

    123410 (x, the minuend)
  - 123401 (y, the subtrahend)

Using the first method the sum of the nines' complement of ''x'' and ''y'' is

    876589 (nines' complement of x)
 +  123401 (y)

{{=}}
    999990
The nines' complement of 999990 is 000009. Removing the leading zeros gives 9 the desired result.

If the subtrahend, ''y'', has fewer digits than the minuend, ''x'', leading zeros must be added in the second method. These zeros become leading nines when the complement is taken. For example:

   48032  (x)
 -   391  (y)

can be rewritten

   48032  (x)
 - 00391  (y with leading zeros)

Replacing 00391 with its nines' complement and adding 1 produces the sum:

   48032  (x)
 + 99608  (nines' complement of y)
 +     1

{{=}}
  147641

Dropping the leading"1" gives the correct answer: 47641.

==Binary method==
{| class="wikitable floatright"
! Binary&lt;br&gt;digit
! Ones' &lt;br&gt;complement
|-align="center"
| 0
| 1
|-align="center"
| 1
| 0
|}
The method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones' complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing '0' to '1' and vice versa). Adding 1 to get the two's complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:

   01100100  (x, equals decimal 100)
 - 00010110  (y, equals decimal 22)

becomes the sum:

   01100100  (x)
 + 11101001  (ones' complement of y)
 +        1  (to get the two's complement)

{{=}}

  101001110

Dropping the initial "1" gives the answer: 01001110 (equals decimal 78)

==Negative number representations==
{{main article|Signed number representations}}

The method of complements normally assumes that the operands are positive and that ''y'' ≤ ''x'', logical constraints given that adding and subtracting arbitrary integers is normally done by comparing signs, adding the two or subtracting the smaller from the larger, and giving the result the correct sign.

Let's see what happens if ''x'' &lt; ''y''. In that case, there will not be a "1" digit to cross out after the addition since &lt;math&gt;x-y+b^n&lt;/math&gt; will be less than &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt;. For example, (in decimal):

   185  (x)
 - 329  (y)

Complementing ''y'' and adding gives:

   185  (x)
 + 670  (nines' complement of y)
 +   1

{{=}}
   856

This is obviously the wrong answer; the expected answer is -144. But it isn't as far off as it seems; 856 happens to be the ten's complement of 144. This issue can be addressed in three ways:
* Ignore the issue. This is reasonable if a person is operating a calculating device that doesn't support negative numbers since comparing the two operands before the calculation so they can be entered in the proper order, and verifying that the result is reasonable, is easy for humans to do.
* Represent negative numbers as radix complements of their positive counterparts. Numbers less than &lt;math&gt;b^n/2&lt;/math&gt; are considered positive; the rest are considered negative (and their magnitude can be obtained by taking the radix complement). This works best for even radices since the sign can be determined by looking at the first digit. For example, numbers in ten's complement notation are positive if the first digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and negative if 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. And it works very well in binary since the first bit can be considered a sign bit: the number is positive if the sign bit is 0 and negative if it is 1. Indeed, [[two's complement]] is used in most modern computers to represent signed numbers.
* Complement the result if there is no carry out of the most significant digit (an indication that ''x'' was less than ''y''). This is easier to implement with [[digital circuit]]s than comparing and swapping the operands. But since taking the radix complement requires adding 1, it is difficult to do directly. Fortunately, a trick can be used to get around this addition: Instead of always setting a carry into the least significant digit when subtracting, the carry out of the most significant digit is used as the carry input into the least significant digit (an operation called an ''[[end-around carry]]''). So if ''y'' ≤ ''x'', the carry from the most significant digit that would normally be ignored is added, producing the correct result. And if not, the 1 is not added and the result is one less than the radix complement of the answer, or the diminished radix complement, which does not require an addition to obtain. This method is used by computers that use sign-and-magnitude to represent signed numbers.....

==Practical uses==
[[File:Comptometer1920Model.jpg|thumb|Comptometer from the 1920s, with nines' complements marked on each key]]
The method of complements was used in many mechanical calculators as an alternative to running the gears backwards. For example:

* [[Pascal's calculator]] had two sets of result digits, a black set displaying the normal result and a red set displaying the nines' complement of this. A horizontal slat was used to cover up one of these sets, exposing the other. To subtract, the red digits were exposed and set to 0. Then the nines' complement of the minuend was entered. On some machine this could be done by dialing in the minuhend using inner wheels of complements (i.e. without having to mentally determine the nines' complement of the minuhend). In displaying that data in the complement window (red set), the operator could see the nines' complement of the nines' complement of the minuhend, that is the minuhend. The slat was then moved to expose the black digits (which now displayed the nines' complement of the minuhend) and the  subtrahend was added by dialing it in. Finally, the operator had to move the slat again to read the correct answer.
* The [[Comptometer]] had nines' complement digits printed in smaller type along with the normal digits on each key. To subtract, the operator was expected to mentally subtract 1 from the subtrahend and enter the result using the smaller digits. Since subtracting 1 before complementing is equivalent to adding 1 afterwards, the operator would thus effectively add the ten's complement of the subtrahend. The operator also needed to hold down the "subtraction cutoff tab" corresponding to the leftmost digit of the answer. This tab prevented the carry from being propagated past it, the Comptometer's method of dropping the initial 1 from the result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/Comptometer-instructions.html Easy Instructions for Operation the Controlled Key Comptometer], Comptometer Division, Felt and Tarrant Mfg. Co., Chicago, 1917, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Curta calculator]] used the method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides along the side of the device. The number on each slide was added to a result counter by a gearing mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating "echelon drum" (a.k.a. "step drum"). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its "6" position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the drum was shifted slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position. This alternate row contained the nines' complement of the digits. Thus, the row of 6 cams that had been in position for addition now had a row with 3 cams. The shifted drum also engaged one extra cam which added 1 to the result (as required for the method of complements). The always present ten's complement "overflow 1" which carried out beyond the most significant digit of the results register was, in effect, discarded.

===In computers===
Use of the method of complements is ubiquitous in digital computers, regardless of the representation used for signed numbers. However, the circuitry required depends on the representation:

* If two's complement representation is used, subtraction requires only inverting the bits of the subtrahend and setting a carry into the rightmost bit.
* Using ones' complement representation requires inverting the bits of the subtrahend and connecting the carry out of the most significant bit to the carry in of the least significant bit (end-around carry).
* Using sign-magnitude representation requires only complementing the sign bit of the subtrahend and adding, but the addition/subtraction logic needs to compare the sign bits, complement one of the inputs if they are different, implement an end-around carry, and complement the result if there was no carry from the most significant bit.

===Manual uses===
The method of complements was used to correct errors when accounting books were written by hand. To remove an entry from a column of numbers, the accountant could add a new entry with the ten's complement of the number to subtract. A bar was added over the digits of this entry to denote its special status. It was then possible to add the whole column of figures to obtain the corrected result.

Complementing the sum is handy for cashiers making change for a purchase from currency in a single denomination of 1 raised to an integer power of the currency's base.  For decimal currencies that would be 10, 100, 1,000, etc., e.g. a $10.00 bill.

==In grade school education==

In grade schools, students are sometimes taught the method of complements as a shortcut useful in [[mental arithmetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Arithmetic and Geometry for Elementary School Teachers | author = Carl Barnett Allendoerfer | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1971 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subtraction is done by adding the ten's complement of the [[subtrahend]], which is the nines' complement plus 1.  The result of this addition used when it is clear that the difference will be positive, otherwise the ten's complement of the addition's result is used with it marked as negative.  The same technique works for subtracting on an adding machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">In [[dynamical systems theory]], an area of [[pure mathematics]], a '''Morse–Smale system''' is a smooth dynamical system whose [[non-wandering set]] consists of finitely many [[hyperbolic equilibrium point]]s and [[hyperbolic set|hyperbolic]] [[periodic orbit]]s and satisfying a transversality condition on the [[stable manifold|stable]] and unstable [[manifold]]s. Morse–Smale systems are [[structural stability|structurally stable]] and form one of the simplest and best studied classes of smooth dynamical systems. They are named after [[Marston Morse]], the creator of the [[Morse theory]], and [[Stephen Smale]], who emphasized their importance for smooth dynamics and [[algebraic topology]].

For Morse–Smale systems on 2D-sphere all equilibrium points and periodical orbits are [[Hyperbolic equilibrium point|hyperbolic]]; there are no [[Separatrix (dynamical systems)|separatrice]] loops.

[[Gradient-like dynamical systems]] are particular case of Morse–Smale systems.

Theorem ([[Peixoto]]). The vector field on 2D manifold is structurally stable if and only if this field is Morse-Smale.

== Examples ==
[[Image:UprightTorusFlowLines.png|thumb|right|Flow lines on an upright torus: the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle points do not intersect transversely, so the height function does not satisfy the Morse-Smale condition.]]
[[Image:TiltedTorusFlowLines.png|thumb|right|Flow lines on a tilted torus: the height function satisfies the Morse-Smale condition.]]
Any [[Morse function]] ''f'' on a [[compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' defines a gradient vector field. If one imposes the condition that the [[unstable manifold|unstable]] and [[stable manifold|stable]] [[manifold]]s of the [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s intersect transversely, then the gradient vector field and the corresponding smooth [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] form a '''Morse–Smale system'''. The finite set of [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of ''f'' forms the non-wandering set, which consists entirely of fixed points.

An '''Oblivious RAM (ORAM) simulator''' is a [[compiler]] that transforms [[algorithms]] in such a way that the resulting algorithms preserve the [[Input/output|input]]-[[output (computing)|output]] behavior of the original algorithm but the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of [[memory]] access pattern of the transformed algorithm is independent of the memory access pattern of the original algorithm. The definition of ORAMs is motivated by the fact that an adversary can obtain nontrivial information about the execution of a program and the nature of the [[data]] that it is dealing with, just by observing the pattern in which various locations of memory are accessed during its execution. An adversary can get this information even if the data values are all [[encryption|encrypted]]. The definition suits equally well to the settings of protected programs running on unprotected [[shared memory]] as well as a client running a program on its system by accessing previously stored data on a [[remote server]]. The concept was formulated by [[Oded Goldreich]] in 1987.&lt;ref name = "G87"&gt;[[Oded Goldreich]]. 1987. Towards a theory of software protection and simulation by oblivious RAMs. In Proceedings of the nineteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (STOC '87), Alfred V. Aho (Ed.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 182-194. {{DOI|10.1145/28395.28416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Early solutions required the server to store  data items and each access to a data item actually required  data requests. Later work of Pinkas and Reinman brought this down to storage and requests, but their solution was insecure but an improvement later made this secure. There is a theoretical lower bound on the number of requests because the overhead arises out of which data oblivious sorting algorithm one chooses.&lt;ref&gt;Elette Boyle and [[Moni Naor]]. 2016. Is There an Oblivious RAM Lower Bound?. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS '16). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 357-368. {{DOI|10.1145/2840728.2840761}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Definition==

A [[Turing machine]] (TM), the mathematical abstraction of a real computer (program), is said to be [[Turing machine equivalents#Oblivious Turing machines|oblivious]] if for any two inputs of the same length, the motions of the tape heads remain the same. [[Nick Pippenger|Pippenger]] and Fischer&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Pippenger and Michael J. Fischer. 1979. Relations among complexity measures. Journal of ACM. DOI = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=322138&lt;/ref&gt; proved that every TM with running time &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt; can be made oblivious and that the running time of the oblivious TM is &lt;math&gt;O(T(n)\log T(n))&lt;/math&gt;. A more realistic model of computation is the [[RAM model]]. In the RAM model of computation, there is a [[CPU]] that can execute the basic mathematical, logical and control instructions. The CPU is also associated with a few [[Processor register|registers]] and a physical random access [[memory]], where it stores the operands of its instructions. The CPU in addition has instructions to read the contents of a memory cell and write a specific value to a memory cell. The definition of ORAMs capture a similar notion of obliviousness memory accesses in this model.

Informally, an ORAM is an algorithm at the interface of a protected CPU and the physical RAM such that it acts like a RAM to the CPU by querying the physical RAM for the CPU while hiding information about the actual memory access pattern of the CPU from the physical RAM. In other words, the distribution of memory accesses of two programs that make the same number of memory accesses to the RAM are indistinguishable from each other. This description will still make sense if the CPU is replaced by a client with a small storage and the physical RAM is replaced with a remote server with a large storage capacity, where the data of the client resides.

The following is a formal definition of ORAMs.&lt;ref name="CP13"&gt;Kai-Min Chung and Rafael Pass. 2013. A simple ORAM. IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive. DOI = http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/243&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; denote a program requiring a memory of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; when executing on an input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; has instructions for basic mathematical and control operations in addition to two special instructions &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; reads the value at location &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt; writes the value &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The sequence of memory cell accessed by a program &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; during its execution is called its memory access pattern and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi}(n,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial-time algorithm]], &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is an Oblivious RAM (ORAM) compiler with computational overhead &lt;math&gt;c(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and memory overhead &lt;math&gt;m(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;n\in N&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic RAM program]] &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; with memory-size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; outputs a program &lt;math&gt;\Pi_0&lt;/math&gt; with memory-size &lt;math&gt;m(n)\cdot n&lt;/math&gt; such that for any input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the running-time of &lt;math&gt;\Pi_0(n, x)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by &lt;math&gt;c(n)\cdot T&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the running-time of &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n, x)&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a [[negligible function]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that the following properties hold:
* '''Correctness:''' For any &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and any string &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0, 1\}^*&lt;/math&gt;, with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1- \mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n, x) = \Pi_0(n, x)&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Obliviousness:''' For any two programs &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1, \Pi_2&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and any two inputs, &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2 \in \{0, 1\}^*&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;|\tilde{\Pi}_1(n, x_1)| = |\tilde{\Pi}_2(n, x_2)|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{\Pi}_1}'(n, x_1)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-close to &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{\Pi}_2}'(n, x_2)&lt;/math&gt; in [[statistical distance]], where &lt;math&gt;{\Pi_1}' = C(n, \Pi_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\Pi_2}' = C(n, \Pi_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the above definition uses the notion of [[Information-theoretic security|statistical security]]. One can also have a similar definition for the notion of [[Semantic security|computational security]].

==History of ORAMs==

ORAMs were introduced by [[Oded Goldreich|Goldreich]] and [[Rafail Ostrovsky|Ostrovsky]]&lt;ref name = "G87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O90"&gt;Rafail  Ostrovsky.   Efficient  computation  on  oblivious  rams.   In Proceedings  of the 22nd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, May 13–17, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GO96"&gt;Oded Goldreich and Rafail Ostrovsky.  Software protection and simulation on oblivious rams. Journal of ACM.1996&lt;/ref&gt; where in the key motivation was stated as software protection from an adversary who can observe the memory access pattern (but not the contents of the memory).

The main result in this work&lt;ref name="GO96"/&gt; is that there exists an ORAM compiler that uses &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; server space and incurs a running time overhead of &lt;math&gt;2^{O(\sqrt{\log n \log \log n})}&lt;/math&gt; when making a program that uses &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; memory cells oblivious. This work initiated a series of works in the construction of oblivious RAMs that is going on till date. There are several attributes that need to be considered when we compare various ORAM constructions. The most important parameters of an ORAM construction are the amounts of client storage, the amount of server storage and the time overhead in making one memory access. Based on these attributes, the construction of Kushilevitz et al.&lt;ref name="KLO12"&gt;Eyal Kushilevitz, Steve Lu, and Rafail Ostrovsky.  On the (in) security of hash-based oblivious ram and a new balancing scheme.  In Proceedings of the twenty-third  annual  ACM-SIAM  symposium  on  Discrete  Algorithms. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; is the best known ORAM construction. It achieves &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; client storage, &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; server storage and &lt;math&gt;o(\log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; access overhead.

Another important attribute of an ORAM construction is whether the access overhead is [[amortized]] or [[worst-case]]. Several of the earlier ORAM constructions have good amortized access overhead guarantees, but have &lt;math&gt;\Omega(N)&lt;/math&gt; worst-case access overheads. Some of the ORAM constructions with [[Time complexity#Polylogarithmic time|polylogarithmic]] worst-case computational overheads are.&lt;ref name ="KLO12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OS97"&gt;Rafail Ostrovsky and Victor Shoup.  Private information storage (extended abstract).   In Proceedings  of  the  Twenty-Ninth  Annual  ACM  Symposium  on  the Theory  of  Computing. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="SCSL11"&gt;Elaine Shi, T-H Hubert Chan,  Emil Stefanov,  and Mingfei Li.  Oblivious ram with &lt;math&gt;O((\log n)^3)&lt;/math&gt; worst-case cost. In Advances in Cryptology. ASIACRYPT 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="GMOT11"&gt;Michael T. Goodrich,  Michael  Mitzenmacher,  Olga  Ohrimenko,  and  Roberto Tamassia.  Oblivious ram simulation with efficient worst-case access overhead. In Proceedings of the 3rd ACM workshop on Cloud computing security workshop. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="CLP14"&gt;Kai-Min  Chung,  Zhenming  Liu,  and  Rafael  Pass.   Statistically-secure  ORAM with  &lt;math&gt;\tilde{O}(\log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt;  overhead.   In Advances  in  Cryptology  -  ASIACRYPT  2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The constructions of&lt;ref name ="G87" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="O90" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="GO96" /&gt; were for the random oracle model, where the client assumes access to an oracle that behaves like a random function and returns consistent answers for repeated queries. They also noted that this oracle could be replaced by a pseudorandom function whose seed is a secret key stored by the client, if one assumes the existence of one-way functions. The papers&lt;ref name ="A10"&gt;Miklos Ajtai. Oblivious rams without cryptographic assumptions. In Proceedings of the 42nd ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="DMN11"&gt;Ivan  Damgard, Sigurd  Meldgaard, and Jesper Buus  Nielsen. Perfectly secure oblivious RAM without random oracles. In Theory of  Cryptography Conference,  TCC. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; were aimed at removing this assumption completely. The authors of&lt;ref name = "DMN11" /&gt; also achieve an access overhead of &lt;math&gt;O(\log^3 n)&lt;/math&gt;, which is just a log-factor away from the best known ORAM access overhead.

While most of the earlier works focus on proving security computationally, there are more recent works&lt;ref name ="CP13" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="SCSL11" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="A10" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="DMN11" /&gt; that use the stronger statistical notion of security.

One of the only known lower bounds on the access overhead of ORAMs is due to Goldreich et al.&lt;ref name ="GO96" /&gt; They show a &lt;math&gt;\Omega(\log{n})&lt;/math&gt; lower bound for ORAM access overhead, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the data size. There is also a conditional lower bound on the access overhead of ORAMs due to Boyle et al.&lt;ref name ="BN16"&gt;Elette Boyle and Moni Naor.  Is there an oblivious RAM lower bound?  In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; that relates this quantity with that of the size of sorting networks.

==ORAM Constructions==

===Trivial construction===

A trivial ORAM simulator construction, for each read or write operation, reads from and writes to every single element in the array, only performing a meaningful action for the address specified in that single operation. The trivial solution thus, scans through the entire memory for each operation. This scheme incurs a time overhead of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; for each memory operation, where {{mvar|n}} is the size of the memory.

===A simple ORAM scheme===

A simple version of a statistically secure ORAM compiler constructed by Chung and Pass&lt;ref name = "CP13"/&gt; is described in the following along with an overview of the proof of its correctness. The compiler on input {{mvar|n}} and a program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} with its memory requirement {{mvar|n}}, outputs an equivalent oblivious program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}.

If the input program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} uses {{mvar|r}} registers, the output program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} will need &lt;math&gt;r+n/{\alpha}+\text{poly}\log{n}&lt;/math&gt; registers, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter of the construction. {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} uses &lt;math&gt;O(n \text{ poly} \log n)&lt;/math&gt; memory and its (worst-case) access overhead is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

The ORAM compiler is very simple to describe. Suppose that the original program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} has instructions for basic mathematical and control operations in addition to two special instructions &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{read}(l)&lt;/math&gt; reads the value at location {{mvar|l}} and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{write}(l,v)&lt;/math&gt; writes the value {{mvar|v}} to {{mvar|l}}. The ORAM compiler, when constructing {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}, simply replaces each {{sans-serif|read}} and {{sans-serif|write}} instructions with subroutines {{sans-serif|Oread}} and {{sans-serif|Owrite}} and keeps the rest of the program the same. It may be noted that this construction can be made to work even for memory requests coming in an [[Online algorithm|online]] fashion.

[[File:ORAM-view.pdf|thumb|The ORAM compiler substitutes the read and write instructions in the original program with subroutines Oread and Owrite.]]

====Memory organization of the oblivious program====

The program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} stores a complete binary tree {{mvar|T}} of depth &lt;math&gt;d=\log (n/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; in its memory. Each node in {{mvar|T}} is represented by a binary string of length at most {{mvar|d}}. The root is the empty string, denoted by {{mvar|&amp;lambda;}}. The left and right children of a node represented by the string &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} thinks of the memory of {{math|&amp;Pi;}} as being partitioned into blocks, where each block is a contiguous sequence of memory cells of size {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}}. Thus, there are at most &lt;math&gt;\lceil n /\alpha \rceil&lt;/math&gt; blocks in total. In other words, the memory cell {{mvar|r}} corresponds to block &lt;math&gt;b=\lfloor r/\alpha \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.

At any point of time, there is an association between the blocks and the leaves in {{mvar|T}}.
To keep track of this association, {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} also stores a data structure called position map, denoted by &lt;math&gt;Pos&lt;/math&gt;, using &lt;math&gt;O(n/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; registers. This data structure, for each block {{mvar|b}}, stores the leaf of {{mvar|T}} associated with {{mvar|b}} in &lt;math&gt;Pos(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Each node in {{mvar|T}} contains an array with at most {{mvar|K}} triples. Each triple is of the form &lt;math&gt;(b,Pos(b),v)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|b}} is a block identifier and {{mvar|v}} is the contents of the block. Here, {{mvar|K}} is a security parameter and is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly} \log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Orammemory.pdf|thumb|An illustration of the memory of the oblivious program showing the binary tree and position map.]]
 
====Description of the oblivious program====

The program {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} starts by initializing its memory as well as registers to {{math|&amp;perp;}}. Describing the procedures {{sans-serif|Owrite}} and {{sans-serif|Oread}} is enough to complete the description of {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}. The sub-routine {{sans-serif|Owrite}} is given below. The inputs to the sub-routine are a memory location &lt;math&gt;l \in [n]&lt;/math&gt; and the value {{mvar|v}} to be stored at the location {{mvar|l}}. It has three main phases, namely FETCH, PUT_BACK and FLUSH.

     '''input:''' a location {{mvar|l}}, a value {{mvar|v}}

     '''Procedure FETCH'''     // &lt;u&gt;Search for the required block.&lt;/u&gt;
          &lt;math&gt;b\leftarrow \lfloor l/ \alpha \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;          // &lt;u&gt;{{mvar|b}} is the block containing {{mvar|l}}.&lt;/u&gt;
          &lt;math&gt;i\leftarrow l\mod \alpha&lt;/math&gt;          // &lt;u&gt;{{mvar|i}} is {{mvar|l}}'s component in the block {{mvar|b}}.&lt;/u&gt;

               Push down this triple to the node {{mvar|N}} that corresponds to the longest common prefix of &lt;math&gt;pos''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt;.
               '''if''' at any point some bucket is about to overflow '''then'''
                    Abort outputting '''overflow'''.

The task of the FETCH phase is to look for the location {{mvar|l}} in the tree {{mvar|T}}. Suppose &lt;math&gt;pos&lt;/math&gt; is the leaf associated with the block containing location {{mvar|l}}. For each node {{mvar|N}} in {{mvar|T}} on the path from root to &lt;math&gt;pos&lt;/math&gt;, this procedure goes over all triples in {{mvar|N}} and looks for the triple corresponding to the block containing {{mvar|l}}. If it finds that triple in {{mvar|N}}, it removes the triple from {{mvar|N}} and writes back the updated state of {{mvar|N}}.  Otherwise, it simply writes back the whole node {{mvar|N}}.

In the next phase, it updates the block containing {{mvar|l}} with the new value {{mvar|v}}, associates that block with a freshly sampled uniformly random leaf of the tree, writes back the updated triple to the root of {{mvar|T}}.

The last phase, which is called FLUSH, is an additional operation to release the memory cells in the root and other higher internal nodes. Specifically, the algorithm chooses a uniformly random leaf &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt; and then tries to push down every node as much as possible along the path from root to &lt;math&gt;pos^*&lt;/math&gt;. It aborts outputting an overflow if at any point some bucket is about to overflow its capacity.

The sub-routine {{sans-serif|Oread}} is similar to {{sans-serif|Owrite}}. For the {{sans-serif|Oread}} sub-routine, the input is just a memory location &lt;math&gt;l \in [n]&lt;/math&gt; and it is almost the same as {{sans-serif|Owrite}}. In the FETCH stage, if it does not find a triple corresponding to the location {{mvar|l}}, it returns {{math|&amp;perp;}} as the value at location {{mvar|l}}. In the PUT_BACK phase, it will write back the same block that it read to the root, after associating it with a freshly sampled uniformly random leaf.

====Correctness of the simple ORAM scheme====

Let {{mvar|C}} stand for the ORAM compiler that was described above. Given a program {{math|&amp;Pi;}}, let {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} denote &lt;math&gt;C(\Pi)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the execution of the program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} on an input {{mvar|x}} using {{mvar|n}} memory cells. Also, let &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi}(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the memory access pattern of &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n,x)&lt;/math&gt;. Let {{mvar|&amp;mu;}} denote a function such that for any &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, for any program {{math|&amp;Pi;}} and for any input &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that &lt;math&gt;\Pi'(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; outputs an overflow is at most &lt;math&gt;\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The following lemma is easy to see from the description of {{mvar|C}}.

;Equivalence Lemma: Let &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt;. Given a program {{math|&amp;Pi;}}, with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1 - \mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the output of &lt;math&gt;\Pi'(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; is identical to the output of &lt;math&gt;\Pi(n,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

It is easy to see that each {{sans-serif|Owrite}} and {{sans-serif|Oread}} operation traverses root to leaf paths in {{mvar|T}} chosen uniformly and independently at random. 
This fact implies that the distribution of memory access patterns of any two programs that make the same number of memory accesses are indistinguishable, if they both do not overflow.

;Obliviousness Lemma: Given two programs {{tmath|\Pi_1}} and {{tmath|\Pi_2}} and two inputs &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2 \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|\tilde{\Pi_1}(x_1,n)| = |\tilde{\Pi_2}(x_2,n)|&lt;/math&gt;, with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1 - 2\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the access patterns &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi_1'}(x_1,n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Pi_2'}(x_2,n)&lt;/math&gt; are identical.

The following lemma completes the proof of correctness of the ORAM scheme.

;Overflow Lemma:There exists a negligible function {{mvar|&amp;mu;}} such that for very program {{math|&amp;Pi;}}, every {{mvar|n}} and input {{mvar|x}}, the program &lt;math&gt;\Pi'(n,x)&lt;/math&gt; outputs overflow with probability at most &lt;math&gt;\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Computational and memory overheads====

During each {{sans-serif|Oread}} and {{sans-serif|Owrite}} operation, two random root-to-leaf paths of {{mvar|T}} are fully explored by {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}}. This takes &lt;math&gt;O(K\cdot\log (n/\alpha))&lt;/math&gt; time. This is the same as the computational overhead, and is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt; since {{mvar|K}} is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

The total memory used up by {{math|&amp;Pi;&amp;prime;}} is equal to the size of {{mvar|T}}. Each triple stored in the tree has &lt;math&gt;\alpha + 2&lt;/math&gt; words in it and thus there are &lt;math&gt;K(\alpha + 2)&lt;/math&gt; words per node of the tree. Since the total number of nodes in the tree is &lt;math&gt;O(n/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, the total memory size is &lt;math&gt;O(nK)&lt;/math&gt; words, which is &lt;math&gt;O(n\text{ poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the memory overhead of the construction is &lt;math&gt;O(\text{poly}\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- 
==Definition==
Suppose RAM: &lt;math&gt;[1, 2, 3, ..., n]&lt;/math&gt;;

Sequence: S= &lt;math&gt;[OP_1, OP_2, OP_3, ..., OP_m]&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;OP_i&lt;/math&gt; is read [address] or write [address, data] operation;

There are various sequences of operations that result in the same configuration of RAM. We want an algorithm that, given sequence S, produces another [[sequence]] S’ that performs the same task in a RAM-Oblivious way. In other words, the access pattern of S' is independent of S. Thus, the RAM is Oblivious RAM.

The definition of a memory oblivious algorithm is as follows: “A program P is ‘memory oblivious’ if the memory access pattern is independent of input S”. Formally speaking, let Access Pattern AP(x) be the sequence of memory accesses for program P with input x.

P is memory oblivious means &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y ((x\neq y)\and(\left\vert x \right\vert = \left\vert y \right\vert)) \Longrightarrow AP(x) \approx AP(y)&lt;/math&gt;

This definition of memory oblivious helps us state the definition of Oblivious RAM problem as: Given a program P, what is the most efficient program Q=P such that Q is memory oblivious. In this case, once the inputs are same, we can get identical outputs.

==Formal Definition==
We begin by defining the access pattern at the sequence of memory locations which the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] accesses during computation. This definition applies also to an oracle-CPU (The CPU interaction with MEMORY is a sequence of triples &lt;math&gt;(i, a, v)&lt;/math&gt; of “instruction”, “address” and “values” respectively).

Definition of Access Pattern: The access pattern, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^k(y)&lt;/math&gt;, of a deterministic &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}} is a sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_1,...,a_i,...)&lt;/math&gt;, such that for every {{mvar|i}}, the &lt;math&gt;i-th&lt;/math&gt; message sent by &lt;math&gt;CPU_k&lt;/math&gt;, when interacting with &lt;math&gt;MEM_k(y)&lt;/math&gt;, is of the form&lt;math&gt;(.,a_i,.)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we can define the access pattern of an &lt;math&gt;oracle-RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on a specific input {{mvar|y}} and access to a specific function {{mvar|f}}.

Considering the probabilistic-RAMs, we define a [[random variable]] which for every possible function {{mvar|f}} assigns the access pattern which corresponds to computations in which the RAM has access to this function.

Definition of Access Pattern of a Probabilistic-RAM: The access pattern, denoted &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y)}&lt;/math&gt;, of a probabilistic-&lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}} is a random variable which assumes the value of the access pattern of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on a specific input {{mvar|y}} and access to a uniformly selected function {{mvar|f}}.

Now, we are ready to define an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;. We define an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt; to be a probabilistic &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; for which the [[probability distribution]] of the sequence of [[memory address]]es accessed during an execution depends only on the [[running time]](i.e., is independent of particular input).

Formal definition of &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;: For every &lt;math&gt;k\in N&lt;/math&gt;, we define an oblivious &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; as a probabilistic-&lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following condition. For every two strings, &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\left\vert {\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_1)} \right\vert&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\vert {\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_2)} \right\vert&lt;/math&gt; are identically distributed then so are &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_2)}&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, the sequence of memory accesses of an oblivious &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; reveals no information about the input( to the &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;), beyond the running-time for the input.

===Oblivious simulation===
Now that we have define both &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;, it is left only specify what is meant by an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;Simulation&lt;/math&gt;of an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; program on an &lt;math&gt;Oblivious RAM&lt;/math&gt;, our notion of simulation is minimal one: it only requires that both machines compute the same function. The &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; simulation presented in the sequel are simulations in a much stronger sense: specifically, they are “on-line”. On the other hand, an oblivious simulation of a &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; is not merely a simulation by an oblivious RAM. In addition, we require that inputs having identical running-time on the original &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt;, maintain identical running-time on the Oblivious &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt;, so that the obliviously condition applies to them in a non-vacuous manner. For the sake of simplicity, we present only definition for oblivious simulation of deterministic RAMs.

Definition of &lt;math&gt;Oblivious&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;Simulation&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt;: Given &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;,  we say that a &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, obliviously simulates &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; if the following conditions hold.

1.    The &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt; simulates &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; with probability 1. In other words, for every input y, and every choice of an oracle function {{mvar|f}}, the output of &lt;math&gt;oracle-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, on input {{mvar|y}} and access to oracle {{mvar|f}}, equals the output of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}}.

2.    The &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt; is oblivious. (We stress that we refer here to the access pattern of &lt;math&gt;RAM'_{K'}&lt;/math&gt; on a fixed input and a randomly chosen oracle function.)

3.    The random variable representing the running-time of &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;  is fully specifies by the running-time &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; (on input {{mvar|y}}).(Here again we refer to the behavior of &lt;math&gt;RAM'_{K'}&lt;/math&gt; on fixed input and a randomly chosen oracle function.)

Hence, the access pattern in an oblivious simulation (which is a random variable defined over the choice of the random oracle) has a distribution depending only on the running-time of the original machine. Namely, let &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y)}&lt;/math&gt; denote the access pattern in an oblivious simulation of the computation of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}}. Then, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal\bar{A}^k(y_2)}&lt;/math&gt; are identically distributed if the running-time of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on these inputs (i,e., &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt;) is identical.

We note that in order to define oblivious simulations of &lt;math&gt;oracle-RAMs&lt;/math&gt;, we have to supply the simulating &lt;math&gt;RAM&lt;/math&gt; with two oracles (i.e., one identical to the oracle of the simulated machine and the other being a random oracle). Besides, these two oracles can be incorporated into one, but in any case the formulation will be slightly more cumbersome.

We need to define the overhead of oblivious simulation.

Definition of Overhead of Oblivious Simulations:

Given &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose that a &lt;math&gt;probabilistic-RAM'_{k'}&lt;/math&gt;, obliviously simulates the computation of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt;, and let y: &lt;math&gt;g: \Bbbk\mapsto\Bbbk&lt;/math&gt; be a function. We say that the overhead of the simulation is at most {{mvar|g}} if, for every {{mvar|y}}, the expected running-time of &lt;math&gt;RAM'_{K'}&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}} is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;g(T)\cdot T&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|T}} denoted the running-time of &lt;math&gt;RAM_k&lt;/math&gt; on input {{mvar|y}}.

===Solution===

====Computer model construction====
* Two parts: [[Computer memory|Memory]] and [[Central processing unit|Processors]]
* Internal memory of process: &lt;math&gt;c\log\left\vert Memory \right\vert&lt;/math&gt;
* Interaction:  &lt;math&gt;fetch(address)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;store(address, value)&lt;/math&gt;
* Processor has access to random oracle
* Computation starts with a program and an input in &lt;math&gt;Memory&lt;/math&gt;
* One step: fetch one cell - update value and Processor memory - store

====Oblivious execution====
We want to hide orders of access to cells of &lt;math&gt;Memory&lt;/math&gt;, thus we define Oblivious Execution as for all programs of size {{mvar|m}} working in time {{mvar|t}}, an order of fetch/store address is the same. The weaker requirement is for all programs of size {{mvar|m}} working in time {{mvar|t}}, order of fetch/store address has the same distribution.

====Basic solution====

=====Naive simulation=====
# We store encrypted pairs(address, value) in memory cells 
# For every fetch/store we scan through all memory. If the address is wrong, re-encrypt and store the data, otherwise, do the job which means encrypt and store the results.
Cost of simulation: &lt;math&gt;tm&lt;/math&gt; time, {{mvar|m}} memory

=====Square root solution=====
We need to protect order of accesses and number of accesses. Because &lt;math&gt;Memory = Main Part (m + \sqrt{m}) \mid Shelter \sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt;, the idea comes that: firstly we divide computation in epochs of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; steps each. Then on each original step, we make one fetch to the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt; and scan through all the &lt;math&gt;Shelter&lt;/math&gt;.

Square Root simulation 
# Store input in the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt;
# Add &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; dummy cells to the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt;
# for every epoch of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; steps
## Permute all cells in the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt;(using [[permutation]] {{math|&amp;Pi;}} from random oracle)
## For each process({{mvar|i}}) scan through the &lt;math&gt;Shelter&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;i-th&lt;/math&gt; element is not founded, fetch it from &lt;math&gt;\pi(i)&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise fetch next dummy cell
## Update(Obliviously) the &lt;math&gt;Main Part&lt;/math&gt; using the &lt;math&gt;Shelter&lt;/math&gt; values
Cost of simulation: &lt;math&gt;t\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; time, &lt;math&gt;m + 2\sqrt{m}&lt;/math&gt; memory

=====Buffer solution=====
Buffer solution refers to Oblivious [[Hash table|Hash Table]]. Suppose we have a memory of initial program: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, v_1), ..., (a_m, v_m)&lt;/math&gt;
# Take a [[hash function]] h : &lt;math&gt;[1...m]\rightarrow[1...m]&lt;/math&gt;
# Prepare &lt;math&gt;m \times \log m&lt;/math&gt; table
# Put &lt;math&gt;(a_i, v_i)&lt;/math&gt; to a random free call in &lt;math&gt;h(a_i)-th&lt;/math&gt; column
# The chance of overflow is less than &lt;math&gt;1/m&lt;/math&gt;
Simulation:
# Construct (obliviously) a hash table
# For every step &lt;math&gt;fetch(i)&lt;/math&gt; of initial program
## Scan through &lt;math&gt;h(i)&lt;/math&gt; column
## Update the target cell
Cost of simulation : &lt;math&gt;t \log m&lt;/math&gt; time, &lt;math&gt;m \log m&lt;/math&gt; memory

====Hierarchical construction====
Data structure : [[Oblivious data structure|Oblivious Data Structure]]
* &lt;math&gt;k-buffer&lt;/math&gt; = table &lt;math&gt;2^k \times k&lt;/math&gt;
* Hierarchical Buffer Structure = &lt;math&gt;1-buffer, ..., \log t-buffer&lt;/math&gt;
* Initial position : input in last buffer, all others are empty

=====Hierarchical simulation=====
Simulation of processing cell {{mvar|i}}:
# Scan through &lt;math&gt;1-buffer&lt;/math&gt;
# For every j scan through &lt;math&gt;h(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;-th column in &lt;math&gt;j-buffer&lt;/math&gt;
# Put the updated value to the first buffer

=====Periodic rehashing=====
Refreshing the data structure:
# Every &lt;math&gt;2^{j-1}&lt;/math&gt; steps unify {{mvar|j}}-th and &lt;math&gt;j-1&lt;/math&gt;-th buffer
# Delete doubles
# Using new hash function put all data to &lt;math&gt;j-th&lt;/math&gt; level
Invariant: For every moment of time for every {{mvar|I}} buffers from 1 to {{mvar|I}} all together contain at most &lt;math&gt;2^{I-1}&lt;/math&gt; elements.

Cost of simulation: &lt;math&gt;O(t \cdot (\log t)^3)&lt;/math&gt; time, &lt;math&gt;O(m \cdot (\log m)^2)&lt;/math&gt; memory

Omitted details: realization of oblivious hashing and random oracle

===Sorting network===
When allowing for parallel comparators, we can trivially sort an array in O(n) time. But there are much better [[sorting networks]]. Optimally, there is a way to getting O(n logn) comparisons in O(logn) parallel time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/800061.808726| title = An {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} sorting network| work = Proceedings of the fifteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing | conference = [[Symposium on Theory of Computing|STOC]] '83| pages = 1–9| year = 1983| last1 = Ajtai | first1 = M. |author-link1 = Miklós Ajtai| last2 = Komlós | first2 = J. |author-link2 = János Komlós (mathematician)| last3 = Szemerédi | first3 = E. |author-link3 = Endre Szemerédi| isbn = 0-89791-099-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

That is, given an open cover of the topological space, there is a refinement which is also an open cover, with the further property that at any point, the intersection of all open sets in the refinement containing that point, is also open.

If the number of open sets containing the point is finite, then their intersection is clearly open. That is, every point finite open cover is interior preserving. Hence, we have the following: every [[metacompact space]], and in particular, every [[paracompact space]], is orthocompact.

Useful theorems:
* Orthocompactness is a topological invariant; that is, it is preserved by [[homeomorphisms]].
* Every closed subspace of an orthocompact space is orthocompact.
* A topological space X is orthocompact if and only if every open cover of X by basic open subsets of X has an interior-preserving refinement that is an open cover of X.
* The product X × [0,1] of the [[Unit interval|closed unit interval]] with an orthocompact space X is orthocompact if and only if X is [[countably metacompact]]. (B.M. Scott) &lt;ref&gt; B.M. Scott, Towards a product theory for orthocompactness, "Studies in Topology", N.M. Stavrakas and K.R. Allen, eds (1975), 517–537.&lt;/ref&gt;      
* Every orthocompact space is countably orthocompact.
* Every countably orthocompact [[Lindelöf]] space is orthocompact.

'''Paul Erdős''' ({{lang-hu|Erdős Pál}} {{IPA-hu|ˈɛrdøːʃ ˈpaːl|}}; 26 March 1913 – 20 September 1996) was a [[Hungarian mathematician]]. He was one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Erdős |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/191138/Paul-Erdos |publisher="Encyclopædia Britannica |author=Paul Hoffman |date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known both for his social practice of mathematics (he engaged more than 500 collaborators) and for his eccentric lifestyle ([[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] called him ''The Oddball's Oddball'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990598,00.html |title=Paul Erdos: The Oddball's Oddball |author=Michael D. Lemonick |date=March 29, 1999 |publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years—indeed, his death came only hours after he solved a geometry problem at a conference in [[Warsaw]].

{{nobr|Erdős}} pursued and proposed problems in [[discrete mathematics]], [[graph theory]], [[number theory]], [[mathematical analysis]], [[approximation theory]], [[set theory]], and [[probability theory]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/191138/Paul-Erdos|title=Paul Erdos &amp;#124; Hungarian mathematician|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his work centered around [[discrete mathematics]], cracking many previously unsolved problems in the field. He championed and contributed to [[Ramsey theory]], which studied the conditions in which order necessarily appears. Overall, his work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics.

Erdős published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime, a figure that remains unsurpassed.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{cite web |title=Facts about Erdös Numbers and the Collaboration Graph |url=http://oakland.edu/enp/trivia/}}, using the Mathematical Reviews data base, the next highest article count is roughly 823.&lt;/ref&gt; He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. Erdős's prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the [[Erdős number]], the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erdős in terms of co-authorships.

==Life==
Paul Erdős was born in [[Budapest]], [[Austria-Hungary]], on 26 March 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Erdos.html |title=Erdos biography |publisher=Gap-system.org |accessdate=2010-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183318/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Erdos.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only surviving child of Anna (née Wilhelm) and Lajos Erdős (born as Louis Engländer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = A. | last2 = Bollobas | first2 = B. | authorlink2 = Béla Bollobás| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1999.0011 | title = Paul Erdős 26 March 1913 – 20 September 1996: Elected For.Mem.R.S. 1989 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 45 | pages = 147 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChernHirzebruch2000-p294" /&gt; His two sisters, aged 3 and 5, both died of [[scarlet fever]] a few days before he was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Erdos.html |title=Paul Erdős |accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were both [[Jewish]] [[mathematics teachers]]. His fascination with mathematics [[child prodigy|developed early]]—he was often left home by himself because his father was held captive in [[Siberia]] as an Austro-Hungarian [[POW]] during 1914–1920,&lt;ref name="ChernHirzebruch2000-p294"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chern|first1=Shiing-Shen|last2=Hirzebruch|first2=Friedrich|title=Wolf Prize in Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSUSUfvT3PoC&amp;pg=PA294|year=2000|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-3945-9|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing his mother to have to work long hours to support their household. He taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around their home. By the age of four, given a person's age, he could calculate in his head how many seconds they had lived.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his sisters' deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them allegedly sharing the same bed until he left for college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoffman|first1=Paul|title="Paul Erdős: The Man Who Loved Only Numbers" video lecture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9634A0iBw7w|website=YouTube|publisher=The University of Manchester|accessdate=2017-03-17|date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Both of Erdős's parents were high school mathematics teachers, and Erdős received much of his early education from them. Erdős always remembered his parents with great affection. At 16, his father introduced him to two of his lifetime favorite subjects—[[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] and [[set theory]]. During high school, Erdős became an ardent solver of the problems proposed each month in [[Középiskolai Matematikai és Fizikai Lapok|KöMaL]], the Mathematical and Physical Monthly for Secondary Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-2001-11.ps |title=Paul Erdős just left town |author=László Babai |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609174744/http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-2001-11.ps |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Erdős entered the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] at the age of 17.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=1999–2003|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=120|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was 20, he had found a proof for [[Bertrand's postulate|Chebyshev's Theorem]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Erdős later published several articles in the monthly about problems in elementary plane geometry. In 1934, at the age of 21, he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Erdős's thesis advisor was [[Lipót Fejér]], who was also the thesis advisor for [[John von Neumann]], [[George Pólya]], and [[Pál Turán|Paul (Pál) Turán]]. Because he was a Jew, Erdős decided Hungary was dangerous and relocated to the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many members of Erdős' family, including two of his aunts, two of his uncles, and his father, died in Budapest during the [[Holocaust]]. His mother survived in hiding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was living in America and working at the [[Princeton Institute for Advanced Study]] at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="documentary"&gt;{{cite video | author=Csicsery, George Paul | title=N Is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős | publisher=Springer Verlag | location=Berlin; Heidelberg |date=2005 | isbn = 3-540-22469-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by his biographer, Paul Hoffman, as "probably the most eccentric mathematician in the world," Erdős spent most of his adult life [[No fixed abode|living out of a suitcase]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=121|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for some years in the 1950s, when he was not allowed to enter the United States based on the pretense that he was a Communist sympathizer, his life was a continuous series of going from one meeting or seminar to another.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During his visits, Erdős expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 20 September 1996, at the age of 83, he had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died while attending a conference in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=C.|first=Bruno, Leonard|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=122|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; These circumstances were close to the way he wanted to die. He once said,

{{Quote|text=I want to be giving a lecture, finishing up an important proof on the blackboard, when someone in the audience shouts out, 'What about the general case?'. I'll turn to the audience and smile, 'I'll leave that to the next generation,' and then I'll keel over.|sign=Paul Erdős|source=Math &amp; Mathematicians: The History of Math Discoveries Around the World ({{ISBN|0-7876-3813-7}})&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;}}

Erdős never married and had no children. He is buried next to his mother and father in grave 17A-6-29 at [[Kozma Street Cemetery|Kozma Utcai Temető]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="agt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agt.bme.hu/varga/foto/izraelita/erdos-p.html|website=agt.bme.hu|title=Erdős Pál sírja - grave 17A-6-29 |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his [[epitaph]], he suggested "I've finally stopped getting dumber." (Hungarian: ''"Végre nem butulok tovább"'').&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His life was documented in the film ''[[N Is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős]]'', made while he was still alive, and posthumously in the book ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]'' (1998).

Erdős' name contains the Hungarian letter "[[ő]]" ("o" with [[double acute accent]]), but is often incorrectly written as ''Erdos'' or ''Erdös'' either "by mistake or out of typographical necessity".&lt;ref&gt;The full quote is "Note the pair of long accents on the "ő," often (even in Erdos's own papers) by mistake or out of typographical necessity replaced by "ö," the more familiar German umlaut which also exists in Hungarian.", from {{cite book |title=Combinatorics, Paul Erdős is eighty |author=Paul Erdős, D.

}}

Possessions meant little to Erdős; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally [[philanthropist|donated]] to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards, to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of "Erdős problems" (see below). He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce "my brain is open", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next.

His colleague [[Alfréd Rényi]] said, "a mathematician is a machine for turning [[coffee (drink)|coffee]] into [[theorem]]s",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html Biography of Alfréd Rényi] by J.J. O'Connor and E.F. Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; and Erdős drank copious quantities (this quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erdős,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Bruno Schechter |title=My Brain is Open: The Mathematical Journeys of Paul Erdős |year=2000 |page=155 |isbn=0-684-85980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Erdős himself ascribed it to Rényi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul Erdős |title=Child Prodigies |journal=Mathematics Competitions |volume=8 |url=http://www.amt.edu.au/mc19951erdos.pdf |accessdate=2012-07-17 |number=1 |year=1995 |pages=7–15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324221556/http://www.amt.edu.au/mc19951erdos.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). After 1971 he also took [[amphetamine]]s, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom ([[Ronald Graham|Ron Graham]]) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking the drug for a month.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, J. [http://www.untruth.org/~josh/math/Paul%20Erd%F6s%20bio-rev2.pdf Paul Erdos, Mathematical Genius, Human (In That Order)]&lt;/ref&gt; Erdős won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: "Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper."{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his amphetamine use.

He had his own idiosyncratic vocabulary: although an [[agnostic atheist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centenary of Mathematician Paul Erdős – Source of Bacon Number Concept|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/colm-mulcahy/paul-erdos_b_2945871.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2013-04-13|author=[[Colm Mulcahy]]|date=2013-03-26|quote=In his own words, "I'm not qualified to say whether or not God exists.

He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the "Supreme Fascist" (SF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Schechter, Bruce | title=My brain is open: The mathematical journeys of Paul Erdős | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=70–71 | isbn = 0-684-85980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Variety in Religion And Science: Daily Reflections|year=2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595358403|author=Varadaraja Raman|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian [[passport]]s, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to Himself. When he saw a particularly [[mathematical beauty|beautiful mathematical proof]] he would exclaim, "This one's from ''The Book''!" This later inspired a book titled ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK|Proofs from the Book]]''.

Other idiosyncratic elements of Erdős's vocabulary include:&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, chapter 1. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-man.html As included with the New York Times review of the book].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children were referred to as "[[epsilon]]s" (because in mathematics, particularly calculus, an arbitrarily small positive quantity is commonly denoted by the Greek letter (ε))
* Women were "bosses" who "captured" men as "slaves" by marrying them. Divorced men were "liberated."
* People who stopped doing mathematics had "died," while people who died had "left."
* Alcoholic drinks were "poison".
* Music (except classical music) was "noise".
* To give a mathematical lecture was "to preach".
* To give an oral exam to students was "to torture" them.

He gave nicknames to many countries, examples being: the U.S. was "samland" (after [[Uncle Sam]]), the Soviet Union was "joedom" (after [[Joseph Stalin]]), and [[Israel]] was "{{not a typo|isreal}}".

==Career==
In 1934, he moved to [[Manchester]], England, to be a guest lecturer. In 1938, he accepted his first American position as a scholarship holder at [[Princeton University]]. At this time, he began to develop the habit of traveling from campus to campus. He would not stay long in one place and traveled back and forth among mathematical institutions until his death.

In 1954, the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] denied Erdős, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States, for reasons that have never been fully explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Erdos.html |title=Erdos biography |accessdate=2008-11-11 |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland|date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching at the [[University of Notre Dame]] at the time, Erdős could have chosen to remain in the country. Instead, he packed up and left, albeit requesting reconsideration from the U.S. Immigration Services at periodic intervals. [[File:ronald graham couple with erdos 1986.jpg|right|thumb|Counter-clockwise from left: Erdős, [[Fan Chung]], and her husband [[Ronald Graham]], Japan 1986]]

[[Hungary]] at the time was under the [[Warsaw Pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, it gave Erdős the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased in 1956.

The U.S. Immigration Services later granted a visa in 1963 to Erdős and he resumed including American universities in his teaching and travels. Ten years later, in 1973, the 60-year-old Erdős voluntarily left Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Paul Erdős (1913–1996) |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199801/comm-erdos.pdf|volume=45|issue=1|author1=László Babai  |author2=Joel Spencer|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last decades of his life, Erdős received at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the UK [[Royal Society]]. Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the [[University of Waterloo]] over what he considered to be unfair treatment of colleague [[Adrian Bondy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erdős|first1=Paul|title=Dear President Downey|url=http://ecp6.jussieu.fr/pageperso/bondy/uw/letters/erdos.pdf|accessdate=2014-07-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051015141515/http://ecp6.jussieu.fr/pageperso/bondy/uw/letters/erdos.pdf|archivedate=2005-10-15|format=PDF|date=4 June 1996|quote=With a heavy heart I feel that I have to sever my connections with the University of Waterloo, including resigning my honorary degree which I received from the University in 1981 (which caused me great pleasure).

===Mathematical work===
Erdős was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, comparable only with [[Leonhard Euler]]; Erdős published more papers, mostly in collaboration with other mathematicians, while Euler published more pages, mostly by himself.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffman, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Erdős wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/pubinfo/ |title=Publications of Paul Erdös |author=Jerry Grossman |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly with co-authors. He strongly believed in and practiced mathematics as a social activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | periodical=[[Washington Post]] | author=[[Charles Krauthammer]] | title=Paul Erdos, Sweet Genius | date=September 27, 1996| page=A25 | url=http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~mohar/Erdos.html}} {{cite web |url=http://theory.cs.uchicago.edu/erdos/wash-post2.ps |title= ? |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; having 511 different collaborators in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/thedata/ |title=The Erdős Number Project Data Files |publisher=Oakland.edu |date=2009-05-29 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his mathematical style, Erdős was much more of a "problem solver" than a "theory developer" (see "The Two Cultures of Mathematics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Two Cultures of Mathematics |author= Timothy Gowers |title= Mathematics: Frontiers and Perspectives |editor= V. I. Arnold, Michael Atiyah, Peter D. Lax and Barry Mazur |publisher=American Mathematical Society |year=2000 |chapterurl=http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/2cultures.pdf |isbn=978-0821826973}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Timothy Gowers]] for an in-depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). [[Joel Spencer]] states that "his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Spencer |title=Prove and Conjecture! |journal=American Scientist |volume=88 |issue=6 |date=November–December 2000}} This article is a review of ''Mathematics: Frontiers and Perspectives''&lt;/ref&gt; Erdős never won the highest mathematical prize, the [[Fields Medal]], nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did,&lt;ref name="oakland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/erdpaths/|title=Paths to Erdős - The Erdős Number Project- Oakland University|website=oakland.edu|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pattern that extends to other prizes.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://www.oakland.edu/upload/docs/Erdos%20Number%20Project/trails.pdf "trails to Erdos"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924054224/http://www.oakland.edu/upload/docs/Erdos%20Number%20Project/trails.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}, by DeCastro and Grossman, in ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'', vol. 21, no. 3 (Summer 1999), 51–63: A careful reading of Table 3 shows that although Erdos never wrote jointly with any of the 42 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Fields&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; medalists (a fact perhaps worthy of further contemplation)... there are many other important international awards for mathematicians. Perhaps the three most renowned...are the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, and the Leroy P. Steele Prizes. ... Again, one may wonder why KAPLANSKY is the only recipient of any of these prizes who collaborated with Paul Erdös. (After this paper was written, collaborator Lovász received the Wolf prize, making 2 in all).&lt;/ref&gt; He did win the [[Wolf Prize]], where his contribution is described as "for his numerous contributions to [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[probability]], [[set theory]] and [[mathematical analysis]], and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=23&amp;cat_title=MATHEMATICS |title=Wolf Foundation Mathematics Prize Page |publisher=Wolffund.org.il |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as "outstanding", "classic", and "profound", and the three before as "fundamental" or "seminal".

Of his contributions, the development of [[Ramsey theory]] and the application of the [[probabilistic method]] especially stand out. [[Extremal combinatorics]] owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of [[analytic number theory]]. Erdős found a proof for [[Bertrand's postulate]] which proved to be far neater than [[Chebyshev]]'s original one. He also discovered the first [[elementary proof]] for the [[prime number theorem]], along with [[Atle Selberg]]. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erdős and Selberg.&lt;ref name=goldfeld&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goldfeld | first = Dorian | year = 2003 | title = The Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem: an Historical Perspective | journal = Number Theory: New York Seminar | pages = 179–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2008-45-04/S0273-0979-08-01223-8/S0273-0979-08-01223-8.pdf |first=Nils A.|last= Baas|first2= Christian F.|last2= Skau |journal= Bull.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdős also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as [[topology]], where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a [[Totally disconnected space|totally disconnected topological space]] that is not [[Zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maa.org/features/erdos.html |title=Reminiscences of Paul Erdös (1913–1996) |author=Melvin Henriksen |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erdős's problems===
[[File:Paul Erdos with Terence Tao.jpg|thumb|Paul Erdős influenced many young mathematicians. In this 1985 photo taken at the [[University of Adelaide]], Erdős explains a problem to [[Terence Tao]]—who was 10 years old at the time. Tao received the [[Fields Medal]] in 2006, and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 2007.]]
Throughout his career, Erdős would offer payments for solutions to unresolved problems.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Wittmeier, "Math genius left unclaimed sum," Edmonton Journal, September 28, 2010. [https://edmontonjournal.com/business/Math+genius+left+unclaimed/3589345/story.html?cid=megadrop_story]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ranged from $25 for problems that he felt were just out of the reach of the current mathematical thinking (both his and others), to several thousand dollars for problems that were both difficult to attack and mathematically significant. There are thought to be at least a thousand remaining unsolved problems, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remain active despite Erdős's death; [[Ronald Graham]] is the (informal) administrator of solutions. A solver can get either an original check signed by Erdős before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Erdös's Hard-to-Win Prizes Still Draw Bounty Hunters |author=Charles Seife |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci%3B296/5565/39 |doi=10.1126/science.296.5565.39 |date=5 April 2002 |volume=296 |pmid=11935003 |issue=5565 |pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the [[Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions]]:

{{quote|If the sum of the reciprocals of a sequence of integers diverges, then the sequence contains [[arithmetic progression]]s of arbitrary length.}}

If true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the [[prime number]]s contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the [[Green–Tao theorem]]). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;p. 354, Soifer, Alexander (2008); ''The Mathematical Coloring Book: Mathematics of Coloring and the Colorful Life of its Creators''; New York: Springer. {{isbn|978-0-387-74640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most familiar problem with an Erdős prize is likely the [[Collatz conjecture]], also called the 3''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 problem. Erdős offered $500 for a solution.

===Collaborators===
His most frequent collaborators include Hungarian mathematicians [[András Sárközy]] (62 papers) and [[András Hajnal]] (56 papers), and American mathematician [[Ralph Faudree]] (50 papers).

==Erdős number==
{{Main|Erdős number}}
Because of his prolific output, friends created the Erdős number as a tribute. An Erdős number describes a person's degree of separation from Erdős himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erdős number. Erdős alone was assigned the Erdős number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erdős number of 1, their collaborators have Erdős number at most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erdős number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

and some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erdős number smaller than 8 (not surprising in light of the [[small world phenomenon]]). Due to collaborations with mathematicians, many scientists in fields such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics have Erdős numbers as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/erdpaths/ |title=Some Famous People with Finite Erdös Numbers |author=Jerry Grossman |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[marine navigation]], a '''pelorus''' is a reference tool for maintaining [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of a vessel at sea. It is a "dumb compass" without a directive element, suitably mounted and provided with vanes to permit observation of relative bearings.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The American Practical Navigator/Glossary#P|Pelorus]] entry in [[American Practical Navigator]], from Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;
==Modern use==
In appearance and use, a '''pelorus''' resembles a [[compass]] or [[compass repeater]], with sighting vanes or a sighting telescope attached, but it has no directive properties. That is, it remains at any ''relative'' direction to which it is set. It is generally used by setting 000° at the [[lubber line|lubber's line]]. Relative bearings are then observed. They can be converted to bearings true, magnetic, grid, etc., by ''adding'' the appropriate heading. The direct use of relative bearings is sometimes of value. A pelorus is useful, for instance, in determining the moment at which an aid to navigation is broad on the beam. It is also useful in measuring pairs of relative bearings which can be used to determine distance off and distance abeam of a navigational aid.

If the true heading is set at the lubber's line, true bearings are observed directly. Similarly, compass bearings can be observed if the compass heading is set at the lubber's line, etc. However, the vessel must be on the heading to which the pelorus is set if accurate results are to be obtained, or else a correction must be applied to the observed results. Perhaps the easiest way of avoiding error is to have the steersman indicate when the vessel is on course. This is usually done by calling out "mark, mark, mark" as long as the vessel is within a specified fraction of a degree of the desired heading. The observer, who is watching a distant object across the pelorus, selects an instant when the vessel is steady and is on course. An alternative method is to have the observer call out "mark" when the relative bearing is steady, and the steersman note the heading. If the compass is swinging at the moment of observation, the observation should be rejected. The number of degrees between the desired and actual headings is ''added'' if the vessel is to the ''right'' of the course, and ''subtracted'' if to the ''left''. Thus, if the course is 060° and the heading is 062° at the moment of observation, a correction of 2° is added to the bearing.

The instrument was named for one Pelorus, said to have been the pilot for [[Hannibal]], circa 203 BC.

==Ancient instrument==
[[Harold Gatty]] described the use of a pelorus by [[Polynesians]] before the use of a compass. In equatorial waters the nightly course of stars overhead is nearly uniform during the year.  This regularity simplified navigation for the Polynesians using a pelorus, or dummy compass:&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Gatty]] (1958). ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=r7XDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nature Is Your Guide]'', pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;[Arabs] divided the horizon into 32 points. These points were derived from fifteen stars which rose at approximately equally spaced points of the eastern horizon. The setting points of these stars on the western horizon gave them another fifteen points and north and south brought the total to thirty two.

These accomplished navigators [Polynesians] had names for one hundred and fifty stars. They knew the point on the [[horizon]] where each of these rose, and the time at which it did so. They knew the islands which each passed over.

Many of the peoples in the Pacific used the thirty two point dummy compass…I consider this…proof of the Indo-Malayan origin of the Polynesians.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reading from North to South, in their rising and setting positions, these stars are:&lt;ref&gt;List comes from Tolmacheva (1980:p. 183), based "with some reservations" on Tibbets (1971: p. 296, n. 133). The sidereal rose given in Lagan (2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIOpOb0mpugC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.66]) has some differences, e.g. placing Orion's belt in East and Altair in EbN.&lt;/ref&gt;

The true position of these stars is only approximate to their theoretical equidistant rhumbs on the sidereal compass. Over time, the elaboration of the pelorus points led to the modern [[compass rose]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4155">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''pseudorandom generator for low-degree polynomials''' is an efficient procedure that maps a short truly random seed to a longer pseudorandom string in such a way that low-degree polynomials cannot distinguish the output distribution of the generator from the truly random distribution. That is, evaluating any low-degree polynomial at a point determined by the pseudorandom string is statistically close to evaluating the same polynomial at a point that is chosen uniformly at random.

Pseudorandom generators for low-degree polynomials are a particular instance of [[pseudorandom generator]]s for statistical tests, where the statistical tests considered are evaluations of low-degree polynomials.

==Definition==
A pseudorandom generator &lt;math&gt;G: \mathbb{F}^\ell \rightarrow \mathbb{F}^n&lt;/math&gt; for polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; over a [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; is an efficient procedure that maps a sequence of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; field elements to a sequence of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; field elements such that any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-variate polynomial over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is fooled by the output distribution of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, for every such polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Total_variation#Total_variation_distance_in_probability_theory|statistical distance]] between the distributions &lt;math&gt;p(U_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(G(U_\ell))&lt;/math&gt; is at most a small &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_k&lt;/math&gt; is the uniform distribution over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Construction==
The case &lt;math&gt;d=1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to [[pseudorandom generators for linear functions]] and is solved by [[small-bias sample space|small-bias generators]].
For example, the construction of {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} achieves a seed length of &lt;math&gt;\ell= \log n + O(\log (\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;, which is optimal up to constant factors.

{{harvtxt|Bogdanov|Viola|2007}} conjectured that the sum of small-bias generators fools low-degree polynomials and were able to prove this under the [[Gowers inverse conjecture]].
{{harvtxt|Lovett|2009}} proved unconditionally that the sum of &lt;math&gt;2^d&lt;/math&gt; small-bias spaces fools polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.
{{harvtxt|Viola|2008}} proves that, in fact, taking the sum of only &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; small-bias generators is sufficient to fool polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.
The analysis of {{harvtxt|Viola|2008}} gives a seed length of &lt;math&gt;\ell = d \cdot \log n + O(2^d \cdot \log(\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19676">In [[mathematics]], the '''Riemann series theorem''' (also called the '''Riemann rearrangement theorem'''), named after 19th-century German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]], says that if an [[infinite series]] of real numbers is [[conditionally convergent]], then its terms can be arranged in a [[permutation]] so that the new series converges to an arbitrary real number, or [[divergent series|diverges]].

As an example, the series 1 – 1 + 1/2 – 1/2 + 1/3 – 1/3 + ... converges to 0 (for a sufficiently large number of terms, the partial sum gets arbitrarily near to 0); but replacing all terms with their absolute values gives 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + ... , which sums to infinity. Thus the original series is conditionally convergent, and can be rearranged (by taking the first two positive terms followed by the first negative term, followed by the next two positive terms and then the next negative term, etc.) to give a series that converges to a different sum: 1 + 1/2 – 1 + 1/3 + 1/4 – 1/2 + ... = [[natural logarithm|ln]] 2. More generally, using this procedure with ''p'' positives followed by ''q'' negatives gives the sum ln(''p''/''q''). Other rearrangements give other finite sums or do not converge to any sum.

==Definitions==
A series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; [[convergent series|converges]] if there exists a value &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[sequence]] of the partial sums

:&lt;math&gt;(S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots), \quad S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k,&lt;/math&gt;

converges to &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;. That is, for any ''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0, there exists an integer ''N'' such that if ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''N'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert S_n - \ell \right\vert \le \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

A series [[conditional convergence|converges conditionally]] if the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges but the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left\vert a_n \right\vert&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

A permutation is simply a [[bijection]] from the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[positive integer]]s to itself. This means that if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation, then for any positive integer &lt;math&gt;b,&lt;/math&gt; there exists exactly one positive integer &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma (a) = b.&lt;/math&gt; In particular, if &lt;math&gt;x \ne y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma (x) \ne \sigma (y)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement of the theorem==

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of [[real number]]s, and that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is conditionally convergent. Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a real number. Then there exists a [[permutation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\sigma (n)} = M.&lt;/math&gt;

There also exists a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\sigma (n)} = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum can also be rearranged to diverge to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; or to fail to approach any limit, finite or infinite.

==Alternating harmonic series==

===Changing the sum===
The [[alternating harmonic series]] is a classic example of a conditionally convergent series:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

is convergent, while

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \bigg| \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \bigg|&lt;/math&gt;

is the ordinary [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], which diverges. Although in standard presentation the alternating harmonic series converges to ln(2), its terms can be arranged to converge to any number, or even to diverge.  One instance of this is as follows.  Begin with the series written in the usual order,

:&lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

and rearrange the terms:

:&lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{12} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

where the pattern is: the first two terms are 1 and &amp;minus;1/2, whose sum is 1/2.  The next term is &amp;minus;1/4.  The next two terms are 1/3 and &amp;minus;1/6, whose sum is 1/6.  The next term is &amp;minus;1/8.  The next two terms are 1/5 and &amp;minus;1/10, whose sum is 1/10.  In general, the sum is composed of blocks of three:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2k - 1} - \frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} - \frac{1}{4k},\quad k = 1, 2, \dots.&lt;/math&gt;

This is indeed a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series: every odd integer occurs once positively, and the even integers occur once each, negatively (half of them as multiples of 4, the other half as twice odd integers).  Since

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2k - 1} - \frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} = \frac{1}{2(2k - 1)},&lt;/math&gt;

this series can in fact be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{10} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} - \frac{1}{2(2k)} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \cdots\right) = \frac{1}{2} \ln(2)&lt;/math&gt;
which is half the usual sum.

===Getting an arbitrary sum===
An efficient way to recover and generalize the result of the previous section is to use the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;1 + {1 \over 2} + {1 \over 3} + \cdots + {1 \over n} = \gamma + \ln n + o(1),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;gamma;'' is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]], and where the [[Big O notation|notation o(1)]] denotes a quantity that depends upon the current variable (here, the variable is&amp;nbsp;''n'') in such a way that this quantity goes to 0 when the variable tends to infinity.

It follows that the sum of ''q'' even terms satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2} + {1 \over 4} + {1 \over 6} + \cdots + {1 \over 2 q} = {1 \over 2} \, \gamma + {1 \over 2} \ln q + o(1),&lt;/math&gt;

and by taking the difference, one sees that the sum of ''p'' odd terms satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;{1} + {1 \over 3} + {1 \over 5} + \cdots + {1 \over 2 p - 1} = {1 \over 2} \, \gamma + {1 \over 2} \ln p + \ln 2 + o(1).&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that two positive integers ''a'' and ''b'' are given, and that a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series is formed by taking, in order, ''a'' positive terms from the alternating harmonic series, followed by ''b'' negative terms, and repeating this pattern at infinity (the alternating series itself corresponds to {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} ''b'' {{=}} 1}}, the example in the preceding section corresponds to ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;= 2):

:&lt;math&gt;{1} + {1 \over 3} + \cdots + {1 \over 2 a - 1} - {1 \over 2} - {1 \over 4} - \cdots - {1 \over 2 b} + {1 \over 2 a + 1} + \cdots + {1 \over 4 a - 1} - {1 \over 2b + 2} - \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Then the partial sum of order (''a''+''b'')''n'' of this rearranged series contains {{nowrap|''p'' {{=}} ''a''&amp;thinsp;''n''}} positive odd terms and {{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} ''b''&amp;thinsp;''n''}} negative even terms, hence

:&lt;math&gt;S_{(a+b)n} = {1 \over 2} \ln p + \ln 2 - {1 \over 2} \ln q + o(1) = {1 \over 2} \ln(a/b) + \ln 2 + o(1).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the sum of this rearranged series is

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2} \ln(a/b) + \ln 2 = \ln\bigl( 2 \sqrt{a/b} \bigr).&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose now that, more generally, a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series is organized in such a way that the ratio {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} between the number of positive and negative terms in the partial sum of order ''n'' tends to a positive limit ''r''.  Then, the sum of such a rearrangement will be

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\bigl( 2 \sqrt{r} \bigr),&lt;/math&gt;

and this explains that any real number ''x'' can be obtained as sum of a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series: it suffices to form a rearrangement for which the limit ''r'' is equal {{nowrap|to&amp;thinsp; e&lt;sup&gt;2''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp; 4}}.

==Proof==
===Existence of a rearrangement that sums to any positive real ''M''===

For simplicity, this proof assumes first that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 for every ''n''.  The general case requires a simple modification, given below.  Recall that a conditionally convergent series of real terms has both infinitely many negative terms and infinitely many positive terms. First, define two quantities, &lt;math&gt;a_n^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_n^-&lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}^{+} = \frac{a_n + |a_n|}{2}, \quad a_{n}^{-} = \frac{a_n - |a_n|}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^{+}&lt;/math&gt; includes all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; positive, with all negative terms replaced by zeroes, and the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^{-}&lt;/math&gt; includes all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; negative, with all positive terms replaced by zeroes. Since &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is conditionally convergent, both the positive and the negative series diverge. Let ''M'' be a positive real number. Take, in order, just enough positive terms &lt;math&gt;a_{n}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; so that their sum exceeds&amp;nbsp;''M''. Suppose we require ''p'' terms &amp;ndash; then the following statement is true:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} a_{n}^{+} \leq M &lt; \sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is possible for any ''M''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 because the partial sums of &lt;math&gt;a_{n}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; tend to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Discarding the zero terms one may write

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} = a_{\sigma(1)} + \cdots + a_{\sigma(m_1)}, \quad a_{\sigma(j)} &gt; 0, \ \ \sigma(1) &lt; \ldots &lt; \sigma(m_1) = p.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we add just enough negative terms &lt;math&gt;a_{n}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, say ''q'' of them, so that the resulting sum is less than ''M''.  This is always possible because the partial sums of &lt;math&gt;a_{n}^{-}&lt;/math&gt; tend to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Now we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} + \sum_{n=1}^{q} a_{n}^{-} &lt; M \leq \sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} + \sum_{n=1}^{q - 1} a_{n}^{-}.&lt;/math&gt;

Again, one may write

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} + \sum_{n=1}^{q} a_{n}^{-} =  a_{\sigma(1)} + \cdots + a_{\sigma(m_1)} + a_{\sigma(m_1+1)} + \cdots + a_{\sigma(n_1)},&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(m_1+1) &lt; \ldots &lt; \sigma(n_1) = q.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''&amp;sigma;'' is injective, and that 1 belongs to the range of ''&amp;sigma;'', either as image of 1 (if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0), or as image of {{nowrap|''m''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1}} (if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt; 0).  Now repeat the process of adding just enough positive terms to exceed&amp;nbsp;''M'', starting with {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} ''p'' + 1}}, and then adding just enough negative terms to be less than&amp;nbsp;''M'', starting with {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} ''q'' + 1}}.  Extend ''&amp;sigma;'' in an injective manner, in order to cover all terms selected so far, and observe that {{nowrap|''a''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} must have been selected now or before, thus 2 belongs to the range of this extension.  The process will have infinitely many such "''changes of direction''".  One eventually obtains a rearrangement&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;sigma;''&amp;thinsp;(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  After the first change of direction, each partial sum of&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;sigma;''&amp;thinsp;(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} differs from ''M'' by at most the absolute value &lt;math&gt;a_{p_j}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|a_{q_j}^{-}|&lt;/math&gt; of the term that appeared at the latest change of direction.  But {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} converges, so as ''n'' tends to infinity, each of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_{p_j}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{q_j}^{-}&lt;/math&gt; go to&amp;nbsp;0.  Thus, the partial sums of&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;sigma;''&amp;thinsp;(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} tend to ''M'', so the following is true:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(n)} = M.&lt;/math&gt;

The same method can be used to show convergence to ''M'' negative or zero.

One can now give a formal inductive definition of the rearrangement ''&amp;sigma;'', that works in general.  For every integer ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥ 0, a finite set ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of integers and a real number ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined.  For every ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0, the induction defines the value ''&amp;sigma;''(''k''), the set  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the values ''&amp;sigma;''(''j'')  for ''j''&amp;nbsp;≤ ''k'' and  ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the partial sum of the rearranged series.  The definition is as follows:

* For ''k''&amp;nbsp;= 0, the induction starts with ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; empty and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0.
* For every ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥ 0, there are two cases: if ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤ ''M'', then ''&amp;sigma;''(''k''+1) is the smallest integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥ 1 such that ''n'' is not in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥ 0; if ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; ''M'', then ''&amp;sigma;''(''k''+1) is the smallest integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥ 1 such that ''n'' is not in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt; 0. In both cases one sets

:&lt;math&gt;A_{k+1} = A_k \cup \{\sigma(k+1)\} \, ; \quad S_{k+1} = S_k + a_{\sigma(k+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proved, using the reasonings above, that ''&amp;sigma;'' is a permutation of the integers and that the permuted series converges to the given real number&amp;nbsp;''M''.

===Existence of a rearrangement that diverges===
Let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i&lt;/math&gt; be a conditionally convergent series. The following is a proof that there exists a rearrangement of this series that tends to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (a similar argument can be used to show that &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; can also be attained).

Let &lt;math&gt;p_1 &lt; p_2 &lt; p_3 &lt; \cdots&lt;/math&gt; be the sequence of indexes such that each &lt;math&gt;a_{p_i}&lt;/math&gt; is positive, and define &lt;math&gt;n_1 &lt; n_2 &lt; n_3 &lt; \cdots&lt;/math&gt; to be the indexes such that each &lt;math&gt;a_{n_i}&lt;/math&gt; is negative (again assuming that &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is never 0). Each natural number will appear in exactly one of the sequences &lt;math&gt;(p_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(n_i).&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest natural number such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{b_1} a_{p_i} \geq |a_{n_1}| + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Such a value must exist since &lt;math&gt;(a_{p_i}),&lt;/math&gt; the subsequence of positive terms of &lt;math&gt;(a_i),&lt;/math&gt; diverges.  Similarly, let &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest natural number such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=b_1+1}^{b_2} a_{p_i} \geq |a_{n_2}| + 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and so on.  This leads to the permutation

:&lt;math&gt;(\sigma(1),\sigma(2),\sigma(3),\ldots) = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{b_1}, n_1, p_{b_1+1}, p_{b_1+2}, \ldots, p_{b_2}, n_2, \ldots).&lt;/math&gt;

And the rearranged series, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(i)},&lt;/math&gt; then diverges to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

From the way the &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; were chosen, it follows that the sum of the first &lt;math&gt;b_1+1&lt;/math&gt; terms of the rearranged series is at least 1 and that no partial sum in this group is less than 0. Likewise, the sum of the next &lt;math&gt;b_2 - b_1 + 1&lt;/math&gt; terms is also at least 1, and no partial sum in this group is less than 0 either. Continuing, this suffices to prove that this rearranged sum does indeed tend to &lt;math&gt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==

=== Sierpiński theorem ===
In Riemann's theorem, the permutation used for rearranging a conditionally convergent series to obtain a given value in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; may have arbitrarily many non-fixed points, i.e. all the indexes of the terms of the series may be rearranged. 
One may ask if it is possible to rearrange only the indexes in a smaller set so that a conditionally convergent series converges to an arbitrarily chosen real number or diverges to (positive or negative) infinity. The answer of this question is positive: Sierpiński proved that is sufficient to rearrange only some strictly positive terms or only some strictly negative terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sierpiński|first1=Wacław|title=Contribution à la théorie des séries divergentes|journal=Comp. Rend. Soc. Sci. Varsovie|date=1910|volume=3|pages=89–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sierpiński|first1=Wacław|title=Remarque sur la théorème de Riemann relatif aux séries semi-convergentes|journal=Prac. Mat. Fiz.|date=1910|volume=XXI|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sierpiński|first1=Wacław|title=Sur une propriété des séries qui ne sont pas absolument convergentes|journal=Bull. Intern. Acad. Sci.: Cracovie A|date=1911|volume=149-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This question has also been explored using the notion of [[Ideal (set theory)|ideals]]: for instance, Wilczyński proved that is sufficient to rearrange only the indexes in the ideal of sets of asymptotic density zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilczyński|first1=Władysław|title=On Riemann derangement theorem|journal=Słup. Pr. Mat.-Fiz.|date=2007|volume=4|pages=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipów and Szuca proved that other ideals also have this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filipów|first1=Rafał|last2=Szuca|first2=Piotr|title=Rearrangement of conditionally convergent series on a small set|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|date=February 2010|volume=362|issue=1|pages=64–71|doi=10.1016/j.jmaa.2009.07.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steinitz's theorem ===
Given a converging series {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of [[complex number]]s, several cases can occur when considering the set of possible sums for all series {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;sigma;''&amp;thinsp;(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} obtained by rearranging (permuting) the terms of that series:

* the series {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may converge unconditionally; then, all rearranged series converge, and have the same sum: the set of sums of the rearranged series reduces to one point;
* the series {{nowrap|∑&amp;thinsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may fail to converge unconditionally;  if ''S'' denotes the set of sums of those rearranged series that converge, then, either the set ''S'' is a line ''L'' in the complex plane&amp;nbsp;'''C''', of the form

::&lt;math&gt;L = \{a + t b : t \in \mathbf{R} \}, \quad a, b \in \mathbf{C}, \ b \ne 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:or the set ''S'' is the whole complex plane&amp;nbsp;'''C'''.

More generally, given a converging series of vectors in a finite-dimensional real [[vector space]] ''E'', the set of sums of converging rearranged series is an [[Affine space|affine subspace]] of&amp;nbsp;''E''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3889">[[File:Schmidtnet.svg|thumb|right|Schmidt net, used for making plots of the Lambert azimuthal projection.]]
The '''Schmidt net''' is a manual drafting method for the [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection]] using graph paper. It results in one lateral hemisphere of the Earth with the grid of [[circle of latitude|parallels]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]s. The method is common in the geophysical sciences.

==Construction==
In the figure, the area-preserving property of the projection can be seen by comparing a grid sector near the center of the net with one at the far right of the net. The two sectors have the same area on the sphere and the same area on the disk. The angle-distorting property can be seen by examining the grid lines; most of them do not intersect at right angles on the Schmidt net. A single Schmidt net can only represent one hemisphere of the earth; typically a pair of Schmidt nets is used to represent both sides of the globe.

It is relatively simple to re-plot a gridded map of the world onto a Schmidt net if the azimuth is chosen to be the junction of the equator with any particular meridian from the world-map's grid. Each grid square surrounding this chosen longitude is simply re-plotted into the corresponding distorted grid-square in the Schmidt net. Points of latitude-longitude can be plotted relative to the azimuth's longitude, interpolating between grid lines in the Schmidt net. For greater accuracy, it is helpful to have a net with finer spacing than 10°; spacings of 2° are common.

[[File:Schmidtnetanimation.gif|thumb|left|Animation demonstrating the alternative use of a Schmidt net to produce a Lambert equal-area projection using a polar azimuth.]]
The Schmidt net is not an appropriate grid for representing the Earth's northern or southern hemisphere (because the lines would not correspond to meridians or parallels in such a projection). However, it can be used as a scalar measuring device for projecting latitude-longitude points onto a blank circle of the same size, to produce a Lambert equal-area projection with the azimuth at the north or south pole. The intersection of the parallels with the outer circle can be used as a ''de facto'' protractor for plotting a point's longitude as the angle in the polar projection. The Schmidt net's horizontal axis can then be used as a scalar measuring device to convert the point's latitude (relative to the pole) into a radial distance from the centre of the circle.  Alternatively, the Schmidt net could be replaced entirely with a correctly projected polar grid, and grid squares from a map re-drawn into this disc.

==Use==
Researchers in [[structural geology]] use the Lambert azimuthal projection to plot [[Lineation (geology)|lineation]] and [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] in rocks, [[slickenside]]s in [[Fault (geology)|faults]], and other linear and planar features. In this context the projection is called the '''equal-area hemispherical projection'''. The Schmidt net is often used to sketch out the Lambert azimuthal projection for these purposes.&lt;ref name="borradaile2003"&gt;Borradaile (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the [[Stereographic_projection#Wulff_net|Wulff net]] ("equal-angle projection") is used to plot [[crystallography|crystallographic]] axes and faces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3875">In [[mathematics]], a '''smooth structure''' on a [[manifold]] allows for an unambiguous notion of [[smooth function]]. In particular, a smooth structure allows one to perform [[mathematical analysis]] on the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Callahan, James J.|title=Singularities and plane maps|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=81|year=1974|pages=211–240|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/singularities-and-plane-maps|doi=10.2307/2319521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A smooth structure on a manifold ''M'' is a collection of smoothly equivalent smooth atlases. Here, a '''smooth atlas''' for a topological manifold ''M'' is an [[atlas (topology)|atlas]] for ''M'' such that each [[transition map|transition function]] is a [[smooth map]], and two smooth atlases for ''M'' are '''smoothly equivalent''' provided their [[union (set theory)|union]] is again a smooth atlas for ''M''. This gives a natural [[equivalence relation]] on the set of smooth atlases.

A [[smooth manifold]] is a topological  manifold ''M''
together with a smooth structure on ''M''.

==Maximal smooth atlases==

By taking the union of all [[atlas (topology)|atlases]] belonging to a smooth structure, we obtain a '''maximal smooth atlas'''. This atlas contains every chart that is compatible with the smooth structure. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between smooth structures and maximal smooth atlases.   
Thus, we may regard a smooth structure as a maximal atlas and vice versa.

In general, computations with the maximal atlas of a manifold are rather unwieldy. For most applications, it suffices to choose a smaller atlas. 
For example, if the manifold is [[compact space|compact]], then one can find an atlas with only finitely many charts.

==Equivalence of smooth structures==

Let &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; be two 
maximal atlases on ''M''.  
The two smooth structures associated to 
&lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; 
are said to be equivalent if there is a homeomorphism
&lt;math&gt; f: M \rightarrow M &lt;/math&gt; 
such that &lt;math&gt; \mu \circ f= \nu &lt;/math&gt;.

==Exotic spheres==

[[John Milnor]] showed in 1956 that the 7-dimensional sphere admits a smooth structure that is not equivalent to the standard smooth structure. A sphere equipped with a nonstandard smooth structure is called an [[exotic sphere]].

==E8 Manifold==
The [[E8 manifold]] is an example of a [[topological manifold]] that does not admit a smooth structure. This essentially demonstrates that [[Rokhlin's theorem]] holds only for smooth structures, and not topological manifolds in general.

==Related structures==

The smoothness requirements on the transition functions can be weakened, so that we only require the transition maps to be ''k''-times continuously differentiable; or strengthened, so that we require the transition maps to be real-analytic. Accordingly, this gives a [[differential manifold|&lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt;]] or [[analytic manifold|(real-)analytic structure]] on the manifold rather than a smooth one. Similarly, we can define a [[complex manifold|complex structure]] by requiring the transition maps to be holomorphic.

'''STARMAD''' ('''space tool for advanced and rapid mission analysis and design''') deals with the latest trend in the space industry is towards space missions, spacecraft, systems and products, which require quick solutions for system design and software development.

Fundamental aspects are: the capability of minimising the number of steps to perform a complete Space Mission Analysis and Design; the ability to evaluate and display results instantaneously; the possibility to control all complex Space Mission subjects in a concurrent manner.

STARMAD aims to achieve cost reduction and quality improvements by streamlining the design process through improving engineer involvement, and hence his understanding and efficiency in designing a space mission.

== Definition ==
'''STARMAD''' is a Space Mission Analysis and Design tool, intended to enable users to quickly and easily perform the following tasks:&lt;ref&gt;[[Starmad#References|[1] W.J.Larson, J.R. Wertz, “Space Mission Analysis and Design”, 3rd edition, Space Technology Library, 1999.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Preliminary Orbit Analysis, in terms of Dynamics, Geometry, Manoeuvre and Maintenance, Interplanetary Transfer, and Delta-V Budget. &lt;br /&gt;
2. Observation Payload Analysis, in terms of Electromagnetic Spectrum, Optics and Sizing.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Spacecraft Subsystems Design, considering Attitude Control, Communications, Power System, Propulsion System, Structural Analysis and Thermal Control.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Launch and Transfer Vehicle Information.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Mission Operation Complexity, from the point of view of Mission Design and Planning, Flight System Design, Operational Risk Avoidance, Ground Systems.

Its main features are:
* Possibility to perform all, or only a subset of, the tasks listed above.
* Easy to use through the graphical user interface.
* Capability to concurrently analyse Space Mission aspects.
* Configuring STARMAD with an existing space mission and satellite, it is possible to check the effects that any modifications have on a Mission.
* Export data and possibility to generate a full Space Mission Report.

== Problem modelling ==
STARMAD is a tool allowing user to perform a Space Mission Analysis and Design &lt;ref&gt;[[Starmad#References|[2] P.Fortescue, J.Stark, G.Swinerd, “Spacecraft Systems Engineering”, 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 2003.]]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a complete, simple and fast way.

It can be compared to an electronic handbook where you have just to insert the required inputs, press enter and see the results. &lt;br /&gt;
The user does not need a large quantity of literature to analyse a space mission subject. Based on the task, STARMAD uses suitable formulas to find the solution.

Starting from the requirements, the engineer can carry out fundamental Space Mission Analyses, not only in terms of engineering parameters but also in terms of Mission Operations Complexity.  In addition, configuring STARMAD with an existing space mission and satellite, it is possible to test critical applied modifications.

Furthermore, it offers the possibility to work in a concurrent as well as in an independent way.

The ''System Algorithms technique'' is used to compute system performance. It applies the basic physical or geometric formulas associated with a particular system or process, such as those for determining resolution, size of an antenna, link budget, geometric coverage. System Algorithms provide the best method for computing performance, providing clear traceability and establishing the relationship between design parameters and performance characteristics. &lt;br /&gt;
STARMAD computations are based on ''System Algorithms technique'', additionally implementing all the design parameters interdependencies and automatically exchanging results throughout its sections. This allows to simplify and streamline the overall design process.
This method is powerful, showing how performance varies with key parameters. Limitation is the assumption of having correctly identified what limits system performance, such as optical quality, pointing stability, etc. Although this limitation, System Algorithms technique is ideal for preliminary assessment on space missions.

== Concurrent approach ==
In automatically linking all Space Mission aspects with their associated interdependencies, STARMAD is able to simplify an otherwise complex problem.&lt;br /&gt;
It facilitates a fast and effective interaction of all disciplines involved, ensuring consistent, high-quality results. The software is an efficient working tool to ensure consistent end-to-end design of a space mission.&lt;br /&gt;
The concurrent approach &lt;ref&gt;[[Starmad#References|[3] M.Bandecchi, F.Ongaro, “The ESA/ESTEC Concurrent Design Facility”, Paper presented at 2nd European Systems Engineering Conference, Munich 13–15 September 2000.]]&lt;/ref&gt; will improve engineer involvement, and hence his/her understanding and efficiency in designing a space mission.

The spacecraft design process is based on mathematical models, which are implemented inside STARMAD. By this means, a consistent set of design parameters can be automatically defined and exchanged throughout the software sections and subsections. And any change, which may affect other disciplines, can immediately be identified and assessed. In this way, a number of design iterations can be performed, and different design options can easily be analysed and compared.
In such a way, via STARMAD, it will be possible to streamline the design process achieving cost reduction and quality improvements.

== STARMAD software structure ==
STARMAD is principally divided into five primary sections, each of which contain several subsections.

Through the [http://www.starmad.net/starmad Graphical User Interface (GUI)], the user can define the type of problem. The Main User Interface is composed of 30 subsections (called pressing relative buttons). Each subsection can be configured with the required inputs and run independently from the others.

Going back to the main GUI, the user can solve several different concurrent space mission tasks calling other subsections and performing analyses in parallel taking under control the complexity of the problem. All the involved sections will take care of the performed evaluations and will automatically set their inputs based on the obtained results. This process will allow the user to concurrently design and analyse space mission subjects.

Every subsection has its own Output Section showing results, data and design summary when the simulation is performed. All results can be saved, stored, or re-loaded for modifications.

The content of each of the five primary sections is described below.

===Orbit analysis===

It is composed of the following sub-divisions:
* ''Orbit Dynamics'' evaluating basic spacecraft dynamics, orbit perturbations both atmospheric and gravitational;
* ''Orbit Geometry'', where general coverage characteristics and target viewing are calculated;
* ''Orbit Manoeuvres and Maintenance'' for circular orbit. In this section, setting main input parameters, such as parking and operational orbit parameters, or re-phasing, de-orbit and end-of-life parameters, Orbit Manoeuvre outputs (orbit dynamics, Hohmann transfer, plane change, low-thrust spiral change) and Orbit Maintenance outputs (Dynamics, Atmospheric and Gravitational effects, Re-phasing, End-of-life Manoeuvre parameters) are evaluated;
* ''Interplanetary Orbit Transfer'', where the main output parameters for an interplanetary transfer are evaluated under the hypothesis of patched conic approximation, such as velocity, energy, time of flight, delta-V to initiate and complete the transfer. For Earth departure, circular orbit is assumed. Heliocentric transfers are also considered;
* ''Delta-V and Geometry Budgets'', calculating all the elements of the delta-V budget and Mapping and Pointing errors.

===Observation payload analysis===

It is subdivided in the sections:

* ''Electromagnetic Spectrum &amp; Optics'', where typical EM Spectrum and Optics parameters are determined, such as irradiance, emittance, swath-width, ground resolution.
* ''Observation Payload Sizing'', where sizing of the observation instrument in terms of dimensions, mass and power is evaluated, as well as the payload data rate.

===Spacecraft subsystems design===
It is composed of all main subsystems required to build a satellite.
* ''Spacecraft preliminary sizing'', in terms of mass, power, volume, area and moments of inertia of S/C body and solar array.
* ''Attitude control'', composed of two sections:
- Torque estimates: where orbit characteristics, environmental torques and slew characteristics are calculated.&lt;br /&gt;
- Attitude control sizing: evaluating main parameters of Momentum wheel, Reaction wheel, Thrusters and Magnetic Torquer.
* ''Communications'':
- Uplink: setting ground transmitter parameters, this section evaluates outputs for Ground and spacecraft transmitter, Geometry and Atmosphere perturbations, Link budget in terms of EIRP, space loss, atmospheric attenuation, rain attenuation, G/T, Antenna pointing losses, Eb/No, C/No, Margin.&lt;br /&gt;
- Downlink: setting the Spacecraft Transmitter parameters, this section evaluates outputs for Ground and Spacecraft transmitter, Geometry and Atmosphere perturbations, Link budget in terms of EIRP, space loss, atmospheric attenuation, rain attenuation, G/T, Antenna pointing losses, Eb/No, C/No, Margin.
* ''Power subsystem sizing'', which is subdivided into 3 sections:
- Solar array;&lt;br /&gt;
- Secondary battery;&lt;br /&gt;
- Other primary sources&lt;br /&gt;
to calculate solar array mass and power budgets, battery capacity and mass, power and mass for fuel cells, solar thermal dynamics, radioisotope, nuclear reactor (if on board).
* ''Propulsion subsystem'', composed of the following sections:
- Sizing, which principally calculates mass, power, mass flow rate, thrust for both chemical and electric propulsion system;&lt;br /&gt;
- Thermodynamics, evaluating specific impulses, combustion chamber and nozzle characteristics. Additionally, it performs a complete sizing for the liquid propulsion system;&lt;br /&gt;
- Storage and Feed, where oxidiser and fuel characteristics plus bulk density and volume are determined.
* ''Structural Analysis'' for:
- Monocoque Structure;&lt;br /&gt;
- Semi-Monocoque Structure&lt;br /&gt;
to calculate loads, axial and lateral deflections, stress, bending moment, margins of safety.
* ''Thermal control'' to perform analyses on the spacecraft body and solar array. Main parameters evaluated are: solar and albedo energy absorbed, maximum and minimum equilibrium temperature, maximum and minimum planet IR energy absorbed, possible changes in S/C to reduce maximum equilibrium temperature to specified upper limit, heater requirements during eclipse.
* ''System Sizing Summary'' resuming the main feature of the designed spacecraft.

===Vehicle information===
This software section gives an overview of the principal characteristics for existing launch and transfer vehicles. Possibility to implement a user-defined vehicle is incorporated in both sections (launchers and transfers).
* For ''Launchers'': spacecraft loaded mass, performance (mass to orbit, available inclinations, injection accuracy, flight rate), reliability experience, payload compartment characteristics, frequency, accelerations and price are summarised.
* For ''Transfer Vehicles'': delta-V capability, thrust, mass flow rate, specific impulse, burn time, and mass characteristics are computed.

===Mission operation complexity===
This section summarises the results of the Mission Operations Complexity investigation using NASA’s JPL model as described in the text “Cost Effective Space Mission Operations”.

It is divided into four subsections as follows:
* ''Mission Design and Planning'': Science and Engineering, GNC and Tracking events are monitored in terms of frequency, criticality, data return, planning;
* ''Flight System Design'': the operations complexity events are related to command, monitor, pointing, automation, flight margins;
* ''Operational Risk Avoidance'': command and control, data return, performance analysis, fault recovery are taken into account;
* ''Ground Systems'': interfaces and ground system complexity, design of the ground system, organisation and staffing, automation, are all considered in the evaluation of the mission operations complexity.
In each of these subsections, a level of complexity (high, medium, or low) is given for all the events related to the particular mission subject. The level of the total mission complexity and the predicted full-time equivalent manpower for efficient operations is given as a final output.

==Mobile version==
Smartphones and tablets usage are widely growing in all the technological fields, helping users in performing the most different activities just ‘on the go’. The increasing computational power of such devices can actually  allow also to perform complex analysis and therefore, they can be conceptually used in Space industry in helping users to build space missions, spacecraft, systems and products requiring quick solutions for system design and software development point of view.&lt;br /&gt;
[http://www.starmad.net/istarmad "iStarmad"] is the iDevice extension of STARMAD, and it is an app to perform preliminary end-to-end space mission analysis and spacecraft subsystems design using iPhone/iPad devices.

==History==
In 2007, STARMAD was created by Davide Starnone. For the following years, it was promoted all around the world through several International Conferences, such as the [[International Astronautical Congress|"IAC"]]. Then the software has been sold around the world for 7 years. In 2014 [http://www.ssbv.com "SSBV"], a Dutch-led technology driven company active in the domains of (aero)Space and Defence &amp; Security, acquired STARMAD that now is officially included in their portfolio.

{{Transformation rules}}
In [[propositional logic]], '''tautology''' is one of two commonly used [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |last=Hurley |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=364–5 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt; The rules are used to eliminate redundancy in [[logical disjunction|disjunctions]] and [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] when they occur in [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. They are:

The principle of '''[[Idempotence|idempotency]] of disjunction''':

: &lt;math&gt;P \or P \Leftrightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;

and the principle of '''idempotency of conjunction''':
: &lt;math&gt;P \and P \Leftrightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;

Where "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;" is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing "can be replaced in a logical proof with."

== Formal notation ==

[[Theorem]]s are those [[Well-formed formula|logical formulas]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the conclusion of a valid proof,&lt;ref&gt;Logic in Computer Science, ''p. 13''&lt;/ref&gt; while the equivalent [[semantic consequence]] &lt;math&gt;\models \phi&lt;/math&gt; indicates a tautology.

The ''tautology'' rule may be expressed as a [[sequent]]:

: &lt;math&gt;P \or P \vdash P &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;P \and P \vdash P &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a metalogical symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \or P&lt;/math&gt;, in the one case, &lt;math&gt;P \and P&lt;/math&gt; in the other, in some [[formal system|logical system]];

or as a [[rule of inference]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \or P}{\therefore P}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \and P}{\therefore P}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;P \or P&lt;/math&gt;" or "&lt;math&gt;P \and P&lt;/math&gt;" appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;";

or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or [[theorem]] of propositional logic. The principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in  ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \or P) \to P &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;(P \and P) \to P &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proposition]] expressed in some [[formal system]].

'''''The Story of 1''''' is a [[BBC]] documentary about the history of numbers, and in particular, the [[1 (number)|number 1]]. It was presented by former [[Monty Python]] member [[Terry Jones]]. It was released in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/previews/storyof1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Terry Jones first journeys to [[Africa]], where [[bone]]s have been discovered with notches in them. However, there is no way of knowing if they were used for [[counting]].

Jones then discusses the [[Ishango bone]], which must have been used for counting, because there are 60 scratches on each side of the bone. Jones declares this "the birth of one"; a defining moment in history of [[mathematics]].

He then journeys to [[Sumer]]. Shortly after farming had been invented and humans were starting to build houses, they started to represent 1 with a token. With this, it was possible for the first time in history to do arithmetic. The Sumerians would enclose a certain number of tokens in a clay envelope and imprint the number of tokens on the outside. However, it was realized that one could simply write the number on a clay tablet.

To explore why the development of numbers occurred there and not some other place, Jones travels to Australia and meets a tribe called the [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]]. In their language, there are no words for numbers. When an individual is asked how many grandchildren he has, he simply replies he has "many", while he in fact has four.

In [[Egypt]], the numeral system provides a {{According to whom|fascinating|date=November 2016}} glimpse of Egyptian society, as larger numbers seem more applicable to higher strata of society. It went something like this: One was a line, ten was a rope, a hundred a coil of rope (three symbols for smaller numbers, probably applicable to the average Egyptian), a thousand a lotus (a symbol of pleasure), ten thousand was a commanding finger, and a million – a number  the Sumerians would never have dreamed of – was the symbol of a prisoner begging for forgiveness.

The Egyptians had a standard unit, the [[cubit]], which was instrumental for building wonders such as the pyramids.

Jones then journeys to [[Greece]] to cover the time of [[Pythagoras]]. Jones discusses with mathematician [[Marcus de Sautoy]] Pythagoras' obsession with numbers, his secret society, his dedication to numbers, the [[Pythagorean theorem]], and his flawed belief that all things could be measured in units (brought down by the attempt to measure the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle, in units relative to the two legs).

[[Archimedes]] was also in love with numbers. He tried to see what would happen if one took a sphere and turned it into a cylinder. This concept would later be applied to map making. Archimedes lived in Syracuse which at the time was at war with [[Rome]]. Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier while working on a mathematical problem. The Romans were not interested in mathematics for its own sake, and as a result mathematics declined. The [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] system was clumsy and inefficient. One reason that Terry Jones theorizes might be was that the numerals that the Romans used were basically the old-fashioned lines of the Ishango bone.

Jones discusses India's invention of a more efficient numeral system, including the invention of the concept of [[zero]]. He explains how the concept traveled west to the Caliphate. Then it arrived in Italy where it met fierce resistance. The reason for this was that most people were familiar only with the Roman numerals and not the superior [[Indian numerals]]. Eventually, the Hindu-Arabic numerals displaced the Roman ones.

Jones discusses finally how [[Gottfried Leibniz]] invented the [[Binary system (numeral)|binary system]], which is the foundation for modern digital [[Computer|computers]]. He planned on building a mechanical computer to use this system, but never followed through with the plan. Leibniz was convinced that 1 and 0 were the only numbers anyone really needed. In 1944, a computer called [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] was used to crack enemy codes during [[World War II]]. Computers like Colossus evolved into modern computers, which are used for every type of number calculation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8858">In [[geometry]], a '''transversal''' is a [[Line (mathematics)|line]]  that passes through two lines in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] at two distinct [[Point (geometry)|points]]. Transversals play a role in establishing whether two other lines in the [[Euclidean plane]] are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. The intersections of a transversal with two lines create various types of pairs of angles: '''consecutive interior angles''', '''corresponding angles''', and '''alternate angles'''. By Euclid's [[parallel postulate]], if the two lines are parallel, consecutive interior angles are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]], corresponding angles are equal, and alternate angles are equal.

&lt;/div&gt;

==Angles of a transversal==
A transversal produces 8 angles, as shown in the graph at the above left:
*4 with each of the two lines, namely α, β, γ and δ and then α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; and
*4 of which are '''interior''' (between the two lines), namely α, β, γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and 4 of which are '''exterior''', namely α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ and δ.

A transversal that cuts two parallel lines at [[right angle]]s is called a '''perpendicular transversal'''. In this case, all 8 angles are right angles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathopenref.com/transversal.html| title =Transversal | publisher =Math Open Reference | year=2009}} (interactive)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lines are [[Parallel lines|parallel]], a case that is often considered, a transversal produces several [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] and several [[supplementary angles]]. Some of these angle pairs have specific names and are discussed below:&lt;ref name=MathisFun/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holgate Art. 87&lt;/ref&gt;corresponding angles, alternate angles, and consecutive angles.

===Corresponding angles===
{{Hatnote|For an alternate use see [[Corresponding angles (congruence and similarity)]]}}
[[File:paralelni transverzala cor.svg|thumb|right|250px|One pair of corresponding angles. With parallel lines, they are congruent.]]

Corresponding angles are the four pairs of angles that:
*have distinct [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] points,
*lie on the same side of the transversal and
*one angle is interior and the other is exterior.

Two lines are parallel if and only if the two angles of any pair of corresponding angles of any transversal are congruent (equal in measure). 

Note: This follows directly from Euclid's parallel postulate. Further, if the angles of one pair are congruent, then the angles of each of the other pairs are also congruent. In our images with parallel lines, corresponding angle pairs are: α=α1, β=β1, γ=γ1 and δ=δ1.

===Alternate angles===
[[File:paralelni transverzala alt.svg|thumb|right|250px|One pair of alternate angles. With parallel lines, they are congruent.]]

Alternate angles are the four pairs of angles that:
*have distinct vertex points,
*lie on opposite sides of the transversal and
*both angles are interior or both angles are exterior.

If the two angles of one pair are congruent (equal in measure), then the angles of each of the other pairs are also congruent.

Proposition 1.27 of [[Euclid's elements]], a theorem of [[absolute geometry]] (hence valid in both [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] and [[Euclidean Geometry]]), proves that if the angles of a pair of alternate angles of a transversal are congruent then the two lines are parallel (non-intersecting) .

It follows from Euclid's [[parallel postulate]] that if the two lines are parallel, then the angles of a pair of alternate angles of a transversal are congruent (Proposition 1.29 of Euclid's elements).

===Consecutive interior angles===
[[File:Transverzala parallel.svg|250px|thumb|right|One pair of consecutive angles. With parallel lines, they add up to two [[right angles]] ]]

Consecutive interior angles are the two pairs of angles that:&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.cortland.edu/matresearch/OxfordDictionaryMathematics.pdf |title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics | author=C.Clapham, J.Nicholson | publisher =Addison-Wesley | year =2009| page=582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MathisFun&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/parallel-lines.html |title=Parallel Lines | author=Rod Pierce | publisher =MathisFun | year=2011}} (interactive)&lt;/ref&gt;

*have distinct vertex points,
*lie on the same side of the transversal and
*are both interior.

Two lines are parallel if and only if the two angles of any pair of consecutive interior angles of any transversal are supplementary (sum to 180°).

By the definition of a straight line and the properties of [[vertical angles]], if one pair is supplementary, the other pair is also supplementary.

==Other characteristics of transversals==
If three lines in general position form a triangle are then cut by a transversal, the lengths of the six resulting segments satisfy [[Menelaus' theorem]].

==Related theorems==
[[Euclid]]'s formulation of the [[parallel postulate]] may be stated in terms of a transversal. Specifically, if the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are less than two right angles then lines must intersect. In fact, Euclid uses the same phrase in Greek that is usually translated as "transversal".&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 308 note 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclid's Proposition 27 states that if a transversal intersects two lines so that alternate interior angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel. Euclid proves this [[Proof by contradiction|by contradiction]]: If the lines are not parallel then they must intersect and a triangle is formed. Then one of the alternate angles is an exterior angle equal to the other angle which is an opposite interior angle in the triangle. This contradicts Proposition 16 which states that an exterior angle of a triangle is always greater than the opposite interior angles.&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Holgate Art. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclid's Proposition 28 extends this result in two ways. First, if a transversal intersects two lines so that corresponding angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel. Second, if a transversal intersects two lines so that interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary, then the lines are parallel. These follow from the previous proposition by applying the fact that opposite angles of intersecting lines are equal (Prop. 15) and that adjacent angles on a line are supplementary (Prop. 13). As noted by [[Proclus]], Euclid gives only three of a possible six such criteria for parallel lines.&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 309-310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Holgate Art. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclid's Proposition 29 is a converse to the previous two. First, if a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then the alternate interior angles are congruent. If not, then one is greater than the other, which implies its supplement is less than the supplement of the other angle. This implies that there are interior angles on the same side of the transversal which are less than two right angles, contradicting the fifth postulate. The proposition continues by stating that on a transversal of two parallel lines, corresponding angles are congruent and the interior angles on the same side are equal to two right angles. These statements follow in the same way that Prop. 28 follows from Prop. 27.&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 311-312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Holgate Art. 93-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclid's proof makes essential use of the fifth postulate, however, modern treatments of geometry use [[Playfair's axiom]] instead. To prove proposition 29 assuming Playfair's axiom, let a transversal cross two parallel lines and suppose that the alternate interior angles are not equal. Draw a third line through the point where the transversal crosses the first line, but with an angle equal to the angle the transversal makes with the second line. This produces two different lines through a point, both parallel to another line, contradicting the axiom.&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A similar proof is given in Holgate Art. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5242">'''Uwe Schöning''' (born 28 December 1955) is a German [[computer scientist]], known for his research in [[computational complexity theory]].

==Education and career==
Schöning earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Stuttgart]] in 1981, under the supervision of Wolfram Schwabhäuser.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=23745}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is a professor in the Institute for Theoretical Informatics at the [[University of Ulm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/theo/m/schoening.html Faculty profile], Univ. of Ulm, retrieved 2013-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Schöning introduced the [[low and high hierarchies]] to structural complexity theory in 1983. As Schöning later showed in a 1988 paper, these hierarchies play an important role in the complexity of the [[graph isomorphism problem]], which Schöning further developed in a 1993 monograph with Köbler and Toran.

In a 1999 FOCS paper, Schöning showed that [[WalkSAT]], a [[randomized algorithm]] previously analyzed for [[2-satisfiability]] by Papadimitriou, had good [[Probabilistic analysis of algorithms|expected time complexity]] (although still exponential) when applied to worst-case instances of [[Boolean satisfiability problem#3-satisfiability|3-satisfiability]] and other [[NP-complete]] [[constraint satisfaction]] problems. At the time this was the fastest guaranteed time bound for 3SAT; subsequent research has built on this idea to develop even faster algorithms.

Schöning is also the inventor of the pedagogical [[programming language]]s [[LOOP (programming language)|LOOP]], GOTO, and WHILE, which he described in his textbook ''Theoretische Informatik - kurz gefasst''.

==Selected publications==
Schöning is the author or editor of many books in computer science, including

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19946">The '''Volterra series''' is a model for non-linear behavior similar to the [[Taylor series]].  It differs from the Taylor series in its ability to capture 'memory' effects.  The Taylor series can be used for approximating the response of a nonlinear system to a given input if the output of this system depends strictly on the input at that particular time.  In the Volterra series the output of the nonlinear system depends on the input to the system at ''all'' other times.  This provides the ability to capture the 'memory' effect of devices like capacitors and inductors.

It has been applied in the fields of medicine (biomedical engineering) and biology, especially neuroscience.  It is also used in electrical engineering to model [[intermodulation]] distortion in many devices including power amplifiers and [[frequency mixer]]s.  Its main advantage lies in its generality: it can represent a wide range of systems. Thus it is sometimes considered a [[non-parametric]] model. 
 
In [[mathematics]], a Volterra series denotes a functional expansion of a dynamic, [[nonlinear]], time-invariant [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]. Volterra series are frequently used in [[system identification]].  The Volterra series, which is used to prove the Volterra theorem, is an infinite sum of multidimensional convolutional integrals.

==History==
The Volterra series is a modernized version of the theory of analytic functionals due to the Italian mathematician [[Vito Volterra]] in work dating from 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sopra le funzioni che dipendono da altre funzioni|last=Volterra|first=Vito|publisher=R. Accademia dei Lincei|year=1887|isbn=|volume=III|location=Italy|pages=97–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vito Volterra. Theory of Functionals and of Integrals and Integro-Differential Equations. Madrid 1927 (Spanish), translated version reprinted New York: Dover Publications, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Norbert Wiener]] became interested in this theory in the 1920s from contact with Volterra's student [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]]. He applied his theory of [[Brownian motion]] to the integration of Volterra analytic functionals. 
The use of Volterra series for system analysis originated from a restricted 1942 wartime report&lt;ref&gt;Wiener N: ''Response of a nonlinear device to noise.'' Radiation Lab MIT 1942, restricted. report V-16, no 129 (112 pp).
Declassified Jul 1946, Published as rep. no. PB-1-58087, U.S. Dept. Commerce. URL: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800212.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of Wiener, then professor of mathematics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. It used the series to make an approximate analysis of the effect of radar noise in a nonlinear receiver circuit. The report became public after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ikehara S: ''A method of Wiener in a nonlinear circuit.'' 
MIT Dec 10 1951, tech. rep. no 217, Res. Lab. Electron.&lt;/ref&gt; As a general method of analysis of nonlinear systems, Volterra series came into use after about 1957 as the result of a series of reports, at first privately circulated, from MIT and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;
Early MIT reports by Brilliant, Zames, George, Hause, Chesler can be found on dspace.mit.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Volterra series'' came into use a few years later.

==Mathematical theory==
The theory of Volterra series can be viewed from two different perspectives: either one considers an operator mapping between two real (or complex) function spaces or a functional mapping from a real (or complex) function space into the real (or complex) numbers. The latter, functional perspective is in more frequent use, due to the assumed time-invariance of the system.

===Continuous time===
A continuous time-invariant system with ''x''(''t'') as input and ''y''(''t'') as output can be expanded in Volterra series as:

&lt;math&gt;
 y(t) = h_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\int_{a}^{b}\cdots\int_{a}^{b}
    {h_{n}(\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{n})\prod^{n}_{j=1}{x(t - \tau_{j}) d\tau_{j}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the constant term &lt;math&gt;h_{0}&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side is usually taken to be zero by suitable choice of output level &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
The function &lt;math&gt;h_{n}(\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{n})&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''n''-th order '''Volterra [[Integral kernel|kernel]]'''. It can be regarded as a higher-order impulse response of the system. For the representation to be unique the kernels must be symmetrical in the variables.

If ''N'' is finite, the series is said to be ''truncated''. If ''a,b'', and ''N'' are finite, the series is called ''doubly finite''.

Sometimes the ''n''-th order term is divided by n!, a convention which is convenient when taking the output of one Volterra system as the input of another ('cascading').

''The causality condition'': Since in any physically realizable system the output can only depend on previous values of the input, the kernels &lt;math&gt; h_n(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n) &lt;/math&gt; will be zero if any of the variables &lt;math&gt; t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n &lt;/math&gt; are negative. The integrals may then be written over the half range from zero to infinity.
So if the operator is causal, &lt;math&gt;a \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

''Fréchet's approximation theorem'': The use of the Volterra series to represent a time-invariant functional relation is often justified by appealing to a theorem due to [[Maurice René Fréchet|Fréchet]]. This theorem states that a time-invariant functional relation (satisfying certain very general conditions) can be approximated uniformly and to an arbitrary degree of precision by a sufficiently high finite order Volterra series. Among other conditions, the set of admissible input functions &lt;math&gt; x(t)&lt;/math&gt; for which the approximation will hold is required to be [[compact space|compact]]. It is usually taken to be an [[equicontinuous]], [[uniformly bounded]] set of functions, which is compact by the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]]. In many physical situations, this assumption about the input set is a reasonable one. The theorem, however, gives no indication as to how many terms are needed for a good approximation, which is an essential question in applications.

===Discrete time===

This is similar to the continuous-time case:

&lt;math&gt;
y(n) = h_{0}+\sum_{p=1}^{P}{ \sum_{\tau_1=a}^{b}\cdots\sum_{\tau_p=a}^{b}
    {h_{p}(\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{p})\prod^{p}_{j=1}{x(n - \tau_{j})}}},
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h_{p}(\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{p})&lt;/math&gt; are called discrete-time Volterra kernels.

If ''P'' is finite, the series operator is said to be truncated. If ''a,b'' and ''P'' are finite the series operator is called doubly finite Volterra series. If &lt;math&gt;a \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; the operator is said to be '''causal'''.

We can always consider, without loss of the generality, the kernel &lt;math&gt;h_{p}(\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{p})&lt;/math&gt; as symmetrical. In fact, for the commutativity of the multiplication it is always possible to symmetrize it by forming a new kernel taken as the average of the kernels for all permutations of the variables &lt;math&gt;\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{p}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a causal system with symmetrical kernels we can rewrite the nth term approximately in triangular form
&lt;math&gt;
    \sum_{\tau_1=0}^{M}\sum_{\tau_2=\tau_1}^{M}\cdots\sum_{\tau_p=\tau_{p-1}}^{M}
    {h_{p}(\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{p})\prod^{p}_{j=1}{x(n - \tau_{j})}} .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Methods to estimate the kernel coefficients==
Estimating the Volterra coefficients individually is complicated since the basis functionals of the Volterra series are correlated. This leads to the problem of simultaneously solving a set of integral-equations for the coefficients. Hence, estimation of Volterra coefficients is generally performed by estimating the coefficients of an orthogonalized series, e.g. the [[Wiener series]], and then recomputing the coefficients of the original Volterra series. The Volterra series main appeal over the orthogonalized series lies in its intuitive, canonical structure, i.e. all interactions of the input have one fixed degree. The orthogonalized basis functionals will generally be quite complicated.

An important aspect, with respect to which the following methods differ is whether the orthogonalization of the basis functionals is to be performed over the idealized specification of the input signal (e.g. gaussian, white noise) or over the actual realization of the input (i.e. the pseudo-random, bounded, almost-white version of gaussian white noise, or any other stimulus). The latter methods, despite their lack of mathematical elegance, have been shown to be more flexible (as arbitrary inputs can be easily accommodated) and precise (due to the effect that the idealized version of the input signal is not always realizable).

===Crosscorrelation method===
This method, developed by Lee &amp; Schetzen, orthogonalizes with respect to the actual mathematical description of the signal, i.e. the projection onto the new basis functionals is based on the knowledge of the moments of the random signal.

We can write the Volterra series in terms of [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]] operators, as

&lt;math&gt;
y(n) = h_{0}+\sum_{p=1}^{P}{H_{p}x(n)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;
 H_{p}x(n) = \sum_{\tau_1=a}^{b}\cdots\sum_{\tau_p=a}^{b} {h_{p}(\tau_{1},.\,.\,,\tau_{p})\prod^{p}_{j=1}{x(n - \tau_{j})}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

To allow identification orthogonalization, Volterra series must be rearranged in terms of orthogonal non-homogeneous ''G'' operators ([[Wiener series]]):

&lt;math&gt;
 y(n) = \sum_{p}{H_p x(n)} \equiv \sum_{p}{G_p x(n)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The ''G'' operators can be defined by the following

&lt;math&gt;
      E\{H_i x(n) G_j x(n)\} = 0;\qquad i &lt; j
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
      E\{G_i x(n) G_j x(n)\} = 0;\qquad i\neq j
&lt;/math&gt;

whenever &lt;math&gt;H_i x(n)&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary homogeneous Volterra, ''x(n)'' is some stationary white noise (SWN) with zero mean and variance ''A''.

Recalling that every Volterra functional is orthogonal to all Wiener functional of greater order, and considering the following Volterra functional:

&lt;math&gt;
 H^*_{\overline{p}}x (n) = \prod^{\overline{p}}_{j=1}{x(n - \tau_{j})} 
&lt;/math&gt;

we can write

&lt;math&gt;
E\left\{y(n)H^*_{\overline{p}}x (n) \right\} = E\left\{\sum_{p=0}^\infty{G_p x(n)H^*_{\overline{p}}x (n)}\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

If ''x'' is SWN, &lt;math&gt;\tau_1 \neq \tau_2 \neq \ldots \neq \tau_P&lt;/math&gt; and by letting &lt;math&gt;A=\sigma^2_x&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

&lt;math&gt;
E\left\{y(n) \prod^{\overline{p}}_{j=1}{x(n - \tau_{j})} \right\} = E\left\{ G_{\overline{p}} x(n)\prod^{\overline{p}}_{j=1}{x(n - \tau_{j})}\right\} =  \overline{p}! A^{\overline{p}} k_{\overline{p}} (\tau_1 ,.\,.\, ,\tau_{\overline{p}} )
&lt;/math&gt;

So if we exclude the diagonal elements, &lt;math&gt;{\tau_i\neq \tau_j,\, \forall i,j}&lt;/math&gt;, it is

&lt;math&gt;
k_p (\tau _1 , .\,.\, ,\tau _p ) = \frac{E\left\{ {y(n)x(n-\tau_1)\cdots x(n-\tau_p)} \right\}}{{p!A^p }}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If we want to consider the diagonal elements, the solution proposed by Lee and Schetzen is:

&lt;math&gt;
k_p (\tau _1 ,.\,.\, ,\tau _p)\!=\!\frac{E\left\{ {\left( {y(n)\!-\!\!\!\sum\limits_{m = 0}^{p - 1} {\!G_m x(n)} }\!\!\right)\! x(n-\tau_1)\cdots x(n-\tau_p)}\right\} }{p!A^p }
&lt;/math&gt;

The main drawback of this technique is that the estimation errors, made on all elements of lower-order kernels, will affect each diagonal element of order p by means of the summation &lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{m = 0}^{p - 1} {\!G_m x(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, conceived as the solution for the estimation of the diagonal elements themselves. 
Efficient formulas to avoid this drawback and references for diagonal kernel element estimation can be found in

&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Wiener kernels were identified, Volterra kernels can be obtained by using Wiener to Volterra formulas, in the following reported for a fifth order Volterra series:

&lt;math&gt;
   h_5 =\, k_5
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_4 =\, k_4
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_3  =\,  k_3  - 10A \sum_{\tau_4} {k_5 (\tau_1 ,\tau_2 ,\tau_3 ,\tau_4 ,\tau_4 )}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_2 =\, k_2   - 6A \sum_{\tau_3}{k_4 (\tau_1 ,\tau_2 ,\tau_3 ,\tau_3 )}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_1  =\,  k_1   - 3A\sum_{\tau_2}{k_3 (\tau _1 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _2 )} + 15A^2 \sum_{\tau2}{\sum_{\tau_3}{k_5 (\tau _1 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _3 ,\tau _3 )}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_0 = \, k_0  - A \sum_{\tau_1}{k_2 (\tau _1 ,\tau _1 )} + 3A^2 \sum_{\tau_1}{\sum_{\tau_2}{k_4 (\tau _1 ,\tau _1 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _2 )} } 
&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiple-variance method===
In the traditional orthogonal algorithm, using inputs with high &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x &lt;/math&gt; has the advantage of stimulating high order nonlinearity, so as to achieve more accurate high order kernel identification.
As a drawback, the use of high &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; values causes high identification error in lower order kernels, as shown in 
,&lt;ref name = SOrc14ALS&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orcioni | first1 = Simone | year = 2014 | title = Improving the approximation ability of Volterra series identified with a cross-correlation method | url = | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics | volume =  78| issue = | pages =  2861–2869| doi = 10.1007/s11071-014-1631-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
mainly due to nonideality of the input and truncation errors.

On the contrary the use of lower &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; in the identification process can lead to a better estimation of lower order kernel, but can be insufficient to stimulate high order nonlinearity.

This phenomenon, that can be called ''locality'' of truncated Volterra series, can be revealed by 
calculating the output error of a series as a function of different variances of input.
This test can be repeated with series identified with different input variances, obtaining different curves, each with a minimum in correspondence of the variance used in the identification.

To overcome this limitation, a low &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; value should be used for the lower order kernel and gradually increased for higher order kernels.
This is not a theoretical problem in  Wiener kernel identification, since the Wiener functional are orthogonal to each other, but an appropriate normalization is needed in Wiener to Volterra conversion formulas for taking into account the use of different variances.
Furthermore, new Wiener to Volterra conversion formulas are needed.

The traditional Wiener kernel identification should be changed as follows:&lt;ref name = SOrc14ALS/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
k_0^{(0)} = E\{y^{(0)}(n)\}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
k_1^{(1)}(\tau_1) = \frac{1}{A_1}E\left\{y^{(1)}(n)\,x^{(1)}(n-\tau_1)\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
k_2^{(2)}(\tau_1,\tau_2)=\frac{1}{2!A_2^2}\,\left\{E\left\{y^{(2)}(n)\,\prod_{i=1}^{2}{x^{(2)}(n-\tau_i)}\right\} - A_2k_0^{(2)}\delta_{\tau_1\tau_2}\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
k_3^{(3)}(\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3) = \frac{1}{3!A_3^3}\left\{E\left\{y^{(3)}(n)\,\prod_{i=1}^{3}{x^{(3)}(n-\tau_i)}\right\} - A_3^2\left[k_1^{(3)}(\tau_1)\delta_{\tau_2\tau_3} + k_1^{(3)}(\tau_2)\delta_{\tau_1\tau_3}+k_1^{(3)}(\tau_3)\delta_{\tau_1\tau_2}\right]\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above formulas the impulse functions are introduced for the identification of diagonal kernel points.
If the Wiener kernels are extracted with the new formulas, the following Wiener to Volterra formulas (explicited up the fifth order) are needed:

&lt;math&gt;
   h_5 =\, k_5^{(5)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_4 =\, k_4^{(4)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_3  =\,  k_3^{(3)}  - 10A_3\sum_{\tau_4} {k_5^{(5)} (\tau_1 ,\tau_2 ,\tau_3 ,\tau_4 ,\tau_4 )}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_2 =\, k_2^{(2)}   - 6A_2\sum_{\tau_3}{k_4^{(4)} (\tau_1 ,\tau_2 ,\tau_3 ,\tau_3 )}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_1  =\,  k_1^{(1)}   - 3A_1\sum_{\tau_2}{k_3^{(3)} (\tau _1 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _2 )} + 15A_1^2 \sum_{\tau2}{\sum_{\tau_3}{k_5^{(5)} (\tau _1 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _3 ,\tau _3 )}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
   h_0 = \, k_0^{(0)}  - A_0\sum_{\tau_1}{k_2^{(2)} (\tau _1 ,\tau _1 )} + 3A_0^2 \sum_{\tau_1}{\sum_{\tau_2}{k_4^{(4)} (\tau _1 ,\tau _1 ,\tau _2 ,\tau _2 )} } 
&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, the drawback with respect to the formula proposed in  &lt;ref name = SOrc05ALM/&gt; is that for the identification of the n-order kernel, all lower kernels must be identified again with the higher variance.
However an outstanding improvement in the output MSE will be obtained if the Wiener and Volterra kernels are obtained with the new formulas, as can be seen in.&lt;ref name = SOrc14ALS/&gt;

===Exact orthogonal algorithm===
This method and its more efficient version (Fast Orthogonal Algorithm) were invented by Korenberg 
.&lt;ref&gt;
Korenberg, M.J., Bruder, S.B., McIlroy, P.J.: Exact orthogonal kernel estimation from finite data records: extending Wiener’s identification of nonlinear systems. Ann. Biomed. Eng.16, 201–214 (1988)
&lt;/ref&gt;
In this method the orthogonalization is performed empirically over the actual input. It has been shown to perform more precisely than the Crosscorrelation method. Another advantage is that arbitrary inputs can be used for the orthogonalization and that fewer data-points suffice to reach a desired level of accuracy. Also, estimation can be performed incrementally until some criterion is fulfilled.

===Linear regression===
Linear regression is a standard tool from linear analysis. Hence, one of its main advantages is the widespread existence of standard tools for solving linear regressions efficiently. It has some educational value, since it highlights the basic property of Volterra series: linear combination of non-linear basis-functionals. For estimation the order of the original should be known, since the Volterra basis-functionals are not orthogonal and thus estimation cannot be performed incrementally.

===Kernel method===
This method was invented by Franz &amp; Schölkopf &lt;ref&gt;Franz, Matthias O., and Bernhard Schölkopf. "A unifying view of Wiener and Volterra theory and polynomial kernel regression." Neural computation 18.12 (2006): 3097-3118.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on [[statistical learning theory]]. Consequently, this approach is also based on minimizing the empirical error (often called empirical risk minimization). Franz and Schölkopf proposed that the kernel method could essentially replace the Volterra series representation, although noting that the latter is more intuitive.

===Differential sampling===
This method was developed by van Hemmen and coworkers and utilizes [[Dirac delta function]]s to sample the Volterra coefficients.

A demonstration of Weyl's argument proceeds by constructing a rectangular tiling of the plane representing a discrete space. A discretized triangle, n units tall and n units long, can be constructed on the tiling. The hypotenuse of the resulting triangle will be n tiles long. However, by the pythagorean theorem, a corresponding triangle in a continuous space—a triangle whose height and length are n -- will have a hypotenuse measuring n√2 units long. To show that the former result does not converge to the latter for arbitrary values of n, one can examine the percent difference between the two results: {{frac|(n√2 - n)|n√2}} = 1-{{frac|1|√2}}. Since n cancels out, the two results never converge, even in the limit of large n. The argument can be constructed for more general triangles, but, in each case, the result is the same. Thus, a discrete space does not even approximate the pythagorean theorem.

In response, Kris McDaniel has argued the Weyl Tile argument depends on accepting the Size Thesis, according to which the distance between two points is given by the number of tiles between the two points. However, as McDaniel points out, the size thesis is not accepted for continuous spaces. Thus, we might have reason not to accept the size thesis for discrete spaces.

Nonetheless, if a discrete space is constructed by a rectangular tiling of the plane and the Size Thesis is accepted, the Euclidean metric will be inappropriate for measuring distances on the resulting space. Instead, the so-called [[Hamming metric]] should be utilized. Computer scientists interested in the distance between two strings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/525 |title=Hamming Distance and Error Correcting Codes |publisher=The Oxford Math Center| accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mathematical biologists interested in the distance between two genetic sequences employ the versions of the Hamming metric in each of their respective disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Martin Nowak|title=Evolutionary Dynamics: Exploring the Equations of Life|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=2006|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
