[[File:Gorlaeus Abraham-crop.jpg|thumb|Abraham van Goorle, aged 52, copper engraving by J. de Gheijn]]
'''Abraham van Goorle''' or, [[Latinized name|Latinized]], '''Abraham Gorlaeus''' (ca. 1549 – 1608) was a Dutch [[antiquary]] of Flemish origin.

Gorlaeus was born in [[Antwerp]] as the son of Jacob Godevaertsz van Ghoorle and Willemken Heijmolen, but fled as a teenager with his brother David to the [[Dutch Republic]]. He lived in [[Utrecht]] and already in 1570 held an influential position under the employment of [[stadtholder]] [[Adolf van Nieuwenaar]]. He married Susanna Patersson, with whom he had three children in the 1580s. In 1595 he moved to [[Delft]] where he remained until his death on 11 October 1608 and where he was buried in the [[Oude Kerk, Delft|Oude Kerk]]. The philosopher and theologian [[David van Goorle|David van Goorle Jr.]] was the son of his brother David.&lt;ref&gt;Frans Maurits de Jaeger, [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu05_01/molh003nieu05_01_0287.php Goorle, Abraham van] in Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek, Vol. 5 (1921), pp. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
Gorlaeus published ''Dactyliotheca'', the catalog of [[engraved gem]]s in his [[cabinet of curiosities]].&lt;ref&gt;Notably published at Antwerp by [[Plantin Press|Plantin]] in 1609: [http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/collectie/beeldmateriaal/tekeningen_en_prenten/1600-1610/38924].&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first extensive repertory of Greco-Roman [[Engraved gem|intaglio]] gems. Such gems had been avidly collected for the previous century, at first in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;David Jaffé, "Aspects of Gem Collecting in the Early Seventeenth Century, [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc|Nicolas-Claude Peiresc]] and [[Lelio Pasqualini]]", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''135''' No. 1079 (February 1993:103-120).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, the cabinet was purchased on behalf of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], an isolated early example of English interest in engraved gems.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales and England's Lost Renaissance'' (1986:199).&lt;/ref&gt; Gorlaeus' ''Dactyliotheca'' remained useful for the rest of the century; it was republished by [[Jakob Gronovius]] in 1695, as part of his ''Thesaurus Graecarum antiquitatum''.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Campbell Bonner, "A Miscellany of Engraved Stones" ''Hesperia'' '''23'''.2 (April - June 1954:138-157)  p.&amp;nbsp;154; [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nB6QN0ahUTcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=%22Abraham+Gorlaeus%22&amp;ots=ky4Q-uN21v&amp;sig=gHb-7-vG43votr8c8qNvN2s1fR0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 1695 title page]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=30hfLSWL4a4C&amp;pg=PP5 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[cabinet of curiosities]], Gorlaeus had a collection of rare [[Exoskeleton|shell]]s, which was of sufficient interest to be purchased by the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General of the Dutch Republic]] as a present for [[Marie de' Medici]], for 9000 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Dodt van Flensburg, "Resolutien der Generalen Staten uit de XVII eeuw", in ''Archief voor kerkelijke en wereldsche geschiedenissen...'' (Utrecht, 1839-48), vol.&amp;nbsp;v, p.&amp;nbsp;8, noted in J. G. van Gelder, "Notes on the Royal Collection - IV: The 'Dutch Gift' of 1610 to Henry, Prince of 'Whalis'..." ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''105''' No. 729 (December 1963: 541-545)  p.&amp;nbsp;542 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali''' (Zulu for ‘Heritage KwaZulu-Natal’), commonly known as 'Amafa', is a [[provincial heritage resources authority]] in terms of South Africa's National Heritage Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1997 in terms of the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act of that year&lt;ref&gt;The KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, 1997 (Act No. 10 of 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and is an agency of the Office of the Premier of the government of the [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]] of South Africa. It is also a 'public entity' under the terms of the Public Finance Management Act.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1, Public Finance Management Act, Act 1 of 1999, (as amended)&lt;/ref&gt; It is mandated to care for that part of South Africa's national estate that is of provincial and local significance in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] .

Amafa is the oldest heritage resources authority in South Africa, all others being established in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act of 1999 or, in the Northern Cape, under provincial legislation that post dates the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, Act No 9 of 2013, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, No 1784, 5 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Amafa is best known as the custodian of approximately 300 Provincial Landmarks and Heritage Landmarks in the province,&lt;ref&gt;[[List of heritage sites in KwaZulu-Natal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and several sites at which it manages interpretative centres.

== History ==
Amafa is the successor body to the [[National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)|National Monuments Council]] in the former [[Natal Province]] and KwaZulu Monuments Council in the former [[KwaZulu]] [[Bantustan]] or homeland, in South Africa. Under the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]], cultural matters are a competency shared between national and provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 4, Part A, Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act. 108 of 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This necessitated the creation of a system whereby many of the responsibilities of former monuments authorities were devolved to provincial level via the National Heritage Resources Act.

Provinces may pass their own heritage resources legislation and KwaZulu-Natal is one of only two that has chosen that route rather than to use provisions of the National Heritage Resources Act to establish a provincial heritage resources authority (PHRA). Part of the reason for this is that the first KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act (1997) predates the National Heritage Resources Act (1999) and that there was no national framework for heritage at the time that the province resolved to establish its PHRA. The 1997 Act was replaced in 2008 by a new act of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, Act No.4 of 2008, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette 225 of 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Logo of the organisation is the one formerly used by the KwaZulu Monuments Council.

=== Chairpersons of Council ===
* 1997 - 2013: Mr Arthur Konigkramer
* 2013 - Present Mr. J. Sithole

=== Chief Executive Officers ===
* 1997 - 2013: Mr Barry Marshall

== SAHRA and Amafa's Mandate ==
Amafa is subject to a biennial assessment of competency by the [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]], SAHRA in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act. This process determines which aspects of the national estate it is qualified to implement.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8(6), National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assessed as competent to deal with all areas over which a provincial heritage resources authority is permitted to act.

== Heritage resources for which Amafa is responsible ==
In terms of the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act Amafa is responsible for a range of heritage resources.

=== Specially Protected Sites ===
Amafa inherited responsibility for former national monuments and KwaZulu monuments in the province. These are now known as 'Specially Protected Heritage Resources' and are Provincial Landmarks, if state owned, or Heritage Landmarks, if privately owned. These terms equate with the term [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage site]] used by the National Heritage Resources Act and hence all other provincial heritage resources authorities in South Africa. At present there are around 300 such sites in the province .&lt;ref&gt;Schedule: Specially Protected Heritage Resources, KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, Act No.4 of 2008, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette 225 of 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Most specially protected sites must be declared by publication of a notice in the Provincial Gazette, but graves of members of the Zulu royal family, and battlefields and public monuments and memorials listed in the Schedule  to the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act are automatically protected in the same way as a Heritage Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;Section 40 &amp; 41, KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, Act No.4 of 2008, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette 225 of 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation continues to declare new sites on a regular basis.

===General Protections===
The following are protected without the need to be specifically identified and declared in terms of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter  8, KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, Act No.4 of 2008, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette 225 of 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Structures older than 60 years
* Graves of victims of conflict
* Traditional burial places
* Battlefields
* Archaeological sites
* Palaeontological sites
* Rock art sites
* Historic fortifications
* Meteorites and meteorite impact sites

===Heritage objects===
Amafa may also protect moveable heritage as [[Heritage objects (South Africa)|Heritage Objects]] by publication of a notice in the Provincial Gazette&lt;ref&gt;Section 43, KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, Act No.4 of 2008, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette 225 of 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Museums and interpretation centres ===
Amafa is unique amongst provincial heritage resources authorities in South Africa in that it also runs a museum and several interpretive centres at sites which it manages: .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagekzn.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt;

*KwaZulu Cultural Museum, Ondini, Ulundi.  The museum is the former museum of the [[KwaZulu]] [[Bantustan]] and illustrates the culture of the Zulu people. Ondini also includes the site of the capital of the Zulu King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande]].
* [[UmGungundlovu|Mgungundlovu]], the site of the capital of Zulu King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]].
* [[Shaka Memorial|KwaDukuza]], site of the assassination of Zulu King [[Shaka]].
* [[Isandlwana]] Battlefield
* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorkes Drift – Shiyane]] Battlefield
* [[Spion Kop Battlefield Memorials|Spioenkop]] Battlefield
* [[Border Cave]] Rock Shelter stone age site
* Kamberg Rock Art Centre

== Council and committees ==
Amafa is governed by a Council appointed by the [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Member of the Executive Council]] of the Province responsible for its functions.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8, KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, Act No.4 of 2008, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette 225 of 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Presently that is the provincial Premier. It is appointed for a three-year term of office. .&lt;ref&gt;Section 9,, KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, Act No.4 of 2008, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Gazette 225 of 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Council has established a number of committees which meet regularly to implement the responsibilities of the organisation. These include the following: .&lt;ref&gt;Amafa Akwazulu Natali/Heritage Kwazulu-Natal Annual Report 2009/2010, Ulundi: Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* Executive Committee
* Human Resources Committee
* Museum Committee 
* Built Environment Committees
* Permit Review Committee for archaeology

== Staff Complement ==
Amafa employs a staff complement of around 100.  They are under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer. .&lt;ref&gt;p. 96, Amafa Akwazulu Natali/Heritage Kwazulu-Natal Annual Report 2009/2010, Ulundi: Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Amafa receives an annual transfer payment from the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] Premier's Department. This, together with earnings from application fees and income generated by the sites which it manages, covers its operational costs.

== Offices ==
Amafa has offices at the KwaZulu Cultural Museum, King Cetshwayo Highway, Ondini, Ulundi (28.19.11.33S  31.27.33.75E) and the Old YMCA Building, Cnr Langalibalele and Buchanan Streets, Pietermaritzburg (29.36.16.46S  30.22.39.42.E)

'''''Bandit''''' is a series of four American [[television film|made-for-television film]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s  based on the popular ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' film series. The four films in the series are: ''Bandit Goes Country'', ''Bandit Bandit'', ''Beauty and the Bandit'' and ''Bandit's Silver Angel''. The films were produced for [[Universal Television]]'s [[Action Pack (television)|Action Pack]] [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming block in 1994 from original director/writer [[Hal Needham]].

==Overview==
[[Brian Bloom]] stars in the series as a younger version of '''Bandit''', the character originated by [[Burt Reynolds]] in the films ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977) and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980). The series also serves as a [[prequel]] as it focuses on events that took place prior to the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIIwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=body+chemistry+%22claire+archer%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bgj0ToWFLG&amp;sig=3na8UxLt4z6xf5gF7sGW2G8225o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQtZHBq_vUAhUKz2MKHaS4BkQQ6AEIUTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=body%20chemistry%20%22claire%20archer%22&amp;f=false|page=201|title=Encyclopedia of Film Themes, Settings and Series|first1=Richard B.|last1=Armstrong|first2=Mary Willems|last2=Armstrong|publisher=McFarland|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car featured in these films is a [[Mitsubishi GTO|Dodge Stealth]] while the ''Smokey and the Bandit'' films featured three generations of the [[Pontiac_Firebird#Firebird_Trans_Am|Pontiac Trans Am]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">'''Charm Of Sound association''' (Äänen Lumo) is the name of a Finnish association for Electronic Music and Sound Art, founded by [[Petri Kuljuntausta]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charmofsound.org |title=Äänen Lumo |publisher=Charm of Sound |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petri Kuljuntausta's "'''Charm of Sound'''" is a 1997 text-based environmental composition in three parts, which is composed for the environment of outer space. It invites the living creatures of [[Saturn]]'s moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], to perform this work by using all the suitable material, solid and liquid, found on the ground of Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Huygens/release/1956434 |title=Various - Huygens (CD) |website=Discogs.com |date=1997-10-15 |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1997, the [[Cassini–Huygens]] spacecraft ([[Titan IV|Titan-IVB/Centaur]]) was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], United States, and reached its destination, [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], on 14 January 2005. Inside the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|Huygens probe]], stored on the [[CD-ROM]], was Kuljuntausta's "Charm of Sound".

[[Petri Kuljuntausta]] has stated: "If we suppose that there is somebody in outer space who could find the ''Huygens'' probe and understand how the CD-ROM works, signs of English language and meaning of artwork, then the composition is possible to realise with very basic elements, liquid and solid materials (objects), which might be available on Titan's ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.macmusic.org/news/view.php/lang/fr/id/2737/ |title=Une musique de Titan |website=MacMusic.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.macmusic.org/news/view.php/lang/en/id/2737/ |title=Music for Titan |website=MacMusic.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alcor.concordia.ca/~kaustin/cecconference/current/1876.html |title=CEC-Conference: The International Electroacoustic Community Dis |website=Alcor.concordia.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macrobius, universe with the earth in the centre.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Universe with the earth in the centre according to Macrobius (''Diagram in folio 25 recto'').]]
'''Commentary on Cicero's Dream of Scipio''' (in [[Latin]] ''Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis'') is a philosophical treatise of [[Macrobius]] based on the [[Somnium Scipionis|famous dream]] narrated in ''[[De re publica|On the republic]]'' of [[Cicero]] (Chapter VI, 9-29), in which [[Scipio Africanus|Scipion the African]] the Old appears  to his adoptive grandson, [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipion Emiliano]], and reveals him his future destination and the one of his country, explains the rewards that await to the [[Virtue|virtuous]] man in another life, describes the universe and the place of the Earth and the man inside the universe. Macrobius, his author, does not offer an exhaustive comment of the text ''ciceroniano'', but it exposes a series of ''theories on the dreams'' from [[Neoplatonism|neoplatónic]] background, on ''the mystic properties of the numbers'', on ''the nature of the'' ''[[soul]]'', on [[astronomy]] and on [[Music]]. Macrobius quotes a lot of authorities, but is little likely that have read them all or at least the majority. [[Plotinus|Plotino]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porfirio]] are his main sources and quotes frequently to [[Virgil]] with ornamental purpose. Nevertheless, the work incorporates ideas of the [[neoplatonism]], that are not conserved  in a direct form in any another place. The style is quite uneven, since Macrobius copies or translates his sources without unifying the style.

The '''Council on Library and Information Resources''' ('''CLIR''') is an American independent, nonprofit organization. It works with libraries, cultural institutions, and higher learning communities on developing strategies to improve research, teaching, and learning environments. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www2.archivists.org/assoc-orgs/council-on-library-and-information-resources | title=Council on Library and Information Resources | publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]] | location=USA | accessdate=17 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CLIR is supported primarily by annual dues from its 183 sponsoring institutions and 156 DLF members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clir.org/about/current-sponsors-and-funders|title=Sponsors, Members, and Funders • CLIR|work=CLIR|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by foundation grants and individual donations.

CLIR is overseen by a 21-member board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clir.org/about/governance|title=Governance • CLIR|work=CLIR|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
Through its work, CLIR aims to cultivate cross-disciplinary intellectual leadership, create professional development opportunities, and promote best practices for the preservation, organization, and accessibility of information. The following are among CLIR's major programs.

=== Digital Library Federation ===

The [[Digital Library Federation]] (DLF) is a community of practitioners who advance research, learning, social justice, and the public good through the creative design and wise application of digital library technologies. It is the place where CLIR's broader information-community strategies are informed and enriched by digital library practice. DLF is led by Bethany Nowviskie and is guided by the DLF Advisory Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.diglib.org/members/advisory/|title=DLF Advisory Committee – DLF|work=DLF|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes five members of CLIR's board of directors.

=== Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives ===

Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clir.org/fellowships/hiddencollections|title=Hidden Collections • CLIR|work=CLIR|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a national competition for digitizing collections of rare and unique content in cultural memory institutions. Last year, CLIR awarded nearly $4 million to institutions holding collections of high scholarly value.The program is supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

=== Postdoctoral Fellowship Program ===

CLIR Postdoctoral Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc|title=CLIR Postdoctoral Fellowship Program • CLIR|work=CLIR|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; work on projects that forge and strengthen connections among library collections, educational technologies, and current research. The program offers recent PhD graduates the chance to help develop research tools, resources, and services while exploring new career opportunities. Host institutions benefit from fellows' field-specific expertise by gaining insights into their collections' potential uses and users, scholarly information behaviors, and current teaching and learning practices within particular disciplines.

=== Mellon Fellowships for Dissertation Research in Original Sources ===

CLIR offers about 15 fellowships&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clir.org/fellowships/mellon/mellon.html|title=Mellon Fellowships for Dissertation Research in Original Sources • CLIR|work=CLIR|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; annually to support original-source doctoral dissertation research in the humanities or related social sciences.

=== Leading Change Institute ===

In partnership with EDUCAUSE, CLIR organizes the annual Leading Change Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadingchangeinstitute.org/|title=Leading Change Institute|website=www.leadingchangeinstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LCI). LCI aims to prepare and develop the next generation of leaders in libraries, information services, and higher education by engaging those who seek to further develop their skills for the benefit of higher education.

=== Committee on Coherence at Scale for Higher Education ===

The Committee on Coherence at Scale for Higher Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coherence.clir.org/|title=— Coherence Website|website=coherence.clir.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 2012 to examine emerging national-scale digital projects and their potential to help transform higher education in terms of scholarly productivity, teaching, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. Committee members include college and university presidents and provosts, deans, university librarians, and association heads.

== Publications ==
CLIR produces a variety of print and web-based publications, most notably the Burgundy Reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports|title=CLIR Reports • CLIR|work=CLIR|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are substantive reports on topics relating to digital libraries, economics of information, long-term access to information, and the future of the library and its leadership. CLIR publications also include ''CLIR Issues,''https://www.clir.org/pubs/issues a bimonthly newsletter covering topics related to CLIR’s agenda; and the blog Re: Thinking. The full text of most CLIR publications is available on the CLIR website.

== History ==
CLIR resulted from the merger of the '''Commission on Preservation and Access''' ('''CPA''') and the '''Council on Library Resources''' ('''CLR''') in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/competence-centres/list/?id=82|title=Council on Library and Information Resources, USA|publisher=[[Digital Preservation Europe]]|accessdate=17 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210000456/http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/competence-centres/list/?id=82|archivedate=10 December 2011|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Planning for the merger began in 1995, with the appointment of [[Deanna B. Marcum]] as the president of both organizations by their respective boards.&lt;ref name="CLIR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/about/history |title=History – Library of Congress Information Bulletin 62(9), p. 199|work= Council on Library and Information Resources|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the merger, Marcum served as president of CLIR until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0309/marcum.html |title=Marcum Appointed Associate Librarian for Library Services|date= September 2003|  |accessdate= 19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was succeeded by Richard Detweiler, who served as interim director until the appointment of Nancy Davenport in June 2004. Davenport left CLIR in 2006 and was succeeded by Charles Henry.

=== Council on Library Resources ===

Established in 1956 with a $5 million grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], the Council on Library Resources (CLR) was an independent coordinating body that aimed to address common problems faced by libraries in an era of explosive library growth and the emergence of new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC200591/?page=1 The Council on Library Resources]" (1961). ''Bulletin of the Medical Library Association'', 49(2), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Booker Wright|Louis B. Wright]], the director of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], was a principal figure in the organization's founding.&lt;ref name="CLIR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcum, Deanna B. (March 31, 1995).

===Commission on Preservation and Access===

The Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA) was established as a permanent body in 1986. It had its beginnings in the work of a task force on preservation and access that was one of several task forces formed jointly by the [[Association of American Universities]] and the Council on Library Resources, under the leadership of CLR president Warren J. Haas, who took office in 1978. Haas, who had previously headed the [[Columbia University Libraries]], was particularly attuned to the problem of the deteriorating condition of books and journals in library collections, and, in 1972, in response to failed efforts of the [[Association of Research Libraries]] to formulate a plan for collective action, had articulated recommendations for a national preservation program.&lt;ref&gt;Marcum, Deanna B. (1988). "[http://eric.ed.gov/?q=ED324006&amp;id=ED324006 President, Council on Library Resources]." In Martin M. Cummings (Ed.), ''Influencing Change in Research Librarianship: A Festschrift for Warren J. Haas''. Washington, DC: Council on Library Resources. p. 9-20; here: p. 11-12. Retrieved 27 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haas served as interim chair of the newly formed Commission, until the appointment of [[Patricia Battin]] as its first president in August 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Marcum (1988), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Digital Library Federation ===

A group of librarians working on projects to test the feasibility of using digital technology for preservation urged CPA to coordinate activities of a small but growing group of libraries that shared digital interests. The [[Digital Library Federation]] (DLF) grew out of informal discussions among eight librarians (the LaGuardia Eight, named after the meeting site at LaGuardia Airport). The group soon comprised 12 institutions that were committed to looking at the broader implications of digital technology. In 1994, the group called for a planning strategy for the development of digital libraries and began to organize themselves to continue local efforts while also sharing their findings.

At about the same time, LC announced its intention to create a national digital library. To ensure that their activities would be compatible with those of LC, the consortium asked LC and the National Archives to join in a new effort—the National Digital Library Federation. The CPA continued to serve as the administrative home for the group, whose name was soon shortened to Digital Library Federation.

'''''Cross Bearer''''' is a 2012 [[horror film]] written and directed by Adam Ahlbrandt.

== Plot ==

A fanatically religious homeless man ("Cross Bearer") rants about sinners, and after donning a makeshift mask made of cloths, uses a hammer to kill a drug addict. Elsewhere, Heather, a stripper, is shown living with her girlfriend Victoria, a controlling and drug-addicted single mother, who she is cheating on with a co-worker named Bunny. Dreaming of running away to Greece together, Heather and Bunny agree to do a drug run for their abusive boss, intent on stealing the money they get for the delivery.

Anton, the pimp who ordered the cocaine, lives on the top floor of an abandoned [[nightclub]], which he brings two prostitutes to. Cross Bearer follows the three up to Anton's room, murders them with his hammer, and takes Anton's gun. Heather, Bunny, Victoria, another stripper named Cindy, and Cindy's boyfriend Mark, an [[amateur film]]maker and pornographer, arrive, and are let in by Cross Bearer. The quintet finds Anton's remains, and are confronted by Cross Bearer, who shoots and beats Mark, and kills Cindy by emptying a bag of cocaine on her face.

Victoria goes to look for a way out on her own, and is chased to a dead end, where Cross Bearer bludgeons her, and rips her tongue out. Heather and Bunny become separated, and the latter is murdered. Cross Bearer goes after Heather, but is distracted by Mark, who shoots him with Anton's gun. After dealing with Mark, Cross Bearer pursues Heather, and the two fight, with Heather emerging victorious, pulling off Cross Bearer's mask, and pummeling him with a baseball bat. While looking for an exit, Heather finds the dying Mark, who gives her Anton's hidden stash of money.

In the morning, Heather goes to her workplace, gives a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] speech, and shoots both her boss, and a man who had [[Heckler|heckled]] her the previous day. Heather then goes to a train station with Victoria's baby, while back at the derelict nightclub, Cross Bearer recovers, and stumbles away while muttering, "Oh, loving Lord, guide my hand, so I may purify this Earthly paradise for your great return".

== Reception ==

''1nflux Magazine's'' Rob Rector gave ''Cross Bearer'' a B, and opened his review with, "There are many things you can overlook as a film reviewer if you know the people behind the camera have a clue. Such is the case for ''Cross Bearer'', a seedy little [[Independent film|indie]] horror flick that may have several shortcomings, but all which can be overlooked by the fact that you can feel the appreciation of the horror and [[grindhouse]] genres the film so skillfully captures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://1nfluxmagazine.com/cross-bearer-review/|title = ''Cross Bearer'' (Review)|last = Rector|first = Rob|publisher = ''1nflux Magazine''|date = |website = 1nfluxmagazine.com|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 4/5 was awarded by Matt Boiselle of [[Dread Central]], who praised the film's gore and killer, and wrote, "Ahlbrandt delivers on all fronts when it comes to not only delivering a storyline that hooks the audience, but providing a varied assortment of characters that we cannot wait to watch act out their most destructive vices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/55470/cross-bearer-2014/|title = ''Cross Bearer'' (2014)|last = Boiselle|first = Matt|publisher = Dread Central|date = 27 July 2014|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror News also responded well to the film, opining that, "''Cross Bearer'' has a lot of violence, sex, and nudity but still done under the microscope of a professional operation that knows how to make use of their budgets" and "At the end of the day, ''Cross Bearer'' is a dirty little film that is well shot and well presented. It looks good and keeps the action moving treating us to quite a few stripper moments to keep things lively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/88774/film-review-cross-bearer-2012/|title = Film Review: ''Cross Bearer'' (2012)|last = |first = |publisher = Horror News|date = 27 September 2014|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Dolan of ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'' gave the film a positive review, only criticizing the acting and "scatterbrained" structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rue-morgue.com/2012/09/blood-on-a-budget-the-pretty-and-the-putrid/|title = Blood on a Budget: The Pretty and the Putrid|last = Dolan|first = Patrick|publisher = ''Rue Morgue''|date = 5 September 2012|website = rue-morgue.com|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for ''[[Film Threat]]'', Mike Watt stated, "I wasn't in that much of a hurry to see yet another low-budget [[slasher film]], but ''Cross Bearer'' contains enough pitch-black moments that it rises above the majority of the mediocre movies sharing the subgenre that we've all endured over the years. Apart from a few padded sections of gleeful debauchery, ''Cross Bearer's'' tone is very bleak and the performances very realistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/64989/|title = ''Cross Bearer''|last = Watt|first = Mike|publisher = ''Film Threat''|date = 18 April 2013|website = filmthreat.com|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9074">The expression '''cultural jet lag''' (or '''cultural jetlag''') was first coined by Marc Perraud during his research into cross-cultural psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Perraud, Marc. Cultural Jet Lag in Third Culture Kids. nyc-o-time management consulting&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the expression as the ''phenomenon of partial socialization in adults born from bi-cultural/national unions and whose childhood was characterized by nomadic displacement during key personality developmental stages''. ''Jet'' symbolically designates international travel as the cause, ''cultural lag'' the resulting disconnect observed in these patients.

Originally the author used the expressions ''social jet lag'' and ''cultural jet lag'' interchangeably, however the expression ''social jet lag'' has since more widely become associated with an unrelated [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] and cultural jet lag has therefore become the conventional term. Cultural jet lag is sometimes just referred to by its initials: CJL. During some of the presentations of his research, Marc Perraud also coined the term ''cultural schizophrenia'' to explain the elements of confusion in children constantly exposed to changing cultural and moral environments. This expression is to be seen only as an attempt at vulgarization using popular imagery and does not refer to the actual accepted psychological definition, diagnosis or symptoms of clinical [[schizophrenia]]. 

Incidentally, the expression cultural jet lag was also used in the 1980s as a title for a comic strip [https://web.archive.org/web/20100228044623/http://www.jimsiergey.com/CulturalJetLag.htm], that focused on providing social commentary in the United States (featured in the ''[[Humor Times]]''). This title reflects the notions of distance between the author and the subject of his cultural satire but does not reflect the literal and total connotations of the definition cited prior. (disambiguation)

==People most commonly affected==
Cultural jet lag refers to the feeling of disconnect that [[Third Culture Kids]] (TCKs), as they have now become known, experience in relation to any culture, including the ones from which they stem. This disconnect, also present in Adult Third Culture Kids (ATCKs),&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell AB, Useem RH (1993).ATCKs have problems relating to their own ethnic groups. International Schools Services&lt;/ref&gt; applies to all the cultures to which they are/were exposed, whether it be their parents' cultures or those to which they were exposed during their upbringing through international travel.

==Symptoms and characteristics==
Third Culture Kids, those that were brought between countries, and in a bi-cultural environment, also referred to as [[global nomad]]s, typically experience varying degrees of cultural jet lag. While they exhibit high levels of [[cross-cultural]] competence (3C)—in that they are in tune with the different cultures between which they grew up, sometimes illustrating more astute understanding than mono-cultured counterparts because of their multiple referential points—they generally have the feeling that they remain outside the culture, looking in. They do not experience the same drives, desires and constraints as other non-TCK members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tckworld.com|title=TCKWorld: The Official Home of Third Culture Kids (TCKs)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their cultures and feel like constant spectators to any visceral dynamic (patriotism, identification, national pride, duty, allegiance, sports fan, political involvement etc.)

Cultural jet lag drives a disconnect that can have varying levels of sociability impact on the TCK depending on their character and their support structures (friends and family in particular). Research done at scenyc [http://www.scenyc.com], a company that regroups one of the largest concentration of TCKs (90% of employees), has shown that:
* All TCK employees exhibit some degree of cultural jet lag, while symptoms vary in breadth and intensity from person to person
* The cultural disconnect they experience with any ''mono-cultured person'', even well-travelled, makes their natural tendency to seek out and bond with others experiencing the same condition. This holds true in friendship, in love and in work relationships.
* CJL appears to increase the prevalence of certain psychological traits/abnormalities: [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] behavior, relationship and commitment difficulties, [[apathy]] and boredom, [[substance abuse]], [[social anxiety]] and malaise, light [[depression (mood)|depression]], and a shared feeling of ''lack of identity'', of ''referent'' and of ''ownership''.
* On the flip side CJL seems to pre-dispose individuals to develop and be rewarded for their unique perspective on the world. This manifests itself through a higher than usual prevalence artistic and creative activities: advertising, design, music, creative writing—all of which it is postulated require a certain abstraction from conventional social and cultural models. CJL also seems to predispose TCKs to educational fields and/or careers that directly tap into their global awareness and perspectives: international relations, humanitarian and strategic thinking

==Other similar cross-cultural phenomena==
Cultural jet lag is sometimes confused with several apparently close but dissimilar cross-cultural phenomena:
* [[Culture shock]]. Simply put, culture shock appears as a result of a discreet decision by an individual to travel abroad. CJL differs from culture shock in that it is not associated to a precise event but rather a lifelong condition linked to the particularities of an uprooted upbringing. CJL neither appears abruptly nor subsides over time, it is a state of being that characterizes those that have experienced a culturally de-structured upbringing. Someone's realization or third party diagnosis of CJL may be sudden, in the form of an "a-ha" moment, but he or she will quickly realize that it is simply an explanation of his or her state of being from as long as he or she can remember.
* CJL also differs from the cultural disconnect that remains between the [[expatriate]] and his host country once he or she has overcome the initial culture shock. Despite the feeling of disconnect with his host country, the expatriate will never feel lost for he or she still maintains a sense of bond to his or her original culture. Even if this bond dissipates slowly with time, the expatriate will never exhibit the same psychological symptoms as those that characterize CJL. This is because the expatriate will always rely on the psychological stability he or she developed based on a stable mono-cultural referential during key youth developmental stages.
* CJL also differs from what has been called [[reverse culture shock]],&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Julie and Linda Lankenau (Undated) "Third Culture Kids: Returning to their Passport Country." US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; the reaction caused by an expatriate returning to his or her home country after years of being abroad. As with the example described above, no one can suddenly experience cultural jet lag as its symptoms stem from an atypical developmental environment and not a situational stimuli during adulthood (i.e. after character formation maturity).

==Ongoing research==
Some high level research has been done on the Third Culture Kids [http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art3.html].&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell AB, Useem RH (1993). TCKs Experience Prolonged Adolescence. International Schools Services&lt;/ref&gt; However this research has primarily described attributes, anecdotes and summarized basic behavioral/sociological observations. While the serious study of the psychological mechanisms and impacts of cultural jet lag is still in its infancy, it has been brought to the forefront because of the impact globalization has had on the number of children and future adults that will experience CJL.

Research currently underway is testing the postulate that cultural jet lag stems from an atypical crystallization of the [[super-ego]] during the child developmental phases. While typical children inherit morals and values first from their parents and then from their environments in a second stage, culturally jet lagged children, devoid of a single moral and cultural referential in their environment, later develop an overstated role of [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] in their [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] balance (referring to [[Freudian]] theory).

Statistical research is also underway to identify the psychological impacts of CJL, in particular the:
* Prevalence of clinical psychological abnormalities in culturally jet lagged adults
* Preferred psychological coping mechanisms of culturally jet lagged adolescents
* Comparing the statistical distribution of [[Myers Briggs]] profiles in CJL adults vs. the general population

'''''DC One Million''''' is a [[comic book]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline that ran through a self-titled, weekly [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] and through special issues of almost all of the "DCU" titles published by American company [[DC Comics]] in November [[1998 in comics|1998]]. It featured a vision of the [[DC Universe]] in the 853rd century (85,201–85,300 AD), chosen because that is the century in which DC Comics would have published issue #1,000,000 of their comics if they had maintained a regular publishing schedule. The miniseries was written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Val Semeiks]].

==Setup==
The core of the event was a four-issue miniseries, in which the 20th-century [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] and the 853rd-century [[Justice Legion Alpha]] cooperate to defeat a plot by the supervillain [[Vandal Savage]] (who, being practically immortal, exists in both centuries as well as all the ones in between) and future [[Superman]] nemesis [[Solaris (comics)|Solaris]] the Living Sun. Thirty-four other series then being published by DC also put out a single issue numbered #1,000,000, which either showed its characters' involvement in the central plot or gave a glimpse of what its characters' descendants/successors would be doing in the 853rd century. ''[[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hitman]]'' #1,000,000 was essentially a [[parody]] of the entire storyline. A trade paperback collection was subsequently published, consisting of the four-issue mini-series, and tie-in issues necessary to follow the main plot. The series was then followed by a one-shot titled ''DC One Million 80-Page Giant'' #1,000,000 (1999), which was a collection of further adventures in the life of the future heroes.

==Plot==
In the 853rd century, the original [[Superman]] ("Superman-Prime One Million") [[All-Star Superman|still lives]], but has spent over fifteen thousand years in a self-imposed exile in his [[Fortress of Solitude]] in the heart of the Sun in order to keep it alive, during which everyone he knew and loved died.  One of his descendants is "[[Kal Kent]]", the Superman of the 853rd century.

The [[galaxy]] is protected by the Justice Legions, which were inspired by the 20th-century [[Justice League]] and the 31st-century [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], among others. [[Justice Legion Alpha]], which protects the [[solar system]], includes [[Kal Kent]] and future analogues of [[Wonder Woman]], [[Hourman]], [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], [[Aquaman]], [[the Flash]] and [[Batman]]. Advanced [[terraforming]] processes have made all the Solar System's planets habitable, with the ones most distant from the Sun being warmed by Solaris, a "star computer" which was once a villain but was reprogrammed by one of Superman's descendants.

Superman-Prime announces that he will soon return to humanity and, to celebrate, Justice Legion Alpha travels back in time to the late 20th century to meet Superman's original teammates in the JLA, and bring them and Superman to the future to participate in games and displays of power as part of the celebration.

Meanwhile, in [[Russia]], [[Vandal Savage]] single-handedly defeats the [[Teen Titans|Titans]] ([[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], [[Jesse Quick]] and [[Supergirl]]) when they attempt to stop him purchasing nuclear-powered [[Rocket Red]] suits. He then launches four Rocket Red suits (with a Titan trapped inside each of the four) in a nuclear strike on [[Washington D.C.]], [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], [[Brussels]] and [[Singapore]].

Unfortunately one member of the Justice Legion Alpha (the future [[Starman (comics)#Farris Knight|Starman]]) has been bribed into betraying his teammates by Solaris, who has returned to its old habits. Before the original heroes can be returned to their own time the future [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], an [[Android (robot)|android]], collapses and releases a [[virus]] programmed by Solaris to attack [[computer virus|machines]] and humans.

The virus affects the guidance systems of the Rocket Red suits and causes one of them to instead detonate over [[Montevideo]], killing over one million people. Tempest (the Titan inside) had escaped long before the suit exploded by using the ice that formed on the suit at high altitude, although he subsequently blacked out and fell into the sea. The virus also drives humans insane, causing an increase in anger and paranoia worldwide. Believing that this was deliberately planned by the JLA to stop him, Savage launches an all-out war on superhumans using "blitz engines" he had created and hidden while allied with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] during [[World War II]]. The paranoia caused by the virus also leads the Justice Legion Alpha and the contemporary heroes to attack each other, although the Justice Legion Alpha manage to coordinate themselves enough to stop the other Rocket Red suits from hitting their targets.

The remnants of the JLA that stayed in the present and the Justice Legion Alpha overcome their paranoia when the future Superman and [[Steel (comics)|Steel]] realize the significance of the symbol they both wear; as [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] had pointed out to Steel earlier, wearing the 'S' means that he has to make the hard choices. The two JLAs are eventually able to stop the virus when it is discovered that it is a complex [[computer program]] looking for appropriate hardware. To provide this hardware, the heroes are forced to build the body of Solaris (including in it a [[DNA]] sample of Superman's wife [[Lois Lane]]) and the virus flees from the Earth to this body, bringing Solaris to life. In a final act of repentance, the future Starman sacrifices himself to banish Solaris from the solar system. The future Superman forces himself through time using confiscated [[time travel]] technology he finds in the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]], almost dying in the process due to the drain on his powers.

Meanwhile, in the 853rd century, the original JLA are fighting an alliance between Solaris and Vandal Savage. Savage has found a sample of [[kryptonite]] on Mars (where it was left by the future Starman back in the 20th century), which he gives to Solaris. Savage has also hired [[Chronos (comics)#Walker Gabriel|Walker Gabriel]] to steal the time travel gauntlets of the 853rd century Flash ('''John Fox''') to ensure the Justice Legion Alpha remains trapped in the past. However, he ultimately double-crosses Gabriel.

Solaris, in a final attack, slaughters thousands of [[superhuman]]s so that it can fire the kryptonite into the sun and kill Superman-Prime before he emerges. The JLA's [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]] — a hero who uses a power that Solaris has never encountered before — causes Solaris to go [[supernova]] and he and the 853rd century Superman contain the resulting blast — but not before the kryptonite is released.

The future Vandal Savage teleports from [[Mars]] to [[Earth]] using the stolen Time-Gauntlets. It turns out, however, that Walker Gabriel and Mitch Shelley, the [[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]] (an immortal who had become Savage's greatest foe through the millennia), had sabotaged the Gauntlets so that Savage, instead of travelling only in space, also travels through time, arriving in Montevideo moments before the nuclear blast he caused centuries earlier, finally bringing his life to an end.

It is then revealed that a secret conspiracy—forewarned by the trouble in the 20th century, mainly in that Huntress, inspired by the time capsules which students in her class were currently making, realized they had centuries to foil the plot—has spent the intervening centuries coming up with a foolproof plan for stopping Solaris. Their actions included replacing the hidden kryptonite with a disguised [[Power ring (weapon)|Green Lantern power ring]], with which the original Superman emerges from the Sun and finishes off Solaris.

In the aftermath, the original Superman and the future Hourman use the DNA sample to recreate Lois Lane, complete with superpowers. Superman then also recreates [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], along with all its deceased inhabitants, in Earth's solar system, and live happily ever after with Lois.

==The Justice Legions==
There are twenty-four Justice Legions, each based on 20th- and 30th-century superhero teams. Those featured include:
* '''Justice Legion A''' is based on the [[Justice League]]. See main article [[Justice Legion Alpha]].
* '''Justice Legion B''' is based on the [[Teen Titans|Titans]]. Members include [[Nightwing]] (a batlike humanoid), [[Aqualad]] (a humanoid made from water), [[Donna Troy|Troy]] (a younger version of the 853rd century Wonder Woman), [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] (a robot) and [[Joto (comics)|Joto]] (killed in teleporter accident).
* '''Justice Legion L''' is based on the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and protects an artificially created planetary system (all that remains of the 30th Century United Planets). Members include Cosmicbot (a cyborg based on magnetism, modelled on [[Cosmic Boy]]), [[Titan Girl|Titangirl]] (the combined psychic energy of all [[Titan (moon)|Titanians]], based on [[Saturn Girl]]), Implicate Girl (who contains the abilities of all three trillion Carggites in her "third eye", very loosely based on [[Triad (comics)|Triplicate Girl]]), Brainiac 417 (a disembodied intelligence, based on [[Brainiac 5]] and [[Apparition (comics)|Apparition]]), the M'onelves (who combine the powers of [[Lar Gand|M'onel]] and [[Shrinking Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]]) and barely humanoid versions of [[Umbra (comics)|Umbra]] and [[Chameleon (DC Comics)|Chameleon]].
* '''Justice Legion S''' consists of numerous [[Kon-El|Superboy clones]], all with different powers. Members include Superboy 820 (with aquatic powers), Superboy 3541 (who can increase his size) and Superboy One Million (who can channel any of their powers through "the Eye"). They all (most notably One Million) resemble [[One-Man Army Corps|OMAC]] as much as Superboy. This was an intentional pun, as the title of the story was "One Million And Counting", which referred to the million clones and formed the OMAC acronym.
* '''Justice Legion T''' is based on [[Young Justice]]. Members include Superboy One Million (as referred to above), [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] the Toy Wonder (optimistic robot sidekick to the 853rd century Batman) and [[Impulse (comics)|Impulse]] (the living embodiment of random thoughts lost in the Speed Force).
* '''Justice Legion Z''' (for Zoomorphs) is based on the [[Legion of Super-Pets]]. Members include [[Proty]] One Million and [[Mister Mind|Master Mind]]. A version of [[Comet (DC Comics)|Comet the Super-Horse]] is also a member.

==Other characters==
Several other futuristic versions of DC characters appeared in the crossover, including:
* [[Atom (comics)|Atom]]
* [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]
* [[Booster Gold]]
* [[Catwoman]]
* Charade City
* [[Gunfire (comics)|Gunfire]]
* [[Lex Luthor]]
* [[Supergirl (Linda Danvers)|Supergirl]]
* [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]

==Later references==
In 2008, ten years after the crossover, an issue of ''[[Booster Gold#Publication history|Booster Gold]]'' (vol. 2) was published as ''Booster Gold'' #1,000,000 and was announced as an official ''DC One Million'' [[tie-in]] by DC Comics. This comic introduced Peter Platinum, the Booster Gold of the 853rd century.

[[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' miniseries made several references to the ''DC One Million'' miniseries. The Superman from ''DC One Million'' makes an appearance and the series ends with Superman becoming an energy being who resides in the Sun after his body has been supercharged with yellow solar energy (similar in appearance to Superman-Prime) and [[Solaris (DC comics)|Solaris]] makes an appearance as well.

Morrison's ''Batman'' #700 also briefly shows the One Million Batman and his sidekick—Robin, the Toy Wonder—alongside a number of future iterations of Batman.

The One Million Batman, Robin the Toy Wonder and One Million Superman play a significant role in ''Superman/Batman'' #79–80, in which [[Epoch (DC Comics)|Epoch]] battles Batmen and Supermen from various time periods.

By signing into your WBID account in-game, a One Million Version of Batman will be unlocked as a character skin in the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''.

'''Deconstruction''' is a critique of the relationship between text and meaning originated by the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Derrida's approach consisted in conducting readings of texts with an ear to what runs counter to the intended meaning or structural unity of a particular text. The purpose of deconstruction is to show that the usage of language in a given text, and language as a whole, are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. Throughout his readings, Derrida hoped to show deconstruction at work.

Many debates in [[continental philosophy]] surrounding [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[hermeneutics]], and philosophy of language refer to Derrida's observations. Since the 1980s, these observations inspired a range of theoretical enterprises in the humanities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deconstruction|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/155306/deconstruction|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the disciplines of law&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allison|first1=David B.|last2=Garver|first2=Newton|title=Speech and Phenomena and Other Essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs|date=1973|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston|isbn=0810103974|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2qdBeWFUmJQC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=8 September 2017|quote=A decision that did not go through the ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free decision, it would only be the programmable application or unfolding of a calculable process...[which] deconstructs from the inside every assurance of presence, and thus every criteriology that would assure us of the justice of the decision.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–76}}&lt;ref name="Bridge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Legal Studies Movement|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/bridge/CriticalTheory/critical2.htm|website=The Bridge|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Law Journal - Past Special Issues|url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/index.php?pageID=13&amp;vol=6&amp;no=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516144840/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/index.php?pageID=13&amp;vol=6&amp;no=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 May 2013|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Rosalind C.|title=Legacies of Derrida: Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=September 2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=355–389|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.36.081406.094357}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[historiography]],&lt;ref name="Munslow"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munslow|first1=Alan|title=Deconstructing History|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/4397/1/Deconstructing_History_by_Alun_Munslow___Institute_of_Historical_Research.pdf|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[linguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Busch|first1=Brigitta|title=The Linguistic Repertoire Revisited|url=http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/04/applin.ams056.full|website=Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 September 2017|pages=503–523|doi=10.1093/applin/ams056|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; sociolinguistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esch|first1=&amp;|last2=Solly|first2=Martin|title=The Sociolinguistics of Language Education in International Contexts|date=2012|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Bern|isbn=9783034310093|pages=31–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychoanalysis]], [[LGBT studies]], and the feminist school of thought.

While common in continental Europe (and wherever [[Continental philosophy]] is in the mainstream), deconstruction is not adopted or accepted by most [[philosophy]] departments in universities where [[analytic philosophy]] is predominant.

==Overview==
[[Jacques Derrida|Jacques Derrida's]] 1967 book ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' introduced the majority of ideas influential within deconstruction.&lt;ref name="Derrida"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derrida|first1=Jacques|last2=Spivak|first2=Gayatri Chakravorty|authorlink2=Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|title=[[Of Grammatology]]|date=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801858305}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} Derrida published a number of other works directly relevant to the concept of deconstruction. Books showing deconstruction in action or defining it more completely include ''[[Différance]]'', ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]'', and ''[[Writing and Difference]]''.

According to Derrida and taking inspiration from the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saussure|first1=Ferdinand de|authorlink=Ferdinand de Saussure|title=Course in General Linguistics|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dfoster/cf3324/saussure.htm|website=Southern Methodist University|publisher=New York Philosophical Library|accessdate=8 September 2017|location=New York|pages=121–122|date=1959|quote=In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system.}}&lt;/ref&gt; language as a system of signs and words only has meaning because of the contrast between these signs.&lt;ref name="Theory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deconstructionist Theory|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/derrida/rorty.html|website=Stanford Presidential Lectures and Symposia in the Humanities and Arts|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derrida"/&gt;{{rp|7, 12}} As [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]] contends, "words have meaning only because of contrast-effects with other words...no word can acquire meaning in the way in which philosophers from [[Aristotle]] to [[Bertrand Russell]] have hoped it might—by being the unmediated expression of something non-linguistic (e.g., an emotion, a sense-datum, a physical object, an idea, a [[Platonic Form]])".&lt;ref name="Theory"/&gt; As a consequence, meaning is never present, but rather is deferred to other signs. Derrida refers to the—in this view, mistaken—belief that there is a self-sufficient, non-deferred meaning as [[metaphysics of presence]]. A concept, then, must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as being/nothingness, normal/abnormal, speech/writing, etc.&lt;ref name="Writing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derrida|first1=Jacques|last2=Bass|first2=Alan|title=Writing and Difference|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0203991788|page=276|edition=New|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nsyH7x41RpsC&amp;pg=PA276|accessdate=8 September 2017|chapter=7 :Freud and the Scene of Writing|quote=The model of hieroglyphic writing assembles more strikingly—though we find it in every form of writing—the diversity of the modes and functions of signs in dreams. Every sign—verbal or otherwise—may be used at different levels, in configurations and functions which are never prescribed by its "essence," but emerge from a play of differences.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derrida2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derrida|first1=Jacques|title=Positions|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226143316|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}

Further, Derrida contends that "in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-a-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand": signified over signifier; intelligible over sensible; speech over writing; activity over passivity, etc. The first task of deconstruction would be to find and overturn these oppositions inside a text or a corpus of texts; but the final objective of deconstruction is not to surpass all oppositions, because it is assumed they are structurally necessary to produce sense. The oppositions simply cannot be suspended once and for all. The hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Deconstruction only points to the necessity of an unending analysis that can make explicit the decisions and arbitrary violence intrinsic to all texts.&lt;ref name="Derrida2"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

Finally, Derrida argues that it is not enough to expose and deconstruct the way oppositions work and then stop there in a nihilistic or cynical position, "thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively".&lt;ref name="Derrida2"/&gt;{{rp|42}} To be effective, deconstruction needs to create new terms, not to synthesize the concepts in opposition, but to mark their difference and eternal interplay. This explains why Derrida always proposes new terms in his deconstruction, not as a free play but as a pure necessity of analysis, to better mark the intervals. Derrida called undecidables—that is, unities of simulacrum—"false" verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition, but which, however, inhabit philosophical oppositions—resisting and organizing it—without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of Hegelian dialectics (e.g., [[différance]], [[archi-writing]], [[Pharmakon (philosophy)|pharmakon]], supplement, hymen, gram, spacing).&lt;ref name="Derrida2"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

==Influences==
Derrida's theories on deconstruction were themselves influenced by the work of linguists such as Ferdinand de Saussure (whose writings on [[semiotics]] also became a cornerstone of structuralist theory in the mid-20th century) and literary theorists such as [[Roland Barthes]] (whose works were an investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought). Derrida's views on deconstruction stood in opposition to the theories of structuralists such as psychoanalytic theorist [[Jacques Lacan]], and linguist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. However, Derrida resisted attempts to label his work as "[[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]]".{{Citation needed|reason=Correct but this entire paragraph needs references.|date=December 2013}}

===Influence of Nietzsche===
In order to understand Derrida's motivation, one must refer to Nietzsche's philosophy.

Nietzsche's project began with Orpheus, the man underground. This foil to Platonic light was deliberately and self-consciously lauded in ''Daybreak'', when Nietzsche announces, albeit retrospectively, "In this work you will discover a subterranean man at work", and then goes on to map the project of unreason: "All things that live long are gradually so saturated with reason that their origin in unreason thereby becomes improbable. Does not almost every precise history of an origination impress our feelings as paradoxical and wantonly offensive? Does the good historian not, at bottom, constantly contradict?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|last2=Clark|first2=Maudemarie|last3=Leiter|first3=Brian|last4=Hollingdale|first4=R.J.|title=Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521599636}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}

Nietzsche's point in ''Daybreak'' is that standing at the end of modern history, modern thinkers know too much to be deceived by the illusion of reason any more. Reason, logic, philosophy and science are no longer solely sufficient as the royal roads to truth. And so Nietzsche decides to throw it in our faces, and uncover the truth of Plato, that he—unlike Orpheus—just happened to discover his true love in the light instead of in the dark. This being merely one historical event amongst many, Nietzsche proposes that we revisualize the history of the West as the history of a series of political moves, that is, a manifestation of the will to power, that at bottom have no greater or lesser claim to truth in any noumenal (absolute) sense. By calling our attention to the fact that he has assumed the role of Orpheus, the man underground, in dialectical opposition to Plato, Nietzsche hopes to sensitize us to the political and cultural context, and the political influences that impact authorship. For example, the political influences that led one author to choose philosophy over poetry (or at least ''portray'' himself as having made such a choice), and another to make a different choice.

The problem with Nietzsche, as Derrida sees it, is that he did not go far enough. That he missed the fact that this will to power is itself but a manifestation of the operation of writing. And so Derrida wishes to help us step beyond Nietzsche's penultimate revaluation of all western values, to the ultimate, which is the final appreciation of "the role of writing in the production of knowledge".&lt;ref name="Zuckert"/&gt;

===Influence of Saussure===
Derrida approaches all texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all [[discourse]] has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of [[difference (philosophy)|difference]] inside a "system of distinct signs". This approach to text is influenced by the [[semiology]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Royle|first1=Nick|title=Jacques Derrida|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415229319|pages=6–623|edition=Reprint|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nNaSdb9VMTwC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derrida|first1=Jacques|last2=Ferraris|first2=Maurizio|title=A Taste for the Secret|date=2001|publisher=Wiley|location=|isbn=9780745623344|page=76|quote=I take great interest in questions of language and rhetoric, and I think they deserve enormous consideration; but there is a point where the authority of final jurisdiction is neither rhetorical nor linguistic, nor even discursive. The notion of trace or of text is introduced to mark the limits of the linguistic turn. This is one more reason why I prefer to speak of 'mark' rather than of language. In the first place the mark is not anthropological; it is prelinguistic; it is the possibility of language, and it is every where there is a relation to another thing or relation to an other. For such relations, the mark has no need of language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saussure is considered one of the fathers of [[structuralism]] when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Saussure explicitly suggested that linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, a science of signs in general, human codes being only one part. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, Saussure made linguistics "the regulatory model", and "for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone".&lt;ref name="Derrida2"/&gt;{{rp|21, 46, 101, 156, 164}} Derrida will prefer to follow the more "fruitful paths (formalization)" of a general semiotics without falling into what he considered "a hierarchizing teleology" privileging linguistics, and to speak of "mark" rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working everywhere there is a relation to something else.

==Deconstruction according to Derrida==

===Etymology===
Derrida's original use of the word "deconstruction" was a translation of ''[[Destruktion]]'', a concept from the work of [[Martin Heidegger]] that Derrida sought to apply to textual reading. Heidegger's term referred to a process of exploring the categories and concepts that tradition has imposed on a word, and the history behind them.&lt;ref name="Heidegger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin|last2=Macquarrie|first2=John|last3=Robinson|first3=Edward|title=Being and Time|date=2006|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9780631197706|pages=21–23|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S57m5gW0L-MC|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic philosophical concerns===
Derrida's concerns flow from a consideration of several issues:

# A desire to contribute to the re-evaluation of all Western values, a re-evaluation built on the 18th-century Kantian critique of pure reason, and carried forward to the 19th century, in its more radical implications, by [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].
# An assertion that texts outlive their authors, and become part of a set of cultural habits equal to, if not surpassing, the importance of authorial intent.
# A re-valuation of certain classic western dialectics: poetry vs. philosophy, reason vs. revelation, structure vs. creativity, [[episteme]] vs. [[techne]], etc.

To this end, Derrida follows a long line of modern philosophers, who look backwards to Plato and his influence on the Western metaphysical tradition.&lt;ref name="Zuckert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckert|first1=Catherine H.|title=Postmodern Platos: Nietzsche, Heidegger, Gadamer, Strauss, Derrida|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226993310|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}} Like Nietzsche, Derrida suspects Plato of dissimulation in the service of a political project, namely the education, through critical reflections, of a class of citizens more strategically positioned to influence the polis. However, like Nietzsche, Derrida is not satisfied merely with such a political interpretation of Plato, because of the particular dilemma modern humans find themselves in. His Platonic reflections are inseparably part of his critique of modernity, hence the attempt to be something beyond the modern, because of this Nietzschian sense that the modern has lost its way and become mired in nihilism.

===Différance===
{{Main|Différance}}
Différance is the observation that the meanings of words come from their [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchrony]] with other words within the language and their [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachrony]] between contemporary and historical definitions of a word. Understanding language, according to Derrida, requires an understanding of both viewpoints of linguistic analysis. The focus on diachrony has led to accusations against Derrida of engaging in the [[etymological fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soskice|first1=Janet Martin|title=Metaphor and Religious Language|date=1987|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198249825|pages=80–82|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one statement by Derrida—in an essay on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] in ''[[Of Grammatology]]''—which has been of great interest to his opponents.&lt;ref name="Derrida"/&gt;{{rp|158}} It is the assertion that "there is no outside-text" (''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''),&lt;ref name="Derrida"/&gt;{{rp|158–59, 163}} which is often mistranslated as "there is nothing outside of the text". The mistranslation is often used to suggest Derrida believes that nothing exists but words. [[Michel Foucault]], for instance, famously misattributed to Derrida the very different phrase "Il n'y a rien en dehors du texte" for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|last2=Howard|first2=Richard|last3=Cooper|first3=David|title=Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415253853|page=602|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Derrida, his statement simply refers to the unavoidability of context that is at the heart of différance.&lt;ref name="Limited"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derrida|first1=Jacques|title=[[Limited Inc]]|date=1995|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston|isbn=0810107880|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}}

For example, the word "house" derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from "shed", "mansion", "hotel", "building", etc. (Form of Content, that [[Louis Hjelmslev]] distinguished from Form of Expression) than how the word "house" may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e., the relationship between [[signified and signifier]]), with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition: when can we talk about a "house" or a "mansion" or a "shed"? The same can be said about verbs, in all the languages in the world: when should we stop saying "walk" and start saying "run"? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying "yellow" and start saying "orange", or exchange "past" for "present"? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance.

Thus, complete meaning is always "differential" and ''postponed'' in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word's definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries. Such a process would never end.

===Metaphysics of presence===
{{Main|Metaphysics of presence}}
Derrida describes the task of deconstruction as the identification of metaphysics of presence, or ''logocentrism'' in western philosophy. Metaphysics of presence is the desire for immediate access to meaning, the privileging of presence over absence. This means that there is an assumed bias in certain binary oppositions where one side is placed in a position over another, such as good over bad, speech over the written word, male over female. Derrida writes, "Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of ousia as parousia, on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite".&lt;ref name="Heidegger"/&gt;{{rp|29–67}} To Derrida, the central bias of logocentrism was the now being placed as more important than the future or past. This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who, in ''[[Being and Time]]'', claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as [[ready-to-hand]] and [[being-with]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Deconstruction and dialectics===
In the deconstruction procedure, one of the main concerns of Derrida is to not collapse into Hegel's dialectic, where these oppositions would be reduced to contradictions in a dialectic that has the purpose of resolving it into a synthesis.&lt;ref name="Derrida2"/&gt;{{rp|43}} The presence of Hegelian dialectics was enormous in the intellectual life of France during the second half of the 20th century, with the influence of Kojève and Hyppolite, but also with the impact of dialectics based on contradiction developed by Marxists, and including the existentialism of Sartre, etc. This explains Derrida's concern to always distinguish his procedure from Hegel's,&lt;ref name="Derrida2"/&gt;{{rp|43}} since Hegelianism believes binary oppositions would produce a synthesis, while Derrida saw binary oppositions as incapable of collapsing into a synthesis free from the original contradiction.

==Difficulty of definition==
There have been problems defining deconstruction. Derrida claimed that all of his essays were attempts to define what deconstruction is,&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|4}} and that deconstruction is necessarily complicated and difficult to explain since it actively criticises the very language needed to explain it.

===Derrida's "negative" descriptions===
Derrida has been more forthcoming with negative ([[wikt:apophatic|apophatic]]) than with positive descriptions of deconstruction. When asked by [[Toshihiko Izutsu]] some preliminary considerations on how to translate "deconstruction" in Japanese, in order to at least prevent using a Japanese term contrary to deconstruction's actual meaning, Derrida began his response by saying that such a question amounts to "what deconstruction is not, or rather ''ought'' not to be".&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=David|last2=Bernasconi|first2=Robert|title=Derrida and Sifférance|date=1988|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, Illinois|isbn=9780810107861|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

Derrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis, a critique, or a method&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} in the traditional sense that philosophy understands these terms. In these negative descriptions of deconstruction, Derrida is seeking to "multiply the cautionary indicators and put aside all the traditional philosophical concepts".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} This does not mean that deconstruction has absolutely nothing in common with an analysis, a critique, or a method, because while Derrida distances deconstruction from these terms, he reaffirms "the necessity of returning to them, at least under erasure".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Derrida's necessity of returning to a term [[sous rature|under erasure]] means that even though these terms are problematic we must use them until they can be effectively reformulated or replaced. The relevance of the tradition of negative theology to Derrida's preference for negative descriptions of deconstruction is the notion that a positive description of deconstruction would over-determine the idea of deconstruction and would close off the openness that Derrida wishes to preserve for deconstruction. If Derrida were to positively define deconstruction—as, for example, a critique—then this would make the concept of critique immune to itself being deconstructed. Some new philosophy beyond deconstruction would then be required in order to encompass the notion of critique.

====Not a method====
Derrida states that "Deconstruction is not a method, and cannot be transformed into one".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} This is because deconstruction is not a mechanical operation. Derrida warns against considering deconstruction as a mechanical operation, when he states that "It is true that in certain circles (university or cultural, especially in the United States) the technical and methodological "metaphor" that seems necessarily attached to the very word 'deconstruction' has been able to seduce or lead astray".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Commentator Richard Beardsworth explains that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Derrida is careful to avoid this term [method] because it carries connotations of a procedural form of judgement. A thinker with a method has already decided ''how'' to proceed, is unable to give him or herself up to the matter of thought in hand, is a functionary of the criteria which structure his or her conceptual gestures. For Derrida [...] this is irresponsibility itself. Thus, to talk of a method in relation to deconstruction, especially regarding its ethico-political implications, would appear to go directly against the current of Derrida's philosophical adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beardsworth|first1=Richard|title=Derrida &amp; The Political|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1134837380|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beardsworth here explains that it would be irresponsible to undertake a deconstruction with a complete set of rules that need only be applied as a method to the object of deconstruction, because this understanding would reduce deconstruction to a thesis of the reader that the text is then made to fit. This would be an irresponsible act of reading, because it becomes a prejudicial procedure that only finds what it sets out to find.

====Not a critique====
Derrida states that deconstruction is not a [[critique]] in the Kantian sense.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} This is because [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defines the term critique as the opposite of [[dogmatism]]. For Derrida, it is not possible to escape the dogmatic baggage of the language we use in order to perform a pure critique in the Kantian sense. Language is dogmatic because it is inescapably [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]. Derrida argues that language is inescapably metaphysical because it is made up of [[Sign (linguistics)|signifiers]] that only refer to that which transcends them—the signified.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In addition, Derrida asks rhetorically "Is not the idea of knowledge and of the acquisition of knowledge in itself metaphysical?"&lt;ref name="Allison"/&gt;{{rp|5}} By this, Derrida means that all claims to know something necessarily involve an assertion of the metaphysical type that something ''is'' the case somewhere. For Derrida the concept of neutrality is suspect and dogmatism is therefore involved in everything to a certain degree. Deconstruction can challenge a particular dogmatism and hence desediment dogmatism in general, but it cannot escape all dogmatism all at once.

====Not an analysis====
Derrida states that deconstruction is not an [[analysis]] in the traditional sense.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} This is because the possibility of analysis is predicated on the possibility of breaking up the text being analysed into elemental component parts. Derrida argues that there are no self-sufficient units of meaning in a text, because individual words or sentences in a text can only be properly understood in terms of how they fit into the larger structure of the text and language itself. For more on Derrida's theory of meaning see the article on [[différance]].

====Not post-structuralist====
Derrida states that his use of the word deconstruction first took place in a context in which "[[structuralism]] was dominant" and deconstruction's meaning is within this context. Derrida states that deconstruction is an "antistructuralist gesture" because "[s]tructures were to be undone, decomposed, desedimented". At the same time, deconstruction is also a "structuralist gesture" because it is concerned with the structure of texts. So, deconstruction involves "a certain attention to structures"&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|2}} and tries to "understand how an 'ensemble' was constituted".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} As both a structuralist and an antistructuralist gesture, deconstruction is tied up with what Derrida calls the "structural problematic".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|2}} The structural problematic for Derrida is the tension between genesis, that which is "in the essential mode of creation or movement", and structure: "systems, or complexes, or static configurations".&lt;ref name="Writing"/&gt;{{rp|194}} An example of genesis would be the [[sense|sensory]] [[idea]]s from which knowledge is then derived in the [[empirical]] [[epistemology]]. An example of structure would be a [[binary opposition]] such as [[good and evil]] where the meaning of each element is established, at least partly, through its relationship to the other element.

It is for this reason that Derrida distances his use of the term deconstruction from [[post-structuralism]], a term that would suggest that philosophy could simply go beyond structuralism. Derrida states that "the motif of deconstruction has been associated with 'post-structuralism{{' "}}, but that this term was "a word unknown in France until its 'return' from the United States".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;{{rp|3}} In his deconstruction of Husserl, Derrida actually argues {{em|for}} the contamination of pure origins by the structures of language and temporality. [[Manfred Frank]] has even referred to Derrida's work as "Neostructuralism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Manfred|title=What is Neostructuralism?|date=1989|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0816616027}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}

===Alternative definitions===
The popularity of the term deconstruction, combined with the technical difficulty of Derrida's primary material on deconstruction and his reluctance to elaborate his understanding of the term, has meant that many secondary sources have attempted to give a more straightforward explanation than Derrida himself ever attempted. Secondary definitions are therefore an interpretation of deconstruction by the person offering them rather than a summary of Derrida's actual position.

* [[Paul de Man]] was a member of the [[Yale School]] and a prominent practitioner of deconstruction as he understood it. His definition of deconstruction is that, "[i]t's possible, within text, to frame a question or undo assertions made in the text, by means of elements which are in the text, which frequently would be precisely structures that play off the rhetorical against grammatical elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moynihan|first1=Robert|title=A Recent imagining: interviews with Harold Bloom, Geoffrey Hartman, J. Hillis Miller, Paul De Man|date=1986|publisher=Archon Books|location=Hamden, Connecticut|isbn=9780208021205|page=156|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard Rorty]] was a prominent interpreter of Derrida's philosophy. His definition of deconstruction is that, "the term 'deconstruction' refers in the first instance to the way in which the 'accidental' features of a text can be seen as betraying, subverting, its purportedly 'essential' message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Peter|title=The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: From Formalism to Poststructuralism|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521300131|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[John D. Caputo]] attempts to explain deconstruction in a nutshell by stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whenever deconstruction finds a nutshell—a secure axiom or a pithy maxim—the very idea is to crack it open and disturb this tranquility. Indeed, that is a good rule of thumb in deconstruction. ''That'' is what deconstruction is all about, its very meaning and mission, if it has any. One might even say that cracking nutshells is what deconstruction ''is''. In a nutshell. ...Have we not run up against a paradox and an [[aporia]] [something contradictory]...the paralysis and impossibility of an aporia is just what impels deconstruction, what rouses it out of bed in the morning..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caputo|first1=John D.|title=Deconstruction in a Nutshell: A Conversation with Jacques Derrida|date=1997|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780823217557|page=32|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Niall Lucy]] points to the impossibility of defining the term at all, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;"While in a sense it ''is'' impossibly difficult to define, the impossibility has less to do with the adoption of a position or the assertion of a choice on deconstruction's part than with the impossibility of every 'is' as such. Deconstruction begins, as it were, from a refusal of the authority or determining power of every 'is', or simply from a refusal of authority in general. While such refusal may indeed count as a position, it is not the case that deconstruction holds this as a sort of 'preference' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucy|first1=Niall|title=A Derrida DIctionary|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=1405137517}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* David B. Allison is an early translator of Derrida and states, in the introduction to his translation of ''Speech and Phenomena'': &lt;blockquote&gt;[Deconstruction] signifies a project of critical thought whose task is to locate and 'take apart' those concepts which serve as the axioms or rules for a period of thought, those concepts which command the unfolding of an entire epoch of metaphysics. 'Deconstruction' is somewhat less negative than the Heideggerian or Nietzschean terms 'destruction' or 'reversal'; it suggests that certain foundational concepts of metaphysics will never be entirely eliminated...There is no simple 'overcoming' of metaphysics or the language of metaphysics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Paul Ricœur]] defines deconstruction as a way of uncovering the questions behind the answers of a text or tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Anne Carolyn|title=Meeting the Great Bliss Queen: Buddhists, Feminists, and the Art of the Self|date=1994|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807073063}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}
* Richard Ellmann defines 'deconstruction' as the systematic undoing of understanding.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

A survey of the secondary literature reveals a wide range of heterogeneous arguments. Particularly problematic are the attempts to give neat introductions to deconstruction by people trained in literary criticism who sometimes have little or no expertise in the relevant areas of philosophy that Derrida is working in. These secondary works (e.g. ''Deconstruction for Beginners''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=Jim|title=Deconstruction for Beginners|date=2005|publisher=Writers and Readers Publishing|location=Danbury, Connecticut|isbn=0863169988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}} and ''Deconstructions: A User's Guide'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Royle|first1=Nicholas|title=Deconstructions: A User's Guide|date=2000|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|isbn=0333717619}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}} have attempted to explain deconstruction while being academically criticized as too far removed from the original texts and Derrida's actual position.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Application==
Derrida's observations have greatly influenced literary criticism and post-structuralism.

===Literary criticism===
Derrida's method consisted of demonstrating all the forms and varieties of the originary complexity of [[semiotics]], and their multiple consequences in many fields. His way of achieving this was by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, with an ear to what in those texts runs counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the [[aporia]]s and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways that this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sallis|first1=John|authorlink=John Sallis|title=Deconstruction and Philosophy: The Texts of Jacques Derrida|date=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226734390|pages=3–4|edition=Paperback|quote=One of the more persistent misunderstandings that has thus far forestalled a productive debate with Derrida's philosophical thought is the assumption, shared by many philosophers as well as literary critics, that within that thought just anything is possible. Derrida's philosophy is more often than not construed as a license for arbitrary free play in flagrant disregard of all established rules of argumentation, traditional requirements of thought, and ethical standards binding upon the interpretative community. Undoubtedly, some of the works of Derrida may not have been entirely innocent in this respect, and may have contributed, however obliquely, to fostering to some extent that very misconception. But deconstruction which for many has come to designate the content and style of Derrida's thinking, reveals to even a superficial examination, a well-ordered procedure, a step-by-step type of argumentation based on an acute awareness of level-distinctions, a marked thoroughness and regularity. [...] Deconstruction must be understood, we contend, as the attempt to "account," in a certain manner, for a heterogeneous variety or manifold of nonlogical contradictions and discursive equalities of all sorts that continues to haunt and fissure even the ''successful'' development of philosophical arguments and their systematic exposition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deconstruction denotes the [[Hermeneutics|pursuing of the meaning]] of a text to the point of exposing the supposed contradictions and internal oppositions upon which it is founded—supposedly showing that those foundations are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. It is an approach that may be deployed in philosophy, in [[literary analysis]], and even in the analysis of scientific writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobson|first1=Marian|author-link=Marian Hobson|title=Jacques Derrida: Opening Lines|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134774449|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kl146cNpzNQC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deconstruction generally tries to demonstrate that any text is not a discrete whole but contains several irreconcilable and contradictory meanings; that any text therefore has more than one interpretation; that the text itself links these interpretations inextricably; that the incompatibility of these interpretations is irreducible; and thus that an interpretative reading cannot go beyond a certain point. Derrida refers to this point as an "aporia" in the text; thus, deconstructive reading is termed "aporetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Currie|first1=M.|title=The Invention of Deconstruction|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137307033|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i3ecdVgknGkC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He insists that meaning is made possible by the relations of a word to other words within the network of structures that language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mantzavinos|first1=C.|title=Hermeneutics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/#Semiotics|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida initially resisted granting to his approach the overarching name "deconstruction", on the grounds that it was a precise technical term that could not be used to characterize his work generally. Nevertheless, he eventually accepted that the term had come into common use to refer to his textual approach, and Derrida himself increasingly began to use the term in this more general way.

Derrida's deconstruction strategy is also used by [[Postmodernism|postmodernists]] to locate meaning in a text rather than discover meaning due to the position that it has multiple readings. There is a focus on the deconstruction that denotes the tearing apart of a text to find arbitrary hierarchies and presuppositions for the purpose of tracing contradictions that shadow a text's coherence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Undermining of Beliefs in the Autonomy and Rationality of Consumers|last=O'Shaughnessy|first=John|last2=O'Shaughnessy|first2=Nicholas Jackson|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0415773237|location=Oxon|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the meaning of a text does not reside with the author or the author's intentions because it is dependent on the interaction between reader and text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even the process of [[translation]] is also seen as transformative since it "modifies the original even as it modifies the translating language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deconstruction and Translation|last=Davis|first=Kathleen|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781900650281|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of structuralism===
Derrida's lecture at [[Johns Hopkins University]], "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences]]", often appears in collections as a manifesto against structuralism. Derrida's essay was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist. Structuralism viewed language as a number of signs, composed of a signified (the meaning) and a signifier (the word itself). Derrida proposed that signs always referred to other signs, existing only in relation to each other, and there was therefore no ultimate foundation or centre. This is the basis of [[différance]].&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" (1966), as printed/translated by Macksey &amp; Donato (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development after Derrida==

===The Yale School===
{{Further|Yale school}}
Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, many thinkers were influenced by deconstruction, including [[Paul de Man]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]], and [[J. Hillis Miller]]. This group came to be known as the [[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale school]] and was especially influential in [[literary criticism]]. Derrida and Hillis Miller were subsequently affiliated with the [[University of California Irvine|University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tisch|first1=Maude|title=A critical distance|url=http://yaleherald.com/news-and-features/a-critical-distance/|website=The Yale Herald|accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller has described deconstruction this way: "Deconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text, but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself. Its apparently solid ground is no rock, but thin air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=J. Hillis|title=STEVENS' ROCK AND CRITICISM AS CURE: In Memory of William K. Wimsatt (1907-1975)|journal=The Georgia Review|date=1976|volume=30|issue=1|pages=5–31|doi=10.2307/41399571|jstor=41399571|issn=0016-8386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical legal studies movement===
{{Further|Critical legal studies}}
Arguing that law and politics cannot be separated, the founders of the "Critical Legal Studies Movement" found it necessary to criticize the absence of the recognition of this inseparability at the level of theory. To demonstrate the [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminacy]] of legal doctrine, these scholars often adopt a method, such as [[structuralism]] in [[linguistics]], or deconstruction in [[Continental philosophy]], to make explicit the deep structure of categories and tensions at work in legal texts and talk. The aim was to deconstruct the tensions and procedures by which they are constructed, expressed, and deployed.

For example, [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]], in explicit reference to semiotics and deconstruction procedures, maintains that various legal doctrines are constructed around the binary pairs of opposed concepts, each of which has a claim upon intuitive and formal forms of reasoning that must be made explicit in their meaning and relative value, and criticized. Self and other, private and public, subjective and objective, freedom and control are examples of such pairs demonstrating the influence of opposing concepts on the development of legal doctrines throughout history.&lt;ref name="Bridge"/&gt;

===''Deconstructing History''===
Deconstructive readings of history and sources have changed the entire discipline of history. In ''Deconstructing History'', [[Alun Munslow]] examines history in what he argues is a postmodern age. He provides an introduction to the debates and issues of postmodernist history. He also surveys the latest research into the relationship between the past, history, and historical practice, as well as articulating his own theoretical challenges.&lt;ref name="Munslow"/&gt;

===''The Inoperative Community''===
[[Jean-Luc Nancy]] argues, in his 1982 book ''The Inoperative Community'', for an understanding of community and society that is undeconstructable because it is prior to conceptualisation. Nancy's work is an important development of deconstruction because it takes the challenge of deconstruction seriously and attempts to develop an understanding of political terms that is undeconstructable and therefore suitable for a philosophy after Derrida.

===''The Ethics of Deconstruction''===
[[Simon Critchley]], an English philosopher, argues, in his 1992 book ''The Ethics of Deconstruction'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Critchley|first1=Simon|authorlink=Simon Critchley|title=The Ethics of Deconstruction: Derrida and Levinas|date=2014|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780748689323|page=352|edition=3rd|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/book/9780748689323 |accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Derrida's deconstruction is an intrinsically ethical practice. Critchley argues that deconstruction involves an openness to the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] that makes it ethical in the [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinasian]] understanding of the term.

===''Derrida and the Political''===
Jacques Derrida has had a great influence on contemporary political theory and political philosophy. Derrida's thinking has inspired [[Slavoj Žižek|Slavoj Zizek]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], [[Judith Butler]] and many more contemporary theorists who have developed a deconstructive approach to politics. Because deconstruction examines the internal logic of any given text or discourse it has helped many authors to analyse the contradictions inherent in all schools of thought; and, as such, it has proved revolutionary in political analysis, particularly ideology critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McQuillan|first1=Martin|title=The Politics of Deconstruction: Jacques Derrida and the Other of Philosophy|date=2007|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=0745326749|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}

Richard Beardsworth, developing from Critchley's ''Ethics of Deconstruction'', argues, in his 1996 ''Derrida and the Political'', that deconstruction is an intrinsically political practice. He further argues that the future of deconstruction faces a perhaps undecidable choice between a [[deconstruction-and-religion|theological]] approach and a technological approach, represented first of all by the work of [[Bernard Stiegler]].

==Criticisms==
Derrida was involved in a number of high-profile disagreements with prominent philosophers, including [[Michel Foucault]], [[John Searle]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Peter Kreeft]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. Most of the criticism of deconstruction were first articulated by these philosophers and repeated elsewhere.

===John Searle===
{{See also|Limited Inc.}}
In the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with [[Jacques Derrida]] regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points.&lt;ref name="Limited"/&gt;{{rp|29}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Footnote provided only sources half the claim.--&gt; Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection ''[[Limited Inc]]''. Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy, or even intelligible writing, and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by paying any attention to it. Consequently, some critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maclachlan|first1=Ian|title=Jacques Derrida: Critical Thought|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=0754608069}}&lt;/ref&gt; have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others&lt;ref name="Alfino"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alfino|first1=Mark|title=Another Look at the Derrida-Searle Debate|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|date=1991|volume=24|issue=2|pages=143–152|doi=10.2307/40237667|jstor=10.2307/40237667}}&lt;/ref&gt; have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that "It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was "the only sentence of the 'reply' to which I can subscribe".&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Glendinning]]. 2001. ''Arguing with Derrida''. Wiley-Blackwell. p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] philosophies.

The debate began in 1972, when, in his paper "Signature Event Context", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the [[Illocutionary act|illocutionary act]]. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes "force", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. Derrida argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a "structure of absence" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by "iterability" (the constraints on what can be said, imposed by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on [[intentionality]] in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious, or "parasitic" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres as governed by different structures of meaning, or hadn't considered them due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, "Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Campbell. 1993. "John R. Searle" in Irene Rima Makaryk (ed). Encyclopedia of contemporary literary theory: approaches, scholars, terms. University of Toronto Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "Reiterating the Différences: A Reply to Derrida", Glyph 2 (Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus.&lt;ref name="Alfino"/&gt; This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with [[wikt:phenomenological|phenomenological]] perspectives on intentionality.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;Marian Hobson. 1998. Jacques Derrida: opening lines. Psychology Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;95-97&lt;/ref&gt; Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on Derrida's having misunderstood Austin's [[type–token distinction]] and having failed to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to [[performativity]]. Some critics&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.

Derrida, in his response to Searle ({{nowrap|"a b c ..."}} in ''Limited Inc''), ridiculed Searle's positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, Derrida suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a ''société à responsabilité limitée'' (a "[[limited liability company]]") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to "normality" in the analytical tradition to be problematic.&lt;ref name="Limited"/&gt;{{rp|133}}&lt;ref name="Alfino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farrell|first1=Frank B.|title=Iterability and Meaning: The Searle-Derrida Debate|journal=Metaphilosophy|date=1 January 1988|volume=19|issue=1|pages=53–64|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1988.tb00701.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9973.1988.tb00701.x/abstract|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en|issn=1467-9973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fish|first1=Stanley E.|title=With the Compliments of the Author: Reflections on Austin and Derrida|journal=Critical Inquiry|date=1982|volume=8|issue=4|pages=693–721|doi=10.2307/1343193|jstor=10.2307/1343193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Edmond|title=Derrida, Searle, Contexts, Games, Riddles|journal=[[New Literary History]]|date=1982|volume=13|issue=3|pages=463–477|doi=10.2307/468793|jstor=10.2307/468793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culler|first1=Jonathan|title=Convention and Meaning: Derrida and Austin|journal=New Literary History|date=1981|volume=13|issue=1|pages=15–30|doi=10.2307/468640|jstor=10.2307/468640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenaan|first1=Hagi|title=Language, philosophy and the risk of failure: rereading the debate between Searle and Derrida|journal=Continental Philosophy Review|date=2002|volume=35|issue=2|pages=117–133|doi=10.1023/A:1016583115826|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/dwu9j5cx8ft1jum8/|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raffel|first1=Stanley|title=Understanding Each Other: The Case of the Derrida-Searle Debate|journal=Human Studies|date=28 July 2011|volume=34|issue=3|pages=277–292|doi=10.1007/s10746-011-9189-6|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x16m6724k5513827/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debate, Derrida praised Austin's work, but argued that Austin is wrong to banish what Austin calls "infelicities" from the "normal" operation of language. One "infelicity", for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is "sincere" or "merely citational" (and therefore possibly ironic). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily "citational", due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for attempting to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible "intention". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow from a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.

Derrida argued against the constant appeal to "normality" in the analytical tradition of which Austin and Searle were paradigmatic examples.&lt;ref name="Limited"/&gt;{{rp|133}}

{{quotation| In the description of the structure called "normal," "normative," "central," "ideal,"this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility. The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident-marginal or parasitic. It cannot be, and hence ought not to be, and this passage from can to ought reflects the entire difficulty. In the analysis of so-called normal cases, one neither can nor ought, in all theoretical rigor, to exclude the possibility of transgression. Not even provisionally, or out of allegedly methodological considerations. It would be a poor method, since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensably about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general.}}

Derrida argued that it was problematic to establish the relation between "nonfiction or standard discourse" and "fiction," defined as its "parasite, "for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place—and in so doing to "de-essentialize" itself as it were".&lt;ref name="Limited"/&gt;{{rp|133}}
He would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:&lt;ref name="Limited"/&gt;{{rp|133}}
{{quotation|what is "nonfiction standard discourse," what must it be and what does this name evoke, once its fictionality or its fictionalization, its transgressive "parasitism," is always possible (and moreover by virtue of the very same words, the same phrases, the same grammar, etc.)?
&lt;br&gt; This question is all the more indispensable since the rules, and even the statements of the rules governing the relations of "nonfiction standard discourse" and its fictional"parasites," are not things found in nature, but laws, symbolic inventions, or conventions, institutions that, in their very normality as well as in their normativity, entail something of the fictional.}}

In 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in ''The Construction of Social Reality''. He called Derrida's conclusion "preposterous" and stated that "Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Searle|first1=John R.|title=The Construction of Social Reality|date=1995|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0029280451|pages=157–160|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase "''il n'y a pas dehors du texte''," ("There is no outside-text") which appears in Derrida's ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.&lt;ref name="Derrida"/&gt;{{rp|158–159}}

===Jürgen Habermas===
In ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'', [[Jürgen Habermas]] criticized what he considered Derrida's opposition to [[Rationality|rational discourse]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|last2=Lawrence|first2=Frederick|title=The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures|date=2005|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0745608302|pages=185–210|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, in an essay on religion and religious language, Habermas criticized Derrida's insistence on [[etymology]] and [[philology]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (see ''[[Etymological fallacy]]'').

===Walter A. Davis===
The American philosopher [[Walter A. Davis]], in ''Inwardness and Existence: Subjectivity in/and Hegel, Heidegger, Marx and Freud'', argues that both deconstruction and structuralism are prematurely arrested moments of a dialectical movement that issues from Hegelian "unhappy consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|authorlink=Walter A. Davis|title=Inwardness and Existence: Subjectivity In/and Hegel, Heidegger, Marx, and Freud|date=1989|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=0299120147|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

===In popular media===
Popular criticism of deconstruction intensified following the [[Sokal affair]], which many people took as an indicator of the quality of deconstruction as a whole, despite the absence of Derrida from Sokal's follow-up book ''[[Impostures Intellectuelles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan D.|title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|website=www.physics.nyu.edu|accessdate=3 April 2007|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chip Morningstar]] holds a view critical of deconstruction, believing it to be ''epistemologically challenged''. He claims the humanities are subject to isolation and genetic drift due to their unaccountability to the world outside academia. During the Second International Conference on Cyberspace (Santa Cruz, California, 1991), he reportedly heckled deconstructionists off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinberg|first1=Steve|title=Hype List|url=https://www.wired.com/1993/01/hypelist-19/|website=WIRED|accessdate=19 May 2017|date=1 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently presented his views in the article "How to Deconstruct Almost Anything", where he stated, "Contrary to the report given in the 'Hype List' column of issue #1 of Wired ('Po-Mo Gets Tek-No', page 87), we did not shout down the postmodernists.  We made fun of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morningstar|first1=Chip|title=How To Deconstruct Almost Anything: My Postmodern Adventure|url=ftp://ftp.metalab.unc.edu/pub/academic/communications/papers/habitat/deconstr.rtf|date=1993-07-05|accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eckhaus Latta''' is a bi-coastal [[American culture|American]] fashion brand. Eckhaus Latta was founded by Zoe Latta and Mike Eckhaus in 2011. Eckhaus Latta is a young label recognized across the spectrums of the fashion, entertainment, and arts industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Karin |title=Clothes Call |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/eckhaus-latta-designers |website=W Magazine |publisher=W Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is known for their use of unexpected materials, exploring texture and tactility in their designs, and for incorporating writing, performance, and video into their practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lew |first1=Christopher Y. |title=Group Dynamics |url=https://whitney.org/essays/eckhaus-latta |publisher=Whitney Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Eckhaus Latta opened a show, ''Possessed'', at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]], the  first fashion-related exhibition at the museum in 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Halabin |first1=Layla |title=Eckhaus Latta is showing the first fashion-related exhibition at the Whitney in 21 years |url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/05/29/eckhaus-latta-possesed-fashion-exhibition-whitney-museum |website=thefader.com |publisher=The Fader}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label previously exhibited their work, a sculptural collage of fashion, fine art, and video, in group shows at the [[Hammer Museum]], (2016) and [[MoMA PS1]], (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yotka |first1=Steff |title=Contemporary Fashion Finds a New Home at MoMA PS1 |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/moma-ps1-greater-new-york-fashion-eckhaus-latta |website=Vogue |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eckhaus Latta - Hammer Museum |url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/smile/#gallery_8d869c77f18e1f6f51919838db43ab295eebaf4c |website=The Hammer Museum |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Eckhaus Latta was nominated for the 2018 Edition of the [[LVMH|LVMH Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eckhaus Latta |url=http://www.lvmhprize.com/designer/eckhaus-latta/ |website=LVMH Prize |publisher=LVMH}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are known for collaborating with other artists.

==History==
Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta met as students at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], where Mike studied sculpture and Zoe textiles. In 2010, Eckhaus moved to NYC and began working as an accessories designer at Marc by [[Marc Jacobs]] while Latta ran a textiles business, Ruth Prince, selling prints to designers such as [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Proenza Schouler]] while designing knits for [[Opening Ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fernandez |first1=Chantal |title=Eckhaus Latta, Beyond the Fringe |url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/eckhaus-latta-beyond-the-fringe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking to move beyond the somewhat restricted commercial environments in which they worked, Eckhaus and Latta decided to design a collection together.

==Collaborators==
Eckhaus Latta habitually collaborates with those they find inspiring, from putting artists' sculptures into their store, to commissioning the furniture in their Los Angeles retail store, to working with [[Camper (company)|Camper]] on a line of footwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sidell |first1=Misty |title=Eckhaus Latta to Partner With Camper |url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/eckhaus-latta-partner-camper-10482504/ |website=WWD.com |publisher=WWD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhaus Latta amplifies their peers and engages in a spectrum of collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Colman |first1=David |title=Who Wore It Better: Art or Commerce? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/style/eckhaus-latta-whitney.html |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helen Duncan fake ectoplasm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Helen Duncan]] was well known for using dolls and other [[theatrical property|props]] as ectoplasm in her séances.]]

'''Ectoplasm''' (from the Greek ''ektos'', meaning "outside", and ''plasma'', meaning "something formed or molded") is a term used in [[spiritualism]] to denote a substance or [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] "exteriorized" by physical [[mediumship|mediums]]. It was coined in 1894 by psychical researcher [[Charles Richet]].&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Jan Dirk. (2010). ''A Dictionary of Hallucinations''.

==Phenomenon==
In spiritualism, ectoplasm is said to be formed by [[Mediumship#Physical mediumship|physical mediums]] when in a trance state. This material is excreted as a gauze-like substance from orifices on the medium's body and spiritual entities are said to drape this substance over their nonphysical body, enabling them to interact in the physical and real universe. Some accounts claim that ectoplasm begins clear and almost invisible, but darkens and becomes visible, as the psychic energy becomes stronger. Still other accounts state that in extreme cases ectoplasm will develop a strong odor. According to some mediums, the ectoplasm cannot occur in light conditions as the ectoplasmic substance would disintegrate.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Joad]]. (2005). ''Guide to Modern Thought'' Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researcher [[Gustav Geley]] defined ectoplasm as being “very variable in appearance, being sometimes vaporous, sometimes a plastic paste, sometimes a bundle of fine threads, or a membrane with swellings or fringes, or a fine fabric-like tissue”.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Christian Barnard. (1933). ''The Supernormal: A Critical Introduction to Psychic Science''. London: Rider &amp; Co., Print&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] described ectoplasm as “a viscous, gelatinous substance which appeared to differ from every known form of matter in that it could solidify and be used for material purposes”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1930). ''The Edge of the Unknown''. New York:  G.P. Putnam’s Sons, Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Science does not accept the physical existence of ectoplasm, and some tested samples purported to be ectoplasm have been found to be various non-paranormal substances.&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;{{cite book| last = Keene

Peterson, [http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/mysterious_beings_or_mere_accidents/ "Mysterious Beings or Mere Accidents?"], ''Skeptical Briefs'' newsletter, June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ectenic force==
[[File:Ektoplasma.gif|thumb|170px|[[Eva Carrière]] and supposed ectoplasm (1912)]]
The idea of ectoplasm was merged into the notion of an "ectenic force" by some early psychical researchers who were seeking a physical explanation for reports of [[psychokinesis]] in [[séance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Randall. (1982). ''Psychokinesis: a study of paranormal forces through the ages''. Souvenir Press. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Its existence was initially hypothesized by Count [[Agenor de Gasparin]], to explain the phenomena of [[Table-turning|table turning]] and tapping during séances. Ectenic force was named by de Gasparin's colleague M. Thury, a professor of natural history at the Academy of Geneva. Between them, de Gasparin and Thury conducted a number of experiments in ectenic force, and claimed some success. Their work was not independently verified.&lt;ref name=Blavatsky1&gt;[[Madame Blavatsky|Blavatsky H. P.]] "ISIS UNVEILED: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology", Theosophical University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=randi1&gt;(Paperback) Randi, James. Clarke, Arthur C. (1997-03-15) ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural'', St. Martin's Griffin, {{ISBN|0-312-15119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other psychical researchers who studied mediumship speculated that within the human body an unidentified [[fluid]] termed the "psychode", "psychic force" or "[[ecteneic force]]" existed and was capable of being released to influence matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hamlin Garland]]. (1936). ''Forty years of psychic research: a plain narrative of fact''. pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (2003). ''An Encyclopaedia of Occultism''. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; This view was held by [[Camille Flammarion]]&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Prevost Battersby. (1988). ''Psychic Certainties''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Crookes]], however a later psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] pointed out that the fluid was hypothetical and has never been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington]]. (2003). ''Eusapia Palladino and Her Phenomena''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical investigator W. J. Crawford (1881–1920) had claimed that a fluid substance was responsible for [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] of objects after witnessing the medium [[Kathleen Goligher]]. Crawford, after witnessing a number of her séances, claimed to have obtained flashlight [[photographs]] of the substance; he later described the substance as "plasma". He claimed the substance is not visible to the naked eye but can be felt by the body.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard M. L. Ernst, Hereward Carrington. (2003). ''Houdini and Conan Doyle: The Story of a Strange Friendship''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist and psychical researcher [[Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe]] later investigated the medium [[Kathleen Goligher]] at many sittings and arrived at the opposite conclusions to Crawford; according to D'Albe, no [[paranormal]] phenomena such as levitation had occurred with Goligher and stated he had found evidence of fraud. D'Albe claimed the substance in the photographs of Crawford was ordinary [[muslin]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. (2005). ''A Survey of the Occult''. p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Jolly. (2006). ''Faces of the Living Dead: The Belief in Spirit Photography''. Miegunyah Press. pp. 84-86. {{ISBN|978-0712348997}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a séance D'Albe had observed white muslin between Goligher's feet.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe. (1922). ''The Goligher Circle''. J. M. Watkins. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
[[File:Seance Doll.jpg|thumb|right|A photograph of the medium Linda Gazzera with a doll portrayed as ectoplasm]]
[[File:Helen-duncan-platexi.jpg|thumb|left|260x260px|[[Helen Duncan]] with supposed ectoplasm, analysed by [[Harry Price]] to be made of cheesecloth and a rubber glove]]

Ectoplasm on many occasions has been proven to be fraudulent. Many mediums had used methods of swallowing and regurgitating cheesecloth, textile products smoothed with [[potato starch]] and in other cases the ectoplasm was made from paper, cloth and [[egg white]] or butter muslin.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]]. (1975). ''Beware Familiar Spirits''. Scribner. p. 142. {{ISBN|978-0684161815}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Renée Haynes]]. (1982). ''The Society for Psychical Research, 1882-1982: A History''. Macdonald. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-0356078755}} "The most usual material for 'ectoplasm' however, seemed to be butter muslin or cheesecloth, probably swallowed and regurgitated."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]]. (1994). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. Guinness World Records Limited. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-0851127484}} "Fraudulent mediums were known to produce ectoplasm composed of nothing more than strips of muslin, or mixtures of soap, gelatin and egg white."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brad Clark. (2002). ''Spiritualism''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 220-226. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] investigations into [[mediumship]] exposed many fraudulent mediums which contributed to the decline of interest in physical mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]]. (1994). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. Guinness Publishing. p. 311. {{ISBN|978-0851127484}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, [[Hereward Carrington]] exposed the tricks of fraudulent mediums such as those used in slate-writing, [[table-turning]], trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading and [[spirit photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington]]. (1907). [https://archive.org/stream/physicalphenomen00carr#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism'']. Herbert B. Turner &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century the psychical researcher [[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]] investigated the medium [[Eva Carrière]] and claimed her ectoplasm "[[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]]" were not from spirits but the result of "ideoplasty" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind.&lt;ref name="Brady2010"&gt;M. Brady Brower. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 120. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schrenck-Notzing published the book ''Phenomena of Materialisation'' (1923) which included photographs of the ectoplasm.

''Spiritism and Common Sense''. P. J. Kenedy &amp; Sons. pp. 186-198&lt;/ref&gt; Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carrière deceptively smuggled pins into the séance room.&lt;ref name="Heredia1992"/&gt; The magician [[Carlos María de Heredia]] replicated the ectoplasm of Carrière using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief.&lt;ref name="Heredia1992"/&gt;

[[Donald J.

A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters "Le Miro". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. West|Donald West]]. (1954). ''Psychical Research Today''. Chapter Séance-Room Phenomena.

After Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carrière had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm.&lt;ref name="Brady2010"/&gt; Because of this Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous.&lt;ref name="Heredia1992"/&gt; [[Joseph McCabe]] wrote "In Germany and Austria, Baron von Schrenck-Notzing is the laughing-stock of his medical colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Harris.

The Danish medium [[Einer Nielsen]] was investigated by a committee from the [[University of Oslo|Kristiania University]] in Norway in 1922 and it was discovered in a séance that his ectoplasm was fake.&lt;ref&gt;Universitetskomiteen, Mediet Einer Nielsen, kontrolundersøkelser av universitetskomiteen i Kristiania. (Kristiania 1922). ”Rapport fra den av Norsk Selskab for Psykisk Forskning nedsatte Kontrolkomité”, Norsk Tidsskrift for Psykisk Forskning 1 (1921-22).&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen was also caught hiding his ectoplasm in his [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

University of Illinois Press. p. 171. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mina Crandon]] was a famous medium known for producing ectoplasm during her séance sittings. She produced a small ectoplasmic hand from her stomach which waved about in the darkness. Her career ended however when biologists examined the hand and found it to be made of a piece of carved animal liver.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mNGno8qc9IkC&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=mina+crandon+%22liver%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oHePBCFd1-&amp;sig=AFBE7D-S21LBRzYA1MejFiZW8is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z1zPUPOTNueS0QWzsIHADQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Ghosts, Apparitions and Poltergeists: An Exploration of the Supernatural through History]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Franklin Prince]] described the Crandon case as "the most ingenious, persistent, and fantastic complex of fraud in the history of psychic research."&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited''. Prometheus Books. p. 245. {{ISBN|978-0879755331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researchers [[Eric Dingwall]] and [[Harry Price]] re-published an anonymous work written by a former medium entitled ''Revelations of a Spirit Medium'' (1922) which exposed the tricks of mediumship and the fraudulent methods of producing "spirit hands".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Dingwall]], [[Harry Price]]. (1922). [https://archive.org/stream/revelationsofspi00farriala#page/n5/mode/2up ''Revelations of a Spirit Medium'']. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally all the copies of the book were bought up by spiritualists and deliberately destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgess McHargue]]. (1972). ''Facts, Frauds, and Phantasms: A Survey of the Spiritualist Movement''. Doubleday. p. 158. {{ISBN|978-0385053051}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of ectoplasm and fraud John Ryan Haule wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because ectoplasm was believed susceptible to destruction by light, the possibility that ectoplasm might appear became a reason for making sure that Victorian séances took place in near darkness. Poor lighting conditions also became an opportunity for fraud, particularly as faux ectoplasm was easy to make with a mixture of soap, gelatin and egg white, or perhaps merely well-placed muslin.&lt;ref&gt;John Ryan Haule. (2010). ''Jung in the 21st Century: Synchronicity and Science''. Routledge. pp. 122-123. {{ISBN|0-203-83360-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Psychical researcher [[Harry Price]] exposed medium [[Helen Duncan]]'s fraudulent techniques by proving, through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was [[cheesecloth]] that she had swallowed and regurgitated.&lt;ref&gt;Marina Warner. (2006). ''Phantasmagoria: Spirit Visions, Metaphors, and Media into the Twenty-first Century''. Oxford University Press. p. 299. {{ISBN|978-0199239238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan had also used dolls' heads and masks as ectoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p. 599. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mediums would also cut pictures from magazines and stick them to the cheesecloth to pretend they were spirits of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Whittington-Egan]]. (1991). ''William Roughhead's Chronicles of Murder''. Lochar. p. 89. {{ISBN|978-0948403552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another researcher, [[C. D. Broad]], wrote that ectoplasm in many cases has proven to be composed of home material such as butter-muslin and that there is no solid evidence that it has anything to do with spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. D. Broad]]. (2011). ''Lectures on Psychical Research''. Reprint Edition. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographs taken by [[Thomas Glendenning Hamilton]] of ectoplasm reveal the substance to be made of tissue paper and magazine cut-outs of people. The famous photograph taken by Hamilton of the medium Mary Ann Marshall (1880–1963) depicts [[tissue paper]] with a cut out of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s head from a newspaper. [[Skeptic]]s have suspected that Hamilton may have been behind the [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.ca/hazlitt/feature/touching-dead-spooky-winnipeg Touching the Dead: Spooky Winnipeg by Tom Jokinen]&lt;/ref&gt; The mediums [[Rita Goold]] and [[Alec Harris]] dressed up in their séances as ectoplasm spirits and were exposed as frauds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Cornell]].

[[File:Eglantyne Jebb 1920.jpg|thumb|Eglantyne Jebb]]
'''Eglantyne Jebb,'''  (25 August 1876 – 17 December 1928) was a British [[reform movement|social reformer]] and founder of the [[Save the Children]] organisation.

== Early life ==
She was born in 1876 in [[Ellesmere, Shropshire]], and grew up on her family's estate. The Jebbs were a well-off family and had a strong social conscience and commitment to public service. Her mother, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], had founded the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]], to promote Arts and Crafts among young people in rural areas; her sister Louisa would help found the [[Women's Land Army]] in [[World War I]]. Another sister, [[Dorothy Frances Jebb]], who married the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Charles Roden Buxton]], campaigned against the demonisation of the German people after the war.
She also served a faculty member at [[Wellesley College]] in 1929, teaching courses in English literature.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley College, [http://repository.wellesley.edu/news/796 "The Wellesley News (05-31-1928)"] (1928). ''The Wellesley News''. Book 796.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nickname ==
She was known as the "White Flame" because the flame of her [[philanthropy|dedicated love]] for children in distress burned to a white heat of passion all her life.

== Social activism ==
Having studied history at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford - Prominent Alumni|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jebb trained to become a school teacher, but a year's experience as a Primary School teacher, at St. Peter's Junior School in Marlborough, convinced her that this was not her vocation, though it increased her awareness of the difficulties and widespread nature of poverty faced by young children.

She moved to [[Cambridge]] to look after her sick mother. There she became involved in the [[Charity Organisation Society]], which aimed to bring a modern scientific approach to charity work. This led her to carry out an extensive research project into conditions in the city, and in 1906 she published a book, ''Cambridge, a Study in Social Questions'' based on her research.

The Cambridge Independent Press, a weekly liberal-supporting newspaper published a number of articles covering Eglantyne's campaigning and political activities in Cambridge in the run up to the First World War. She was appointed to the Education Committee of Cambridge Borough Council in 1907, although in her first year only attended 13 of a possible 31 meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=8 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also on the committee of the newly formed League for Physical Education and Improvement, but resigned citing pressures from other workloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|issue=17 May 1907|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=17 May 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the watchful eye of [[Florence Ada Keynes]] Eglantyne and Florence's daughter Margaret set up and ran the Boy's employment registry, shortly followed by a similar one for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a Blue Plaque above 82 Regent Street where the employment registry was sited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulley|first1=Clare|url=http://www.claremulley.com/blog/28-december-2014/|title=Blue Plaque-tastic!|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 she was asked to undertake a journey to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] on behalf of the Macedonian Relief Fund. She returned shortly before the First World War broke out, and soon was drawn into a project organised by Dorothy, who had begun importing European newspapers – including ones from Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] for which a special licence had to be obtained from the government – and publishing extracts in English in the ''Cambridge Magazine'', which revealed that everyday life in the enemy countries was far worse than government propaganda suggested.

As the war was coming to an end, and the German and Austro-Hungarian economies came near to collapse, it was clear to Dorothy and Eglantyne that the children of these countries were suffering appallingly from the effects of the war and the [[Blockade of Germany|Allied blockade]], which continued even when an armistice was signed. A pressure group, the Fight the Famine Council, was set up in 1919 to persuade the British government to end the blockade.

== Save the Children ==
Soon, however, the focus shifted to organising relief. On 15 April 1919, the Council set up a fund to raise money for the German and Austrian children – the [[Save the Children Fund]]. Unexpectedly, this organisation, launched at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London on 19 May 1919, quickly raised a large sum of money from the British public, and officials were despatched to organise relief work.

The success of the Fund led Eglantyne and Dorothy to attempt to set up an international movement for children. The [[International Save the Children Union]] (''Union International de Secours à l'Enfant'') was founded in [[Geneva]] in 1920, with the British [[Save the Children Fund]] and the Swedish [[Rädda Barnen]] as leading members.

In London, it was now Eglantyne who was in charge, and she ensured that the Fund adopted the professional approach she had learnt in the Charity Organisation Society. A manager, Lewis Golden, was recruited to put the organisation on a businesslike foundation. He adopted the innovative – and controversial – approach of taking full-page advertisements in national newspapers; it was highly effective, and raised very substantial amounts of income for the Fund's work.

As the problems in central Europe receded, there was a new focus of the Fund's attention – a refugee crisis in [[Greece]] and the surrounding areas, a consequence of the continuing conflict in the area. Then in 1921, just as this situation was coming under control, there was a new and bigger emergency. Partly as a consequence of the devastation of war, revolution and civil war, and partly due to the disastrous economic policies of the [[Bolshevik]] government, the people of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] faced a [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]] as crops failed. A new fundraising effort brought a surge of donations, and a Save the Children team was dispatched to the city of [[Saratov]], one of the main famine centres.

== Declaration of the Rights of the Child ==
In all the work the Fund did, a major element in Eglantyne's thinking was the importance of a planned, research-based approach. In 1923, when the Russian relief effort was coming to an end, and the Fund's income was sharply reducing, she turned to another issue – that of children's rights. She headed to Geneva, to a meeting of the International Union, with a plan for a Children's Charter. The result was a short and clear document – drafted by Eglantyne – which asserted the rights of children and the duty of the international community to put children's rights in the forefront of planning. The [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]], or the Declaration of Geneva as it came to be known, was adopted a year later by the [[League of Nations]].

With peace returning to Europe, and relief efforts in decline, the focus of the Save the Children movement shifted to promoting the Declaration. In 1925, the first International Child Welfare congress was held in Geneva. The Declaration was widely discussed and supported by organisations and governments. An expanded version would be adopted by the United Nations in 1959, and it was one of the main inspirations behind the 1989 UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

== Death and legacy ==
After many years of ill health due to a thyroid problem, including three operations for [[goitre]], Eglantyne Jebb died in a nursing home in Geneva in 1928, and is buried there in St George's cemetery. [[Save the Children]], which she and her sister [[Dorothy Buxton|Dorothy]] (who converted to the [[Society of Friends]] with her husband) founded in England in 1919 and as an international organisation based in Geneva the following year, remains active today. Also, the [[Church of England]] remembers her life and service annually on its [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|liturgical calendar]] on 17 December.

{{short description|}}
'''Evolutionary psychology of language''' is the study of the evolutionary history of language as a psychological faculty within the discipline of [[evolutionary psychology]]. It makes the assumption that language is the result of a [[Darwinian adaptation]].

There are many competing theories of how language might have evolved, if indeed it is an evolutionary adaptation. They stem from the belief that language development could result from an [[adaptation]], an [[exaptation]], or a by-product. [[Heredity|Genetics]] also influence the study of the evolution of language. It has been speculated that the [[FOXP2]] gene may be what gives [[human]]s the ability to develop [[grammar]] and [[syntax]].

==Language evolution theories==

In the debate surrounding the evolutionary psychology of language, three sides emerge: those who believe in language as an [[adaptation]], those who believe it is a [[by-product]] of another adaptation, and those who believe it is an [[exaptation]].

===Adaptation===
Scientist and psychologists [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop. The complexity of the mechanisms, the faculty of language and the ability to learn language provides a comparative resource between the [[evolutionary psychology|psychological evolved]] traits and the [[evolutionary biology|physical evolved]] traits.&lt;ref name="Richardson 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Richardson,  | first = R. | title = The prospects for an evolutionary psychology: Human language and human reasoning |publisher = Springer | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00389658 | journal = Minds and Machines| volume =6| issue = 4| pages = 541–557| date = November 1996 | accessdate = 2 January 2014 | doi=10.1007/BF00389658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker, though he mostly agrees with [[Noam Chomsky]], a [[linguist]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive scientist]], in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction, but Pinker and Bloom argue that the [[organic (model)|organic]] nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) ''Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.'' Cambridge University Press p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By-product/Spandrel===
Noam Chomsky spearheaded the debate on the faculty of language as a cognitive by-product, or spandrel. As a linguist, rather than an evolutionary biologist, his theoretical emphasis was on the infinite capacity of speech and speaking: there are a fixed number of words, but there is an infinite combination of the words.&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;Chomsky, N., ''Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use.'' Praeger, New York. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis from this considers that the ability of our cognition to perceive infinite possibilities, or create infinite possibilities, helped give way to the extreme complexity found in our language.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt; Both Chomsky and Gould argue that the complexity of the brain is in itself an adaptation, and language arises from such complexities.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt;
On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a by product, [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2011). ''The Evolution of Language.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. p. 15. {{ISBN|052167736X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptationist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether "Language has evolved as an adaptation" as being misleading.&lt;ref name="Fitch" /&gt;
He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use [[symbolic communication]] is integrated in all other [[cognitive process]]es.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon, T. The Symbolic Species. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exaptation===
Exaptations, like adaptations, are fitness-enhancing characteristics, but, according to Stephen Jay Gould, their purposes were appropriated as the species evolved. This can be for one of two reasons: either the trait’s original function was no longer necessary so the trait took on a new purpose or a trait that does not arise for a certain purpose, but later becomes important.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botha|first1=Rudolf P|title=How much of language, if any, came about in the same sort of way as the brooding chamber in snails?|journal=Language &amp; Communication| volume=21| issue=3|year=2001|pages=225–243|doi=10.1016/S0271-5309(01)00002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically exaptations have a specific shape and design which becomes the space for a new function.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001" /&gt; The foundation of this argument comes from the low-lying position of the [[larynx]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Fitch2"&gt;Fitch, T., "Evolutionary Developmental Biology and Human Language Evolution: Constraints on Adaptation." "Evolutionary Biology". 39:4. pp. 613-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mammals have this same positioning of the larynx, but no other species has acquired language. This leads exaptationists to see an evolved modification away from its original purpose.&lt;ref name="Fitch2" /&gt;

==Genes and language==
Research has shown that “genetic constraints” on language evolution could have caused a “specialized” and “species-specific language module.&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chater | first1 = N. | last2 = Florencia | first2 = R. | last3 = Christiansen | first3 = M. H. | year = | title = Restrictions on biological adaptation in language evolution | url = | journal = [[PNAS]] | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 1015–1020 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807191106 | pmc = 2633574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through this module that there are many specified “domain-specific linguistic properties,” such as syntax and agreement.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; Adaptationists believe that language genes “coevolved with human language itself for the purpose of communication.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; This view suggests that the genes that are involved with language would only have coevolved in a very stable linguist environment. This shows that language could not have evolved in a rapidly changing environment because that type of environment would not have been stable enough for natural selection. Without natural selection, the genes would not have coevolved with the ability for language, and instead, would have come from “cultural conventions.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; The adaptationist belief that genes coevolved with language also suggests that there are no “arbitrary properties of language.” This is because they would have coevolved with language through natural selection.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;
 
The [[Baldwin effect]] provides a possible explanation for how language characteristics that are learned over time could become encoded in genes. He suggested, like Darwin did, that organisms that can adapt a trait faster have a “selective advantage.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; As generations pass, less environmental stimuli is needed for organisms of the species to develop that trait. Eventually no environmental stimuli are needed and it is at this point that the trait has become “genetically encoded.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;

{{main|FOXP2}}
The genetic and cognitive components of language have long been under speculation, only recently have linguists been able to point out a gene that may possibly explain how language works.&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff"&gt;Fisher, S.E. &amp; Scharff, C. (2009). "FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language." ''Cell Press'' pp.166-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 [[gene]] may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist [[Myrna Gopnik]] identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the [[KE family]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The KE family has a mutation in the FOXP2, that makes them suffer from a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[language disorder]]. It has been argued that the FOXP2 gene is the grammar gene, which is what allows humans the ability to form proper syntax and make our communication of higher quality. Children that grow up in a stable environment are able to develop highly proficient language without any instruction. Individuals with a mutation to their FOXP2 gene have trouble mastering complex sentences, and shows signs of [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]].&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff" /&gt;

This gene most likely evolved in the [[hominini|hominin]] line after the hominin and the chimpanzee lines split; this accounts for the fact that humans are the only ones able to learn and understand grammar.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby"&gt;Christianse, M. H. &amp; Kirby, S. (2004). ''Language Evolution.'' [[Oxford University Press]]. pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a unique [[allele]] of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby" /&gt; This suggests that speech evolved late in overall spectrum of human evolution.

==Variation in human language==
In the world there are nearly 7000 languages, there is great amount of variation and this variation is thought to have come about through [[Cultural differentialism|cultural differentiation]]. There are four factors that are thought to be the reason as to why there is language variation between cultures: [[founder effect]]s, [[drift (linguistics)|drift]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and adaptation. With the vast amounts of lands available different tribes began to form and to claim their territory, in order to differentiate themselves many of these groups made changes to their language and this how the evolution of languages began. There also tended to be drifts in the population a certain group would get lost and be isolated from the rest of the group, this group would lose touch with the other groups and before they knew there had been mutations in their language and a whole new language had been formed.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Levinson | first1 = SC. | last2 = Gray | first2 = RD. | title = Tools from evolutionary biology shed new light on the diversification of languages. | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–73 |date=March 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2012.01.007 | pmid = 22336727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybridization also played a big role in the language evolution, one group would come in contact with another tribe and they would pick up words and sounds from each other eventually leading to the formation of a new language. Adaptation would also play a role in the evolution of language differentiation, the environment and the circumstances were constantly changing therefore the groups had to adapt to the environment and their language had to adapt to it as well, it is all about maximizing fitness.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"/&gt;

Atkinson theorized that language may have originated in [[Africa]] since [[African languages]] have a greater variation of speech sounds than other languages. Those sounds are seen as the root for the other languages that exist across the world.&lt;ref name="Bower 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bower|first1=Bruce|title=Darwin's tongues: Languages, like genes, can tell evolutionary tales|journal=Science News|volume=180| issue=11|year=2011| pages=22–25|issn=0036-8423|doi=10.1002/scin.5591801128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication in other animals==
Research indicates that nonhuman animals (e.g., apes, dolphins, and songbirds) show evidence of language. Comparative studies of the sensory-motor system reveal that speech is not special to humans: nonhuman primates can discriminate between two different spoken languages.&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;Hauser, M. D., et al. (2002). The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? Science 298. pp. 1569-1579.&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomical aspects of humans, particularly the descended larynx, has been believed to be unique to humans' capacity to speak. However, further research revealed that several other mammals have a descended larynx beside humans, which indicates that a descended larynx must not be the only anatomical feature needed for speech production.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;
Vocal imitation is not uniquely human as well.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; Songbirds seem to acquire species-specific songs by imitating.&lt;ref name="Haesler 2004"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Haesler S, Wada K, Nshdejan A, etal |title=FoxP2 expression in avian vocal learners and non-learners |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=24 |issue=13 |pages=3164–75 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15056696 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4369-03.2004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haesler 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haesler S, Rochefort C, Georgi B, Licznerski P, Osten P, Scharff C |title=Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e321 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18052609 |pmc=2100148 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because nonhuman primates do not have a descended larynx, they lack vocal imitative capacity, which is why studies involving these primates have taught them nonverbal means of communication, e.g., sign language.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

[[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] and [[Nim Chimpsky]] are two apes that have successfully learned to use sign language, but not to the extent that a human being can. Nim is a chimpanzee that was taken in by a family in the 1970s and was raised as if he were a human child. Nim was able to master 150 signs, which were limited but useful. Koko was a gorilla that was taken in by a Berkley student. She was able to master 600 signs for generative communication. Koko and Nim were not able to develop speech due to the fact that they lack the larynx which is what distinguishes humans from other animals and allows them to speak.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

'''Exercise bulimia''' is a subset of the [[psychological disorder]] called [[bulimia]] in which a person is compelled to exercise in an effort aimed at burning the [[calories]] of [[food energy]] and [[body fat|fat reserves]] to an excessive level that negatively affects their [[health]]. The damage normally occurs through not giving the body adequate [[Human relaxation|rest]] for athletic recovery compared to their exercise levels, leading to increasing levels of disrepair. If the person eats a normally healthy and adequate diet but exercises in levels they know require higher levels of nutrition, this can also be seen as a form of [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6465">The '''history of Gan Chinese''', a [[variety of Chinese]] spoken in modern-day China, stretches back to the beginning of the [[Qin dynasty]]. This long stretch of time is divided into Old Gan, late Old Gan, and Middle Gan periods.

==Old Gan==
Old Gan (上古贛語, ''Song-gu Gon-ngi'') or Proto-Gan (原始贛語, ''Ngien-si Gon-ngi'') was spoken between the beginning of the [[Qin dynasty]] to the latter part of the [[Han dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Wan Bo (萬波), ''Research on Gan's consonants'' (贛語聲母的歷史層次研究).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of 221 BC, General Tu Sui (屠睢) was sent on behalf of the Qin dynasty to the south of [[China]] in order to conquer the territory of Baiyue. 500,000 soldiers then settled down at [[Yugan County|Yugan]], [[Nankang, Jiangxi|Nankang]] and three other places.  This formed the initial Chinese population in [[Jiangxi]]. In 202 BC, Yuzhang Prefecture (豫章郡) was set up by the Han dynasty. Following this, the local population increased rapidly.

==Late Old Gan==
Late Old Gan (中古贛語, ''Zung-gu Gon-ngi'') was spoken between the 3rd and 6th centuries. It was largely [[sinicized]] by new settlers from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]].  Some scholars consider late Old Gan, together with [[Hakka Chinese]] and the Tongtai dialect of [[Jianghuai Mandarin]] to have been the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|Southern Dynasties]].&lt;ref&gt;Lu Guoyao (魯國堯), ''On Gan-Hakka and the Tongtai dialect derived from lingua franca of Southern Dynasties'' (客、贛、通泰方言源於南朝通語說), 2003, {{ISBN|7-5343-5499-4}}, pages 123-135&lt;/ref&gt;

However, late Old Gan was still distinctly different from the official language. ''[[History of Southern Dynasties]]'' records that 
{{blockquote|Hu Xiezhi (胡諧之) of [[Nanchang]], the Emperor wants to bestow a noble marriage on him. He sends several persons of the Palace in order to teach his children the [official] language. Two years later, the Emperor asks him if the language has been standardized in his family, and Hu answers that his family hasn't acquired the official language while those imperial envoys have already been Ganized.&lt;ref&gt;Nanshi, volume 37 of ''Biographies and Collective Biographies'' (列傳)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Middle Gan==
Middle Gan (中世贛語, ''Zung-si Gon-ngi'') is the variety of Gan spoken between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties (from the 6th to the 13th century). The last time of large-scale settlement in Jiangxi by people from the Central Plain took place as a result of the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]. Gan also became stabilized following this period.

Research on the rhyming system of Jiangxi poets of this period has been made in order to reconstruct the linguistic form of Middle Gan. Scholars have found that modern Gan still keeps many linguistic characteristics of this historical layer.&lt;ref&gt;Du Aiying (杜愛英), ''On the rhyming system of Jiangxi poets of Song dynasty'' (宋代江西詩人用韻研究)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu Lunxin (劉綸鑫), ''On the history of Gan-Hakka'' (客贛方言史簡論)&lt;/ref&gt;
For example,{{clarify|reason=Where do these rimes come from? What does "corresponds to" mean here?|date=November 2014}}

*rime 尤侯 corresponds to rime 蕭豪;
*rime 支微 corresponds to rime 魚模;
*rime 魚模 corresponds to rime 家麻;
*rime 皆來 corresponds to rime 支微;
*rime 監廉 corresponds to rime 寒先;
*rime 庚青 corresponds to rime 江陽.

==Late Middle Gan==
Late Middle Gan (近世贛語, ''Qin-si Gon-ngi'') was the form of Gan spoken between the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties (from the 13th to the 17th century).
Some linguistic characteristics of late Middle Gan are:&lt;ref&gt;DING Bangxin, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furuya Akihiro , 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*Semi-coronal {{IPA|[l]}} differentiates from alveolar stops {{IPA|[n]}}{{clarify|reason=Weren't they originally separate?|date=November 2014}}
*[[Slack voice|Muddy]] consonants are merged with [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants
*[[Syllable coda]] {{IPA|[-m]}} merges into {{IPA|[-n]}}

==Early Modern Gan==
Early Modern Gan (近代贛語, ''Qin-tai Gon-ngi'') was the form of Gan spoken from the [[Qing dynasty]] (17th century) up to the beginning of modern times.

The textbook ''Lei Zi Meng Qiu'' (類字蒙求) published in the middle of the 19th century has been used to understand the linguistic form of [[Nanchang dialect]]; scholars have found that Gan has stayed relatively stable from this time. For example, the nasal ending {{IPA|[-m]}} merged into {{IPA|[-n]}},{{clarify|reason=Also placed in the previous period|date=November 2014}} and 7 tones were used.

Westerners also began to study Gan  during this period. [[British people|British]] diplomatic official [[Edward Harper Parker]] was the first westerner to recorded Gan speech. He noticed his friend Wen-yuan of [[Fuzhou, Jiangxi|Fuzhou]] merged [[Slack voice|muddy]] consonants with [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]] consonants.

[[Bibles]] in some Gan dialects were also published at this time.

'''Illyro-Roman''' is a term used in historiography and anthropological studies for the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] [[Illyrians]] within the ancient [[Roman province]]s of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Moesia]], Pannonia and [[Dardani#Roman Dardania|Dardania]]. The term 'Illyro-Roman' can also be used to describe the Roman settlers who colonized Illyricum. The remnants of the Illyro-Romans, called ''[[Vlachs]]'' in literature{{cn|date=August 2016}}, were absorbed by the western [[South Slavs]] and [[Albanians]].

==Before Rome==
The Illyrian tribes were considered barbarians by both the Romans and the Hellenic peoples in the southern Balkans. They considered them among the vast group of barbarian peoples such as the Gauls, Germans and Dacians. The conquest of Illyria in 168 BC, along with that of Epirus, consolidated the Roman domain over the Adriatic Sea. The mountainous geography of the region meant that the region was hard to subdue, but by 9 CE the [[Great Illyrian Revolt]] had been quelled and from then on the region would supply large numbers of non-citizen soldiers to the Roman [[Auxilia]].

==During the Empire==
The Romanization of these barbarian peoples eventually transformed them into the most valuable soldiers of the Late Roman Army, with a substantial portion of the officials and generals coming from a northern balkanic background, such as Illyria, Dalmatia, Pannonia and Moesia. One emperor, [[Decius]], several usurpers and during the reign of [[Gallienus]], who started the professionalization of the high command of the army, large numbers of soldiers achieved high rank within the army. They took the place which the Senatorial order had had the privilege of holding since the time of Augustus, 250 years earlier, the command of the legions and armed provinces.

==Roman colonization==
Illyricum was heavily colonized by the Romans beginning in the third century BC. The Romans founded the cities of [[Acruvium]], [[Cibalae]], [[Mursa]], [[Narona]], [[Siscia]], and established colonies at [[Salona]], [[Sirmium]], [[Epidaurum]], [[Aequum]], [[Zadar|Iader]], [[Rhizon]], and in many other cities. These cities were colonized by Roman war veterans.

==The "[[Illyrian emperors]]"==
It was from this group that the most successful emperors of the time came from and it was they who brought the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] to an end. Examples include [[Claudius II Gothicus]], [[Aurelian]], and [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]]. The creator of the Tetrarchy [[Diocletian]] and his fellow Tetrarchs [[Maximian]], [[Constantius Chlorus]] (father of the first Christian emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]]) and [[Severus II]] were also of Illyro-Roman background.

None of these reflect proto-TNG pronouns.  However, Kiwaian languages have basic TNG lexical words like body-part terms.

==Classification==
The Trans–New Guinea identity of Kiwaiian is supported by a relatively large number of basic lexical items.  [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Ross]] (2005) tentatively linked Kiwaiian to the erstwhile [[language isolate]] [[Porome language|Porome]].  However, the evidence is only two pronouns, and the connection has not been accepted by other researchers.

'''''Kkangpae''''' (Korean: 깡패) is a [[romanization]] of the [[Korean language|Korean]] for a 'gangster', 'thug', or 'hoodlum', usually referring to members of unorganized street gangs. This is as opposed to mafiosos or members of organised crime gangs, which are known as '''''geondal''''' (Korean: 건달), or '''''jopok''''' (Korean: 조폭; [[Hanja]]: 組暴).

Criminal gangs have featured in South Korean popular culture, including films and television, over the past decades.

==History==
The Korean mafia may have been established in the 19th century, towards the end of the [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]], with the rise of commerce and the emergence of investment from European colonial powers. At this time, pre-existing street gangs, which were largely lower-class but operated by wealthy merchants, gained greater influence. The modern history of Korean criminal organizations can be divided into four periods: the Colonial era, the political mobs of the 1950s and early 1960s under president [[Syngman Rhee]], the Civil War period under the military rule of [[Park Chung-hee]] and [[Chun Doo-hwan]], and the present era.

===1910–1945: Colonial era===
During the 35 years of when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea under Imperial Japanese rule]], some Koreans were subjected to forced labor and [[Comfort women|sex slavery]]. This intensified during [[World War II]] when the [[Empire of Japan]] spread its empire throughout [[Manchuria]], and parts of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]]. During this period, Koreans fled to mainland Japan and formed mobs to overcome discrimination and crime. The most infamous "mobster" during this period was [[Kim Du-han]], the son of a famous [[Korean independence movement|Korean independence fighter]] and insurgent leader [[Kim Chwa-chin]], a freedom fighter against Colonial rule. After his mother and father were killed, Kim grew up as a beggar and became involved with a local gang named ''Jumok'' ("fist"). He rose through the ranks and became infamous for fighting groups against the Japanese mobs, or [[yakuza]].

The colonial branch of the Imperial Japanese yakuza was then under the control of Hayashi, an ethnic Korean who defected to the Japanese and joined the yakuza. The rival mob to Hayashi's yakuza was controlled by [[Koo Ma-jak|Koo Majok]], but the Korean mafia was always short of money and many local mob bosses were disloyal to Koo and formed separated mobs, notably [[Shin Majak]] and [[Shang Kal]] (''twin knives''). Koo Majok finally tried to solidify his control over the Korean mobs by knocking out Ssang Kal and taking over his territory, but it caused a backlash. Kim Du-han, originally a member of Ssang Kal, rebelled against Koo Majok. Kim killed both Shin Majok and Koo Majok, and unified all the Korean mobs under his command at the age of 18.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} After solidifying his rule by beating the revolting groups, Kim made his move against the yakuza, starting the famous trial war between ''Jumok'' and yakuza, which became symbolic of the resistance by Koreans against Japanese. Kim Du-han was a major figure of the movement against the colonial rule and later became a politician in [[Syngman Rhee]]'s [[Liberal Party (South Korea)|Liberal Party]]. To this date, many Korean mobs are still at war with yakuza.

=== 1950s–60s: Political mobs ===
During the 1950s, two separate Seoul-based groups, the Myung-dong and the Chong-ro, operated to protect Korean merchants from Japanese criminals who were often protected by officials.&lt;ref name=lee-1&gt;Lee, 2006 [1]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s, however, saw a shutdown of nearly all gang activity as those groups were considered a problem by the regime.

=== 1970s–80s: Military rule ===
It was not until the early 1970s that the modern Korean gangs began to emerge. Hierarchical structures began forming during this time, as well as the use of weapons such as knives and iron bars which culminated in more violent attacks.&lt;ref name=lee-1/&gt; The 1980s was a flourishing period for gangsters, as they were able to infiltrate businesses and set up connections with in-house government and entertainment officials, as well as making ties with other global crime rings. 

=== 1990s–present ===
The early 1990s saw another periodic crackdown with Article 114 of Korean Criminal Law dictating that not only were organized gangs illegal, but those who joined or formed groups could also be charged. This new law forced many into hiding or fleeing, while many others were arrested, and even those who finished their time were often put under surveillance if they were deemed career criminals.&lt;ref name=lee-1/&gt; However, Korea’s rapid globalization has it made it hard for law enforcement to completely stamp out organized crime, which continues to be a problem in the present day.

Gang members have been linked to crimes ranging from [[sex trafficking]] to [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggling]] and [[extortion]]. A survey in 2007 showed that 109 inmates jailed for organized criminal activities were all involved in extortion, mostly victimizing/running bars, nightclubs, and game rooms.&lt;ref&gt;2007, "Average" [1]&lt;/ref&gt; Gangsters have also been used as hired muscle and strongmen for businesses, such as in the case of Kim Seung-youn, "a conglomerate owner who hired gangsters to abduct and beat up employees of bar".&lt;ref&gt;2007, "Organized Gangs" [2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assault]]s have become more common in recent years as seen in 2009, when out of 621 gang members, 35% were arrested for assault while extortion took second at 29%, and [[illegal gambling]] (11%) and [[Loan shark|loan sharking]] (7%) made up the rest. The number of gang members and affiliates jump in years of economic strain, as in the economic slump of 2009, when officials saw a 60% increase in new gang formations and activities.&lt;ref&gt;2009, "South Korea" [3]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, police initiated a crackdown on gangs and affiliated members, rounding up 127 individuals within the first week of the "war against organized crime".&lt;ref&gt;2011, "About 130" [4]&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korean mafiosi often have tattoos of the ''pa'' ([[English language|English]]: ''mob'') they are in. When confronted by other mobs, they show their tattoos to help identify themselves. The tattoo can also be used as a warning to the general public. As a result, tattoos are often considered taboo in South Korean society.

The stereotypical image of the quintessential South Korean mafioso is one with a ''gakdoogi'' hairstyle, which consists of the sides of the head shaved, with hair remaining on top, a big build, dark, black clothing, tacky suits, black-painted luxury cars, prominent tattoos, and regional accents or dialects (Korean: ''[[Korean dialects|Saturi]]''). Contrary to popular belief, Seoul is not a known hotbed of South Korean mob presence. The most prominent organizations of the South Korean mafia operate in the [[Jeolla Province|Jeolla region]], in cities such as [[Gwangju]] and [[Mokpo]], with other South Korean mafiosi known to be operating in [[Busan]] and [[Incheon]].


==In popular culture==
Films romanticizing ''kkangpae'' have featured in South Korean cinema since the 1970s, but gained a foothold in the market in the early 1990s (Jamier, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;1)[1]. Such films emphasized traits like loyalty, decency, and morality against a backdrop of violence and corruption. The popularity of films like ''[[Friend (2001 film)|Friend]]'' (2001), ''[[A Bittersweet Life]]'' (2005), ''[[New World (2013 film)|New World]]'' (2013) popularized the image of the identifiable and ‘honorable’ gangster (Jamier, 2015)[1].

The rise in gang-centered content in film and television has been linked to changes in the public perception of ''kkangpae'', particularly in teens and younger audiences. Some have linked this to the increase in school-yard gangs known as ''iljinhoe'', which may take cues from such movies in the form of intimidation and mental or physical abuse (2005, “School Gangs”)[2]. Youths may look up to ''kkangpae'' characters for their strength and intelligence outside of the restrictive classroom setting (2005, “School Gangs”)[2].

[[File:Men's Sapeur inspired looks from SS 15 lookbook.jpg|thumb|upright|Ugandan Sapeurs (2015)]]
'''La Sape''', an abbreviation based on the phrase '''Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes''' ([[French language|French]]; literally "Society of Ambiance-Makers and Elegant People") and hinting to the French slang word ''sape'' which means "attire", is a [[subculture]] centered on the cities of [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Republic of Congo]] respectively. An adherent of La Sape is known as a '''''sapeur'''''.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|title=The Surprising Sartorial Culture Of Congolese 'Sapeurs' |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/pictureshow/2013/05/07/181704510/the-surprising-sartorial-culture-of-congolese-sapeurs |first=Angela |last=Evancie| publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement embodies the elegance in style and manners of colonial predecessor [[dandies]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
''La sape'' can be traced back to the period of colonialism in Africa, and in particular [[Brazzaville]] and [[Kinshasa]]. The French mission was to civilize the "uncouth" and "naked" African people. They brought second hand clothing from Europe as a bargaining tool to gain the loyalty of the chiefs. Brazzaville soon became the "most favored residential area for whites and the seat of colonial government." By the end of the 19th century their "houseboys" were the first to embrace European modernity because they would be given clothing instead of money as compensation for their work. The Congolese elite not only included the houseboys, but also those who held lower positions as clerks in colonial offices and other places.
[[File:Papa Wemba.jpg|thumb|The noted musician [[Papa Wemba]] was an important supporter of La Sape in Congo]]
A major influence on the Congolese elite, present during the 1920s (the so-called [[Roaring Twenties]]), was West African colonial workers who came to the Congo. These Bapopo or Coastmen, as they were called, served as inspiration for the Congolese elite "to combat ingrained charges of inferiority leveled at them" by French and Belgian colonialism. Young Congolese men took the style of their masters’ and made it their own. In the historian Didier Gondola's essay titled "La Sape Exposed!: High Fashion Among Lower-Class Congolese", he says:

{{quote|Captivated by the snobbery and refined elegance of the Coast Men’s attire, Congolese houseboys spurned their masters’ secondhand clothes and became unremitting consumers and fervent connoisseurs, spending their meager wages extravagantly to acquire the latest fashions from Paris.}}

The houseboys used their connections in [[France]] to acquire their clothing. One colonist{{who|date=April 2016}} looked down on the habits her houseboys in Brazzaville because while they may have been half-starved, they would still don their expensive clothing once their monthly wages came in.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

According to Gondola, Camille Diata frontlined the sape movement in Brazzaville in the 1930s, but also had a deep influence in France. He was also part of L'Amicale, "a loosely organized anti-colonial movement," formed in France in 1926 by the imaginative Congolese revolutionary [[André Matsoua]]. The organization mainly helped Africans new to Paris get settled in the city because they were not really welcomed by French, facing imprisonment and deportation. By the time of Matsoua death in 1942, his political developments gained prominence in the Congo and were "hijacked" by the Congolese intellectual elite. They not only adapted the fashion sense but also his anti-colonial views. This movement became a distinctly ethnic [[Bakongo]] and [[Balari]] one characterized by potent political symbolism and ideology that would manifest in postcolonial era.
[[File:Flickr - enric bach - Entrevista a Mangrokoto Bayaya.jpg|thumb|A Brazzaville sapeur being interviewed for Spanish documentary filmmakers (2010)]]
The 1950s gave rise to the cosmopolitan, thus bringing prominence to the music scene. Nightclubs and beer halls made up the venues home to the music and young urbanites of the Congolese townships of Kinshasa and Brazzaville. La Sape was synonymous with the Congolese rumba scene that surfaced and which [[Papa Wemba]], a Congolese musician, made music about the La Sape style. During the postcolonial years, the unique dynamics of La Sape coalesced in 1960 when both Congos were granted independence. Economic chaos ensued and many were left jobless. This caused numerous Congolese people to move abroad to western cities like [[London]] and [[Paris]]. Since they were also not very welcome, La Sape acted as refuge for them to cope with European life.

==Today==
[[File:Justin makangara RDC (7).JPG|thumb|A ''sapeur'' in [[Kinshasa]] (2014)]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Congolese dandies living in Paris and other [[Europe]]an cities were only deemed sapeur once they returned to Brazzaville in the summer to showcase their style before the mid-1990s.

Although war and strife had riddled the Congo over the years, there has been a revival of La Sape in Brazzaville. Whereas before in the early 1980s when campaigns were being prompted to bar La Sape from public spaces, they are now well respected and are "darlings of the regime." They have been raised to a higher status of "cultural heritage" by [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] by allowing them to participate in public cultural events like the African Exhibit of Fashion and Crafts (Salon africain de la mode et de l’artisanat).

Gondola argues that:

{{quote|Today, with both countries in turmoil, la sape, with its exuberant flamboyance may well serve as a lightning rod for the Congolese disenfranchised youth to map out their itinerary from Third World status to a modern cosmopolitanism and to cope with their social dereliction.}}

==Cultural influences==
In an interview with [[David M. Ewalt]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} media theorist [[Henry Jenkins]] described the traditional cosmopolitan as someone who escapes the orbit of their own parochial culture through high culture and absorption of the values attached to that culture. This includes luxuries such as opera, ballet, paintings, etc. However, the pop cosmopolitan is the modern teenager. He used America to illustrate this point through teenagers today who learn, absorb, and interact with various facets of Asian cultures as a means of escaping the limitations of American culture. They use the Internet and technology to connect with other cultures. Social networks are a force toward globalization and it is this very connectivity that allows modern globalization to thrive.

Sapeurs are shown in a film ''35 Cows and a Kalashnikov'' (2014), directed by Oswald von Richthofen.

'''Light poetry''' or '''light verse''' is [[poetry]] that attempts to be humorous.  Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]] including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme, and heavy [[alliteration]]. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few [[free verse]] poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]] or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.

[[File:Muso Soseki 3.jpg|thumb|Calligraphy of Five Mountains Patriarch Muso Soseki]]
The '''literature of the Five Mountains''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 五山文学, gozan bungaku) is the [[literature]] produced by the principal [[Zen]] (禅) monastic centers of the [[Rinzai]] sect in [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]] and [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], Japan.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The term also refers to five Zen centers in China in [[Hangzhou]] and [[Ningpo]] that inspired zen in Japan, while the term "mountain" refers to Buddhist [[monastery]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Five Mountains literature or ''gozan bungaku'' (五山文學) is used collectively to refer to the poetry and prose in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] produced by Japanese [[monk]]s during the 14th and 15th centuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Included are works by Chinese monks residing in Japan.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The period witnessed a widespread importation of cultural influences from [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] period China that in many ways transformed Japan. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Style==
The literature of the Five Mountains highly prized a sense of humor and sympathy with life’s ordinariness.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A Five Mountains poet might write about anything, in contrast to the proscribed themes of the aristocratic court poets.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Kokan Shiren]] (d. 1346) for example would write about a [[mosquito]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Snouts sharp as drill bits!&lt;br&gt;
Buzz like thunder as they circle the room.&lt;br&gt;
They sneak through the folds of my robe,&lt;br&gt;
But they could bloody the back of an ox made of iron!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The image in the final line of ''Mosquitoes'' reminds the reader of one of the custom in Zen establishments of slapping on the head with a stick those practitioners of meditation who have momentarily dozed off.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In contrast, a courtier might write about the [[cicada]] and celebrate seasonal associations connected to them.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} To write about the mosquito would violate the courtier’s strict sense of literary decorum.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In a poem entitled "Sailing in the Moonlight", Kokan focuses on the incongruous humor of life.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;We monks boat in moonlight, circle through the reeds.&lt;br&gt;
The boatman shouts the tide recedes; we must return.&lt;br&gt;
The village folk mistake us for a fishing boat&lt;br&gt;
And scramble to the beach to buy our catch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Five Mountains literature was not entirely concerned with the rustic cloistered world. Often the principal historical events of the day found their way into the works of the monks.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Zen clerics themselves often served as advisers to the leading political figures.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In a poem, "Written Suddenly While Feeling Remorse Over the Passage of Time" [[Chugan Engetsu]] (d. 1375) relates his feelings about the fall of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] a year earlier.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;A year ago today the Kamakura fell.&lt;br&gt;
In the monasteries now, nothing of the old mood remains.&lt;br&gt;
The peddler girl understands nothing of a monk's remorse-&lt;br&gt;
Shouting through the streets, selling firewood, selling vegetables.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Maa Shakti''' (previously known as '''Aarki''') is the name of the world record garba, which has been organized every year by Mr. Jayesh Thakkar and his NGO Samvedan Charitable Trust which runs the [[Garba (dance)|garba]] festival in the city of [[Vadodara]].

==Overview==
Jayesh Thakkar has organised this event under ''Sam Vedan Charitable Trust''. [[Nitin Sandesara]] formerly organised it under the name ''Maa Aarki''. Navratri, who strongly believed in the traditional form of Garba, introduced it.  Mr. [[Nitin Sandesara]] who started this theme, ceased organising the event{{When|date=February 2011}} and for the last 10 years, it has been known as "Maa Shakti/RISHABH Group", but its popularity has not decreased. Owing to the organising committee, Maa Shakti/RISHABH Group of Vadodara has taken a global face. [[Crore]]s of [[rupee]]s are now spent on the event of navratri in [[Gujarat]].  Under Nitin sandesaras arkee garb there was not even one advertisement on the grounds as he believed that it is a place of worship and there are no advertisements in a temple.

The organisers of the event ensure the traditional aspect of the event. The organisers set rules such as the dancers only being allowed on the ground wearing traditional costumes and [[aarti]] of the goddess Amba. The garbas are performed in large circles around the main stage. The number of circles varies between 15-20. The singers sing traditional and new compositions in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].

===Record===
Maa Shakti holds a record in the [[Limca Book of Records]] of holding the largest number of dancers in the ground. The number of dancers present in the ground (when the record was set) was about 38,850.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13948">'''Mandatory retirement''' also known as '''enforced retirement''', is the set age at which people who hold certain jobs or offices are required by industry custom or by law to leave their employment, or [[retire]].

==Rationale==
Typically, mandatory retirement is justified by the argument that certain occupations are either too dangerous (military personnel) or require high levels of physical and mental skill ([[air traffic controllers]], [[Aviator|airline pilots]]). Most rely on the notion that a worker's productivity declines significantly after age 70, and the mandatory retirement is the employer's way to avoid reduced productivity.&lt;ref name="oeaw.ac.at"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/fuernkranz/lazear_mandatory_retirement.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090528/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/fuernkranz/lazear_mandatory_retirement.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the age at which retirement is mandated is often somewhat arbitrary and not based upon an actual physical evaluation of an individual person, many view the practice as a form of [[age discrimination]], or [[ageism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7195/full/453588a.html Retiring Retirement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Edward Lazear]] has argued that mandatory retirement can be an important tool for employers to construct wage contracts that prevent [[Efficiency wage#Shirking|worker shirking]].&lt;ref name="oeaw.ac.at"/&gt; Employers can tilt the wage profile of a worker so that it is below marginal productivity early on and above marginal productivity toward the end of the employment relationship. In this way, the employer retains extra profits from the worker early on, which he returns in the later period if the worker has not shirked his duties or responsibilities in the first period (assuming a competitive market).

==Countries==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, compulsory retirement is generally unlawful throughout the various State and Territory jurisdictions in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agediscrimination.info/international/Pages/australia.aspx |title=australia |publisher=Agediscrimination.info |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711152948/http://www.agediscrimination.info/international/Pages/australia.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some exemptions. For instance, permanent members of the [[Australian Defence Force]] must retire at the age of 60 and reservists at 65.&lt;ref name="ALRC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Australian Law Reform Commission|title=Recruitment and Employment Law|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/2-recruitment-and-employment-law/compulsory-retirement|website=Grey Areas—Age Barriers to Work in Commonwealth Laws (DP 78)|publisher=Australian Law Reform Commission|accessdate=31 December 2016|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the passage of [[Australian referendum, 1977 (Retirement of Judges)|a constitutional amendment]] in 1977, judges on [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]] are required to retire at the age of 70.&lt;ref name="ALRC" /&gt;

===Brazil===
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] says in Article 40, Paragraph 1, Item II, that all [[public servant]]s in the Union, States, Cities and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] shall mandatorily retire at the age of 70.&lt;ref name="CF-BR"&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao.htm Constitution of Brazil.] ''(in Portuguese)''. Retrieved November 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation encompasses servants from the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]] and [[judicial]] branches. It also applies to the [[Supreme Federal Court]] Justices, as per Article 93, Item VI, of the Constitution,&lt;ref name="CF-BR" /&gt; and the [[Tribunal de Contas da União|Court of Accounts of the Union]] Judges, as stated in Article 73, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (disposition added after the 20th Amendment).&lt;ref name="CF-BR" /&gt;

=== Canada ===
The normal age for retirement in Canada is 65, but one cannot be forced to retire at that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agediscrimination.info/international/Pages/Canada.aspx |title=Canada |publisher=Agediscrimination.info |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716080129/http://www.agediscrimination.info/international/Pages/Canada.aspx |archivedate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour laws in the country do not specify a retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/lp/spila/clli/eslc/19Mandatory_Retirement.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423032659/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/lp/spila/clli/eslc/19Mandatory_Retirement.shtml|date=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Age 65 is when federal [[Old Age Security]] pension benefits begin, and most private and public retirement plans have been designed to provide income to the person starting at 65 (an age is needed to select premium payments by contributors to be able to calculate how much money is available to retirees when they leave the program by retiring).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/oas-cpp/index.shtml |title=Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security |publisher=Hrsdc.gc.ca |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All judges in Canada are subject to mandatory retirement, at 70 or 75 depending on the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/sys/index-eng.asp |title=Supreme Court of Canada - Canadian Judicial System |publisher=Scc-csc.gc.ca |date=2012-04-07 |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402202906/http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/sys/index-eng.asp |archivedate=2 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal [[Senate of Canada|senators]] cease to hold their seats at 75.

Mandatory retirement of federally regulated employees is prohibited as of December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=568 |title=Tories in Canada end forced retirement, decades of ‘age discrimination’ |publisher=Agediscrimination.info |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718004027/http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=568 |archivedate=18 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In October 2006 the [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006]], the UK Labour Government introduced a Default Retirement Age, whereby employers are able to terminate or deny employment to people over 65 without a reason. A legal challenge to this failed in September 2009, although a review of the legislation was expected in 2010 by the new Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government.&lt;ref name=BBCChallengeFails&gt;{{cite news

=== United States ===
Mandatory retirement is generally unlawful in the United States, except in certain industries and occupations that are regulated by law, and are often part of the government (such as military service and federal police agencies, such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]).

From the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website:
{{quote|text=The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from employment discrimination based on age. The ADEA's protections apply to both employees and job applicants. Under the ADEA, it is unlawful to discriminate against a person because of his/her age with respect to any term, condition, or privilege of employment, including hiring, firing, promotion, layoff, compensation, benefits, job assignments, and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/age.html|title=Facts About Age Discrimination|website=www.eeoc.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations discussing the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]]:

{{quote|text=...one of the original purposes of this provision, namely, that the exception does not authorize an employer to  require or permit involuntary retirement of an employee within the  protected age group on account of age,&lt;ref name="EEOC root"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/ |title=US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |publisher=Eeoc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Millennium Promise''', or The Millennium Promise Alliance, Inc., is a [[non-profit organization]] incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, dedicated to ending extreme poverty within our lifetime. Its flagship initiative is the Millennium Villages Project, which highlights how integrated, community-led development, even in some of the poorest communities across rural sub-Saharan Africa, can lead to progress in achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and can provide communities with the basic tools and necessities to break out of poverty, on the path toward self-sustainable development.  Millennium Promise oversees the Millennium Villages Project in collaboration with the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

The project reflects Millennium Promise's focus on simultaneously addressing the inter-connected challenges of poverty - which include hunger and malnutrition, disease and lack of access to health care, poor education, and insufficient infrastructure, among others. The organization engages partners from the private and public sectors, national governments, and individuals in support of its work in the Millennium Villages and for a broader policy and advocacy agenda in support of the MDGs.  As such, Millennium Promise recognizes the critical importance of partnerships in addressing the many dimensions of poverty.  Among the Millennium Promise MDG Global Leaders are fashion icon Tommy Hilfiger,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/first-mdg-global-leader,1358099.html {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905054012/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/first-mdg-global-leader,1358099.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]], [[Renzo Rosso]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitchengine.com/diesel/renzo-rosso-named-millennium-promise-mdg-global-leader/90934/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senegalese musician and UNICEF ambassador Youssou Ndour.

A central goal of Millennium Promise, using the platform of the Millennium Villages Project, is to demonstrate the power of practical, low-cost and community-led approaches to poverty alleviation that can be replicated at scale by developing nations around the world.  Through the Millennium Villages Project, Millennium Promise works in over 80 villages across ten different countries in sub-Saharan Africa — Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. Each Millennium Village site is a cluster of a village or villages, of approximately 5,000 inhabitants per cluster.

Millennium Promise was co-founded by the renowned international economist and Director of [[The Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]], Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], and philanthropist and Wall Street leader [[Ray Chambers]] in 2005. The organization is headquartered in New York, New York, with regional headquarters in Bamako, Mali and Nairobi, Kenya, and national affiliates in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.  Peter Neidecker is CEO of Millennium Promise.  Prior to joining Millennium Promise, Mr. Neidecker served as the director of programs for the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation in London.

In September 2006, the financier and philanthropist [[George Soros]] pledged $50 million to Millennium Promise to fund 33 Millennium Villages. This donation has received added attention as a departure from Soros' characteristic sponsorship of [[democracy building]] and [[good governance]]-focused programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dugger |first1=Cecilia W. |title=Philanthropist Gives $50 Million to Help Aid the Poor in Africa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/us/13soros.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results published in May 2010 of three years of work from five of the Millennium Villages sites, in ''Harvests of Development in Rural Africa: The Millennium Villages after Three Years'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.millenniumpromise.org/pdf/MVP_Midterm_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714152303/http://www.millenniumpromise.org/pdf/MVP_Midterm_Report.pdf |archive-date=2010-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported an average three-fold increase in maize yields, a seven-fold increase in access to basic sanitation, and an over 50% reduction in malaria prevalence, among other factors.  On May 30, 2010, United Nations Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] visited the Millennium Village of Mwandama, Malawi, and he stated:  “I congratulate the leadership of the village and the whole community – especially the women of Mwandama – for their hard work and their commitment to a better life for their children and for generations to come... .  Today, I call on every country to look closely at this success. It is a case study in what is possible, even in the poorest places in the world.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opportunity.org/blog/ban-ki-moon-visits-opportunity-malawi-mobile-bank/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Millennium Villages Project, Millennium Promise also supports independent projects and initiatives to address extreme poverty. Millennium Promise is a founding partner of the organization [[Malaria No More]]. Launched in December 2006 at the White House Summit on Malaria, Malaria No More brings together corporations, foundations, faith-based groups, grassroots networks, and the public to support a comprehensive approach to control malaria. In 2010, Millennium Promise, in collaboration with the Earth Institute and Ericsson Mobile, founded a global education initiative called [http://www.connecttolearn.org Connect To Learn], the focuses on bringing access to a 21st-century education - including secondary school - to all children, and in particular girls.

[[Music]] can be described and represented in many different ways including [[sheet music]], symbolic representations, and audio recordings. For each of these representations, there may exist different versions that correspond to the same musical work. The general goal of '''music alignment''' (sometimes also referred to as '''music synchronization''') is to automatically link the various data streams, thus interrelating the multiple information sets related to a given musical work. More precisely, music alignment is taken to mean a procedure which, for a given position in one representation of a piece of music, determines the corresponding position within another representation.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER&gt;

==Basic procedure==
[[File:MusicAlignment Procedure.png|thumb|300px|right|Overview of the processing pipeline of a typical music alignment procedure.]]

Given two different music representations, typical music alignment approaches proceed in two steps.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER/&gt; In the first step, the two representations are transformed into sequences of suitable features. In general, such feature representations need to find a compromise between two conflicting goals. On the one hand, features should show a large degree of [[robustness]] to variations that are to be left unconsidered for the task at hand. On the other hand, features should capture enough characteristic information to accomplish the given task. For music alignment, one often uses '''[[chroma feature|chroma-based features]]''' (also called [[chromagram]]s or [[harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]]), which capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation, are being used.

In the second step, the derived feature sequences have to be brought into (temporal) correspondence. To this end, techniques related to '''[[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]]''' or '''[[hidden Markov model|hidden Markov models (HMMs)]]''' are used to compute an optimal alignment between two given feature sequences.

==Related tasks==
Music alignment and related synchronization tasks have been studied extensively within the field of [[music information retrieval]]. In the following, we give some pointers to related tasks. Depending upon the respective types of music representations, one can distinguish between various synchronization scenarios. For example, audio alignment refers to the task of temporally aligning two different audio recordings of a piece of music. Similarly, the goal of score–audio alignment is to coordinate note events given in the score representation with audio data. In the  [[offline]] scenario, the two data streams to be aligned are known prior to the actual alignment. In this case, one can use global optimization procedures such as [[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]] to find an optimal alignment. In general, it is harder to deal with scenarios where the data streams are to be processed online. One prominent online scenario is known as '''[[score following]]''', where a musician is performing a piece according to a given musical score. The goal is then to identify the currently played musical events depicted in the score with high accuracy and low latency.&lt;ref&gt;

In this context, alignment techniques such as hidden Markov models or particle filters have been employed, where the current score position and tempo are modeled in a statistical sense.&lt;ref&gt;

However, as a main disadvantage, an online strategy is very sensitive to local tempo variations and deviations from the score - once the procedure is out of sync, it is very hard to recover and return to the right track. A further online synchronization problem is known as '''[[Pop music automation#Automatic accompaniment|automatic accompaniment]]'''. Having a solo part played by a musician, the task of the computer is to accompany the musician according to a given score by adjusting the tempo and other parameters in real time. Such systems were already proposed some decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50318">'''Muted Group Theory''' ('''MGT'''), created by [[Edwin Ardener]] and [[Shirley Ardener]] in 1975, is a [[communication theory]] that focuses on how [[Social exclusion|marginalized groups]] are muted and excluded via the use of language. The main idea of MGT is that "Language serves its creators better than those in other groups who have to learn to use the language as best they can."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The term “mutedness” refers to a group’s inability to express themselves due to this inequity.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967775008|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=9781259870323|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=967775008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s) as being as follows: 1) the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the [[Social norm|social norms]] and vocabulary, and 2) members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the [[Linguistic imperialism|dominant language]] to express themselves. However, this [[translation]] process may result in the loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The dominant group may also ignore the voice of the [[Social exclusion|marginalized group]]. All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group. Although this theory was initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

==Overview ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Screen Shot 2015-11-21 at 10.26.45 PM.png|thumbnail|Ardener's Dominant Group vs Muted Group|336x336px]]Muted Group Theory was firstly developed in the field of [[cultural anthropology]] by the British anthropologist, Edwin Ardener. The first formulation of MGT emerges from one of Edwin Ardener's short essays, entitled "Belief and the Problem of Women," in which Ardener explored the "problem" of women. In social anthropology, the problem of women is divided in two parts: technical and analytical. The technical problem is that although half of the population and society is technically made up of women, ethnographers have often ignored this half of the population. Ardener writes that "those trained in [[ethnography]] evidently have a bias towards the kinds of model that men are ready to provide (or to concur in) rather than towards any that women might provide."&lt;ref name="Ardener73"&gt;Ardener, Edwin, &amp; Chapman, Malcolm. (2007). ''The voice of prophecy and other essays''. New York: Berghahn Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also suggests that the reason behind this is that men tend to give a "bounded model of society"&lt;ref name=Ardener73/&gt; akin to the ones that ethnographers are attracted to.&lt;ref name=Ardener73/&gt;  Therefore, men are those who produce and control symbolic production in a society. This leads to the analytical part of the problem which attempts to answer the question: "[…] if the models of society made by most ethnographers tend to be models derived from the male portion of that society, how does the symbolic weight of the other mass of persons express itself?"&lt;ref name="Ardener73" /&gt;

After conducting an experiment with the information in his essay, the results indicated that the male point of view is the dominant point of view in society, which is why it is depicted with a standard solid line in this graph. On the other hand, the female point of view is considered as non-dominant and non-standard, so it falls into the muted category with the broken line. According to Ardener, because male-based understandings of society represent the dominant worldview, certain groups are silenced or muted. He writes: "In these terms if the male perception yields a dominant structure, the female one is a muted structure."&lt;ref name="Ardener73" /&gt; As part of the critical approach to the world, Ardener uses MGT to explore the power and societal structure in relation to the dynamism between dominant and subordinated groups. Moreover, Ardener's concept of muted groups does not only apply to women but can also be applied to other non-dominant groups within social structures.

Scholars Cheris Kramer, Barrie Thorne and Nancy Henley were interested in exploring ways language “defines, deprecrates, and ignores women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Cheris|last2=Thorne|first2=Barrie|last3=Henley|first3=Nancy|date=1978-04|title=Perspectives on Language and Communication|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/493507|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=3|issue=3|pages=638–651|doi=10.1086/493507|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; What they discovered is that "male dominance affects more than just the way sexes speak but the content and structure of the English language.

=== Key concepts ===

==== Mutedness ====
[[File:Muted.jpg|thumb|Graphic highlighting ways women are silenced.]]
Mutedness does not equal silence. Mutedness occurs when people cannot articulate their ideas, regardless of time and space, without changing their language to meet the dominant group's vocabulary. Mutedness results from the lack of power and might lead to being overlooked, muffled, and invisible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A  First Look at Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Emory A|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-353430-5|location=New York|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As gender communication scholar [[Cheris Kramarae]] states, social interaction and communication create the current language structure. Because the latter was mainly built by men, men have an advantage over women. Consequently, women cannot express their thoughts through their own words because their language use is limited by the rules of a man's language.&lt;ref name="Kramarae1981"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and men speaking: Frameworks for analysis|date=1981|publisher=Newbury House Publishers|last1=Kramarae|first1=Cheris}} Rowley, MA: Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramarae states:

"The language of a particular culture does not serve all its speakers equally, for not all speakers contribute in an equal fashion to its formulation. Women (as well as members of other non-dominant groups) are not as free or as able as men are to say what they wish, because the words and the norms for their use have been formulated by the dominant group, men."

As Cowan points out, " 'mutedness' does not refer to the absence of voice but to a kind of distortion where subordinate voices…are allowed to speak but only in the confines of the dominant communication system."&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, R. (May, 2007). Muted group theory: Providing answers and raising questions concerning workplace bullying. Conference Papers -- National Communication Association. Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Muted group ====
Muted group or subordinated group is relative to the dominant group.  According to Gerdrin, muting or silencing is a social phenomenon based on the tacit understanding that within a society there are dominant and non-dominant groups.&lt;ref name="Gendrin"&gt;Gendrin, D. M. Homeless women's inner voices: Friends or foes?, in Hearing many voices. Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the muting process is a socially shared phenomenon that presupposes a collective understanding of who is in power and who is not.&lt;ref name="Gendrin" /&gt; The discrepancies in power result in the "oppressor" and "[[Oppression|the oppressed]]". Kramarae points out that muted group as "the oppressed" are people who don't have a "public recognized vocabulary" to express their experience. Their failure in articulate their ideas lead to their doubt about "the validity of their experience" and "the legitimacy of their feelings".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kramarae also addresses that [[gender]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[Social class|class hierarchies]], where muted groups, are supported by our "political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to the lack of power, muted groups are usually at the margin of the society.

==== The "muting" process ====
[[File:Screen Shot 2015-11-21 at 11.27.28 PM.png|thumb|West and Turner's Muting or Silencing Process|352x352px]]Several scholars have researched and studied how the "muting" process occurs. Houston and Kramarae posit that women have been silenced in many ways by for example ridiculing women's related lexicon, reinforcing family hierarchies, constructing a male-controlled media, trivializing their opinions, ideas, and concerns, and censoring women's voices.&lt;ref name="Houston1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kramarae|first2=Cheris|year=1991|title=Speaking from silence:methods of silencing and of resistance|journal=Discourse and Society|last1=Houston|first1=Marsha}} 2.4  387-400. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A central factor that contributes to these silencing methods is the trivialization of the lexicon and speech patterns that is often used to describe female activities.&lt;ref name="Houston1991" /&gt;

According to West and Turner (2010), individuals can use the following strategies to avoid the "muting" process: 
* Name the silencing factors, had it been men or news agencies. 
* Reclaim, elevate and celebrate women's discourse. 
* Create new words to the language system that are inclusive of marginalized groups and gendered words and experiences. 
* Use media platforms (traditional and new) to voice groups.&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner (2010). Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. 5th ed. Boston: McGraw-Hill. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assumptions ==
According to Cheris Kramarae, MGT makes three assumptions :

=== Assumption #1 ===

''The different experiences caused by the division of labor result in the different perceptions that women and men hold towards the world''

Using men's words is a disadvantage to women because Kramarae believes that men and women are vastly different and thus will view the world differently from each other. This stems from the distinction between the meanings of the words "[[sex]]" and "gender". Kramerae believes that communication between men and women is not on an even level. This is because language is man made. This makes it easier for men to communicate over women. [[Symbolic interactionism|Symbolic Interactionism Theory]] believes that "the extent of knowing is the extent of naming."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When applied to muted group, this means women have an extreme disadvantage over men because men are the namers.

=== Assumption #2 ===

''Women find it difficult to articulate their ideas as men's experience are dominant''

Kramarae argues that English is a "[hu]man-made language" and that it "embodies the perspectives of the masculine more than the feminine", while supporting "the perceptions of white middle-class males. Men are the standard."&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W., &amp; Foss, K.A. (2011). Theories of human communication, 10th ed. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press. P148&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kramerae argues that men use language to dominate women, so that women's voices become less present, or "muted". Kramarae also explains that men's control over language has produced an abundance of derogatory words for women and their speech patterns. Some of these include names such as "[[slut]]", "whore", and "easy lay", along with speech patterns such as "[[gossip]]ing", "whining", and "[[wikt:bitch#Verb|bitching]]".&lt;ref name="Houston1991" /&gt; When it comes to words connoting promiscuity, there are fewer male-specific terms and the ones that do exist are seen in a positive/sexual light. These include words such as "stud", "player", and "[[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;465).  Kramarae suggests these harmful words shape our reality. She believes that "words constantly ignored may eventually come to be unspoken and perhaps even unthought". This can lead women to doubt themselves and the intentions of their feelings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women are at a disadvantage once again.

=== Assumption #3 ===

''Women have to go through a translation process when speaking in order to participate in social life''

Kramarae says that women need to choose their words carefully in public. According to Kramarae, this is because, "what women want to say and can say best cannot be said easily because the language template is not of their own making."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another example of the male-dominated language Kramarae brings up is that in public speaking, women most often use sports and war analogies (things most women do not usually associate themselves with) in order to relate to their male audiences. This stems from the market being dominated by males for so long. Almost all prominent authors, theorists, and scientists have historically been male. This allows for them to give women the "facts" they should believe about society and life in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VanGorp|first=Ericka|title=Muted Group Theory|url=http://www.colorado.edu/communication/meta-discourses/Papers/App_Papers/VanGorp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramarae also believes that "males have more difficulty than females in understanding what members of the other gender mean."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feminist scholar [[Dale Spender]] supports the idea that language, and society in general, is traditionally male-centric. "[[Masculinity]] is the unmarked form: the assumption is that the world is male unless proven otherwise. Femininity is the marked form: it is the proof of otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man-Made Language|last=Spender|first=Dale|publisher=Pandora Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0863584015|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If masculinity, and subsequently language, are unmarked forms, than any marked form must go through a translation process in order to participate in social life.

==Applications==

=== Language ===
[[File:The Ladies' Dictionary 1694 (22163418033).jpg|thumb|289x289px|Application in language - A Feminist Dictionary]]
According to Kissack, traditionally communication has been constructed within the framework of a male dominated society. Women in corporate organizations are expected to use language associated with women, that is, "female-preferential" language. It has been considered as lower than the "male-preferential" language. The primary difference between the two is "male-preferential" language consists of details such as opinions and facts whereas "female-preferential" language consists mainly of personal details, emotions reflected in the conversations, also there is a great use of adjectives in it.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt;

Muted group theory has "recognized that women's voices are muted in Western society so that their experiences are not fully represented in language and has argued that women's experiences merit linguistic recognition".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. T. (2005). Feminist standpoint theory and muted group theory: Commonalities and divergences. Women &amp; Language, 28(2), 61-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramarae states that in order to change muted group status we also need to change dictionaries. Traditional dictionaries rely on the majority of their information to come from male literary sources. These male sources have the power to exclude words important to or created by women. Furthering this idea, Kramarae and Paula Treichler created [[A Feminist Dictionary]] with words they believed [[Merriam-Webster]] defined on male ideas. For example, the word "[[Cuckold]]" is defined as "the husband of an unfaithful wife" in Merriam Webster. However, there is no term for a wife who has an unfaithful husband. She is simply called a wife. Another example Kramarae defined was the word "doll". She defined "doll" as "a toy playmate given to, or made by children". Some adult males continue their childhood by labeling adult female companions "dolls". The feminist dictionary includes up to 2,500 words to emphasize women's linguistic ability and to give women words of empowerment and change their muted status.&lt;ref&gt;Treichler, P., and C. Kramarae. (1985) A feminist dictionary. Boston. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Long argues that words can shape reality and feelings. She also believes that women can grab opportunities to take up physical and political space if they are given more verbal space.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Hannah R. "Expanding the Dialogue: 7e Need for Fat Studies in Critical Intercultural Communication." (Winter 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass Media ===
[[File:Pride in London 2016 - A London Live reporter interviews the flag bearer for India before the parade.png|thumb|337x337px|Application in mass media - Women in the mass media industry]]
According to Kramarae, women have been locked out of the publishing business until 1970; thus they lacked influence on mass media and have often been misrepresented in history. The reason behind this lies in the predominance of male gatekeepers, who are defined as editors and other arbiters of a culture who determine which books, essays, poetry, plays, film scripts, etc. will appear in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramarae|first1=Cheris|title=Technology and Women's Voices : Keeping in Touch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Pamela Creedon argues that in the mid-70s there is an increase of women in the male-dominated profession of journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creedon|first1=P.|last2=Cramer|first2=J.|title=Women in Mass Communication|date=2007|publisher=Thousand Oak|pages=275–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014, The Women's Media Centre researchers explore the current status of women in the mass media industry. The report compiles 27,000 pieces of content among "20 of the most widely circulated, read, and viewed, and listened TV networks, newspapers, news wires, and online news in the United States."&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/|title=The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Women's Media Center|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that women (36.1%) are significantly out-numbered by men (63.4%). Although the number of women on TV news broadcasts is generally growing, the misrepresentation of women does not only regard their presence as anchors but also the events that they cover. Several studies show that while men mainly report on "hard" news, women are often relegated to cover "soft" news. Thus, women are often muted in terms of the topics they tend to cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabe|first1=Maria Elizabeth|last2=Samson|first2=Lelia|title=Sexual Cues Emanating From the Anchorette Chair: Implications for Perceived Professionalism, Fitness for Beat, and Memory for News|journal=Communication Research|date=2012|doi=10.1177/0093650210384986|volume=38|issue=4|pages=471–496|hdl=2022/14319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engstrom|first1=Erika|last2=Ferri|first2=Anthony J|title=Looking Through a Gendered Lens: Local U.S. Television News Anchors' Perceived Career Barriers|journal=Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media|date=Fall 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Women's Media Centre study is very U.S.-centric, non-dominant groups are often muted even in other country's media landscapes. For example, Aparna Hebbani and Charise-Rose Wills have explored how Muslim women have often been muted in the Australian mass media sphere.&lt;ref name="Hebbani"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Rose-Wills|first2=Charise|title=How Muslim women in Australia navigate through media (mis) representations of hijab/burqa|journal=Australian Journal of Communication|pages=89–102|last1=Hebbani|first1=Aparna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study shows that women that wear a [[hijab]] or [[burqa]] are often inaccurately and negatively connoted in Australian mass media.&lt;ref name="Hebbani" /&gt; According to the authors, Muslim women represent a muted group and thus cannot entirely incorporate their experiences, views, and perspective in their representation in Australian media. Thus, there is a social hierarchy that is privileging certain groups via Australian mass media.&lt;ref name="Hebbani" /&gt; It also shows that although currently muted, this group is attempting to gain a voice in this media landscape by engaging and interacting with members of the dominant culture in order to negotiate their silenced position.&lt;ref name="Hebbani" /&gt;

=== Social Rituals ===
[[File:Documentary-wedding-photographers-melbourne.jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in social rituals - A father gives his daughter away at the wedding ceremony.]]
There are some conventional stereotypes attached to men and women in society when an individual's behavior deviates from this norm they attain "negative feedback" for this opposition to the norm by their actions. In the case of women, this gets quite complicated as women are told to act in a certain manner, but when they do try and emulate their male counterparts, they are "discriminated" and "discouraged" for acting that way.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt;

Social rituals are another example of a place in which the muting process takes place. Kramarae suggests that many elements within wedding ceremonies place women in a silenced position. For example, the fact that the father of the bride "gives her away" to the groom, that the position of the bride – at the left of the minister – is considered less privileged than the one of the groom, that the groom announces his vows first, and that the groom is asked to kiss the bride, are all factors that contribute to the position of a woman as subordinated to the one of the man.&lt;ref name="Houston1991" /&gt;

As [[Catharine MacKinnon]] (one of the leading voices in the feminist legal movement ) suggests, the law sees women similarly as men see women. Like language, the legal system has thus been created, defined, and interpreted mostly by men.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon1983"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Summer 1983|title=Feminism, Marxism, Method, and the State: Toward Feminist Jurisprudence|journal=The University Chicago Press|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of unequal power relations between men and women, MacKinnon proposes new standards to define and evaluate [[sexual harassment]] and sex-related issues considered as the consequence of unwanted impositions of sexual requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Harassment of Working Women|date=1979|publisher=Yale University Press|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finley argues that there has been a recent interest in feminist [[jurisprudence]] and legal scholarship inspired by the law's failure to see that despite the legal removal of barriers, sexes are not socially equal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1988|title=The nature of domination and the nature of women: reflections on Feminism Unmodified|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|volume=|last1=Finley|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Workplace===
[[File:L-14-11-17-A-0465 (15796735016).jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in the workplace - Women in the workplace]]
In 1940s America, women entered the workplace in great numbers while men were at war. However, after the war period, the society did not encourage the participation of women in the workplace, and in this way tried to assert male dominance in the society. Organizations still appear to be male dominated. Women's experiences are often not taken into account in the workplace the way male experiences are. The "structure" is maintained by men who primarily use communication from the male perspective.&lt;ref name="Kissack"&gt;Kissack, H. (2010). "Muted voices: a critical look at e-male in organizations". ''Journal of European Industrial Training''. '''34''' (6): 539–551. {{DOI|10.1108/03090591011061211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most organization goals are met by the usage of "male-preferential" language, as they tend to focus on aspects such as "economic gain" and "performance improved". The main point of organizational communication is that it can help an employee fulfill their work duties. Women are not able to fulfill these duties using language more relevant to them, so in order to attain success in their workplace, they have to go beyond their natural realm and utilize "male-preferential" language.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt;

One of the ways that women are differentiated can be observed when we take the "performance appraisals" into consideration. What they mainly consist of is reviews that are based on the standards that are more like "masculine" standards.&lt;ref name="Kissack" /&gt; Research points to muted groups having little to no sense of agency, dominant emotions, and can point to the employee’s role in the silencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meares|first=Mary M.|last2=Oetzel|first2=John G.|last3=Torres|first3=Annette|last4=Derkacs|first4=Denise|last5=Ginossar|first5=Tamar|date=2004-02|title=Employee mistreatment and muted voices in the culturally diverse workplace|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0090988042000178121|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|volume=32|issue=1|pages=4–27|doi=10.1080/0090988042000178121|issn=0090-9882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One member of the subordinate group that is also silenced in the workplace are women who face sexual harassment by the dominant group. Many women have a hard time when faced with harassment in a male dominated workplace because they are "the verbal minority".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. T. (1992). Telling our stories: Narratives as a basis for theorizing sexual harassment. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 20, 349-362.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations rarely encourage issues of [[sexual harassment]] be discussed openly and call for confidentiality when dealing with complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clair|first=Robin Patric|date=1993-06|title=The use of framing devices to sequester organizational narratives: Hegemony and harassment|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637759309376304|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=60|issue=2|pages=113–136|doi=10.1080/03637759309376304|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, women rarely go through formal channels of reporting sexual harassment for a number of reasons to include: "expecting their compliant to be ignored or trivialized by the male dominant group, fear of not being protected from retaliation, worry that the male dominated hierarchy will 'team up' against them, or that their time will be wasted due to the organizations ineffective sexual harassment policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1981-12|title=Toward a Redefinition of Sexual Equality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1340713|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=95|issue=2|pages=487|doi=10.2307/1340713|issn=0017-811X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those from the subordinate groups are trusted less than white men in the workplace and in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amiot|first=Catherine E.|last2=Bourhis|first2=Richard Y.|date=2005-06|title=Discrimination between dominant and subordinate groups: The positive-negative asymmetry effect and normative processes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1348/014466604x17605|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=289–308|doi=10.1348/014466604x17605|issn=0144-6665}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Education ===
[[File:Womens Studies (8407729802).jpg|thumb|260x260px|Application in education - "Women's studies"]]
The classroom can be a place where women are muted. [[Women's education in the United States]] has progressed over the years, but academia is still male-dominated. Kramarae has raised several suggestions for more inclusive educational environments, such as including "women's humor", "speechlessness", and ways to address the issue of "abusive language".&lt;ref name="Kramarae1996"&gt;Kramarae, Cheris. (1996) "Centers Of Change: An Introduction To Women's Own Communication Programs." Communication Education 45.4: 315. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Including more diverse language systems in academia can keep it from being dominated by one way of thinking.

In the classroom, men and women utilize language differently. The bond differently with other members of their gender. Women tend to bond with each other through the process of discussing their problems, while men bond with each other using "playful insults" and "put downs".&lt;ref name="Tannen1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|year=1992|title=How Men and Women Use Language Differently in Their Lives and in the Classroom|journal=The Education Digest|volume=57|issue=6}} n. page. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of classroom discussions, men tend to believe that they are supposed to dominate the class discussion while women avoid dominating the discussions.&lt;ref name="Tannen1992" /&gt;

Houston believes in order to create a positive reform in education it might be useful to revise the curriculum and lay special stress on "woman-centered communication" education. [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]] (WS) has evolved and grown over the years. Today there is greater demand for faculty to be on initiatives such as WS programs, African American Programs, and other programs focused on marginalized groups.&lt;ref name="Kramarae1996" /&gt;

=== Politics ===
[[File:Third Party Debate 2012 (8120719565).jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in politics - Third Party Debate 2012]]
Independent parties have emerged since [[World War II]] to offer people alternative choices for election. However, most of these parties operate only in "circumscribed regions or with very narrow platforms". Prentice studied the impact of the [[Third party (United States)|third party]], i.e., candidates from non-major parties, in public debate. He finds out that there have been few studies around third party by 2003 and even though third party candidates are involved in public campaign debates, they remain inarticulate and ignored due to the judgment by "standard of the political rhetoric and worldview of the major parties".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prentice|first=Carolyn|year=2005|title=Third Party Candidates in Political Debates: Muted Groups Struggling to Express Themselves|url=|journal=Speaker &amp; Gavel|volume=42: Iss. 1, Article 2.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prentice points out that major parties usually interfere with the free expression of third parties through three ways: "ignoring their claims, appearing confused (verbally or nonverbally) by the claims, or actively attacking the claims made". He also notices that the debate questions are structured in a way that reflects major parties' worldviews, which results in third party's mutedness. In order to participate and articulate their own worldview, third party candidates have to transform their ideas to match the major parties' models through emphasizing the agreements with the majority rather than the differences and sometimes may lead them to make statements that can be misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Communication Studies, 47(3). doi: 10.1080/10510979609368473&lt;/ref&gt; Although LGBT individuals do not necessarily share the same identity, they share similar experiences of being marginalized by the dominant groups.

=== Race ===
[[File:1. The right to be heard- People claiming their right to a better life (9065195747).jpg|thumb|337x337px|Application in race - "the right to be heard"]]
[[Gloria Ladson-Billings]] believes that "stories provide the necessary context for understanding, feeling, and interpreting" and argues that voices of dispossessed and marginalized groups such as people of color are muted within the dominant culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ladson-Billings, Gloria. (1998). Just what is critical race theory and what's it doing in a nice field like education?, International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 11:1, 7-24, DOI: 10.1080/095183998236863&lt;/ref&gt; Critical race theorists try to bring the marginalized group's viewpoint to the forefront through an encouragement of "naming one's own reality". Delgado addresses three reasons for "naming one's own reality" in legal discourse: "1) much of 'reality' is socially constructed; 2) stories provide members of outgroups a vehicle for psychic self-preservation; and 3) the exchange of stories from teller to listener can help overcome [[ethnocentrism]] and the dysconscious drive or need to view the world in one way".&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, R. (1989). Symposium: Legal storytelling. Michigan Law Review, 87, 2073.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to education, critical race theorists argue that the official school curriculum is designed to maintain a "[[White supremacy|White supremacist]] master script". As Swartz contends, master scripting sets the standard knowledge for students, which legitimizes "dominant, white, upper-class, male voices" and mutes multiple perspectives. The voices from other non-dominant groups are under control, mastered and can only be heard through reshaping and translation to meet the dominant standard.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, E. (1992). Emancipatory narratives: Rewriting the master script in the school curriculum. Journal of Negro Education, 61, 341-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Lasdon-Billing argues that the curriculum should be race-neutral or colorblind, present people of color, and "presume a homogenized 'we' in a celebration of diversity".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Age ===
[[Ageism]] leads to certain age groups being muted in American society. In particular, the elderly are often ignored and marginalized.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seaver|first=Carol|date=1996|title=Muted lives: older battered women|url=|journal=Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=8|issue=2|pages=3–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Muted lives: Older battered women'', Carol Seaver discusses how older abused women are silenced because of sexism and ageism. She focuses on issues specific to elderly abused women, not just abused women in general. She argues that this group of domestic abuse survivors faces a specific set of difficulties, "They are silenced by ageist assumptions about them as too resistant and hopeless to change or made invisible by the notion that very frail elders are the only victims of elder abuse."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Here, age intersects with gender to create a specific kind of muted group. In ''Muted groups in health communication policy and practice: The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas'', Deborah Ballard-Reisch examines how and why elderly populations in the rural areas of Nevada and Kansas are considered muted health communication groups. Ageism, as well as other factors, result in this community being muted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballard-Reisch   87-93|first=Deborah|date=2010|title=Muted groups in health communication policy and practice: The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas|url=|journal=Women &amp; Language|volume=33|issue=2|pages=87–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aging populations, as seen in Seaver and Ballard-Reisch's works, can be silenced by stereotypes, such as the idea that the elderly are resistant to change.

Issues of ageism intersect with [[heterosexism]] when looking at how aging LGBT community members are silenced. Scholar Maria T. Brown writes, "The exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) elders from queer and gerontological theories has resulted in the silencing of LGBT older adults and their experiences."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Maria T.|date=2009|title=LGBT aging and rhetorical silence|url=https://experts.syr.edu/en/publications/lgbt-aging-and-rhetorical-silence|journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy|volume=6|pages=65–78|via=Syracuse University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown claims that the silencing is a "rhetorical move" that excludes the elderly from [[queer theory]] and queerness from the field [[gerontology]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This case study is an example of how identities intersect (in this case, being elderly and part of the LGBT community). MGT can apply to both of these identities and intersections.

=== Disability ===
Marcel Calvez argues that, "What makes a social group muted is that claims of its members to participate into social life are discounted and that they have internalised the idea that they are not entitled to raise their voice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvez|first=Marcel|date=2001|title=Involvement and detachment in intellectual disability studies|url=|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=41–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this logic, he says that those with intellectual disabilities are muted. Calvez's study examines the experiences of those with intellectual disabilities, with special attention to the fact these groups are often marginalized and silenced.

Many disabled groups are silenced by the dominant abled group that knowingly or unknowingly exclude them. The means of muting, ridicule, ritual, control, and harassment can all apply to disabled groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Ableism|Ableist]] language, such as use of the pejorative term "[[Retard (pejorative)|retard]]", can be used to ridicule disabled groups. By bringing attention to the use of pejoratives and how they affect certain communities, disabled individuals and abled allies can raise awareness about their harm.

== Navigating the Muted Status ==
To get their concerns recognized by the dominant group, the subordinate groups take on language and communication styles of the dominant group. There are particularly stringent demands on the performances by members of "inferior" groups when they communicate with persons from the dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;Stanback, M., &amp; Pearce, W. (n.d.). ''Talking to “The Man”: Some Communication Strategies Used by Members of “Subordinate” Social Groups.'' The Quarterly Journal of Speech, 67(1), 21–30. &lt;/ref&gt; Orbe (1994) identified six themes central to African American male communication: "(1) the importance of other African Americans, (2) learning how to communicate with non-African Americans, (3) keeping a safe distance, (4) playing the part (snap!), (5) testing the sincerity of non-African Americans, and (6) an intense social responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orbe|first=Mark P.|date=1994-06|title=“Remember, it's always whites' ball”: Descriptions of African American male communication|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01463379409369935|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=42|issue=3|pages=287–300|doi=10.1080/01463379409369935|issn=0146-3373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents in Orbe’s research were observed changing immediately into two different people, in order to play the part, when communicating with non-African Americans.  

In addition to African American men feeling as though they need to communicate differently with White men, African American women also feel pressure to conform to the dominant language. A speaker’s dialect (e.g. Black English or Mainstream American English) is most heavily influenced by his or her place in the social hierarchy, for example, the speaker’s socio-economic status, educational status, provenance, and/or racial/ethnic origin. As a result, African American women find themselves needing to “code-switch” when communicating with the dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Marsha Houston: (aka Marsha Houston Stanback)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781452225692.n9|work=Black Pioneers in Communication Research|pages=172–188|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9780761929932|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies of Resistance ==
MGT offers ways to change the muting status quo, i.e., naming the strategies of silencing, reclaiming, elevating and celebrating women's discourse, and creating new languages based on the experience of the marginalized group.

Women as a muted group recognize the ways in which women are silenced both interpersonally and societally, but also stress the ways that they resist being silenced such as labeling and talking about problems that are usually ignored in the dominant discourse (Vonnegut 1992). Specifically, with the creation of the [[Feminist theory|Feminist Theory]] to understand the nature of gender inequality. Additionally, in the last year, the international movement against sexual harassment and assault with the [[Me Too movement|Me Too Movement]] are other examples of strategies of resistance against the dominant group.

== Extension ==
Although the muted group theory has been mainly developed as a [[feminist theory]], it can also be applied to other silenced groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hechter|first1=M.|date=2004|title=From class to culture|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=110|issue=2|pages=400–445|doi=10.1086/421357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Orbe, a communication theorist, has suggested that in the U.S. the dominant group consists of white, heterosexual, middle-class, males. Thus, groups that distinguish themselves from the dominant one in terms of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, and economic status can potentially be silenced or muted.

=== Interethnic Communication  ===
In ''[[African Americans|African-American]] communication research: Toward a deeper understanding of interethnic communication'' (1995) and ''Constructing co-cultural theory:  An explication of culture, power, and communication'' (1998), Orbe fleshed out two important extensions of muted group theory:
*Muting as described in muted group theory can be applied to many cultural groups.  Orbe stated that research performed by the dominant white European culture has created a view of African-American communication "which promotes the illusion that all African-Americans, regardless of gender, age, class, or sexual orientation, communicate in a similar manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orbe|first=MP|year=1995|title=African American Communication Research: Toward a Deeper Understanding of Interethnic Communication|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=59|pages=61–78|doi=10.1080/10570319509374507}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are several ways in which members of a muted group can face their position within the dominant culture.  Orbe identified 26 different ways that members of muted groups can use to face the structures and messages imposed by dominant groups.  For example, individuals can choose to (1) emphasize commonalities and downplay cultural differences, (2) educate others about norms of the muted group, and (3) avoid members of the dominant group. Orbe also suggests that individuals choose one of the 26 different ways based on previous experiences, context, abilities, and perceived costs and rewards.

Therefore, although Kramarae focuses on women's muted voices, she also opens the door to the application of muted group theory to issues beyond gender differences. Orbe not only applies this theoretical framework to a different muted group, i.e. African-Americans, but also contributes by assessing "how individual and small collectives work together to negotiate their muted group status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuing the legacy of theorizing from the margins: Conceptualizations of co-cultural theory", Women and Language|last1=Orbe|first1=M. P.|date=1995|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model", African American communication and identities: Essential reading|last1=Orbe|first1=M. P.|date=1998|publisher=Thousand Oakes|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-cultural Communication ===
Orbe regards "interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members" as co-cultural communication. He argues that there are three preferred outcomes in the co-cultural communication process: "assimilation (e.g., becoming integrated into mainstream culture), accommodation (gaining acceptance and space in a society and achieving cultural pluralism without hierarchy), or separation (maintaining a culturally distinct identity in intercultural interactions."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Orbe, M.P. (1998b). From the standpoint(s) of traditionally muted groups: Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model. Communication Theory, 8, 1–26. doi:10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00209.x&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes three communication approaches: "nonassertive (when individuals are constrained and nonconfrontational, putting the needs of others first to avoid conflicts), assertive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that consider the needs of themselves and others), or aggressive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that ignore the needs of others)."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The different combinations of the three preferred outcomes and three communication approaches result in nine communication orientations.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Further, although various groups can be considered as muted within society, silenced and dominant groups can also exist within any group. For example, Anita Taylor and M. J. Hardman posit that feminist movements can also present dominant subgroups that mute other groups within the same movement. Thus, members within oppressed groups can have diverse opinions and one can become dominant and further mute the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearing Many Voices|last1=Hardman|first1=M. J.|last2=Taylor|first2=A.|date=2000|publisher=Hampton Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
Edwin Ardener saw that MGT had pragmatic as well as analytical potentials.&lt;ref name="Ardener2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ardener|first=Shirley|author2=Edwin Ardener|year=2005|title="Muted Groups": The genesis of an idea and its praxis|journal=Women and Language|volume=28|issue=2|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edwin Ardener always maintained that MGT was not only, or even primarily, about women - although women comprised a conspicuous case in point. In fact, he also drew on his personal experience as a sensitive (intellectual) boy among hearty (sportive) boys in an all boys London secondary school. As a result of his early encounters with other boys, he identified with other groups in society for whom self-expression was constrained.&lt;ref name="Ardener2005" /&gt;

MGT has often been challenged. [[Deborah Tannen]], the theorist that created [[Genderlect]] Theory, criticizes feminist scholars like Kramarae for assuming that men are trying to control women. Tannen acknowledges that differences in male and female communication styles sometimes lead to imbalances of power, but unlike Kramarae, she is willing to assume that the problems are caused primarily  by men and women's different styles. Tannen warns readers that "bad feelings and imputation of bad motives or bad character can come about when there was no intention to dominate, to wield power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conversational style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramerae thinks Tannen's opinion is naïve. She believes men belittle and ignore women whenever they speak out against being muted. She also pointed out that "our political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems support gender, race, and class hierarchies".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Em|publisher=David Patterson|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-353430-5|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both theorists believe muting is involved, but they see it from different standpoints.

Is MGT outdated? In the 1970s and 1980s, MGT challenged the status quo, of academia, at least. While many women reading and discussing the theory thought it made sense in their own lives, many other academics thought it wasn't proper, both theoretically and politically. It certainly wasn't like any of the theories in introductory communication texts at the time. It was considered radical. If MGT isn't as exciting as it once seemed, this is due in part to its success and the success of theories and actions related to it.

The '''Bosnian mafia''' (or '''Bosnian organized crime''') is the body of illegal gangs and criminal organisations operating in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and within the [[Bosnian diaspora]]. Bosnian [[organised crime]] figures operate mostly in Europe. Bosnian organised-crime groups are involved in a wide range of activities and [[extortion]] is (often under the cover of ostensible [[Security guard|security]] and [[insurance]] companies) . Smuggling revenues are between €600 million and €900 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffiths|first=Hugh|title=Investigation: Will Europe Take on Bosnia's Mafia?|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/investigation-will-europe-take-bosnias-mafia|newspaper=Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting|date=21 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organised-crime groups and activities==
The Bosnian mafia can be broadly divided into four categories – the [[Bosniak]] mafia, the [[Bosnian Serb]] mafia, the [[Bosnian Croat]] mafia and many local organised-crime groups.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The Bosnian mafia groups are involved in a wide range of activities; one of their more notorious activities occurred in 2003 when they smuggled and sold 250,000 [[Zastava M70]] Yugoslav-made [[AK-47]]s to Iraq.{{Citation needed|reason=Fact or assumption? Source needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[Federalism|federalist]] government of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes fighting organised-crime groups extremely difficult. Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two largely independent entities, the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]] – both of which have their own capital, parliament, president and police force. Due to the poor cooperation between law-enforcement agencies in the two regions, criminals can often evade prosecution simply by moving from one to the other. Mafia groups from neighbouring countries (particularly [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]]) often base their operations in [[Sarajevo]], due to its proximity to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

However, there have been some efforts to increase collaboration between the two regions. In 2006 the [[European Union]] established the [[State Investigation and Protection Agency]]. SIPA is a Bosnian federal police agency with authority in both regions, and is under the direct administration of the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH MIS).

The annual '''Operaball''' has been held in [[Oslo]], Norway, by the [[Tårnseilerne]] association ([[Apus apus|Swift]]) since 1988. The Operaball merged with Oslo Opera Festival in 2004 for a week of concerts and performances with Opera and classical music.

==History==
[[File:Operaballet i Oslo 1990 STore sal, Gamle logen.jpg|thumb|left|Period dance at the Oslo Operaball in 1990]]
[[File:Gamle Logen, Operaball 2005.jpg|thumb|260px|Operaball in Oslo 2005]]
[[File:Operaball i Gamle Logen, Oslo 2004.jpg|thumb|260px|Operaball in Oslo 2004]]
[[File:Operaball i Gamle Logen, Oslo 2003.jpg|thumb|260px|Operaball in Oslo 2003]]
The balls have been period historical [[costume]] or [[masquerade ball|masquerade]] balls and have been held in the historical [[Gamle Logen]]. The old [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] Lodge in Oslo was renovated in 1989, but housed similar events in [[Oslo|Christiania]] throughout the 19th century attended by some of Norway's most famous composers and artists - such as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Halfdan Kjerulf]], Johan Svendsen, etc. Participants have first attended an [[Opera]] performance at the national opera house, then walk in a costume or carnival procession with horse-drawn carts through the historical centre of Oslo to the historical former freemasons Lodge. Then follows parallel performances and dance in up to six different halls with several orchestras and groups of musicians. All participants are invited to two evenings of rehearsals in [[historical dance]]s, such as the [[menuett]], [[mazurka]], [[francaise (dance)|francaise]], [[lanciers]], [[galopp]] and so forth. Lectures and information evenings inform about the period, culture and attires chosen as theme for the event.

The annual series have historical precedents since the 1850s in the same hall. There were annual [[masquerade balls]] in  the Old Freemasons lodge, by the student association and later also by the artist association in the [[carnival]] season in Christiania. These traditions are closesly related to the present Operaball in Oslo. Several compositions have been written for these events, notably [[Johan Svendsen]]s Festival [[Polonaise]]. [[Edvard Grieg]] has performed and held concerts in the freemasons lodge and one piano composition is called At the carnival. 

The present series were initiated by [[Bjørn Einar Sakseid.]] His first full-scale ball required [[roccoco]] costumes with [[Mozart]] style wigs, powder, and white stockings.
After the restoration and reopening of the old [[Freemason]]s Lodge, this ball series has been the largest event in this hall. The capacity is 600 people. After a gala performance a procession walks a historical route through the city streets Count to [[Grev Herman Wedel Jarlsberg|Wedel]]'s Square and the freemasons Lodge. From 1988-2006 the performance was at the [[Opera House of Oslo|Norwegian Opera]] in Folketeaterbygningen, the new Opera House in Bjørvika opened in 2008. In 2007 and 2011 a mini-opera was held in the old freemasons Lodge.

Operaballs have alternately been called Roccoco Ball, Mozart Ball, masquerade or Mask Balls, in 1992 it was a Leap Year Ball on 29 February. In 1998, there was an Operaball on Valentine's Day, with the Orchestra playing A midsummer Night's dream by Mendelssohn, and in 1993 there was also a Christiania Soirée, where the organizers held the first public ball at [[Akershus fortress]] since the Middle Ages.

The organizers of the Operaballs were first private initiatives by Bjørn Einar Sakseid with Christopher Brown (1988) and Tormod Carlsen (1989) among students at the [[University of Oslo]]. In 1990 the ball was part of the student week of the Norwegian student society led by Beatrice Johnson, from 1991 it was fronted by [[Jo Siri Ekgren]] and [[Signe Marie Hernes]] and in 1992 the Association Tårnseilerne ([[Apus apus|swift]]) was founded. In addition to the ball at the Old Freemasons lodge there have been balls in the Roccoco Halls at the Grand Hotel in Oslo in 1988, a Palace Ball at [[Akershus Castle]] in 1993 and a Fairytale Ball at [[Holmenkollen Park Hotel]] in 1995. The leader of the Operaballs (2004–2011), Gjørill Songvoll, received the City of Oslo's Culture Prize in 2010.

The Operaball in Oslo has inspired several similar balls, notably by the student society in Trondheim, the Jyske Opera in Denmark, the Opera house in Rostock, Germany and Copenhagen Opera House. These have visited, referred to and invited members of the Operaballs in Oslo to similar events. The Jutland Opera ([[den Jyske Opera]]) has organized several masquerade balls after visiting the Oslo Opera Ball and with participation from Oslo, with a masked Ball held on 5 February 2005. The first mask ball in Copenhagen modeled after the Operaball in Oslo was held on 18 February 2005 in the Royal Theatre and Molktes Palé.

[[Image:Pearl Stich Sample.jpg|thumb|right|The purl stitch.]]

An '''overlock''' is a kind of [[Stitch (textile arts)|stitch]] that [[sewing|sews]] over the edge of one or two pieces of [[cloth]] for edging, [[hem]]ming, or [[Seam (sewing)|seaming]]. Usually an overlock [[sewing machine]] will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called '''"sergers"''' in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a [[lockstitch]] sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the [[Sewing needle|needle]] thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.

Overlock sewing machines usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, and most are used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. Overlock stitches are extremely versatile, as they can be used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.

Overlocking is also referred to as "overedging", "merrowing", or "serging". Though "serging” technically refers to overlocking with cutters, in practice the four terms are used interchangeably.

[[Image:Singer 14U344B overlock sewing machine.JPG|thumb|right|An overlock machine.]]

==History==
Overlock stitching was invented by the [[Merrow Sewing Machine Company|Merrow Machine Company]] in  1881.
[[Image:Overlockerindustrial.jpg|thumb|A Zoje 5 cone industrial overlocker]]
J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in [[Connecticut]] in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements to be used in the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for [[whip stitch|crochet]] stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard [[lockstitch]]ing, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless [[Embroidered patch|emblem]] edger.

A landmark lawsuit between Willcox &amp; Gibbs and the Merrow Machine Company in 1905 established the ownership and rights to the early mechanical development of overlocking to the [[Merrow Sewing Machine Company|Merrow Machine Company]].

Throughout the early 20th Century, the areas of Connecticut, USA and New York, USA were the centers of textile manufacturing and machine production. Consequently, many overlock machine companies established themselves in the [[Northeastern United States]].

In 1964 several engineers and managers at one Japanese manufacturer{{which|date=November 2018}} redesigned the industrial serger they were currently manufacturing as a smaller, lighter model intended for home use. They presented their concept to their employer, and after it was rejected they quit and formed the [[Juki]] Corporation.

Nick Tacony, founder of [[Tacony Corporation]], introduced machinery for producing the overlock stich (so called "baby lock") to the United States market. This allowed sewing enthusiasts to produce clothing with finishing seams like those made by industrial garment manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdta.com/Magazines/FEB12/sw-babylockFeb12.html "Baby Lock, the original home serger"], VDTA Magazine, reprinted from SQE Professional February, 2012. Retrieved on October 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In the United States, the term "overlocker" has largely been replaced by "serger". However, in other parts of the world such as Australia and the UK, the term "overlocker" is still in use.

==Types==
Overlock stitches are classified in a number of ways. The most basic classification is by the number of threads used in the stitch. Industrial overlock machines are generally made in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 thread formations. Each of these formations has unique uses and benefits:

* 1-thread: End-to-end seaming or "butt-seaming" of piece goods for textile finishing.
* 2-thread: Edging and seaming, especially on knits and wovens, finishing seam edges, stitching flatlock seams, stitching elastic and lace to lingerie, and hemming. This is the most common type of overlock stitch.
* 3-thread: Sewing pintucks, creating narrow rolled hems, finishing fabric edges, [[decorative edging]], and seaming knit or woven fabrics.
* 4-thread: [[Decorative edging]] and finishing, seaming high-stress areas, mock safety stitches which create extra strength while retaining flexibility.
* 5-thread: In apparel manufacturing, safety stitches utilizing two needles create a very strong seam.

Two- and three-thread formations are also known as '''"[[merrowing]]"''' after the Merrow Machine Company.

Additional variables in the types of overlock stitches are the stitch eccentric, and the stitch width. The stitch eccentric indicates how many stitches per inch there are, which is adjustable and can vary widely within one machine. Different stitch eccentrics create more or less dense and solid-looking edges. The stitch width indicates how wide the stitch is from the edge of the fabric.  Lightweight fabrics often require a wider stitch to prevent pulling.

Adding extra variation in stitch types is the differential feed feature, which allows feed to be adjusted; extra-fast feed creates a ruffled or "lettuce-leaf" effect. Finally, some [[merrowing]] machines contain parts to roll the fabric edge into the stitch for added durability.

&lt;gallery&gt;
image:Overlock_1-thread.jpg|1-thread, 5/8" wide, 12 stitches per inch
image:merrow 300204.jpeg|2-thread, 1/8" wide, 20 stitches per inch, with differential feed
image:Overlock_4-thread.jpg|3-thread, 5/32" wide, 17 stitches per inch
image:Overlock_3-thread.jpg|3-thread, 1/4" wide, 7 stitches per inch
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Formation==
[[Image:Overlock trzynitkowy.SVG|thumb|200px]]
# When the needle enters the fabric, a loop is formed in the thread at the back of the needle.
# As the needle continues its downward motion into the fabric, the lower looper begins its movement from left to right. The tip of the lower looper passes behind the needle and through the loop of thread that has formed behind the needle.
# The lower looper continues along its path moving toward the right of the serger. As it moves, the lower thread is carried through the needle thread.
#  While the lower looper is moving from left to right, the upper looper advances from right to left. The tip of the upper looper passes behind the lower looper and picks up the lower looper thread and needle thread.
# The lower looper now begins its move back into the far left position. As the upper looper continues to the left, it holds the lower looper thread and needle thread in place.
# The needle again begins its downward path passing behind the upper looper and securing the upper looper thread (the needle goes between the metal and the thread) . This completes the overlock stitch formation and begins the stitch cycle all over again.

==Uses==
Overlock stitches are traditionally used for edging and light seaming.  Other applications include:

* Sewing [[Net (textile)|netting]]
* [[Butt-seaming]] is used for joining the ends of piece goods.&lt;ref&gt;Merrow 70-Y3B-2&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flat-locking]]
* Edging [[Embroidered patch|emblem]]s
* [[Purl stitching]]
* [[Rolled hemming]]
* [[Decorative edging]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18782">A '''panzootic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] παν ''pan'' all + ζόιον ''zoion'' animal) is an [[epizootic]] (an outbreak of an [[infectious disease]] of animals) that spreads across a large region (for example a continent), or even worldwide. The equivalent in [[human]] populations is called a [[pandemic]].

A panzootic can start when three conditions have been met:

* the emergence of a disease new to the population.
* the agent infects a species and causes serious illness.
* the agent spreads easily and sustainably among animals.

A disease or condition is not a panzootic merely because it is widespread or kills a large number of animals; it must also be infectious. For example, [[cancer]] is responsible for a large number of deaths but is not considered a panzootic because the disease is, generally speaking, not infectious. Unlike an epizootic, a panzootic covers all or nearly all
species over a large surface area (ex. rabies, anthrax). Typically an enzootic or an epizootic, or
their cause, may act as a potential preparatory factor .&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Manual of Veterinary Sanitary Science and Police ...|last = Fleming|first = George|authorlink = George Fleming (veterinarian)|publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall|year = 1875|isbn = |location = London|pages = 5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Spread and Environmental Influences ==
Contagion and infection by far play the biggest role in the
dissemination and spread of epizootic and panzootic diseases. These include
virulent (ex. Cattle Plague), septic (can be caused in the change in food
quality), parasitic (ex. Scabies), and miasmatic infections (ex. Typhoid Fever).
Many claim that an accidental morbific cause, which infects a great number of
animals which ceases activity after a prolonged time period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Certain factors come into play in the spread of certain
panzootic diseases, as can be seen with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This infection
seems to be sensitive to external conditions, particularly the environments temperature
and moisture. These factors leads to limitations on where the diseases can
thrive, acting almost as its ‘climate niche’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global Amphibian Extinction Risk Assessment for the Panzootic Chytrid Fungus|url = http://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/1/1/52|journal = Diversity|date = 2009-09-11|pages = 52–66|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.3390/d1010052|first = Dennis|last = Rödder|first2 = Jos|last2 = Kielgast|first3 = Jon|last3 = Bielby|first4 = Sebastian|last4 = Schmidtlein|first5 = Jaime|last5 = Bosch|first6 = Trenton W.

==Examples==

=== Persistence of H5N1 Avian Influenza ===
H5N1, the highly pathogenic strain of [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|influenza]], was first detected in the goose population of [[Guangdong|Gaungdong]], China in 1996.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The emergence and diversification of panzootic H5N1 influenza viruses|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213001779|journal = Virus Research|date = 2013-12-05|pmc = 4017639|pmid = 23735533|pages = 35–43|volume = 178|series = H5N1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2013.05.012|first = Yi|last = Guan|first2 = Gavin J. D.|last2 = Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal.

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[China]]." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm | title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece| date=2005-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of October only 67 people had died as a result of H5N1 which was atypical of previous influenza [[pandemic]]s.

The enzooicity of H5N1 in birds, poultry in particular, has led to a major panzootic. As of 2012, there was an estimated 400 million birds killed from infection of the H5N1 strain of influenza. Studies have shown that [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] is very well adapted to domestic duck and geese, making them key in controlling the H5N1 strain and preventing future panzootic events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Presently, the highly pathogenic Asian strain of Avian Influenza is still continuing to kill poultry and wild birds alike on panzootic scales. The persistence of such a pathogen in the environment would only lead to a further continuation of panzootic scale eliminations of birds. To try to control this, scientists did research involving the shed feathers of domestic ducks to test the prevalence of H5N1. Although viral persistence was notably found within drinking water and feces, the feathers exhibited the most remaining H5N1 strain for up to 160 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistence of Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1) in Feathers Detached from Bodies of Infected Domestic Ducks|url = http://aem.asm.org/content/76/16/5496|journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date = 2010-08-15|issn = 0099-2240|pmc = 2918962|pmid = 20581177|pages = 5496–5499|volume = 76|issue = 16|doi = 10.1128/AEM.00563-10|first = Yu|last = Yamamoto|first2 = Kikuyasu|last2 = Nakamura|first3 = Manabu|last3 = Yamada|first4 = Masaji|last4 = Mase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The persistence exhibited through the feathers indicates the potential for environmental contamination of not only H5N1, but also other untested viruses.

=== White Nose Syndrome in Bats ===
White Nose Syndrome (WNS) is a rapidly spreading fungal infection responsible for killing millions of bats within the past 9 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = SPACE-TIME MODELS FOR A PANZOOTIC IN BATS, WITH A FOCUS ON THE ENDANGERED INDIANA BAT|journal = Journal of Wildlife Diseases|date = 2015-01-02|pages = 876–887|volume = 48|issue = 4|doi = 10.7589/2011-06-176|pmid = 23060489|first = Wayne E.|last = Thogmartin|first2 = R.

The mechanism of how the infection on the skin kills bats is unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the outward cause of mortality of the infected bats depends on the stage and severity of the bat. Infected bats commonly die from starvation over winter, and can suffer from lasting damage to the wing membranes and impair summer foraging if survived the winter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Bat White-Nose Syndrome in North America|author1=David S.

Severely infected bats emerge prematurely from hibernation, and if they survive long enough and enter a different hibernaculum, the likelihood of transmission is probably high, because they presumably carry a large load of fungal spores.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transmission of the infection is either physically from bat-to-bat contact, or from and hibernaculum-to-bat, through the exposure to spores of ''Geomyces- destructans'' that were present on a roosting substrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Newcastle disease''' is a contagious bird disease affecting many domestic and wild avian species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Outbreak of Conjunctivitis Due to Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) Occurring in Poultry Workers|journal = American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health|date = 1952-06-01|issn = 0002-9572|pmc = 1526237|pmid = 14924001|pages = 672–678|volume = 42|issue = 6|first = C. B.|last = Nelson|first2 = B. S.|last2 = Pomeroy|first3 = Katherine|last3 = Schrall|first4 = W. E.|last4 = Park|first5 = R. J.|last5 = Lindeman|doi=10.2105/ajph.42.6.672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease is contagious through immediate contact between healthy birds and the bodily discharges of infected birds. This includes transmission through droppings, secretions from the nose, mouth and eyes. Newcastle disease spreads quickly among birds kept in captivity, such as commercially raised chickens.&lt;ref name="Newcastle Disease Virus NDV"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV)|url = http://www.avianbiotech.com/diseases/newcastle.htm|website = www.avianbiotech.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include sneezing, gasping for air, nasal discharge, coughing, greenish and watery diarrhea, nervousness, depression, muscular tremors, drooping wings, twisting of head and neck, circling, complete paralysis, partial to complete drop in egg production and thin-shelled eggs, swelling of the tissues around the eyes and in the neck, and sudden death.&lt;ref name="Newcastle Disease Virus NDV"/&gt;

Newcastle disease was first identified in Java, Indonesia, in 1926, and in 1927, in Newcastle upon Tyne, England (whence it got its name). However, it may have been prevalent as early as 1898, when a disease wiped out all the domestic fowl in northwest Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some Observations On The Epizootiology Of NewCastle Disease|journal = Canadian Journal of Comparative Medicine and Veterinary Science|date = 1956-05-01|issn = 0316-5957|pmc = 1614269|pmid = 17648892|pages = 155–168|volume = 20|issue = 5|first = L. W.|last = Macpherson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its effects are most notable in domestic poultry due to their high susceptibility and the potential for severe impacts of an epizootic on the poultry industries. It is endemic to many countries. The emergence and spread of new genotypes across the world represents a significant threat to poultry. This suggests that the disease is continuously evolving, leading to more diversity (Miller et al., 2009).&lt;ref name="Miller 216–229"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Identification of new sub-genotypes of virulent Newcastle disease virus with potential panzootic features|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134814004031|journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution|date = 2015-01-01|pages = 216–229|volume = 29|doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2014.10.032|pmid = 25445644|first = Patti J.|last = Miller|first2 = Ruth|last2 = Haddas|first3 = Luba|last3 = Simanov|first4 = Avishay|last4 = Lublin|first5 = Shafqat Fatima|last5 = Rehmani|first6 = Abdul|last6 = Wajid|first7 = Tasra|last7 = Bibi|first8 = Taseer Ahmad|last8 = Khan|first9 = Tahir|last9 = Yaqub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, little has been done to comprehend the procedure and advancement of new genotypes (Alexander et al., 2012).&lt;ref name="Miller 216–229"/&gt; Recent vNDV have been characterized as isolates and offer evidence which proposes an emergence of a fifth panzootic initiated by highly related vNDV isolates from Indonesia, Israel and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus in avian influenza negative birds from live bird markets and backyard and commercial farms in Ivory-Coast|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528815300230|journal = Research in Veterinary Science|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 83–88|volume = 102|doi = 10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.07.015|pmid = 26412525|first = A.

J.|last8 = Webby|first9 = M. F.|last9 = Ducatez}}&lt;/ref&gt; These virus strains are related to older strains from wild birds. This suggests that unknown reservoirs harbor new vNDV isolates capable of additional panzootics.

No treatment for NDV exists, but the use of prophylactic vaccines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1. Newcastle disease vaccines: an overview|url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac802e/ac802e04.htm#TopOfPage|website = www.fao.org|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sanitary measures reduces the likelihood of outbreaks.

=== Chytrid Fungus in Amphibian Populations ===
Chytridiomycosis caused by a [[Chytridiomycota|chytrid fungus]] is a deadly fungal disease that has wiped out 30 amphibian species across the globe and has sent overall amphibian populations in decline. The fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium|Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' can be found on every continent with fertile soil and has contributed to the loss of some species of frogs and salamanders.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chytrid Fungus|url = http://www.savethefrogs.com/threats/chytrid/|website = www.savethefrogs.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|date = 2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is estimated that 287 species of amphibians are infected with this disease in over 35 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Kriger, Kerry M., and Jean-Marc Hero. "Chytridiomycosis, Amphibian Extinctions, and Lessons for the Prevention of Future Panzootics."''EcoHealth'' 6.1 (2009): 6-10. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; These countries tend to have varied or tropical climates like those found in Central America, South America, and Africa with optimal climate conditions ranging from 17 degree Celsius to 23 degrees Celsius for the fungus to thrive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The first reported instance of the chytrid fungus was in 1998 which was found on the skin of amphibians.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Since amphibians absorb essential nutrients through their skin, the fungus attaches itself to the amphibian, suffocates the amphibian, and enters the blood stream of the organism. Some symptoms that are prevalent in affected species include lethargy and loss of equilibrium and begin to die 21 days after infection.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Frogs that have died and are examined show high density of the fungal spores in keratinized areas of the body such as the pelvis, mouth, and underbelly.

The fungus is spread through the transportation of amphibious species by humans. Infected amphibians that have escaped or are released into the wild can carry the fungus and therefore invade the surrounding habitats of local species that are not immune to the disease. Species like the [[American bullfrog|American Bullfrog]] and [[African clawed frog|African Clawed Frog]] can carry this disease without experiencing symptoms or death; these kinds of species are usually to blame for the spread of the disease in undeveloped habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epidemic disease decimates amphibian abundance, species diversity, and evolutionary history in the highlands of central Panama|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/107/31/13777|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2010-08-03|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 2922291|pmid = 20643927|pages = 13777–13782|volume = 107|issue = 31|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0914115107|first = Andrew J.|last = Crawford|first2 = Karen R.|last2 = Lips|first3 = Eldredge|last3 = Bermingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some characteristics of amphibians that are more likely to be susceptible to the disease are the lack of various developed [[Microbiota (disambiguation)|microbiota]] that live and breed on the dermis of the species as well the underdeveloped immune system in specific amphibians.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Species that tend to breed in flowing water which washes away the microbiota from the skin of amphibians are more likely to become infected. Organizations across the world have tried to implement rules and regulations for the transportation of amphibians across borders to prevent the continued decline of amphibians however progress has been slow.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To add to the slow progress, the only cure that exists for chytrid fungus is found within laboratories for amphibians in captivity. Because of this, there is no known way for eradicating the disease in the wild.

'''ROFLCon''' was a biennial convention of [[internet meme]]s that took place in 2008, 2010 and 2012, featuring various [[internet celebrities]]. All three events were at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. ROFLCon was first organized by a group of students from [[Harvard University]] led by Tim Hwang.&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://roflcon.org/the-team/ "The Team @ ROFLCon"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501172232/http://roflcon.org/the-team/ |date=2008-05-01 }}. roflcon.org.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hwang, the inspiration for the conference was the September 23, 2007 meetup of fans of ''[[xkcd]]'' with its creator, [[Randall Munroe]], in a park in North Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab4_YWyYtj4&amp;NR=1 "How ROFLCon began"] (video). YouTube.com.&lt;!--authorized video--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "ROFLCon" comes from the [[internet slang]] "[[ROFL]]", short for "rolling on the floor laughing", and "con", short for "convention".

At ROFLCon 2012, it was announced that there would not be another ROFLCon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baio |first=Andy |url=http://waxy.org/2012/05/the_final_roflcon_and_mobiles_impact_on_internet_culture/ |title=The Final ROFLCon and Mobile's Impact on Internet Culture – |website=Waxy.org |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008==
The first ROFLCon was first announced in late 2007, and took place on April 25–26, 2008.&lt;ref name="Wired07"&gt;Wortham, Jenna (December 7, 2007). [https://www.wired.com/underwire/2007/12/famous-internet/ "Famous Internet Memes to Gather at ROFLCon 2008"]. Wired.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]] attended, such as the authors of the webcomics ''[[xkcd]]'', ''[[Questionable Content]]'' and ''[[Dinosaur comics]]'', Jay Maynard "The [[Tron Guy]]", [[Christopher Poole|Christopher "moot" Poole]], [[Leeroy Jenkins]], [[The Brothers Chaps]], and many others.&lt;ref name="NYT10"&gt;Walker, Rob (July 16, 2010).

''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://roflcon.org/guest-list-status/ "Confirmed Guests @ ROFLCon"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429171804/http://roflcon.org/guest-list-status/ |date=2008-04-29 }}. roflcon.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance was open to the public after pre-registration and a fee. The primary events of ROFLCon were moderated panel discussions with the Internet celebrities, and question and answer sessions with the audience. Several guest speakers gave talks on issues pertaining to [[internet culture]]. The convention ended with the "ROFLConcert", featuring live performances by [[Group X]], [[Leslie Hall]], [[Lemon Demon]], [[Trocadero (band)|Trocadero]] and [[Average Homeboy|Denny Blaze]].

==2010==

The second ROFLCon took place from April 30 to May 1 at MIT. Passes were available from $45 for a student to $500 for a "Mystery Pass."&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt;

==2012==
The third and final ROFLCon took place on May 4–5, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120105204115/http://roflcon.org/2011/12/05/roflcon-iii-may-4-5-2012/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Race and Economics''''' is a book by [[Thomas Sowell]], in which the author analyzes the relationship between [[Race in the United States|race]] and [[Wealth in the United States|wealth]] in the United States, specifically, that of [[black race|blacks]]. The book was initially published by [[David McKay Company]] in January 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Race-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/067930262X|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|title=Race and Economics, Paperback|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
He makes three basic arguments. First, he examines the economic impact of [[slavery]], in the United States, the [[West Indies]], and elsewhere. He distinguishes rural slavery from urban slavery, and circumstances in which blacks so predominated that many economic tasks fell to them of necessity, from circumstances in which blacks were punished for initiative and the development of skills.

Next, he compares the economic skills, circumstances, and successes of [[African American|American blacks]], other blacks, [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]], [[Chicano]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Scot]]s, and other [[ethnic group]]s. He notes statistical quirks; ''e.g.'', comparisons of per capita income need to be checked against the median age of the groups concerned. The median age of [[Russians]] in the U.S. at the time of the book's publishing (1975) was 47, of the Irish 36, of blacks 23, of Puerto Ricans, 18. Income tends to be higher in higher age cohorts; and unemployment tends to be higher in lower cohorts. If one matches age cohort to age cohort—those in their twenties, in their thirties, in their forties, etc., comparisons are considerably more just.

He also argues that the stark comparisons between "[[White race|whites]]" and "blacks" are misleading.

His third argument criticizes past governmental and economic policies, and opens up questions for the future. He has criticisms to make of [[Liberalism|liberals]], [[Extremism|radicals]], and [[conservatism|conservatives]], each of whom, he finds, protect their favorite illusions with respect to blacks.

''Race and Economics'' greatly influenced [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foskett|first=Ken|title=Judging Thomas: The Life and Times of Clarence Thomas|year=2004|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-052722-6|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfuE_obMwxkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measures of the '''old Romanian system''' varied greatly not only between the three [[Romania|Romanian states]] ([[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]], [[Transylvania]]), but sometimes also inside the same country. The origin of some of the measures are the Latin (such as [[Jugerum|''iug&amp;#259;r'']] unit), Slavic (such as ''vadră'' unit), Greek (such as ''dram'' unit) and Turkish (such as ''palmac'' unit) systems.

This system is no longer in wide use since the adoption of the metric system in 1864, however some rural communities still use a small subset of these units.

==Length==
* ''Palmă'' (palm) -  1/8 of a ''stânjen''
* ''Stânjen'' -  2 m (approximately)
* ''Palmac'' -  3.48&amp;nbsp;cm (Moldavia)
* ''Poştă'' -  8&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;km (depending on the country)
* ''Pas mic'' (small step) -  4 ''palme'' (Wallachia) (palme is the plural noun for palmă)
* ''Pas mare'' (large step) -  6 ''palme'' (Wallachia; Moldavia)
* ''Lat de palmă'' (palm width) -  1/2 ''palmă''
* ''Cot'' (cubit) -  664&amp;nbsp;mm (Moldavia); 637&amp;nbsp;mm (Wallachia)
* ''Funie'' (rope) -  20&amp;ndash;120 m (depending on the place)
* ''Leghe'' (league) -  4.444&amp;nbsp;km; 
* ''Deget'' (finger) -  the width of a finger
* ''Prăjină'' -  3 ''stânjeni'' (stânjeni is the plural noun for stânjen)
* ''Verstă'' -  1067 m (3,500&amp;nbsp;ft)
* ''Picior'' (foot) -  1/6 of a ''stânjen''

The '''Russian Bear''' is a widespread [[National symbol|symbol]] (generally of a [[Eurasian brown bear]]) for [[Russia]], used in cartoons,  articles and dramatic plays since as early as the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ammer, ''[https://books.google.fr/books?id=C7VaDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75&amp;dq=russian+bear+representation+16th+century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-0ZmSx8fSAhXFvRoKHZHtBF0Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20bear%20representation%2016th%20century&amp;f=false It's Raining Cats and Dogs and Other Beastly Expressions]'' (BookBaby, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and relating alike to the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the present-day [[Russian Federation]]. 
It often was and is used by [[Western world|Westerners]], originated in [[Great Britain|British]] caricatures and later also used in the [[United States]], and not always in a flattering context&amp;nbsp;– on occasion it was used to imply that Russia is "big, brutal and clumsy" (see 19th-century cartoon below).

==History==
The bear image was, however, on various occasions (especially in the 20th century) also taken up by Russians themselves. Having the bear cub "[[Misha]]" as the [[mascot]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Moscow]] [[Olympic Games]]&amp;nbsp;was evidently intended to counter the "big and brutal Russian Bear" image with a small, cuddly and smiling bear cub.

In Russia associations with the image of the bear have received relatively mixed reactions. On one hand, Russians themselves appreciate the bear for its raw power and cunning, and bears are very often used as mascots or as a part of a design on a logo. On the other hand, the overuse of the image of the bear by foreigners visiting Russia prior to 20th century led to the image of bear being a sort of insider joke, postulating that "Russian streets are full of bears" as an example of factually inaccurate information about Russia.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was some support in the [[Russian Parliament]] for having a bear as the new [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]&amp;nbsp;– with the proposers pointing out that "Russia is anyway identified in the world with the Bear"&amp;nbsp;– though eventually it was the Tsarist-era coat of arms of the [[Double-headed eagle]] that was restored.

Later, the bear was taken up as the symbol of the [[United Russia]] Party, which has dominated political life in Russia since the early 2000s. Coincidentally, the surname of [[Dmitry Medvedev]], the Russian president elected in 2008, is the possessive adjective of ''медведь'': i.e. his surname means "bear's".

In his successful 1984 re-election campaign, [[Ronald Reagan]] used the bear motif in the famous "[[Bear in the woods]]" ad, which claimed that he recognized the existence of a Soviet threat, and that his opponent denied its existence.

Russian amateur wrestler [[Aleksandr Karelin]] has also been nicknamed the "Russian Bear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/2009/03/25/250001/|title=Aleksandr Karelin, Wrestler, Law-maker and More|publisher=Voice of Russia|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''studio system''' (which was used during a period known as the '''Golden Age of Hollywood''') is a method of film production and distribution dominated by a small number of "major" studios in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. Although the term is still used today as a reference to the systems and output of the major studios, historically the term refers to the practice of large motion picture [[movie studio|studios]] between the 1920s and 1960s of (a) producing movies primarily on their own [[filmmaking]] lots with creative personnel under often long-term contract, and (b) dominating exhibition through [[vertical integration]], i.e., the ownership or effective control of [[film distributor|distributors]] and [[movie theaters|exhibition]], guaranteeing additional sales of films through manipulative booking techniques such as [[block booking]].

The studio system was challenged under the [[anti-trust]] laws in a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|1948 Supreme Court ruling]] which sought to separate production from the distribution and exhibition and ended such practices, thereby hastening the end of the studio system. By 1954, with television competing for audience and the last of the operational links between a major production studio and theater chain broken, the historic era of the studio system was over.

The period stretching from the introduction of [[sound film|sound]] to the beginning of the demise of the studio system, 1927–1948, is referred to by some film historians as the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Golden Age is a purely technical distinction and not to be confused with the style in film criticism known as [[Classical Hollywood cinema]], a style of American film which developed from 1917 to 1963 and characterizes it to this day.
During the so-called Golden Age, eight companies constituted the major studios that promulgated the Hollywood studio system. Of these eight, five were fully integrated conglomerates, combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: [[Fox Film Corporation]] (later [[20th Century Fox]]), [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew’s Incorporated]] (owner of America's largest theater circuit and parent company to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[Paramount Pictures]], [[RKO Radio Pictures]], and [[Warner Bros.]] Two majors—[[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]—were similarly organized, though they never owned more than small theater circuits. The eighth of the Golden Age majors, [[United Artists]], owned a few theaters and had access to two production facilities owned by members of its controlling partnership group, but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films.

== Sound and the Big Five ==
The years 1927 and 1928 are generally seen as the beginning of Hollywood's Golden Age and the final major steps in establishing studio system control of the American film business. The success of 1927's ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'', the first feature-length "talkie" (in fact, the majority of its scenes did not have [[Sound film#The "Talkies"|live-recorded sound]]) gave a big boost to the then midsized Warner Bros. studio. The following year saw both the general introduction of sound throughout the industry and two more smashes for Warners: ''[[The Singing Fool]]'', ''The Jazz Singer'''s even more profitable follow-up, and Hollywood's first "all-talking" feature, ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]''. Just as significant were a number of offscreen developments. Warner Bros., now flush with income, acquired the extensive Stanley theater chain in September 1928. One month later, it purchased a controlling interest in the [[First National Pictures|First National]] production company, more prominent than Warners itself not long before. With the First National acquisition came not only a {{convert|135|acre|km2|adj=on}} studio and backlot but another large string of movie theaters. Warners had hit the big time.

The last of the "Big Five" Hollywood conglomerates of the Golden Age emerged in 1928: [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. The Radio Corporation of America ([[RCA]]), led by [[David Sarnoff]], was looking for ways to exploit the cinema sound patents, newly trademarked [[RCA Photophone]], owned by its parent company, [[General Electric]]. As the leading film production companies were all preparing to sign exclusive agreements with [[Western Electric]] for their technology, RCA got into the movie business itself. In January, General Electric acquired a sizable interest in [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO), a distributor and small production company owned by [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], father of future president [[John F. Kennedy]]. In October, through a set of [[stock]] transfers, RCA gained control of both FBO and the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] theater chain; merging them into a single venture, it created the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation, Sarnoff chairing the board. With RKO and Warner Bros. (soon to become Warner Bros.–First National) joining Fox, Paramount, and Loew's/MGM as major players, the [[Big Five (movie studios)|Big Five]] that would remain for thirty years were now in place.

Although RKO was an exception, the heads of studios on the west coast, the 'movie moguls', had mostly been in place for some years: [[Louis B. Mayer]] at MGM, [[Jack L. Warner]] at Warner Bros., [[Adolph Zukor]] at Paramount, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] (at 20th Century Fox from 1935), [[Carl Laemmle]] at Universal, and [[Harry Cohn]] at Columbia.

== Reign of the majors and the first decline ==
The ranking of the Big Five in terms of profitability (closely related to market share) was largely consistent during the Golden Age: MGM was number one eleven years running, 1931–41. Paramount, the most profitable studio of the early sound era (1928–30), faded for the better part of the subsequent decade, and Fox was number two for most of MGM's reign. Paramount began a steady climb in 1940, finally edging past MGM two years later; from then until its reorganization in 1949 it was again the most financially successful of the Big Five. With the exception of 1932—when all the companies but MGM lost money, and RKO lost somewhat less than its competitors—RKO was next to last or (usually) last every year of the Golden Age, with Warner generally hanging alongside at the back of the pack. Of the smaller majors, the Little Three, United Artists reliably held up the rear, with Columbia strongest in the 1930s and Universal ahead for most of the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Financial anlaysis based on Finler (1988), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood's success grew during the [[Great Depression]], possibly because films helped audiences escape their personal difficulties. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] said of [[Shirley Temple]], "When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time during this Depression, it is a splendid thing that for just fifteen cents an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/11/shirley-temple-iconic-child-star-dies-at-85.html "Shirley Temple, iconic child star, dies at 85"], Associated Press (February 11, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939 there were 15,000 movie theaters in the United States, more than banks; the number of theaters per capita was twice that of the mid-1980s. The cinema industry was larger than that for office machines. While only the 14th largest by revenue, it was second in the percentage of profits that its executives received. Top stars such as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Claudette Colbert]] were paid more than $400,000 a year (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400000|1939|r=0}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name="friedrich1997"&gt;{{cite book | title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s | publisher=University of California Press | author=Friedrich, Otto | year=1997|edition=reprint | location=Berkeley and Los Angeles | pages=13–14 | isbn=0-520-20949-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The end of the system and the death of RKO ==

One of the techniques used to support the studio system was [[block booking]], a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit. Such a unit—five films was the standard practice for most of the 1940s—typically included only one particularly outstanding film, the rest a mix of A-budget pictures of lesser quality and B movies.&lt;ref&gt;See Schatz (1999), pp. 19–21, 45, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Life'' magazine wrote in 1957 in a retrospective on the studio system, "It wasn't good entertainment and it wasn't art, and most of the movies produced had a uniform mediocrity, but they were also uniformly profitable ... The million-dollar mediocrity was the very backbone of Hollywood."&lt;ref name="hodgins19570610"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=Amid Ruins of an Empire a New Hollywood Arises | work=Life | date=1957-06-10 | accessdate=April 22, 2012 | author=Hodgins, Eric | pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 1948, in a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|federal antitrust suit known as the ''Paramount'' case]] brought against the entire Big Five, the U.S. Supreme Court specifically outlawed block booking. Holding that the conglomerates were indeed in violation of antitrust, the justices refrained from making a final decision as to how that fault should be remedied, but the case was sent back to the lower court from which it had come with language that suggested divorcement—the complete separation of exhibition interests from producer-distributor operations—was the answer. The Big Five, though, seemed united in their determination to fight on and drag out legal proceedings for years as they had already proven adept at—after all, the ''Paramount'' suit had originally been filed on July 20, 1938.

However, behind the scenes at RKO, long the financially shakiest of the conglomerates, the court ruling came to be looked at as a development that could be used to the studio's advantage. The same month that the decision was handed down, multimillionaire [[Howard Hughes]] acquired a controlling interest in the company. As RKO controlled the fewest theaters of any of the Big Five, Hughes decided that starting a divorcement domino effect could actually help put his studio on a more equal footing with his competitors. Hughes signaled his willingness to the federal government to enter into a [[consent decree]] obliging the breakup of his movie business. Under the agreement, Hughes would split his studio into two entities, RKO Pictures Corporation and RKO Theatres Corporation, and commit to selling off his stake in one or the other by a certain date. Hughes's decision to concede to divorcement terminally undermined the argument by lawyers for the rest of the Big Five that such breakups were unfeasible.

While many today point to the May court ruling, it is actually Hughes's agreement with the federal government - signed November 8, 1948 - that was truly the death knell for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Paramount soon capitulated, entering into a similar consent decree the following February. The studio, which had fought against divorcement for so long, became the first of the majors to break up, ahead of schedule, finalizing divestiture on December 31, 1949. By this time, there were 19,000 movie theaters in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[Harris, Warren G.  ''Lucy and Desi.''  New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991. p.149]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Hughes's deal with the federal authorities, and those by the other studios that soon followed, the studio system lingered on for another half-decade. The major studio that adapted to the new circumstances with the most immediate success was the smallest, United Artists; under a new management team that took over in 1951, overhead was cut by terminating its lease arrangement with the Pickford-Fairbanks production facility and new relationships with independent producers, now often involving direct investment, were forged—a business model that Hollywood would increasingly emulate in coming years. The studio system around which the industry had been organized for three decades finally expired in 1954, when Loew's, the last holdout, severed all operational ties with MGM.

Hughes's gambit helped break the studio system, but it did little for RKO. His disruptive leadership—coupled with the draining away of audiences to [[television]] that was affecting the entire industry—took a toll on the studio that was evident to Hollywood observers. When Hughes sought to bail out  of his RKO interest in 1952, he had to turn to a Chicago-based syndicate led by shady dealers without motion picture experience. The deal fell through, so Hughes was back in charge when the RKO theater chain was finally sold off as mandated in 1953. That year, [[General Tire]] and Rubber Company, which was expanding its small, decade-old broadcasting division, approached Hughes concerning the availability of RKO's film library for programming. Hughes acquired near-complete ownership of RKO Pictures in December 1954 and consummated a sale with General Tire for the entire studio the following summer.

The new owners quickly made some of their money back by selling the TV rights for the library they treasured to &lt;!-- [[C&amp;C]] redirects to [[Command &amp; Conquer (series)]]--&gt;C&amp;C Television Corp., a beverage company subsidiary. (RKO retained the rights for the few TV stations General Tire had brought along.) Under the deal, the films were stripped of their RKO identity before being sent by C&amp;C to local stations; the famous opening logo, with its globe and radio tower, was removed, as were the studio's other trademarks.

Back in Hollywood, RKO's new owners were encountering little success in the moviemaking business and by 1957 General Tire shut down production and sold the main RKO facilities to [[Desilu]], the production company of [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]]. Just like United Artists, the studio now no longer had a studio; unlike UA, it barely owned its old movies and saw no profit in the making of new ones. In 1959 it abandoned the movie business entirely.

== In Europe and Asia ==
While the studio system is largely identified as an American phenomenon, film production companies in other countries did at times achieve and maintain full integration in a manner similar to Hollywood's Big Five. As historian James Chapman describes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Britain, only two companies ever achieved full vertical integration (the [[Rank Organisation|Rank Organization]] and the [[Associated British Picture Corporation]]). Other countries where some level of vertical integration occurred were Germany during the 1920s (Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft, or [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]]), France during the 1930s ([[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]]-Franco-Film-Aubert and [[Pathé]]-Natan) and Japan ([[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]] and [[Toho]]). In Hong Kong, [[Shaw Brothers]] adopted the studio system for its [[wuxia]] films throughout the 1950s-'60s. India, which represents perhaps the only serious rival to the U.S. film industry due to its dominance of both its own and the Asian diasporic markets, has, in contrast, never achieved any degree of vertical integration.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2003), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For instance, in 1929 nearly 75 percent of Japanese movie theaters were connected with either Nikkatsu or Shochiku, the two biggest studios at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Freiberg (2000), "The Film Industry."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Star-driven system ===
In the 1950s Hollywood faced three great challenges: The ''Paramount'' case ending the studio system, the new popularity of television, and post-World War II consumer spending providing its audience with many other leisure options. The scale of both box office successes and flops grew, with a "dangerous middle" consisting of films that in the previous era would have made money. A filmmaker stated in 1957 that "[t]he one absolute disaster today is to make a million-dollar mediocrity. One of those you can lose not only your total investment but your total shirt." By that year Hollywood was only making about 300 feature films a year, compared to about 700 during the 1920s.{{r|hodgins19570610}} [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], head of 20th Century Fox,  had no direct involvement with the studio from 1956 to 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Martin [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/business/media/richard-zanuck-producer-of-blockbusters-dies-at-77.html?_r=0 "Richard Zanuck, Producer of Blockbusters, Dies at 77"], ''New York Times'', 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Louis B. Mayer]], sacked in 1951 from MGM, died in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Verswijver (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pNQylJinyQsC&amp;pg=PA60 ''Movies Were Always Magical: Interviews With 19 Actors, Directors, and Producers from the Hollywood of the 1930s Through the 1950s''], Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2003, p.60, n.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Cohn]] of Columbia, who died the following year,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard F. Dick [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Pka5hrnGQcC&amp;pg=PA2 ''Columbia Pictures: Portrait of a Studio''], University of Kentucky Press, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; informed investors in the studio's [[annual report]] of 1957 that:
{{quote|We find ourselves in a highly competitive market for [stars, directors, producers, writers]. Under today's tax structures, salary to those we are dealing with is less inviting than the opportunity for capital gains. We find ourselves, therefore, dealing with corporations rather than with individuals. We find ourselves, too, forced to deal in terms of a percentage of the film's profits, rather than in a guaranteed salary as in the past. This is most notable among the top stars.{{r|hodgins19570610}}}}
Financial backers increasingly demanded star actors, directors, and writers for projects to reduce risk of failure. The growing importance of the overseas market—40 to 50% of Hollywood's total revenue by 1957—also emphasized stars' names as box-office attractions. With their new power, "working for nothing"—receiving a percentage of profit instead of a salary—became a status symbol for stars. A top actor could expect 50% of profit, with a minimum guarantee, or 10% of gross revenue. [[Cary Grant]], for example, received more than $700,000 from his 10% of the gross for ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), while director and producer [[Alfred Hitchcock]] received less than $50,000. In one extreme case, Paramount promised [[Marlon Brando]] 75% of the profit of what became ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961). (Because of [[Hollywood accounting]], studios still received much of the revenue before any profit sharing; thus, they preferred 50% of profit to 10% of gross.) The larger paychecks also increased the power of [[talent agent]]s such as [[Lew Wasserman]] of MCA, whose office was now nicknamed "[[Fort Knox]]".{{r|hodgins19570610}}

By 1957, independent producers made 50% of full-length American films. Beyond working for others, top actors such as [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] created their own production companies and purchased scripts. Top independent directors [[George Stevens]], [[Billy Wilder]], and [[William Wyler]] also saw their paychecks increase, in part because their involvement attracted star actors. Studios increasingly provided funding and facilities to independent producers as opposed to making their own films, or just like United Artists, they focused on distribution. While television had damaged Hollywood, TV production companies such as Desilu and the film studios' own TV divisions helped save the industry by using otherwise-unused facilities.{{r|hodgins19570610}}

=== Syndication, television, recession, and conglomerate Hollywood ===
At the beginning of the 1960s the major studios began to reissue older films for syndication and transformed into mainly producing telefilms and [[b-movies]] to supply TV's demand for programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald, Wasko|first=Paul, Janet|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3387-6|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1969 and 1971 the industry underwent a severe recession, due in part to  big-budget flops, but soon recovered artistically with such films as ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974).

The onset of [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) became the prototype for the modern [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald, Wasko|first=Paul, Janet|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3387-6|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of films at hundreds of venues became the norm with hits such as the sequels to Lucas's ''Star Wars'', ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Spielberg's back-to-back successes with ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', and the development of home-video and cable television. Meanwhile, the uncontrolled budget of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), and its limited box-office revenue, led to the sale of United Artists.

From 1990 to 1995, New Hollywood turned into more of a conglomerate Hollywood and quickly dominating the global entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald, Wasko|first=Paul, Janet|title=The Contemporary Holywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3387-6|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2007, five of the Golden Age majors continue to exist as major Hollywood studio entities, each as part of a larger media conglomerate: Columbia (owned by [[Sony]]), 20th Century Fox (owned by [[Disney]]), Warner Bros. (owned by [[AT&amp;T]]), Paramount (owned by [[Viacom]]), and Universal (owned by [[Comcast]]). In addition, the [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] has emerged as a major, resulting in a "Big Six". With the exception of Disney, all of these so-called major studios are essentially based on the model not of the classic Big Five, but of the old United Artists: that is, they are primarily backer-distributors (and physical studio leasers) rather than actual production companies.

Sony, in addition to ownership of Columbia, also has effective control of the relatively small latter-day incarnation of MGM and its subsidiary UA; under the Sony umbrella, MGM/UA operates as a "mini-major," nominally independent of but closely associated with Columbia. In 1996, Time Warner acquired the once-independent [[New Line Cinema]] via its purchase of [[Turner Broadcasting System]]. In 2008, New Line was merged into Warner Bros., where it continues to exist as a subsidiary. Each of today's Big Six controls quasi-independent "[[arthouse]]" divisions, such as [[Paramount Vantage]]. [[Miramax Films]] (which originally was an independent studio) was owned by Disney until 2010. Most also have divisions that focus on genre movies, [[B movies]] either literally by virtue of their low budgets, or spiritually—for instance, Sony's [[Screen Gems]]. One so-called indie division, Universal's [[Focus Features]], releases arthouse films under that primary brand. Both Focus and Fox's arthouse division, [[Fox Searchlight]], are large enough to qualify as mini-majors. Two large independent firms also qualify as mini-majors, [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] and [[The Weinstein Company]]. They stand somewhere between latter-day versions of the old "major-minor" - just like Columbia and Universal was in the 1930s and 1940s, except Lionsgate and The W.C. have about half their market share—and leading Golden Age independent production outfits such as [[Samuel Goldwyn]] Inc. and the companies of [[David O. Selznick]].

=== Independent era and the beginning of the second decline===

In the mid-2010s, major studios shifted towards producing mainstream films that appeal to the audience (genre films, sequels, [[3-D film|3-D]], and superhero films).  As these films risk losing money at the box-office (and some, in fact, have), an opportunity opened up for [[independent film|independent companies]] to produce films that in recent years have upset other major studio films for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].  The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (which produces the annual [[Academy Awards]]) generally award Best Picture Oscars to films of substance and high quality rather than the popular mainstream film.  Between 2014's ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'' and 2017's ''[[The Shape of Water (film)|The Shape of Water]]'' (both produced by the same major studio, [[20th Century Fox]]), the multiple award wins for independent films such as ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' ([[Open Road Films|Open Road]], 2015) and ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'' ([[A24 (company)|A24]], 2016) had a major impact on box-office intake of other major studio films, and possibly the fate of major studios themselves, and even so today with the latest wave of independent films.  This continuing dominance of the independent film is proof that its success is not dependent on any film format, whether it be 3-D, CinemaScope, or any large-format such as [[IMAX]].  The recent outcomes of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the lack of American films winning these awards may also have affected the dominance of independent film.

{{nihongo|'''''Soukyugurentai'''''|蒼穹紅蓮隊|Sōkyū Gurentai|lead=yes}},{{efn|The title roughly translates to "Blue Sky Hooligans" or "Blue Sky Crimson Squad". The word ''Gurentai'' on the title, which is normally spelled 愚連隊, has the first two characters replaced with 紅蓮, which mean "red lotus" or crimson".}} also known as '''''Terra Diver''''', is a [[Scrolling shooters|vertical-scrolling shooting game]] by [[8ing/Raizing|Raizing]] originally released as an [[arcade game]] for the [[List of Sega arcade system boards#Sega ST-V|ST-V platform]] in 1996.  The game was ported to the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1997, with neither port being released outside of Japan.

==Gameplay==
''Soukyugurentai'' is a vertical-scrolling shooter.  The player picks one of three different ships - red, green or blue - each with their own pilot, fire pattern and laser web. Each ship has a standard gun and a bomb, but the most distinctive of these aspects is the laser-web: holding down the button for the standard gun will release a lock-on laser-web traditionally shaped as a cone or semicircle, which will destroy the enemies it locks onto after releasing the buttons. Each ship has two different lock-on weapons that function as web-designed laser targets. Once an enemy enters the web's range, the player can destroy the enemy or multiple enemies can be destroyed via homing lasers or multiple fire-balls. The game is unusual in that, rather than using a 3:4 aspect ratio to better suit the vertically-oriented gameplay, it uses a horizontal monitor (4:3) in the style of [[Neo Geo]] vertical shooters as well as the later ''[[Radiant Silvergun]]'' and ''[[Giga Wing]]''.

==Plot==
After exhausting the Earth’s resources, particularly [[fossil fuel]], innumerable trade companies team up with [[NASA]] and begin initiating space programs dedicated to finding resources outside the planet Earth. Mining facilities are established in different areas outside of Earth, particularly on large asteroids near the Moon and most especially on Mars. Various resources are found from these areas and distributed to Earth which aid in the world economy. The largest company that is established from this is the Jin-Sei (Exhausting Star) Corporation set in Japan which is worth 1 trillion in New Yen investments, founded by the Miama family.

However, after years of space resource distribution, the separate companies started initiating attacks that would dominate other company’s resources. The strongest of these attacks started on Martian colonies established by the second largest company on Earth, Eight Luck Interstellar Development Inc., which banded with smaller companies across Earth including ones in China, England, and America. Eight Luck planned on claiming Mars for its own so as to monopolize on the outsourcing of minerals as well as developing terraformed areas.

In response to these attacks, the Jin-Sei formed a union with the JDF (a future version of the [[JSDF]]) and began working on a space fighter program organized by Defensive Section 2 of the JDF known as the Soukyugurentai (SOQ for short), which utilized a unique laser technology fighting system known as NALS (Non-blind spot All range Laser System) in combat. The threat of eco-terrorism was on the rise as out-spoken ecosystem protectionism groups opposed the company's outsourcing of materials; these were used as subsequent cover-up stories to hide the company war waging between Jin-Sei and Eight Luck from public awareness. Made up of the best fighters adapted to this combat system as well as innumerable stamina strengthening tests for space travel, the SOQ are sent in to defend company territory from rival companies on Earth and space at all costs.

==Releases==
''Soukyugurentai'' was first distributed for the arcades in [[Japan]] in September 1996. The game was released as a cartridge kit for [[Sega]]'s [[List of Sega arcade system boards#Sega ST-V|ST-V arcade system board]]. While the game was never widely distributed outside [[Japan]], inserting the cartridge on a foreign ST-V board will set the in-game language to English and change the title to ''Terra Diver'' (both titles are printed on the cartridge's label).

A [[Sega Saturn]] version was released by [[Electronic Arts]] on February 1997, five months after the arcade release. Because the original arcade hardware was directly based on the Sega Saturn architecture, this is a close conversion of the original game. Several options and features were also added, including a practice mode which allows the player to try out any of the game's stages without going through the entire campaign, as well as support for the Multi Controller and Mission Stick. A bargain-priced version was released on December 1997, titled {{nihongo4|''Soukyugurentai Okuyo''|蒼穹紅蓮隊　御徳用|Sōkyū Gurentai Okuyō}}, which includes a demo for the Saturn version of ''[[Battle Garegga]]''.

A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was also released by [[Data East]] on December 1997 titled {{nihongo4|''Soukyugurentai: Oubushutsugeki''|蒼穹紅蓮隊　黄武出撃|Sōkyū Gurentai: Ōbu Shutsugeki}}. This version features a Special Mode which adds a fourth playable ship and a new final stage, as well as animated opening and ending videos and a voiced navigator. It supports the analog controls of the [[DualShock]] controller. The PlayStation was reissued on May 2003 by Hamster as part of their MajorWave budget label.

''Soukyugurentai'' was ported to Japanese feature phones in 2005 and was available for [[au (mobile phone company)|EZWeb]], [[i-mode]] and [[Yahoo! Japan|Yahoo! Keitai]] devices.

==Reception==
''Sōkyū Gurentai'' was one of Raizing's most popular arcade games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zverloff |first=Nick |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/raizing/raizing.htm |title=Raizing / Eighting |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=2010-11-26 |accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consoles +'' rated the Sega Saturn version at 92%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Consoles%20Plus/consoleplus_numero075/Consoles%2B_N75-Page%200147.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic image of Terra Diver magazine review |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Macross characters}}
In 1999 a city-sized alien spacecraft crashes in South Ataria Island on Earth. Over the course of 10 years the military organization ''[[U.N. Spacy]]'' reverse-engineers its technology and rebuilds the spacecraft, naming it the [[SDF-1 Macross]]. In 2009 at the launch ceremony of the Macross, a young civilian pilot, [[Hikaru Ichijyo]], comes to visit the ''Macross'' upon U.N. Spacy pilot [[Roy Focker]]'s request. During the launch ceremony, a space war fleet from an alien race of [[humanoid]] giants arrives into the solar system and identifies the Macross as a former battleship used by their enemies, the Supervision Army. As the aliens, known as the [[Zentradi#In Macross|Zentradi]], approach the Macross, the original systems override the crew's commands and fire its main cannon, wiping out the advance alien scouts and starting a war. While Hikaru takes the new [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] on a test flight the aliens retaliate. He then encounters [[Lynn Minmay]] and rescues her from the aliens. The ''Macross'' crew attempts to use the experimental "[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|Fold System]]" ([[Faster-than-light]] drives) to escape to the Moon's orbit, but instead it accidentally takes the ''Macross'' and South Ataria Island to the edge of the solar system. The people from the ''Macross'' salvage everything they can, including the city surrounding the ship and its civilians (who have survived in special safety shelters, which were transported along intact), and attach two aircraft carriers to the ship. Since the fold systems have vanished after the jump, the ''Macross'' is forced to make its way back to Earth by conventional power.

The Zentradi suspect the humans might be their creators, the Protoculture. Under the command of [[Britai Kridanik]] and [[Exsedol Folmo]], they plot ways to understand them. Fearful of their old combat directives of not interfering with Protoculture, the Zentradi perform attacks to test their theories about the people on board the ''Macross'', and even have their Zentradi soldiers "micloned" (miniaturized) to learn more about their culture. The Zentradi capture several Macross personnel including Officer [[Misa Hayase]] and Hikaru to study. [[Boddole Zer]], Supreme Commander of the Zentradi, is puzzled over things such as relationships amongst males and females. He confirms that the Miclones "are" protoculture during a demonstrated kiss between Hayase and Hikaru. After escaping, Hikaru and the others report their findings to their superiors, who have trouble accepting the reasons behind the Zentradi attacks as well as the huge forces the aliens possess.

After much difficulty returning to Earth, the UN Spacy refuses to allow the ''Macross'' and the civilian passengers to return to land. Minmay's cousin, Lynn Kaifun, decides to join the ''Macross'' to see his parents and also look after Minmay. Because of Kaifun's relationship and constant contact with Minmay, the pair eventually enter a romantic relationship. After deliberation, the UN Spacy orders the Macross to leave Earth as a means to get the Zentradi away from them. During all these events, a female Zentradi ace fighter pilot, [[Milia Fallyna]], is micloned and attempts to assassinate [[Maximilian Jenius]], an ace UN Spacy pilot. Attempting to kill him during a knife duel, Milia is defeated and falls in love with Max, and the two are subsequently married. Their wedding aboard the ''Macross'' is broadcast to the Zentradi as a message that aliens and humans can co-exist. Since the Zentradi's exposure to culture and to Lynn Minmay's songs, some of them become eager to join the humans. Believing the "miclone contamination" is becoming a threat to all Zentradi forces, Boddole Zer orders his entire army to exterminate the human race and all those Zentradi previously exposed to human culture. Because [[Britai Kridanik]] was "contaminated" as well, he works with the humans to defeat the main Zentradi forces.

The resulting battle culminates in the large scale devastation of Earth, but the people of the SDF-1 survive. After Boddole Zer is killed and his armada defeated, the surviving humans and their Zentradi allies begin rebuilding Earth.

Two years after the end of the first Space War the transition into the Human ways becomes difficult to some Zentradi who can't stand the idea of a pacified life. [[Quamzin Kravshera]] constantly incites conflicts towards the civilians. He repairs a damaged Zentradi warship to return to his old ways and attacks the new Macross City built around the SDF-1. Moments before the final Zentradi attack, Misa Hayase tells Hikaru Ichijyo of her feelings for him and her decision to leave to space in a colonization mission to preserve human culture across the galaxy. Lynn Minmay, who was left by Kaifun and now loves Hikaru, doesn't want him to leave to join the fight. However, Hikaru still goes to defend the city anyway. Eventually Quamzin is killed. After a long emotional conflict Hikaru finally decides to be with Misa and join the colonization mission, but the two remain good friends with Minmay in the end.

* Note: Back when "Macross" was first put in production, the anime was originally going to end with a total of 23 episodes, but due to popularity, it was expanded to end with a total of 36 episodes.

==Sequels and prequel==
A number of sequels and one prequel to the series have been produced.

''For more information, see: [[Macross#Series chronology|Macross – Series Chronology]]''

==Production==
The series title uses the name of the main spacecraft (which is usually shortened to ''[[SDF-1 Macross]]'' as it is Earth's first ''Super Dimension Fortress''). The original name for the ''Macross'' project was ''Battle City Megaload'' (or ''Battle City Megaroad'', as the Japanese transliteration to either {{angbr|l}} or {{angbr|r}} gives the title a double meaning in reference to the story line: ''Megaload'', referring to the spacecraft containing an entire city of people; and ''Megaroad'', referring to the long journey through space back to Earth).&lt;ref name="Production"&gt;{{cite web | title=Translation &amp; Cultural Notes | url=http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#1 | work=Super Dimension Fortress Macross Liner Notes | publisher=[[AnimEigo]] | date=21 December 2001 | accessdate=26 April 2009 | quote=Comments attributed to Kawamori Shoji in the Macross liner notes are drawn from Nanda, Mamoru (1983) Best Hit Series: Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Macross Graffiti, Akita Shoten, Tokyo. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813121403/http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#1 | archivedate=13 August 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the director of [[Big West Advertising|Big West]], one of the later sponsors of the project, was a fan of Shakespeare and wanted the series and the spacecraft to be named ''[[Macbeth]]'' ({{nihongo||マクベス|Makubesu}}). A compromise was made with the title ''Macross'' ({{nihongo||マクロス|Makurosu}}) due to its similar pronunciation to ''Macbeth'' in Japanese and because it still contained connotations to the original title.&lt;ref name="Production"/&gt; The word ''Macross'' also comes from a wordplay combination of the prefix "macro" in reference to its massive size (though when compared with the alien ships in the series, it is only a relatively small capital ship) and the distance they must cross.&lt;ref name="Macross perfect memory pg 246"&gt;Super Dimension Fortress Macross: The Making of Macross. Pages 203–246. ''Macross Perfect Memory''. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, 10 October.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Super Dimension Fortress" prefix ("Chō Jikū Yōsai") is a wordplay on an intermediary working title for the series, which was originally "Super Dreadnought Fortress Macross" ("Chō Dokyū Yōsai Makurosu").&lt;ref name="Production"/&gt;

Originally proposed in 1980 and greatly inspired by [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] (1979-1980),&lt;ref name="Gundamfans"&gt;{{cite web | title=Translation &amp; Cultural Notes | url=http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#1 | work=The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Liner Notes | publisher=[[AnimEigo]] | date=2001-12-21 | accessdate=2014-09-18 | quote=According to the liner notes of the AnimEigo DVD release of the Macross TV series ''Gunsight One'' was also the fanzine title of the ''Gundam'' fan club that creator Shoji Kawamori, character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto, and writer Hiroshi Oonogi (members number 1, 2, and 3 of said club) founded while they were students at Keio University in Japan... | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813121403/http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#1 | archivedate=13 August 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the show created by [[Studio Nue]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.macross.co.jp/ Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Series Outline. ''Macross Official Website''. Series Section. 04-09-09]&lt;/ref&gt; (from an original concept by newcomer member [[Shoji Kawamori]])&lt;ref name="Macross perfect memory pg 246"/&gt; was initially sponsored by a group called the "Wiz" (''Uizu'') Corporation that was prepared to fund a 48-episode run. "Wiz" wanted to produce the Sci-Fi show as an [[outer space]] comedy, but this clashed with Studio Nue's original idea of a more serious and epic "[[space opera]]" storyline. The resulting animosity between both companies made the initial pre-production of the series very difficult and full of delays.&lt;ref name="Macross perfect memory pg 246"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macross perfect memory pg247"&gt;Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Production Notes. Page 247. ''Macross Perfect Memory''. Reference Book. 260 A4 pages. Minori Library, Japan. Y2800. 1983, 10 October.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1981 Wiz had gone out of business and the "Megaload/Megaroad" (''Macross'') project seemed to be in permanent hiatus. Studio Nue bought the rights of the show from "Wiz" and searched for a sponsor with no avail. [[Big West Advertising|Big West]], an advertising agency looking to branch out into animation sponsorship, approached Studio Nue about the project and agreed to sponsor it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Big West insisted on a leaner budget, not convinced that the show would pan out as profitable and pared the episode count to 27 episodes (meaning the show would have ended with the battle against [[Boddole Zer]]'s fleet).&lt;ref name="Macross perfect memory pg 246"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macross perfect memory pg247"/&gt; Even then, Big West found that the show was going to run more expensive than it had bargained for, and to secure more money, entered into a partnership with animation studio [[Tatsunoko Production]]&lt;ref name="macross perfect memory pg247"/&gt; which included international distribution (what would culminate in the creation of the "[[Robotech]]" adaptation a few years later).&lt;ref name="ADV"/&gt;

Among other production headaches, the master copy of one nearly-completed episode was reportedly accidentally left on a train by a courier, forcing the members of the production staff themselves to search for the footage – otherwise they would have to re-animate it all, at a considerable cost in time and money. Eventually they found the reel, and so disaster was averted.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

When Macross debuted on 3 October 1982 (with only three episodes made so far) its stunning success among Japanese television audiences convinced Big West to approve an extension to 36 episodes, allowing the staff to end with the "two years after" story arc.&lt;ref name="macross perfect memory pg247"/&gt;

[[Studio Nue]] was unable to carry all of the animation work itself at the time (although the success of Macross meant that it was able to do so with nearly all of its other animation projects), and so work was contracted out to a number of satellite studios, including [[Artland (anime studio)|Artland]] ([[Haruhiko Mikimoto]]'s employer), the nascent [[Anime International Company|AIC]] and [[Gainax]] studios, as well as the [[Tatsunoko Production|Tatsunoko]]-supplied [[AnimeFriend]] and [[Star Pro]].&lt;ref name="macross perfect memory pg 248-253"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; AnimeFriend and Star Pro are infamously notorious among fans of the show for having brought in very spotty, off-model and continuity error-laden animation work.

There were plans for a splashy ending to the series, one that would have shown major characters Misa Hayase and Hikaru Ichijo blasting off in the colonization ship ''[[SDF-2 Megaroad-01]]'', but the sequence was scrapped due to lack of time and budget. However, due to fan demand this sequence was later used in the ''[[Macross Flashback 2012]]'' OVA released in 1987.&lt;ref name="Flashback"&gt;{{cite web | title=Translation &amp; Cultural Notes | url=http://www.animeigo.com/Liner/MACROSS.t#1 | work=The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Liner Notes | publisher=[[AnimEigo]] | date=21 December 2001 | accessdate=26 April 2009 | quote=Originally, the creators wanted to end the series with the launch of the SDF-2 and the newly-wed Ichijo Misa in her new captain's uniform. Mechanical designer Miyatake Kazutaka and character designer Mikimoto Haruhiko even drew new designs appropriate for the occasion. Unfortunately, the sequence was never animated. The creators finally got the chance to redesign and animate the SDF-2 Megaroad launch (along with the Minmay Sayonara Concert that was planned but canceled for the ''Do You Remember Love?'' movie ending) four years later.

''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' was produced as the first of the three ''Super Dimension'' mecha anime television series in Japan. It was followed by ''[[The Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' (1984). These shows were related in name only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised and expanded edition |last1=Clements |first1=Johnathan |last2=McCarthy |first2=Helen |pages=468–469 |isbn=1-933330-10-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised and expanded edition |last1=Clements |first1=Johnathan |last2=McCarthy |first2=Helen |pages=598–599 |isbn=1-933330-10-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross episodes}}
In 1984, [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] licensed the first ''Macross'' series from Tatsunoko and planned to dub the series on home video. In 1985, Harmony Gold edited and rewrote the series with ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' into ''[[Robotech]]'', to syndicate on weekday television and to promote a [[Revell]] model line. ''Robotech'''s credits listed only the English adaptation's production crew and two Tatsunoko producers. In 1999, Harmony Gold asserted it had exclusive rights to the "distribution of the Macross television series and the right to create and authorize the sale of merchandise based on such series" outside Japan, and began sending cease-and-desist letters to import toy dealers, temporarily barring ''Macross''-related merchandise from North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harmony Gold bars Macross Imports|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=16 April 2002|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-04-16/harmony-gold-bars-macross-imports |accessdate=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merchandise has since been imported again by the same toy dealers in direct sales, and Harmony Gold has sublicensed additional material for North American retail distribution.

In 2000, Big West and Studio Nue took [[Tatsunoko Production]]s to the [[Tokyo District Court]] over who had the rights to the first ''Macross'' series, due to Harmony Gold's attempt to bar Japanese Macross merchandise in North America the previous year. During production, Big West entered into a partnership with Tatsunoko to assist in the production of the series in a deal where it acquired the license to distribute the show worldwide (i.e., outside Japan), as well as earning some royalties to the merchandise. Tatsunoko then sub-licensed ''Macross'' to [[Harmony Gold USA]] in 1984. In 2002, the Tokyo District Court ruled that Big West/Studio Nue is the sole owner of the original character and mecha designs for the first series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Macross Lawsuit|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=26 February 2002|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-02-26/macross-lawsuit|accessdate=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
while that same court ruled in 2003 that Tatsunoko owned the production rights to the first series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tatsunoko Wins "Author's Right" to Macross|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2003-10-14|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-01-20/tatsunoko-wins-author's-right-to-macross |accessdate=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tatsunoko Wins Macross Lawsuit|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=23 February 2004|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2004-02-23/tatsunoko-wins-macross-lawsuit |accessdate=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1984, Harmony Gold released the first English-language version of ''Macross'': an English-dubbed VHS video release containing unedited video footage of the first three episodes with a new English theme song, adapted dialogue scripts, and several name changes (which were later used in ''Robotech'', aside from Rick Yamada/Hikaru Ichijyo, who became Rick Hunter). This release was canceled after one volume when production of the ''Robotech'' adaptation began. The first episode of this 1984 English dubbing was later released as an extra in the ''Robotech Legacy Collection 5'' and ''Robotech Protoculture Collection'' DVD releases, and is also included in the first volume of [[ADV Films]]' 2006 release of ''Macross''.

[[Streamline Pictures]] then released ''Robotech Perfect Collection: Macross'' on VHS in the summer of 1994, combining two English subtitled episodes of ''Macross'' and the corresponding dubbed episodes of the ''Robotech'' adaptation in each volume. This was the first English subtitling for ''Macross'', but it contained unedited video footage with incomplete and mistranslated English subtitles and was cancelled after eight volumes and 16 episodes.

The series was originally licensed in North America by [[AnimEigo]], who restored the series and released it unedited on DVD with Japanese audio and English subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animeigo.com/Products/MACROSS.t |title=SuperRestored Television Series Macross |publisher=[[AnimEigo]] |accessdate=26 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227055636/http://www.animeigo.com/Products/MACROSS.t |archivedate=27 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first a limited edition pre-order boxset across nine discs was released on 21 December 2001.

===Manga===
A new [[manga]] adaptation of the first TV series called {{nihongo|'''''Super Dimension Fortress Macross: The First'''''|Choujikuu要塞マクロスファースト|Choujikuu Yousai Macross the First}} was released in Japan during 2009. It is a comic format alternate telling of the events in ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' (with modern character and mecha designs) that was being serialized in the ''Macross Ace'' manga magazine until its cancellation, being moved to "Newtype Ace" manga magazine, where it's being currently serialized. The artist for the new manga series is Haruhiko Mikimoto, who was the character designer for the original ''Macross''.&lt;ref name="macross the first 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-11-21/designer-haruhiko-mikimoto-to-draw-new-macross-manga|title=Designer Haruhiko Mikimoto to Draw New Macross Manga (Updated)|date=21 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2009|work=|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="macross the first 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-28/new-macross-manga-launches-in-japan-macross-ace-mag|title=New Macross Manga Launches in Japan's Macross Ace Mag|date=28 June 2009|accessdate=12 November 2009|work=|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
A game based on the TV series called ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (Family Computer)|The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' was released for the Japanese [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Family Computer]] console in 1985 by video game company [[Namco]].

Years later [[Namco Bandai Games|Bandai]] released ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (PlayStation 2 game)|The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' 3D shooting game in October 2003 in Japan for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] console. This game had levels based in both the TV series and its [[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?|movie adaptation]].

More recently, a new 3D [[shooting game]] called ''[[Macross Ace Frontier]]'' included several elements from the original series. It was developed by [[Artdink]] for the Sony [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and was released in 2008.

==Reception==
In the ''Anime Encyclopedia'', authors [[Jonathan Clements]] and [[Helen McCarthy]] called the series "One of the three unassailable pillars of anime sci-fi, pioneering the tripartite winning formula of songs, battling robot-planes and tense relationships".&lt;ref name="Anime Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised and expanded edition |last1=Clements |first1=Johnathan |last2=McCarthy |first2=Helen |pages=385–386 |isbn=1-933330-10-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the video game ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' motion and voice actor Reuben Langdon was told to make cockier than his younger persona albeit more mature. Despite the staff's concerns for the difficulties of such portrayal, Langdon had no issues after choosing [[Roy Focker]] from ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' as his character model and noting he had almost the same age as Dante during production of the game.&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|author=Langdon, Reuben |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ySzx_fmjk|title=DMC4 Nero  |publisher=Youtube|date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[stealth game|stealth]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Toronto]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. The sixth installment of the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' series, it is the sequel of ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction|Splinter Cell: Conviction]]''. The game was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii U]], and [[Xbox 360]] in August 2013. In the game, players control [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]], a spymaster working for the Fourth Echelon, in a mission to stop the Engineers, a group of terrorists which is trying to coerce the United States into recalling all of its troops stationed abroad. ''Blacklist''{{'s}} gameplay is similar to its predecessors, with players tasked with completing objectives and defeating enemies. ''Blacklist'' marks the return of the asymmetrical multiplayer mode Spies vs. Mercs, which was introduced in ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow|Pandora Tomorrow]]''.

It is the first title developed by Ubisoft Toronto, a studio founded by Ubisoft in 2009. The game was directed by Maxime Béland, who had worked on ''Conviction'', and produced by [[Jade Raymond]]. The game endeavors to combine elements of its predecessors, including the action focus of ''Conviction'' and the stealth focus of the older games. To prepare for this game, Béland studied reviews and feature lists of the latter. ''Blacklist'' is the first ''Splinter Cell'' game starring [[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]] as Sam Fisher, since series veteran [[Michael Ironside]] was unable to perform motion capture for the game. The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and its later-announced Wii U version was developed by [[Ubisoft Shanghai]], which also developed the game's multiplayer.

''Blacklist''{{'s}} pre-release reception was generally positive, despite criticism of its new voice actor. The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, gameplay, combat, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. However, criticism was directed at its dated graphics, lack of challenge and ending. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.

==Gameplay==

In ''Blacklist'', players assume control of series protagonist  [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]] as he seeks to stop a terrorist group called the Engineers. The gameplay emphasizes [[stealth video game|stealth]], and utilizes the [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. During the game, players can rotate its camera, run, crouch and leap over obstacles. Since ''Blacklist'' intended to continue the "aggressive stealth" of ''Conviction'' while retaining the traditional stealth features of the older games, it combines action and stealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/splinter-cell-blacklist-trailer-reveals-fishers-abilities-mostly-sneaking-and-shooting/|title=Splinter Cell: Blacklist trailer reveals Fisher's abilities - mostly sneaking and shooting|first=Phil|last=Savage|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows players to use different approaches and methods to complete objectives and defeat enemies. Players can complete levels without being noticed by the non-playable characters' [[artificial intelligence]] by taking cover or using other traditional stealth methods. If the player chooses to kill enemies, other enemies are alerted when they see their companions' dead bodies. To avoid this, players can hide corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/04/e3-2012-splinter-cell-blacklist-fearing-sam-fisher|title=E3 2012: Splinter Cell Blacklist - Fearing Sam Fisher|first=Richard|last=George|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 4, 2012|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher can also create a strategically advantageous dark environment by destroying nearby lights,&lt;ref name="GG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s3834879.htm|title=Good Game Stories: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist|work=[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]|date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is equipped with customizable night-vision and sonar goggles to detect enemies in darkness and see through walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-14-heres-how-splinter-cell-blacklists-night-vision-mode-looks|title=Here's how Splinter Cell: Blacklist's night-vision mode looks|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=March 14, 2015|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/splinter_cell_blacklist/b/xbox360/archive/2013/06/19/playing-splinter-cell-blacklist-with-friends-and-enemies.aspx|title=Playing Splinter Cell: Blacklist With Friends And Enemies|first=Kyle|last=Hilliard|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has the Tri-Rotor, a compact surveillance drone which can spy on enemies, create distractions, give electric shocks, and self-destruct to kill enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/splinter-cell-blacklist-video-shows-the-different-play-styles-ghost-assault-and-er-panther/|title=Splinter Cell Blacklist video shows the different play-styles: Ghost, Assault and, er, Panther|first=Tom|last=Sykes|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Paladin'' is the game's hub.

Although the game has interrogation sequences involving questioning (or torturing) targets, it does not feature ''Conviction''{{'s}} interactive torture scenes. Players can still decide whether to spare their targets or kill them after interrogation,&lt;ref name="KTorture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5980350/splinter-cell-blacklist-wont-have-interactive-torture-but-itll-still-have-interrogations|title=Splinter Cell Blacklist Won't Have Interactive Torture But It'll Still Have Interrogation|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these decisions influence the relationship between Fisher and other crew members.&lt;ref name="Poly1"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Characters===
''Blacklist'' again features Sam Fisher ([[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]]), a former Third Echelon Splinter Cell who is now the [[spymaster]] and commander of the newly installed Fourth Echelon. The game also sees the return of Fisher's old ally, Anna "Grim" Grímsdóttir ([[Kate Drummond]]), and new characters such as Isaac Briggs (Dwain Murphy) and Charlie Cole ([[David Reale]]). Several supporting characters from ''Conviction'' reappear, including Victor Coste (Howard Siegel), Patricia Caldwell ([[Mimi Kuzyk]]), and Andriy Kobin ([[Elias Toufexis]]), as well as interactive telephone conversations with Sarah Fisher ([[Victoria Sanchez (actress)|Victoria Sanchez]]).

==Plot==
Following ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction]]'', Third Echelon is dissolved and Sam Fisher works as a contractor for the private military corporation Paladin 9 Security, ran by his best friend Victor Coste. Terrorists assault the [[Andersen Air Force Base]] on [[Guam]], executing its commander and killing many American soldiers. Sam and Coste were caught in the crossfire and Coste is heavily injured. Soon afterwards, a faction known as the Engineers takes responsibility, announcing a series of attacks on the United States, the titular Blacklist, which will continue until the U.S. recalls [[United States military deployments|its troops deployed abroad]].

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Caldwell assigns Sam and his colleagues, tech expert Charlie Cole, CIA operative Isaac Briggs, and technical analyst Anna Grímsdóttir to Fourth Echelon, a new top secret special-ops and counter-terrorism unit. Charged with stopping the Engineers, the group uses the cargo plane ''Paladin'' as its command center. Fourth Echelon first aims to secure Andriy Kobin, an arms dealer (and Sam's past target) believed to possess information on the Engineers. Sam captures him at a militia headquarters in [[Benghazi]], and learns that he sold arms to the Engineers before the Guam attack. Tracking down Kobin's buyers, Sam infiltrates an Engineer camp at [[Iraq]]. He finds an executed U.S. soldier and learns from a video recording that the executioner and the leader of the Engineers is Majid Sadiq ([[Carlo Rota]]); a former [[MI6]] agent. The Engineers launch a strike on the site with a hacked military drone, and Sam narrowly escapes.

Believing that the next Blacklist attack is at [[Chicago]], Sam infiltrates the site of the attack and prevents the release of a biological toxin into the water supply. Grim identifies Fourth Echelon's next target, Iran-affiliated mercenary broker Reza Nouri (Sam Kalilieh) who may have supplied the Engineers. Sam infiltrates Nouri's mansion in [[Paraguay]], and extracts him as Iranian [[Quds Force|Qods Force]] commandos launch a simultaneous assault to kill Nouri. Nouri gives up intel on the Engineers in exchange for safety, leading to the discovery of an Engineer [[Clandestine cell system|sleeper cell]] in [[London]]. Sam infiltrates an abandoned mill where the cell is operating and finds files suggesting that Iran is behind the Engineers, as well as [[chemical weapon]]s and that Sadiq is on site. Sam is exposed to the chemical weapon when planting a tracker on a bomb, but continues to pursue Sadiq, leading to his incapacitation and capture by Sadiq. Briggs rescues Sam, but Sadiq escapes.

Due to the files recovered by Sam being made public by the President, the United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Sam infiltrates Qods Force headquarters in [[Tehran]] and steals files from their servers. The files prove that Iran did not back the Engineers, and that the files he recovered at London were planted by the Engineers in order to lure the United States into a war. The President announces the new information and deescalates the US-Iranian tension.

The chemical weapon tracker leads to the [[Philadelphia]] city train yard, in time for the next Blacklist attack. Sam and Briggs deploy to the site and disarms all bombs. With multiple Blacklist attacks foiled, the Engineers increase the rate of the Blacklist attacks from once per week to once per day.

During this time, Nouri had given himself up to the CIA at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camps]], and is providing false intel convincing the CIA of Iran's culpability, trying to reignite tensions. Briggs uses his CIA credentials to help Sam infiltrate Guantanamo Bay, allowing him to interrogate Nouri. Nouri says he is planted by Sadiq to distract the US government while Sadiq hijacks a fuel tanker, and that Sadiq is fully aware of Fourth Echelon. Sam and Briggs escape from Guantanamo Bay and reach the ''Paladin'' at [[Yucatán]]. There, they fend off an attack from a drug cartel, tipped off by a bounty on Fourth Echelon from Sadiq.

As Fourth Echelon heads to defend the next Blacklist attack, Sadiq disables ''Paladin'' with a computer virus, intending to crash it. With Kobin's help, ''Paladin'' is restarted, but Sadiq successfully executes his attack during this time; he rams the fuel tanker into the [[Sabine Pass]] [[LNG]] terminal, and uses the same virus to disable all fuel facilities in the Gulf Coast, aiming to burn up all fuel in the area. Sam enters the burning facility and reactivates the fire control systems, stopping the fire's spread. Sam captures an Engineer leader and learns about Sadiq's final target: the government bunker "Site F" under the [[Denver International Airport]].

The successful attack prompted the president to begin [[Continuity of government|continuity-of-government]] procedures, transferring key government personnel into secure bunkers. Sadiq had sleeper agents in Site F and took officials in Site F hostage, including the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. As COG procedures activate, all government files are backed up at Site F, which are Sadiq's true goal. Disregarding the president's order, Fourth Echelon infiltrates Site F. Sadiq tortures the secretary of defense to authorize the file transfer, while Briggs turns himself in to Sadiq. When the secretary yields, Briggs intervenes and kills the secretary, halting Sadiq's plan.

Sadiq tries to flee Site F by stealing the ''Paladin'', using Briggs and the hostages as human shields. Sam, disguised as a hostage, helps [[Delta Force]] snipers to take down Sadiq's men. Sadiq tries to escape on foot, and Sam incapacitates him after a fight. Sadiq boasts that he has already won; if he dies, twelve nations supporting the Engineers will declare war on the U.S., and if he is tried, he will leak U.S. secrets. Although Sam spares Sadiq, he [[Extrajudicial detention|detains him]]. President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq's imprisonment by announcing his death, and the game ends as Fourth Echelon continues its operations; in a [[post-credits scene]], a recovered Coste and Sam prepare to interrogate Sadiq.

===Co-op missions===
Intertwined with the main plot, the co-op missions begin with Fisher and Briggs infiltrating [[Kashmir, India|Kashmir]]. Finding a group of smugglers linked to the Engineers, Fisher and Briggs discover intelligence connecting them to the Russian intelligence organization Voron, before they escape during a drone attack.

Following a lead to a friendly missile base in [[Bangalore]], they find the Indian inhabitants dead and Voron agents stealing the warhead from a missile. Securing the missile and learning that the agents are led by a man named Cherski, Fisher and Briggs escape as the building is destroyed and Indian authorities arrive. Unaware of Cherski's identity, Fisher and Briggs track him to a Voron base in [[Chittagong]] and find him living in a nearby apartment. They breach Cherski's panic room and find two people; uncertain which one is Cherski, they begin interrogating both and learn about a secret base in Russia.

Fisher and Briggs reach an abandoned [[naukograd]], surviving a drone attack, and find a secure medical facility said to contain an OpSat (satellite uplink device used by Fourth Echelon operatives) with vital Voron information. Instead, the base contains a comatose man. Rescuing the man, Fisher and Briggs narrowly escape as the base self-destructs and return the patient to the ''Paladin''. Grim identifies him as Mikhail "Kestrel" Loskov and Kobin confirms his identity, noting that they have a history (detailed in ''Conviction''). When he questions Kobin (who asks if Kestrel's gunshot wound has put him into a coma), Fisher notes that no one had told Kobin how Kestrel had been incapacitated.

In 2010, the series' fifth installment, ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction|Conviction]]'', was released. Although it received generally positive reviews, it was criticized by series fans for lacking some features. Béland considered ''Conviction'' a "stepping stone" for him when he prepared for the development of ''Blacklist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/09/12/splinter-cell-blacklist-builds-on-convictions-story-successes-and-failures/|title=Splinter Cell: Blacklist builds on Conviction’s story, successes and failures|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development team studied ''Conviction''{{'s}} reviews and feature lists, deciding to discard its "black-and-white" stealth approach, and also deciding to bring back the Spies vs. Mercs mode introduced in ''Pandora Tomorrow''. Béland called the mode's return "the easiest decision of [his] life", since the team considered its absence ''Conviction''{{'s}} greatest misstep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/11/splinter-cell-blacklist-aims-to-take-convictions-promise-to-th/|title=Splinter Cell: Blacklist aims to take Conviction's promise to the next level and then some|first=Mike|last=Schramm|date=September 11, 2012|accessdate=August 3, 2015|work=[[Joystiq]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft sent questionnaires through [[Uplay]] to thousands of players to collect feedback on ''Conviction''{{'s}} new features.&lt;ref name="EuroGComplex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-23-raymond-splinter-cell-popularity-held-back-by-its-complexity|title=Raymond: Splinter Cell popularity held back by its complexity|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players called ''Conviction''{{'s}} campaign weak and short, the team added a stronger storyline and greater character depth by introducing the Fourth Echelon and Fisher as a leader (a series first).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/30/how-ubisofts-designers-transformed-sam-fisher-into-a-panther-and-a-leader-in-splinter-cell-blacklist-interview/|title=How Ubisoft’s designers transformed Sam Fisher into a ‘panther’ and a leader in Splinter Cell: Blacklist (interview)|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage repeat play the team introduced the aircraft hub and the strategic mission interface, a player menu.&lt;ref name="GIStory"/&gt;

According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, the series had become too grueling and complicated for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as ''[[Assassin's Creed (series)|Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Far Cry (series)|Far Cry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/splinter-cells-popularity-is-held-back-by-its-complexity-says-blacklist-studio-head/|title=Splinter Cell's popularity is held back by its complexity, says Blacklist studio head|first=Phil|last=Savage|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans.&lt;ref name="EuroGComplex"/&gt; It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/30/splinter-cell-blacklist-modernizes-chaos-theory|title=Splinter Cell: Blacklist Modernizes Chaos Theory|first=Mitch|last=Dyer|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-sam-fisher-favors-shadows-over-gunplay/|title=Splinter Cell: Blacklist: Fisher favors shadows over gunplay|first=Catherine|last=Cai|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cells-complexity-hurting-its-popularity-says-raymond/1100-6407384/|title=Splinter Cell's complexity hurting its popularity, says Raymond|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.&lt;ref name="GIStory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/07/17/directing-splinter-cell-an-interview-with-maxime-beland.aspx?PostPageIndex=2|title=Directing Splinter Cell: An Interview With Maxime Beland|first=Matt|last=Miller|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=July 17, 2012|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''Blacklist''{{'s}} development, its team faced a variety of challenges. The first was to create stealth which was satisfying and fun for players. According to the team, players gain satisfaction from stealth with freedom and choices which allow them to develop a plan. Players must experiment, with each decision having consequences. Game director Patrick Redding compared it to the development of an ecosystem; the team designed a dynamic [[artificial intelligence]] which would react differently to players' actions, making levels feel alive and adding randomness. Encouraging the "panther" style of play (aggressive stealth), the team incorporated elements from the original ''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell'' (where one mistake would abort a mission) and ''Conviction'' (where stealth seamlessly becomes combat). This approach, the team thought, could help players to feel like elite, silent predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-blacklist-and-the-challenges-of-stealth/1100-6406874/|title=Splinter Cell: Blacklist and the Challenges of Stealth|first=Maxwell|last=McGee|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 12, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series veteran [[Michael Ironside]] did not reprise his role as the voice of Sam Fisher. His part was played by [[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]], who also performed the motion capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/6/5/3066844/splinter-cell-blacklist-has-a-new-voice-for-sam-fisher-heres-what|title='Splinter Cell: Blacklist' has a new voice for Sam Fisher; here's what happened to Michael Ironside|first=Russ|last=Frushtick |date=June 5, 2012|accessdate=August 3, 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Blacklist'' developer diary, Ironside said that he was passing the torch to another actor. According to Ubisoft executives the change was made to take advantage of new performance-capture technology to enrich the game experience, and Ironside assisted Johnson with the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/05/e3-2012-why-michael-ironside-wont-return-for-splinter-cell-blacklist|title=E3 2012: Why Michael Ironside Won't Return For Splinter Cell: Blacklist|first=Mitch|last=Dyer|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 4, 2012|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elias Toufexis]], voice and performance-capture actor for Andriy Kobin in ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction|Splinter Cell: Conviction]]'', said that he would return for the new game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Than Meets The Ears|url=http://blog.ubi.com/elias-toufexis-role-playing-column-june-2013/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609032608/http://blog.ubi.com/elias-toufexis-role-playing-column-june-2013/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 9, 2013|work=UbiBlog|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ''Conviction'', the game would have no interactive torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and it was hoped that players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices.&lt;ref name="KTorture"/&gt; However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-30-splinter-cell-blacklists-torture-scene-is-cut|title=Splinter Cell Blacklist's torture scene is cut|first=Martin|last=Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|title=Torture scene removed from Splinter Cell: Blacklist, no one 'loved' it|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/01/30/torture-scene-removed-from-splinter-cell-blacklist-no-one-lov/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist'' received positive reviews. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] rated the PlayStation 3 version 84 out of 100,&lt;ref name=MCPS3 /&gt; the Xbox 360 version  82 out of 100,&lt;ref name=MCX360 /&gt; the PC version 82 out of 100,&lt;ref name=MCPC /&gt; and the Wii U version 75 out of 100.&lt;ref name="MCWIIU" /&gt;

The game's design was praised by most reviewers. Ryan McCaffrey of [[IGN]] praised the gameplay's variety and player options, which he thought made ''Blacklist'' the best installment in the series since ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory]]''. According to McCaffrey, the game was a satisfying stealth experience and an excellent, capable shooter (increasing its [[replay value]]). He noted that several segments forced players to use the Mark and Execute feature, frustrating players who favored stealth over action.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Ben Reeves of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the return and refinement of Mark and Execute, which he found satisfying, and praised the game's intense, varied mission design.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Tom Bramwell of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' disliked the game's direction, particularly its action elements (which he compared to 2012's ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'').&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt;

''Blacklist''{{'s}} campaign was also generally praised. According to IGN's McCaffrey, the game's story is superior to those of its predecessors: well-balanced and believable. He criticized Sam Fisher's new voice actor, who he thought failed to replicate Ironside's charm. Ben Reeves praised the story's plot twists and sympathetic characters.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; On the [[Joystiq]] blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending.&lt;ref name="JoystiqReview"/&gt; Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt;

Its multiplayer features were praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative multiplayer mode had enough content for a separate game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Reeves partially agreed, describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing, intense, and bloody.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; De Matos wrote that it was one of the best multiplayer modes he had ever experienced, and the ''Blacklist'' version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative.&lt;ref name="JoystiqReview"/&gt; Daniel Bloodworth of [[GameTrailers]] praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

''Blacklist''{{'s}} graphics and lack of difficulty were criticized (the former likely due to the game still using [[Unreal Engine 2.5]] that Splinter Cell games since ''Chaos Theory'' have used). McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and [[frame rate]] issues.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt; McCaffrey noted that even when the game is played in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought ''Blacklist'' gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

===Sales===
Ubisoft hoped that ''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist'' would sell at least five million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/blacklist-the-test-for-ubisoft-toronto-game-developers-1.1388627|title=Blacklist the test for Ubisoft Toronto game developers|work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game debuted at number two on the UK retail software sales chart in its first week of release, behind ''[[Saints Row IV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/08/27/saint-row-iv-beats-splinter-cell-blacklist-for-uk-number-one-3939051/|title=Saint Row IV beats Splinter Cell: Blacklist for UK number one|date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2015|work=[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was August's fourth-bestselling game in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/09/13/npd-august-2013-3ds-tops-hardware-again-madden-25-clear-software-winner/|title=NPD August 2013: 3DS tops hardware again, Madden 25 clear software winner|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16, 2013 Ubisoft announced that ''Blacklist'' had failed to meet sales expectations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-16-ubisoft-splinter-cell-rayman-legends-missed-sales-targets|title=Ubisoft: Splinter Cell, Rayman Legends missed sales targets|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=16 October 2013|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 13 it was announced that the game had sold two million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="SCB-Sales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-blacklist-underperforms-with-2-million-sold/1100-6416144/|title=Splinter Cell: Blacklist underperforms with 2 million sold|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=12 November 2013|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tom Ford was born on August 27, 1961, in [[Austin, Texas]], the son of [[realtor]]s Shirley Burton (née Shirley Ann Thrasher) and Thomas David Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Tom. "Ford: Santa Fe Is Home".

''[[Albuquerque Journal]]'' (October 24, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16, he enrolled at [[Bard College at Simon's Rock]], but quickly dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bey |first=Sureme Laster |date=April 15, 2014 |title=Finding Fortune: Tom Ford |url=http://www.out.com/out-exclusives/power-50/2014/04/15/finding-fortune-tom-ford |work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]] |accessdate=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] to study art history at [[New York University]] (NYU).&lt;ref name=styleicon&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11446121.html "Style icon has ties to Santa Fe"]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

"Ford Is Bigger, Louder Than Ever". ''[[New York Daily News]]'' (April 13, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' (November 5, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Before his last year at New School, Ford spent a year and a half in Paris, where he worked as an intern in [[Chloé]]'s press office, inspiring his interest in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharkey |first=Alix |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/how-the-man-in-black-conquered-the-world-728220.html |title=How the man in black conquered the world |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=January 20, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901211350/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-the-man-in-black-conquered-the-world-728220.html |archivedate=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gucci&gt;"Gucci uses its loafer".

"Cynicism key to fashion today, Ford says". ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (March 14, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion career==
===Early career===
When interviewing for jobs after graduation, Ford said that he had attended [[The New School]]'s Parsons division, but concealed that he graduated in architecture,&lt;ref name=gale /&gt; and that his work at Chloé was a low-level public relations position. Despite his lack of experience in fashion, Ford called American designer Cathy Hardwick every day for a month in hopes of securing a job at her sportswear company. Hardwick eventually agreed to interview him. She later recalled the incident: "I had every intention of giving him no hope. I asked him who his favorite European designers were. He said, '[[Armani]] and [[Chanel]].' Months later I asked him why he said that, and he said, 'Because you were wearing something Armani'. Is it any wonder he got the job?" Ford worked as a design assistant for Hardwick for two years.&lt;ref name=gale /&gt;

In 1988, Ford moved to [[Perry Ellis (brand)|Perry Ellis]],&lt;ref name=gale /&gt; where he knew both Robert McDonald, the company's president, and [[Marc Jacobs]], its designer, socially. He worked at the company for two years, but grew tired of working in American fashion.{{Citation needed |date=April 2016}} In a later interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', he commented, "If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America. My own culture was inhibiting me. Too much style in America is tacky. It's looked down upon to be too stylish. Europeans, however, appreciate style."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fashionone.com/news/2014/09/29/touch-innuendo-tom-ford-springsummer-2015/ |title=A Touch of Innuendo at Tom Ford Spring/Summer 2015 |date=September 29, 2014 |website=[[Fashion One]] |access-date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Ashley Joy |date=August 27, 2013 |title=This Week In Fashion History: The Rise And Rise Of Tom Ford's Empire |url=http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/595/20130827/week-fashion-history-rise-tom-fords-empire.htm |website=Fashion Times |publisher=[[IBT Media]] |access-date=April 18, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426014328/http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/595/20130827/week-fashion-history-rise-tom-fords-empire.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Italian fashion house [[Gucci]] was struggling financially and was seeking to strengthen its women's ready-to-wear presence as a part of a brand overhaul. The company's creative director, [[Dawn Mello]] said, "no one would dream of wearing Gucci". In 1990, Mello hired Ford as the brand's chief women's ready-to-wear designer and Ford moved to Milan.&lt;ref name=gale /&gt; "I was talking to a lot of people, and most didn't want the job," Mello said. "For an American designer to move to Italy to join a company that was far from being a brand would have been pretty risky." Ford and his longtime partner, fashion journalist Richard Buckley, relocated to Milan that September.&lt;ref name=gale /&gt;

Ford's role at Gucci rapidly expanded; he was designing menswear within six months, and shoes soon after that. When Richard Lambertson left as design director in 1992, Ford took over his position,&lt;ref name=gale /&gt; heading the brand's ready-to-wear, fragrances, image, advertising, and store design. In 1993, when he was in charge of designing eleven product lines, Ford worked eighteen-hour days. During these years, there were creative tensions between Ford and Maurizio Gucci, the company's chairman and 50% owner. According to Mello, "Maurizio always wanted everything to be round and brown, and Tom wanted to make it square and black." Though Maurizio Gucci wanted to fire Ford, [[Domenico De Sole]] insisted that he remain.&lt;ref name=gale /&gt; Nonetheless, Ford's work during the early 1990s was primarily behind the scenes; his contributions to Gucci were overshadowed by those of Mello, who was the company's public face.

In 1994, Ford was promoted to Creative Director of [[Gucci]].

Ford has been criticized for using naked women in various ad campaigns. Various journalists asserted that the ads were vulgar, sexist, or objectified women.

'''Twins''' appear in the mythologies of many cultures around the world. In some they are seen as ominous and in others they are seen as auspicious. Twins in mythology are often cast as two halves of the same whole, sharing a bond deeper than that of ordinary siblings, or otherwise shown as fierce rivals. Twins can represents some "other" aspect of the Self, a [[doppelgänger]] or a [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]]. The twin may be a brother soul-mate, such as the "civilized" [[Gilgamesh]] and the "wild" [[Enkidu]]. Or, sometimes one twin is the "[[evil twin]]" while the other side represents "good".

Many cultures have mythic or folkloric explanations for how twins are conceived. In Greek mythology, some twins were conceived when a woman slept with both a mortal and a god on the same day. One of her offspring thereafter had godlike qualities, and the other was an ordinary mortal, such as [[Heracles]] and his twin brother [[Iphicles]]. In several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures women avoided eating twin fruits like double almonds and bananas because it was thought to increase the likelihood of twins{{dubious|Avoiding twin foods|reason=old world foods|date=November 2017}}. In other cultures, twins were attributed to superior virility of the father.

Twins can represent the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature of the universe. In Greek mythology, [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]] are twins, and Apollo was adopted as the sun god with Artemis as the moon goddess. In Hinduism, the Ashwini Twins or [[Ashvins]] are the Healers who are also offered sacrificial offerings or oblations as per the Rig Veda. Also, [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] and [[Yami]], elder siblings of the Ashvins, are a brother-sister twin pair. In [[Xingu peoples|Xingu]] mythology of Brazil, the twin brothers Kuat and Iae forced the evil king Urubutsin to give light to the world, and Kuat became the sun with Iae as the moon. In one version of the Egyptian creation myth, the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut were twins. In [[Zoroastrian]] mythology, the twins [[Ahriman]] and [[Ahura Mazda]] represent the spirits of evil and good respectively. Cultures with rival twin heroes often follow this pattern of split moral forces. In a myth of several northeastern Native American tribes, Gluskap, the creator god and cultural hero, has to defeat Malsum, his evil twin, who was the ruler of the demons.

Twins can also be shown as having special powers and deep bonds. In Greek mythology, [[Castor and Pollux]] share a bond so strong that when Castor dies, Pollux gives up half of his immortality to be with his brother. This etiologically explains why their constellation, the Dioskouroi or Gemini, is only seen during one half of the year, as the twins split their time between the underworld and Mount Olympus. In an aboriginal tale, the same constellation represents the twin lizards who created the plants and animals and saved women from evil spirits. To the Dogon of Mali in West Africa, twinship represents completeness and perfection, symbolized by the deity [[Nummo]]. Nummo is actually a set of twins, male and female, and because the creation of the world required a sacrifice, humans can only be one half of the whole, male or female. In many Native American stories, twins are often partners on adventures such as quests.

'''Veche''' ({{lang-ru|вече}}, {{lang-pl|wiec}}, {{lang-uk|віче}}, {{lang-be|веча}}, {{lang-cu|[[wikt:вѣштє#Old Church Slavonic|вѣштє]]}}) was a [[popular assembly]] in [[medieval]] [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] countries.&lt;ref name="veche (medieval Russian assembly) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia"/&gt;

In [[Novgorod]], where the veche acquired great prominence, the veche was broadly similar to the [[Thing (assembly)#Viking and medieval society|Norse thing]] or the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Landsgemeinde]].&lt;ref name="centret2000"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is inherited from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavonic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''větje '', meaning 'council', 'counsel' or 'talk' (which is also represented in the word "[[soviet (council)|soviet]]", both ultimately deriving from Proto-Slavic verbal stem of *větiti 'to talk, speak'){{ref|etymology}}.  There exists misinformation claiming a relation to "-vice" in "advice", and somewhat more distantly to Sanskrit "Veda", Germanic words like "wise" (English), "weten" (Dutch, "to know"), "witch" (Slavonic: ''věšt-ica'') and many others, which however come from a different Indo-European root.  Likewise, there exists misinformation claiming that the [[semantic]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] that yields the meaning of the word under consideration is parallel to that of ''[[wikt:congregation|congregation]]''. The contemporary words ''svedeniya'' ({{lang-ru|сведения}}) and ''svidchennya'' ({{lang-uk|свідчення}}) both meaning "information" are cognates of this word.

== Rus ==
The  East Slavic veche is thought to have originated in tribal assemblies of [[Eastern Europe]], thus predating the [[Kievan Rus|Rus' state]].&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia"/&gt;
The earliest mentions of  ''veche'' in East European chronicles refer to examples in [[Belgorod Kievsky]] in 997, [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod the Great]] in 1016 and in [[Kiev]] in 1068. The assemblies discussed matters of war and peace, adopted laws, and called for and expelled rulers. In Kiev, the veche was summoned in front of the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Cathedral of St Sophia]].

In Ukraine, the town ''viche'' was simply a gathering of community members to inform everybody of important events (''vich-na-vich'' - eye-to-eye) and come up with a collective planning for the near future.

=== Novgorod Republic ===
{{Main|Novgorod veche}} 
[[Image:veche bell.gif|thumb|Removal of the veche bell from Novgorod to Moscow in 1478.]]
The veche was the highest [[legislative|legislature]] and [[judiciary|judicial authority]] in the [[Novgorod Republic|Republic of Novgorod]] until 1478, after the conquest of Novgorod by Grand Prince [[Ivan III]].

The traditional scholarship goes on to argue that a series of reforms in 1410 transformed the veche into something similar to the public assembly of [[Venice]]; it became the [[Commons]] or lower chamber of the parliament. An upper [[Senate]]-like [[Sovet gospod|Council of Lords]] (''sovet gospod'') was also created, with title membership for all former city magistrates (''[[posadnik]]s'' and ''[[tysyatsky]]s''). Some sources indicate that veche membership may have become full-time, and parliament deputies were now called ''vechniks''. Some of the more recent scholars call this interpretation into question.

The Novgorod assembly could be presumably summoned by anyone who rang the veche [[bell (instrument)|bell]], although it is more likely that the common procedure was more complex.  The whole population of the city - boyars, merchants, and common citizens - then gathered at [[Yaroslav's Court]] or in front of the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Cathedral of Holy Wisdom]] (the latter called a ''Vladychnoe veche'' - "An Archbishop's Veche," since it was called in front of the cathedral). The veche bell was a symbol of republican sovereignty and independence and for this reason, Ivan III carted it off to [[Moscow]] when he took control of the city, to show that the old way of doing things was at an end.

Separate assemblies could be held in the [[kontsy|boroughs or "Ends"]] of Novgorod.

Of all other towns of Novgorod Land, the chronicles only mention a veche in [[Torzhok]], however possibly they existed in all other towns as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ru:Русская республика (Севернорусские народоправства во времена удельно-вечевого уклада.

=== Pskov republic ===
In the [[Pskov Republic]] the veche continued until 1510, when that city was taken over by Grand Prince [[Vasily III of Russia|Vasilii III]] (1505–1533). In Pskov the veche assembled in the court of the [[Trinity Cathedral in Pskov|Trinity cathedral]].

==Poland==
[[Image:Wiec Kazimierz Wielki.jpg|thumb|right|A ''wiec'' in the time of [[Poland]]'s King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]] (reigned 1333-70).]]
Veches, known in Poland as wiece, were convened even before the beginning of the Polish statehood in the [[Kingdom of Poland (Piasts)|Kingdom of Poland]].&lt;ref name="bardach202627"/&gt; Issues were first debated by the elders and leaders, and later presented to all the free men for a wider discussion.&lt;ref name="bardach202627"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach63-64"/&gt;

One of the major types of wiec was the one convened to choose a new ruler.&lt;ref name="bardach202627"/&gt; There are legends of a 9th-century [[election]] of the legendary founder of the [[Piast dynasty]], [[Piast the Wheelwright]], and a similar election of his son, [[Siemowit]] (this would place [[royal elections in Poland|a Polish ruler's election]] a century before an [[Iceland]]ic one's by the [[Althing]]), but sources for that time come from the later centuries and their validity is disputed by scholars.&lt;ref name="Davies2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roszko1980"/&gt; The election privilege was usually limited to the elites,&lt;ref name="bardach202627"/&gt; which in the later times took the form of the most powerful nobles ([[magnates]], [[prince]]s) or officials, and was heavily influenced by local traditions and strength of the ruler.&lt;ref name="bardach62-63"/&gt; By the 12th or 13th centuries, the ''wiec'' institution likewise limited its participation to high ranking nobles and officials.&lt;ref name="bardach63-64"/&gt; The nationwide gatherings of ''wiec'' officials in 1306 and 1310 can be seen as precursors of the Polish parliament (the [[general sejm]]).&lt;ref name="bardach63-64"/&gt;

'''World Learning''' is a 501(c)(3) international nonprofit organization that focuses on international development, education, and exchange programs. Based in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], World Learning "unlocks the potential of people to address critical [[global issue]]s" through its five core program areas: [[Experiment in International Living|The Experiment in International Living]], [[SIT Study Abroad]] (including the International Honors Program), the [[SIT Graduate Institute]] (formerly the School for International Training), and International Development and Exchange Programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlearning.org/8503.htm Program Areas], World Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Contradict|scope=section|about=the original purpose of the group and the date the Peace Corps was founded|date=November 2015}}
The Experiment in International Living (EIL) began in 1932.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; It had its origins in preparing outbound Peace Corps Volunteers for their assignments and was the first international exchange program to involve a family homestay.  EIL was selected by the original architects of the Peace Corps, because the professionals at EIL were known to have a strong system for teaching the nuances of culture shock preparedness. Experiment assisted after World War II when they lead teaching voyages on a series of decommissioned warships with the members of the Student Council on Travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciee.org/research_center/archive/Informational_Promotional_Materials/2002HistoryOfCIEE.pdf |title=

1955 Student Council on Travel|work=www.ciee.org/|year=1955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School for International Training (SIT) was established in 1964.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.worldlearning.org/43.htm World Learning, "History".] Accessed: May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; SIT filled a need of returned [[Peace Corps]] volunteers by offering a graduate degree in International Development. The Vermont campus originally consisted of a small collection of dorms around a Carriage House on a scenic farm on the north end of Brattleboro.  These early Peace Corps volunteers took lessons in foreign languages with materials and teachers from the language training from their service, and The School for International Training began to expand its offerings. By 1968, the small but increasing number of returned Peace Corps volunteers were requesting a degree in Teaching English as a Second Language, a new speciality. In 1969, two graduate programs were developed, International Career Training (ICT), and Masters in Teaching Languages (MAT) ([[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[ESL]]).

In the late 1970s, the 1980s, and 1990s there was an undergraduate program called the World Issues Program (WIP). It was a two-year program for transfer juniors and seniors.  During the early years, a group of students published a book entitled "Process: About Learning and Caring"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.brattleboro.org/TLCScripts/interpac.dll?LabelDisplay&amp;LastResult=ItemTitles%26Config=ysm%26FormId=-252%26Branch=,0,%26LimitsId=0%26StartIndex=0%26ItemsPerPage=10%26SortField=0%26PeriodLimit=0%26IdIsDataNumber=0%26DataNumber=150168565%26NotAddToHistory=1%26Count=4%26ItemField=4%26SearchAvailableOnly=0%26PeriodLimit=0&amp;DataNumber=0&amp;RecordNumber=80553&amp;SearchAvailableOnly=0&amp;FormId=-252&amp;ItemField=4&amp;Config=ysm&amp;Branch=,0,|title=
Process: About Caring and Learning|work=School for International Training|year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which speaks about the difficulties and rewards of transformational education.

Inspired by a speech by [[United Nations]] leader [[U Thant]], the program provided classes in Peace and Conflict Studies, Alternative Energy Sources, Population Studies, International Economics and Environmental Studies.  After the first year spent on campus, students had year-long internships in different sites around the world. The final semester consisted of research into one of these areas on a topic of the student's choice, and presentations of research results.  The program was usually completed through submission of a Bachelor's Thesis or combination of projects. After 22 graduating classes, nearby [[Marlboro College]] adopted this program and offered it on their campus.

The International Visitor Leadership Project has brought community activists, legislators and regional leaders to campus to study the means of bringing peace to such war-torn places as [[Rwanda]], [[Ireland]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] or [[Israel]]/[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

'''The Experiment in International Living''' is the longest functioning exchange program and has paved the way into a more peaceful and just world, by transforming students though international experiences and homestays.[http://www.experimentinternational.org EIL]

'''SIT Graduate Institute''' is the accredited master's degree program of World Learning, offering [[Master of Arts]] degrees in Conflict Transformation; International Education; Sustainable Development; Intercultural Service, Leadership and Management; and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL).&lt;ref name=sitgrad&gt;[http://www.sit.edu/graduate/21164.htm SIT Graduate Institute, "Master's Degree and Certificate Programs."] Accessed: May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SIT Study Abroad''' offers undergraduate programs overseas in more than 60 countries. The Study Abroad program has begun the journeys of many notable recipients of fellowships and prestigious education and platforms.[http://www.sit.edu/studyabroad/ SIT Study Abroad]. The '''International Honors Program''' is a new member of the SIT Study Abroad portfolio, leading programs in studying and traveling with multiple destinations.[http://www.ihp.edu/ IHP]

'''International Professional, Academic, and Cultural Exchanges''' works to bridge differences through citizen diplomacy.The program is actively engaged on a daily basis in promoting global understanding "one handshake at a time," the World Learning Visitor Exchange Program (formerly Delphi International) facilitates citizen diplomacy through exchange programs for adults and young leaders.[http://www.worldlearning.org/17671.cfm IPAE]

'''International Development Programs''' As a part of an extensive international NGO network, World Learning also has International Development Programs (IDEP) which focus on capacity building in International Development in 20 countries.[http://www.worldlearning.org/international-development.htm World Learning - IDEP]

Reporting of US Federal educational institution statistics continues under the name, School for International Training, but some data (though apparently not for enrollment) may pertain to both the SIT Graduate Institute and SIT Study Abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/Snapshotx.aspx?unitId=adaeacabb1b3 National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Data Center]. Accessed: May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Learning currently operates about 200 programs in 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlearning.org/wl_facts_figs.pdf Facts and Figures for 2010], World Learning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/09/01/eveningnews/main6827424.shtml?tag=mncol;lst;1 Iraqi Young Leaders Exchange Program], CBS Evening News with Katie Couric&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/07/29/at_peace_in_the_world_far_from_the_war/ Iraqi Young Leaders Exchange Program], Boston Globe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/soccer/general/view/20100626bay_state_students_get_kick_out_of_world_cup/ SIT Study Abroad in South Africa], Boston Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
World Learning's main campus is located in northern Brattleboro, on a country estate developed at the turn of the 20th century as a [[gentleman's farm]].  A core portion of the campus, including the original 20-room mansion house and early 1900s farm complex, are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Dickinson Estate Historic District]].
