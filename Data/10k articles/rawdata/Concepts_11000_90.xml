      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37118">'''[[Academic freedom]] in the Middle East''' is a contested and debated issue, which has caught regional and international attention. In the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa (MENA)]] region, in general, the authoritarian regimes have all showed a certain degree of opposition to every sort of freedom, academic one not excluded, regardless of the type of regime basis they had. Freedom for academicians to inquiry, research, teach and communicate ideas or report facts without being threatened or persecuted or with the possibility of losing their position, being censored or repressed is threatened. What contributes to academic freedom violations is also that they are essential elements for the regimes to maintain their power and in addition to this issue, interstate and civil wars as well as internal disorders and external intervention can damage educational structures and institutions. Additionally, as far as the regime is concerned, a security or national threat can be a pretest for suffocate or suspend academic research and debate. Restrictions on academic freedom also regards the topics of research, which are under significant constraints, although these might be highly interesting and worth researching.

==Background==
There are many organizations that deal with monitoring violations of academic freedom and report academicians' voices, through publishing letters directed to public figures and also directed to the international community.

===Scholars at Risk===
[[Scholars at Risk]] is an international network based in the United States, specifically at the University of Chicago. The aim of this organization is to support scholars and defend academic freedom and human rights all over the world. One of the projects of this network is the Academic Freedom Monitor.

====Reported cases from Academic Freedom Monitor====
The online website Academic Freedom Monitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with reporting violations related to academic freedom. It is based on robust sources of information, which come from independent actors and are, then, verified. According to the Academic Freedom Monitor, which reports cases since 2010 until now, there are different categories of violation regarding the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.academicfreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the Middle East and Northern Africa, the AFM registers cases in: Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Kuwait, Yemen, Iraq, Palestine (OPT), Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia.

==== Types of violations ====
Academic Freedom Monitor identifies different types of violations as following:
* Killings, violence or disappearances
* Wrongful imprisonment/detention
* Wrongful prosecution
* Restrictions on travel or movement
* Retaliatory discharge or loss of position/expulsion from study
* Other significant events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info/monitoring|title=Monitoring - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee on Academic Freedom===
[[Middle East Studies Association of North America|The Middle East Studies Association (MESA)]] is an association which brings together scholars and informed people with an interested in the MENA region. This association is the promoter of the ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' and has the aim to promote cooperation, communication and boost the learning regarding the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/about/index.html|title=About MESA|website=MESANA.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fields it is dealing with regards academic freedom. This association has created a Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF), which aims to remove any obstacle regarding the exchange of knowledge and any restrictions on academicians coming also from governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/committees/academic-freedom/index.html|title=Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF)|website=MESANA.org|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
=== History ===
Academic freedom in Turkey has been through a series of changes and fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Summak, M Semih. “Academic Human Rights and Freedoms in Turkey.” ''The Educational Forum'' 62, no. 1 (1997): 32–39. doi:10.1080/00131729708982678.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often irregular, inadequate and closely tied to the politics in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Weiker, Walter F. “Academic Freedom and Problems of Higher Education in Turkey.” ''Middle East Journal'' 16, no. 3 (1962): 279–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Balyer, Aydın. “Academic Freedom : Perceptions of Academics in Turkey Akademik Özgürlük : Türkiye ’ Deki Akademisyenlerin Algıları” 36, no. 162 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Norris, Kristin E, Academic Freedom and University Autonomy: A comparative analysis of the Turkish higher education system. (2011). http://hdl.handle.net/1805/2486&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Education in Turkey#History|reform]] initiatives have been taken throughout Turkey's history which aim at restructuring governance of higher education and thus affecting academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Doğan, Didem. “Academic Freedom from the Perspectives of Academics and Students: A Qualitative Study.” ''TeEği̇ti̇m VBi̇li̇m'' 41, no. 184 (2016): 25–32. doi:10.15390/EB.2016.6135.&lt;/ref&gt; The first reform initiative was in 1933, as Malche was invited by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] to restructure [[Istanbul University|Istanbul University (Istanbul Darülfünun)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Üvey, Doðan|author2=Gökçe, Ayse Nur|title="The Role of Prof. Dr. Albert Malche in 1933 university reform in turkey." |journal=Acta - Congressus Historiae Pharmaciae|date=2001|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F25595219FD4268916676FA70A746DE?doi=10.1.1.613.7020&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the reforms that made it to the law 2252 was according [[List of universities in Turkey|universities]] with more freedom. In 1946, the Law Number 4936 accorded universities with unprecedented rights, as academicians were seen as guardians of democracy second to the military.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
The [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|Democratic Party]] in 1953 passed laws that would undermine the universities' control over their budget, retirement of academicians and their employment rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those attacks on academic freedom were aimed at confining professors from being involved in partisan politics resulting in several cases of suspensions of academicians and denial of promotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]] was seen as a promise for reversal of the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|DP]]'s encroachment over university autonomy, as it recruited academicians in government offices, selected to write the constitution and other vital roles. However, the 1960 coup junta surprisingly dismissed 147 academicians who were not in agreement with some members of the junta.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
In 1973, higher education was restructured with the increased sovereignty of the Interuniversity Council (ÜAK), while at the same time universities were given complete autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== The Council of Higher Education (YÖK) ====
The current Higher Education Law was implemented in 1981 following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 coup]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The law maintains that, “universities are judicial structures which are managed and supervised by the organs selected among them. University organs, academics and teaching assistants cannot be removed from their posts for no reason by authorities outside the university” (YÖK 2007).&lt;ref&gt;The Council of Higher Education. ''The Law on Higher Education 1981''. The Republic of Turkey: Official Gazette No: 17506, published in English by Ankara Üniversitesi Basimevi (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet academic freedom became too dependent on [[Council of Higher Education (Turkey)|The Council of Higher Education (YÖK)]] as the reform moved towards creating a more centralized system around the YÖK in matters regarding budgetary control, staff employment and student selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law defines the name, number and discipline of each faculty or vocational school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While universities can establish departments, their approval is subject to the Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Egypt==
===History===
Egypt is one of the countries where [[academic freedom]] is not a right freely enjoyed. Since the start of the 1990s, academics in Egypt have faced several forms of repression and endured many violations such as judicial convictions, public condemnation, and physical violence from both private individuals and groups, mainly the Islamists, and government officials.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, there are Egyptian state authorities using [[Egyptian National Police|police]], political appointees, and regulations and laws to control university life. On the other hand, Islamist militants are resorting to physical violence and public attacks to have a say in the content of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
All aspects of university life including the classroom, student activities, research, campus demonstrations were affected by government and private repression. The professors and students find themselves censored and enable to cross the “red lines” of politics, religion, and sex.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"/&gt;
Faculty appointments and promotions are controlled by the state. Student activities are limited once outside the classroom, and campus protests are often violently responded to. All these factors contribute to the deterioration of the academic freedom situation in Egypt and to the general decline of the educational environment.

====Sisi's era====
While Article 21 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|2014 Egyptian constitution]], issued under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]’s rule, ensures that “the state guarantees the independence of universities, scientific and linguistic academies” and that “it commits to providing university education in accordance with global quality criteria, and to developing free university education in state universities and institutes as per the law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian state still violates its constitutional provisions through various repressive ways in an attempt to curb academic freedom. Article 23 of the constitution claims that “the state grants the freedom of scientific research and encourages its institutions.”{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, freedom of scientific research has often been interfered with and even hindered on various occasions by state authorities. [[Egyptian universities|Universities]] under Sisi’s rule have been described as “experiencing the lowest levels of academic freedom the country has ever known."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Crane Linn, Emily. “Egypt’s Besieged Universities: The Country’s Scholars had better teach from President Sisi’s Textbook- or else.” Foreign Policy. 31 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many observers maintained that the violations against Egyptian academics under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|El-Sisi]]’s rule exceed those witnessed during [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak’s]] time. In academic year 2014, 761 student arrests and 281 student expulsions took place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Moreover, the state sentenced to death a university professor for writing critical articles about the regime and accused him of “conspiring to undermine Egypt’s national security”,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and arrested many others who dared to criticize the regime.
The state also monitors what ideas come in and not just the research that comes out. Several universities are canceling their study abroad programs or breaking off their cooperations with foreign universities. For example, Cairo’s [[Ain Shams University]] canceled its study abroad program to Turkey and [[Damanhour University]] stopped its cooperation with foreign institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, El-Sisi issued a decree banning any academic travel outside Egypt that does not have a prior [[State Security Investigations Service|State Security]] authorization. This way, the state would be able to control which conferences can be attended and what sources can be used. Even though this decree and many other violations are, according to the articles mentioned above, unconstitutional, they are still enforced.

===Violations===
There are various cases of academic freedom violations in Egypt. The following are just few of them. Professor Kholoud Saber had her scholarship abroad terminated by [[Cairo University]]. She was doing a doctoral research on a scholarship at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium, that started on October 2015, when she was ordered to return to Egypt following a recommendation of the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Egypt)|Ministry of Higher education]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Press Release: “Cairo’s University Decision Demonstrates the Erosion of University Independence and its Reliance on Dictates of Ministry of Higher Education, which acts as a Cover for Security Intervention in Universities.” 10 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Ohier, a French Master’s student, was arrested and later deported from Egypt. She was working on the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], a group banned by the government as it was accused of state defamation and espionage.&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; She was not given any reason for her arrest by the Egyptian officials but she, reportedly, overheard police officers claiming “she had improper friends.”&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"/&gt;
On another instance, scholar and journalist Ismail Alexandrani was detained, on November 2015, upon his return Egypt from a workshop in Germany. The Egyptian embassy in Berlin had apparently advised the scholar, who happens to be “a vocal critic of human rights violations in Egypt and counterterrorism policy in the Sinai Peninsula,” not to turn up to the workshop titled “Deconstructing Islamist Egypt"&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Mr. Alexandrani’s arrival to Egypt, his passport was confiscated and he was questioned for over 19 hours before getting arrested “on charges of ‘joining and supporting a terrorist organization’ and ‘spreading false news liable to disturb public security and harm public interest."&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"/&gt;

===Giulio Regeni case===
One of the most widely covered stories in relation to the situation of academic freedom in Egypt was the case of the Italian PhD candidate [[Giulio Regeni]], a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK. Giulio Regeni was first found dead, in the outskirts of Cairo, a week after he was declared missing on January 25, 2016, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egyptian uprising]], and his body demonstrated clear signs of torture and severe beating.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. "Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project."|date=2016|url=https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Free_to_Think_2016.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scholarsatrisk.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PhD candidate was investigating the [[Trade unions in Egypt|Egyptian labor movements]] at the [[American University in Cairo|American University of Cairo]] at the time of his murder. While government officials maintained that Regeni was kidnapped and murdered by a gang, international and Egyptian human rights activists claim that he was actually targeted for his research by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;
The murder of Giulio Regeni remains unsolved. 
The case of the researcher, and the continuing imprisonment of hundreds of scholars and thousands of students and the various restrictions on academic freedom signal that there is an actual “not improvement but, rather, a further tightening of control, and loss of autonomy and freedom in Egyptian higher education, as well as a shrinkiHing{{clarify|date=June 2017}} space for critical inquiry and discourse in Egypt generally."&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;

==Israel==
{{POV|date=March 2017}}

=== History ===
In the 1990s, Israeli academia was characterized by open-mindedness and pluralist vision of debated issues such as revisionist history on [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]] that was finding its way into the academic society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Struggle for Academic Freedom in Israel|last=Pappe|first=Ilan|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[Second Intifada]] and its aftermath, these characteristics gradually vanished also due to the disappearance of [[Israeli Left|Israeli left]] parties, which in fact used to host a great part of Israeli academia and when leftish positions started to change, this influenced the academic environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Palestinian academia&lt;!-- This sub-section needs some attention. There are many statements made here that are not backed up with secondary sources. For this reason this section reads more like an academic paper than a Wikipedia article. Remember that it is necessary to write from as neutral a position as possible - so every statement you must ask yourself "would someone want to contest this claim?" and if yes ask yourself what you can do to back it up as much as possible. If you cannot find secondary sources for some of these ideas/statements than you need to remove them.   There are several instances in this sub-section where a secondary source is necessary to validate the statement - even if it an event, it must be validated with an external source.  --&gt; ===
In what it is considered by many international actors a situation of military occupation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories|title=Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories|website=Amnesty International USA|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/un-report-on-palestine-military-occupation-apartheid-torture-israeli-violations-are-deliberate-organised-and-institutionalised/5372212|title=UN Report on Palestine: Military Occupation, Apartheid, Torture – Israeli Violations are "Deliberate, Organised, and Institutionalised"|last=Falk|first=Richard|date=2014-03-07|website=Global Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its consequent policies of [[collective punishment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/palestinians-israel-collective-punishment-160929083644838.html|title='Bad Palestinians' under Israel's collective punishment|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denial of entrance&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;!-- A statement like this should be backed up with sources in order to demonstrate that it is not an opinion but actually 'fact'. Also it would be helpful if you could add more explanation when you write of 'collective punishments' and 'denial of entrance'. Remember that you are an expert on the topic, however other Wikipedia readers are not so these types of statements need some background information - even if you can provide sources and link it to another page that discusses this more thoroughly. --&gt;, such as checkpoints and the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|wall]] between [[Israel]] and [[West Bank]], in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Occupied Palestinian Territories]] access to education for Palestinians has thus been affected&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Laurie A.|year=2007|title=Middle East Studies and Academic Freedom: Challenges at Home and Abroad|url=|journal=International Studies Perspectives|volume=8|pages=385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Again add a source to this claim. --&gt;. In fact, straight after the beginning of the [[first Intifada]], the ability for the students of West Bank Universities to study and carry on theirs studies have been limited, while later on, in 2006, a travel ban to get into Israel was issued for Palestinian students belonging to Israeli universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/ministers-demand-entry-into-israel-for-palestinian-students-1.202733|title=Ministers Demand Entry Into Israel for Palestinian Students|first1=Akiva|last1=Eldar|first2=Yoav|last2=Stern|date=18 October 2006|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedure go along with a series of entry and residence denials for researchers and students, both foreign passport holders and Palestinian-born, which have threatened the ability of carrying on a proper educational and research level in Palestinian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kibush.co.il/downloads/Letter_from_University_Presidents.pdf|format=PDF|title=To Members of Global Civil Society and Academia|website=Kibush.co.il|access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported various violations perpetrated by Israeli authorities on students, in the academic and educational environment. In 2007, 670 students from Gaza were prevented from achieving higher education in countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Germany, Britain and United States, by being denied the exit permits. In total, the number of Gazans who have been denied to exit Gaza has reached 6400 people and this due to Hamas’ takeover of the territory and Israel controlling Gaza’s border. Those students that left for their studies remained once again trapped when they returned home for the summer. Even when they obtained exit permits, students have been stopped at the passenger crossing in [[Erez]], with the justification of “security concerns”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/11/19/gaza-israel-blocks-670-students-studies-abroad|title=Gaza: Israel Blocks 670 Students from Studies Abroad|date=2007-11-19|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/02/us-challenge-israels-restrictions-gaza-students|title=US: Challenge Israel’s Restrictions on Gaza Students|date=2008-06-02|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the organization again stated how discrimination by Israeli authorities prevented many Palestinian students from the [[Gaza Strip]] to travel abroad or to the West Bank to get a better education&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt;&lt;!-- where are your sources for this? --&gt;. Regarding the chances to travel abroad, in 2008, grants allocated for the Palestinians chosen to study in the United States were redirected because there was no way those students would be allowed by Israel to leave Gaza. For the inability to get visa, the grants destined to Gaza students were transferred to students in the West Bank. The organization has highlighted the necessity and the right for those students to access higher education abroad, since in the Gaza Strip the opportunity are quite limited. For instance, there is not a wide range of degrees, both undergraduate and master’s, in the four available universities. Moreover, there is a total absence of doctoral degrees, and lecturers and teachers from outside are hardly allowed by the Israeli government to enter and teach in Gaza.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/01/letter-secretary-state-condoleeza-rice-gazan-students|title=Letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice on Gazan Students|date=1 June 2008|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=12 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This blockade is said to be a clear violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], because Israel’s obligation to guarantee the rights of the people under occupation, among which freedom of movement and right to education display, is inconsistent or not committed at all.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; However, according to international law, Gaza is not occupied since Israel no longer has any military presence in Gaza and Gaza has its own, independent government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/11/13/why-gaza-is-not-remotely-occupied-i/|title=Why Gaza is not remotely occupied (I)|first=Eugene|last=Kontorovich|date=13 November 2014|publisher=|access-date=18 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of restrictions regarding [[academic freedom]] affects also Israeli scholars, such as [[Ilan Pappé|Ilan Pappe]], an Israeli Jew, who has been forced to resign for the [[University of Haifa]] in 2007 for his academic work and political positions, such as academic boycott of Israel. The scholar started researching on the history of the creation of the state of Israel and elaborated a revisionist historical perspective regarding 1948 war. He received along with his family death threats.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In an interview with [[Ma'an News Agency|Ma’an News]], in February 2014, he was asked about academic freedom in Israel and especially regarding his personal experience. This is what he stated:

“Freedom of academic expression in Israel is a bit like the idea of a Israel being a Jewish democracy. You take a universal concept -- everyone has the right to their opinion and everyone has the right to be part of a democracy -- only with one condition: that the universality does not include critique on Zionism and that the democracy would always ensure Jewish majority whatever the demographic and geographical realities are.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?ID=664867|title=Interview: Ilan Pappe on academic freedom in Israel and BDS|website=Maan News Agency|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
During the years that followed the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian revolution]], hundreds of academicians and students were killed as a consequence of a highly violent campaign that aimed to repress academic freedom, silence dissent, and enforce uniformity of thought.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sheehan, Ivan Sascha. “Iran’s Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''The Hill''. November 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedoms of speech, association, and peaceful assembly of thousands of students and faculty members were breached through various methods of brutality, torture and detention. The reasons behind the arrests and torture ranged from “participating in illegal gatherings”, “propaganda against the system”, to “insulting the supreme leader or government officials.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other tens of thousands of students and faculty members were forced out of their education and careers and into exile.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These assaults on academic freedom continued all throughout the 1980s and became a salient feature of the newly established republic. Paradoxically, it was in universities where the initial revolutionary ‘texts’, aimed to oust the Shah, were produced and circulated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Indeed, universities came to represent the de facto ‘spaces’ where open-ended critical discourse was taking place. Nevertheless, they became the primary target of attack after the fall of the monarchy and the rise of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] to power.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Contemporary Era ====
A merciless{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} campaign of repression has been waged by the Iranian authorities against [[academic freedom]] during the last three decades. Academics and students were routinely detained, harassed and expelled from universities because of their beliefs, political affiliations and peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Amnesty International. “Persecution in Universities as Iran ‘squeezes the life out of’ academic freedom.” ''Amnesty.org.'' June 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coercion and repressive methods was stepped up after the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The latter attempted to ‘Islamize’ the educational curriculum through purging it from secular and ‘Western’ influences. Furthermore, a large number of students and academics were barred from universities, following a policy of “starring” that punished those who do not conform to the state's political and social views. The government of President Ahmadinejad also introduced a quota system to limit the number of women in universities and measures to prevent them from enrolling in a list of courses considered more appropriate for men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A firm iron grip was retained over academic institutions by the Iranian authorities to the degree of allowing intelligence bodies and state security to supervise disciplinary proceedings in universities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The next president who assumed office in 2013, [[Hassan Rouhani]]—considered by many as a ‘reformist’-, made some steps to permit the return of several banned academics and students to campuses.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Nonetheless, the situation of academic freedom remained critical with hundreds of students still imprisoned and others newly arrested since the election of President [[Hassan Rouhani|Rouhani]]. By the end of the academic year under the administration of the latter, various restrictions breaching academic freedom and introduced during the time of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] remained in place.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Violations ===
Several international instruments, to which Iran is party and accepted, such as the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]), and the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education clearly guarantee the right to education to all people without discrimination.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Iran: Government Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''Human Rights Watch''. May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the rights of individuals to freedoms of association, expression, opinion, and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination based on sex, race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion, are further protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) and the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ([[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

However, students and academics in Iran still face pervasive and routine infringements of their rights based on gender, religion, ethnicity and opinions. In the period stretching from March 2009 to February 2012, 396 cases of students were reportedly banned from their university programs because of their peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; At least 634 other students were detained by the intelligence and security network.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Student activists were suspended, threatened, arrested and prosecuted on a regular basis due to their peaceful criticism of the regime. Iranian officials have also resorted to shutting down hundreds of student publications, gatherings, and independent organizations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Moreover, the intelligence and paramilitary agencies are strongly present in university campuses and sometimes violently confront students through attacking peaceful gatherings or dormitories, which often leads to grave injuries and even the death of many students. Furthermore, the minorities living in the republic of Iran are confronted with systematic discrimination and deprivation in universities. One example illustrating this case is that of the Baha’i community who are prevented from pursuing higher education because of their different religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Iranian authorities also specifically punish student activists advocating for ethnic minority rights in harsher ways. The punishments range from violent arrests to heavy sentences including the death sentence. Women are also subject to discrimination at the educational level. The establishment of a quota system to limit female participation in universities is curbing women’s rights. Further restrictions on women’s educational choices are enforced. The issue of gender segregation, which does not always guarantee quality education for women, persists. Academics and teaching personnel are also subject to discrimination with their rights constantly violated. More than a hundred academics were dismissed from universities, because of their dissent against the government and their political views, since the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 election]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition to that, several university professors have been imprisoned for merely expressing peaceful dissent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== The case of Professor [[Homa Hoodfar]] ===
A Canadian-Iranian professor of anthropology from [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, [[Homa Hoodfar]], was detained in Iran on the 6th of June, 2016.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bothwell, Ellie. “Professor Imprisoned in Iran: Academic Freedom ‘Not a Western import’.” ''Times Higher Education News''. December 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interrogated for three months before being locked in a small cell in [[Evin Prison]] by the Iranian intelligence service.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Evin Prison|Evin prison]] in Iran is referred to as ‘Evin University’ due to the large number of intellectuals detained there.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] spent 112 days in prison for meddling in affairs of “feminism and security matters.” She was released in September 2016 on “humanitarian grounds” after Canada’s cooperation with officials from Oman, Switzerland and Italy to ensure her release.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Canada worked with the latter countries because it cut its direct diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.

Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] later reported that even though she was not physically abused, the interrogations were severely psychologically distressing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The questioning would last from 9am to 7pm in a basement, where professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] would either be facing a wall or a mirror preventing her from seeing her interrogators.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As examples of psychological abuse, the professor revealed that one day, during questioning, Iranian officials played a song from her husband’s funeral that took place two years before, after they had found a clip of it on her iPad. In another instance, they displayed a picture of “her mother standing at her father’s graveside.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Chinese ancestor worship''', or '''Chinese ancestor veneration''', also called the '''Chinese patriarchal religion''',{{sfnb|Zhou|2003|p=42}} is an aspect of the [[Chinese traditional religion]] which revolves around the ritual celebration of the [[deification|deified]] ancestors and [[tutelary deities]] of [[Chinese kin|people with the same surname]] organised into [[Chinese lineage associations|lineage societies]] in [[ancestral shrines]]. Ancestors, their ghosts, or spirits, and gods are considered part of "this world", that is, they are neither supernatural (in the sense of being outside nature) nor transcendent in the sense of being beyond nature. The ancestors are humans who have become godly beings, beings who keep their individual identities. For this reason, Chinese religion is founded on veneration of ancestors.{{sfnb|Nadeau|2010|p=369}} Ancestors are believed to be a means of connection to the supreme power of [[Tian]]  as they are considered embodiments or reproducers of the creative order of Heaven.{{sfnb|Yao|Zhao|2010|pp=113-116}}

[[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy calls for paying respect to one's ancestors, an aspect of [[filial piety]]; Zhuo Xinping (2011) views traditional patriarchal religion as the religious organisation complementing the ideology of Confucianism.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=281}} As the "bedrock faith of the Chinese", traditional patriarchal religion influences the religious psychology of all Chinese and has influenced the other religions of China,{{sfnb|He|2012}} as it is evident in the worship of founders of temples and schools of thought in [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]].

Ancestor veneration practices prevail in south China, where lineage bonds are stronger and the patrilineal hierarchy is not based upon [[agnatic seniority|seniority]], and access to corporate resources held by a lineage is based upon the equality of all the lines of descent;{{sfnb|Wu|2014|p=20|ps=. Quote: «[...] southern China refers to Fujian and Guangdong province and in some cases is expanded to include Guangxi, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Historically speaking, these areas had the strong lineage organizations and the territorial cult, compared to the rest of China in the late imperial period. These areas not only were the first to revive lineage and the territorial cult in the reform era, but also have the intensity and scale of revivals that cannot be matched by the other part of China. This phenomena is furthered referred as the southern model, based on the south-vs.-north model. The north model refers to the absence of landholding cooperative lineages that exist in the south.» Note 16: The south-vs.-north model comparison has been the thrust of historical and anthropological research. Cohen’s article on “Lineage organization in North China (1990)” offers the best summary on the contrast between the north model and the south model. He calls the north China model “the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship.” By which, he means “patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line trace back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons.” (ibid: 510) In contrast, the south China model is called “the associational mode of patrilineal kinship.” In this mode, all lines of descent are equal. “Access to corporate resources held by a lineage or lineage segment is based upon the equality of kinship ties asserted in the associational mode.” However, the distinction between the north and the south model is somewhat arbitrary. Some practices of the south model are found in north China. Meanwhile, the so-call north model is not exclusive to north China. The set of characteristics of the north model (a distinctive arrangement of cemeteries, graves, ancestral scrolls, ancestral tablets, and corporate groups linked to a characteristic annual ritual cycle) is not a system. In reality, lineage organizations display a mixture between the south and the north model.»}} whereas in north China [[Chinese communal deity religion|worship of communal deities]] is prevalent.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|pp. 12-13Overmyer, 2009. pp=12-13|ps=. "As for the physical and social structure of villages on this vast flat expanse; they consist of close groups of houses built on a raised area, surrounded by their fields, with a multi-surnamed population of families who own and cultivate their own land, though usually not much more than twenty ''mou'' or about three acres. [...] Families of different surnames living in one small community meant that lineages were not strong enough to maintain lineage shrines and cross-village organizations, so, at best, they owned small burial plots and took part only in intra-village activities. The old imperial government encouraged villages to manage themselves and collect and hand over their own taxes. [...] leaders were responsible for settling disputes, dealing with local government, organizing crop protection and planning for collective ceremonies. All these factors tended to strengthen the local protective deities and their temples as focal points of village identity and activity. This social context defines North China local religion, and keeps us from wandering off into vague discussions of ‘popular’ and ‘elite’ and relationships with Daoism and Buddhism."}}

Some contemporary scholars in China have adopted the names "Chinese traditional patriarchal religion" (中國傳統宗法性宗教 ''Zhōngguó chuántǒng zōngfǎ xìng zōngjiào'') or "Chinese traditional primordial religion" (中國傳統原生性宗教 ''Zhōngguó chuántǒng yuánshēng xìng zōngjiào'') to define the traditional religious system organised around the worship of ancestor-gods.&lt;ref name="Zhang-Yang"&gt;Zhang Jin, Yang Chunpeng. [http://www.mzb.com.cn/html/Home/report/385824-1.htm “中国传统原生性宗教”的产生和特点 ("Chinese traditional primordial religion": generation and characteristics)]. China Ethnic and Religious Network (中国民族宗教网), 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062002/http://www.mzb.com.cn/html/Home/report/385824-1.htm|date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;China Confucius Network: [http://www.chinakongzi.org/rjwh/ddmj/guoyi/200705/t20070520_2165616.htm 人文主义宗教与宗教人文主义] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115041/http://www.chinakongzi.org/rjwh/ddmj/guoyi/200705/t20070520_2165616.htm|date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Jin and Yang Chunpeng, based at the Folk Religion Institute and Party School Theory Research Section of Xuanen County, in an article on the China Ethnic and Religious Network define Chinese traditional primordial religion as faith in [[God]] ([[Shangdi]])'s original form.&lt;ref name="Zhang-Yang"/&gt;

Mou Zhongjian defines "clan-based traditional patriarchal religion" as "an orthodox religion that was widely accepted by all classes, and had been practiced for thousands of years in ancient China".{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}} Mou also says that this religion was subordinate to the state, it was "diverse and inclusive" and had "a humanistic spirit that emphasises the social, moral function of religion", and is closely related to politics.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}} It refers to:{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|pp=280-281}}
:«[...] The traditional religion that had been in place since the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. It evolved from the worship of Heaven and ancestors. It had the basic components of a religion, including religious concepts, emotions, and rituals. It had no independent organisation. Instead, it was the kinship structure that fulfilled the functions of religious organisation. The emperor, who was the son of God, was the representative of the people who worshiped Heaven. Elders of the clans and parents represented the family in the worship of ancestors. Respecting Heaven and honoring ancestors (''jingtian fazu''), taking good care in seeing off the deceased, and maintaining sacrifices to distant ancestors (''shenzhong zhuiyuan'') were the basic religious concepts and emotional expressions in this religion. [...]»

According to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal religion and Confucianism complemented each other in ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally lacked a social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion lacked an ideological doctrine.{{sfnb|Yang|Tamney|2011|p=280}}

In [[Chinese folk religion]], a person is thought to have multiple souls, categorized as [[Hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'']], commonly associated with [[yin and yang|yang and yin]], respectively. Upon death, ''hun'' and ''po'' separate. Generally, the former ascends into heaven and latter descends into the earth and/or resides within a [[spirit tablet]]; however, beliefs concerning the number and nature of souls vary.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Richard J. Smith (2007). ''Settling the Dead: Funerals, Memorials and Beliefs Concerning the Afterlife''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from Living in the Chinese Cosmos: Understanding Religion in Late-Imperial China: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/prb/journey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with these traditional beliefs, various practices have arisen to address the perceived needs of the deceased.

===Mourning===
The mourning of a loved one usually involves elaborate rituals, which vary according to region and sect. The intensity of the mourning is thought to reflect the quality of relationship one had with the deceased. From the time of Confucius until the 20th century, a three-year mourning period was often prescribed, mirroring the first three years in a child's life when they are utterly dependent upon and loved unconditionally by their parents. These mourning practices would often include wearing sackcloth or simple garb, leaving hair unkempt, eating a restricted diet of [[congee]] two times a day, living in a mourning shack placed beside the house, and moaning in pain at certain intervals of the day. It is said{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} that after the death of Confucius his followers engaged in this three-year mourning period to symbolize their commitment to his teachings.

===Funeral rites===
[[File:Cangnan - Longgang - P1210226 - funeral procession.JPG|thumb|A funeral procession in Zhejiang province]]
Funerals are considered to be a part of the normal process of family life, serving as a cornerstone in inter-generational traditions. The primary goals, regardless of religious beliefs, are to demonstrate obeisance and provide comfort for the deceased. Other goals include: to protect the descents of the deceased from malevolent spirits and to ensure the proper separation and direction of the deceased's soul into the afterlife.

Some common elements of Chinese funerals include the expression of grief through prolonged, often exaggerated wailing; the wearing of white mortuary clothes by the family of the deceased; a ritual washing of the corpse, followed by its attiring in grave clothes; the transfer of symbolic goods such as money and food from the living to the dead; the preparation and installation of a [[spirit tablet]] or the use of a [[Shi (personator)|personator]], often symbolic. Sometimes, ritual specialists such as Taoist priests or Buddhist monks would be hired to perform specific rites, often accompanied by the playing of music or chanting of scripture to drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson, L. G. (1979). ''Chinese Religion: An Introduction Third Edition''. Belmont, California: Wadsworth, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

===Burial===
[[File:Cangnan - Jinxiang - Qiantoulian - P1210370.JPG|thumb|A typical traditional hill slope cemetery of China's southeastern coast]]
Burial is often delayed according to wealth; the coffin would remain in the main room of the family home until it has been properly prepared for burial. More traditionally, this delay is pre-determined according to social status: the corpse of a king or [[Emperor of China|emperor]] would be held in abeyance for seven months; magnates, five; other officers, three; commoners, one.

In some instances, a "lucky burial" can take place several years after the burial. The bones are dug up, washed, dried, and stored in an earthenware jar. After a period of storage, the contents are then interred in their final resting place in a location selected by an [[Feng Shui|augur]] to optimize the flow of ''[[qi]]''. A bad ''qi'' flow could result in a disgruntled spirit who could possibly haunt their descendants.&lt;ref name="religionfacts"&gt;ReligionFacts. (2005, June 2). ''Ancestor Veneration''. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from www.religionfacts.com: http://www.religionfacts.com/chinese_religion/practices/ancestor_worship.htm &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;

The deceased would often be buried with sacrifices, typically things one was thought to be in need of in the afterlife. This was done as a symbolic demonstration of filial piety or grandeur. For the wealthy and powerful, bronze vessels, oracle bones, and human or animal sacrifices often accompanied the deceased into the grave. More common sacrifices included candles and incense, as well as offerings of wine and food.

===Continued obeisance===
After the funeral, families often install an ancestral tablet at a household altar alongside other deceased ancestors. This act symbolically unifies the ancestors and honors the family lineage. Incense is lit before the altar daily, significant announcements are made before them, and offerings such as favorite foods, beverages, and [[joss paper|spirit money]] are given bi-monthly and on special occasions, such as [[Qingming Festival]] and [[Ghost Festival]].&lt;ref name="religionfacts"/&gt;

[[Prayer]] was usually performed at the household altar in a separate room containing the ''po'' of their ancestors. The eldest male would speak to the altar on a regular basis. In some belief systems where special powers are ascribed to the deceased, he may supplicate the spirit to bless the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5591">'''Angelic tongues''' are the languages supposedly used by angels. It usually refers to sung praise in [[Second Temple period]] Jewish materials.

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
[[Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice]] is the principal source for angelic tongues at [[Qumran]]. The texts are fragmentary but appear to relate to praise tongues:
*[...] through the wonderful height [...] tongue of purity [...] gods (~yhla), seven [...] 4Q400 3 1, 1-2
* ...Psalm of praise, on the tongue of the fou[rth]...[Ps]alm of [tha]nksgiving, on the tongue of the fifth...[Psalm] of exultation, on the tongue of the sixth...Psalm of [singing, on the to]ngue of the seventh of the [chief] pri[nces,] a powerful song [to the God] of ho[lines] with its se[ven] wo[nd]er[ful songs] 4Q403 1 1, 1-6
* Proclaim his glory with the tongue of all who proclaim knowledge, his wonderful songs with the mouth of all who proclaim [him. For he is] God of all who sing {knowledge} for ever, and Judge in his power over all the spirits of understanding. 4Q4031 1 36-37
* ...The tongue of the first will be strengthened seven times with the tongue of the second to him....{this is repeated for the series up to the seventh}... 4Q403 1 2, 27-30

It is not clear whether the angelic tongues are coherent, intelligible to man. However, since Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is itself related to sung praise at the Qumran community, there is a parallel with coherent angelic praise tongues in Testament of Job.&lt;ref&gt;Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, edited by James H. Charlesworth and Carol A. Newsom. Theological Studies 54  2003 649–653.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Poirier ''Tongues of Angels: Concept of Angelic Languages in Classical Jewish and Christian Texts '' 2010. XI, 224 pages. WUNT II 287  p110 "Cf. Sheres and Blau 1995:84: "But the angels' speech [in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice] is not recorded. Why do we not hear what they are saying? One commentator has suggested that the big difference between the 'tongues of men and of angels' rendered their idiom unintelligible. Perhaps also, at such auspicious moments the sectarians themselves spoke in tongues (an ecstatic incomprehensible language), a chanting that would drown out what was going on. The sectarians' taste for the esoteric is evident elsewhere"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George J. Brooke, Hindy Najman, Loren T. Stuckenbruck ''The significance of Sinai: traditions about Sinai and divine Revelation in Judaism and Christianity.'' 2008 p57 "Participation in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice liturgy is reserved for those sufficiently righteous and ... in order to acquire “tongues of angels” would seem to have been such an elite."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren T. Stückenbruck ''Angel veneration and Christology: a study in early Judaism and in the Christology of the Apocalypse of John, by Loren T. Stuckenbruck. WUNT 2/70'' 1995 p156 ''The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice This brings us to a consideration of the angelic sabbath-liturgy (Shi- rot 'Olat ha-Shabbat), which was not fully published and ... and seven tongues, each being seven-fold more powerful than the next ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testament of Job==
The pseudepigraphical [[Testament of Job]] (ca.100 BCE–100CE) contains a conclusion which is believed to relate to the compiling of the hymnbook used by a [[Therapeutae]] community.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Job'' in Charlesworth J.H., The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol.II, Doubleday 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Job gives one of his daughters "a cord" (a stringed instrument of some kind?) 
* "And she took on another heart—no longer minded toward earthly things—but ecstatically in the angelic dialect, sending up a hymn to God in accord with the style of the angels. And as she spoke ecstatically, she allowed “The Spirit” to be on her garment." (T. Job 48:2-3)&lt;ref&gt;http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/ot/pseudo/test-job.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Job’s other daughters likewise took on “the dialect of archons”, “the dialect of those and the “dialect of the cherubim” (T. Job 49:1-50:3). The “cherubim” are also mentioned Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as blessing God (4Q403 1 2, 15, cf. 4Q405 20 2, 3). 

There is parallel description of sung prophecy among the Therapeutae in [[Alexandria]] by [[Philo]], but no mention there of angelic tongues.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, On the Contemplative Life http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
A possible reference to Jewish practices of angelic tongues is 1Co13:1 "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal." The distinction "of men" and "of angels" may suggests that a distinction was known to the Corinthians. If a distinction is intended then 1Co14:10 "There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning" may imply that "tongues of men" were intelligible, whereas 1Co14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit." refers to angelic tongues. The problem with this is that the "angelic" tongues documented at Qumran and among the Therapeutae appear to be inspired, but coherent and intelligible, sung praise. Against this is the view of Dunn that "It is evident then that Paul thinks of [[glossolalia]] as language". {{dubious|date=December 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn Jesus and the Spirit: "A Study of the Religious and Charismatic Experience of Jesus and the First Christians as Reflected in the New Testament," p. 244 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Self deception|Deception}}

[[Image:Othello and Iago.gif|thumb|right|[[Iago]] (right) and Othello from ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].  Much of the tragedy of the play is brought about by advice Iago gives to Othello in bad faith.]]
'''Bad faith''' ([[Latin]]: ''mala fides'') is double mindedness or double heartedness in [[:wikt:duplicity|duplicity]], [[fraud]], or [[deception]].&lt;ref name=WD1913&gt;''"of two hearts ... a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another; bad faith"'', Webster's Dictionary, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[intentionality|intentional]] deceit of others, or [[self-deception]].

The expression "bad faith" is associated with "double heartedness",&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; which is also translated as "double mindedness".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm|title=James 1:8 Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P119.113" /&gt; A bad faith belief may be formed through self-deception, being double minded, or "of two minds", which is associated with faith, belief, [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], and [[loyalty]]. In the 1913 ''Webster's Dictionary'', bad faith was equated with being double hearted, "of two hearts", or "a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another".&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; The concept is similar to [[perfidy]], or being "without faith", in which deception is achieved when one side in a conflict promises to act in good faith (e.g. by raising a flag of surrender) with the intention of breaking that promise once the enemy has exposed himself. After [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s analysis of the concepts of self-deception and bad faith, bad faith has been examined in specialized fields as it pertains to self-deception as two semi-independently acting minds within one mind, with one deceiving the other.

Some examples of bad faith include: a company representative who negotiates with union workers while having no intent of compromising;&lt;ref name="BFN"&gt;"Bad Faith Negotiation," Union Voice, [http://unitas.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/bad-faith-negotiation/].&lt;/ref&gt; a prosecutor who argues a legal position that he knows to be false;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gershman|first1=Bennett L.|title=Bad Faith Exception to Prosecutorial Immunity for Brady Violations|journal=Pace Law Faculty Publications|date=13 January 2010|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/635|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insurer who uses language and reasoning which are deliberately misleading in order to deny a claim.&lt;ref name=lar&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Insurance Company Bad Faith Following Car Accidents|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/car-accidents/insurance-bad-faith.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad faith may be viewed in some cases to not involve deception, as in some kinds of [[hypochondria]] with actual physical manifestations. There is a question about the truth or falsity of statements made in bad faith self-deception; for example, if a hypochondriac makes a complaint about their psychosomatic condition, is it true or false?&lt;ref name=PMREN/&gt;

Bad faith has been used as a term of art in diverse areas involving [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;''"'The Look' as Bad Faith"'', ''Philosophy Today'' 36, 3 (1992), Debra B.

==General use==
In ordinary usage, bad faith is equated with being of "two hearts", or "a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another",&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; and is synonymous with double mindedness, with disloyalty, double dealing, hypocrisy, infidelity, breach of contract, unfaithfulness, pharisaism (emphasizing or observing the letter but not the spirit of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |title=Pharisaic dictionary definition - Pharisaic defined |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Doctrine of absurdity]]), tartuffery (a show or expression of feelings or beliefs one does not actually hold or possess),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GHCX9Z0p2-gC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=tartuffery+definition+%22A+show+or+expression+of+feelings+or+beliefs+one+does+not+actually+hold+or+possess%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Roget's II|publisher=|isbn=9780425156681|last1=Roget|first1=Peter Mark|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; affectation, bigotry, and lip service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/bad+faith|title=Bad faith Synonyms, Bad faith Antonyms - Thesaurus.com|website=www.thesaurus.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
People may hold beliefs in their minds even though they are directly contradicted by facts. These are beliefs held in bad faith. But there is debate as to whether this self-deception is [[intentional]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;''"intentional structure of bad-faith"'', ''Good Faith and other essays'', Joseph S. Catalano, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] defined bad faith (French: ''mauvaise foi'') as hiding the truth from oneself.&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental question about bad faith self-deception is how it is possible.&lt;ref&gt;''"Self Deception and the Nature of Mind"'', ''Tropisms and Reason'', Perspectives on self-deception, Brian P. McLaughlin editor, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=p6Psh4rXKTEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+psychology&amp;ots=H2xGSnT0gC&amp;sig=UozPd8c6ijIz4CPyN9FZm5WnAnw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a liar to successfully lie to the victim of the lie, the liar must know that what is being said is false. In order to be successful at lying, the victim must believe the lie to be true. When a person is in bad faith self-deception, the person is both the liar and the victim of the lie. So at the same time the liar, as liar, believes the lie to be false, and as victim believes it to be true. So there is a contradiction in that a person in bad faith self-deception believes something to be true and false at the same time.&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"&gt;"Self Deception and Bad Faith", Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood, pp. 207-227&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre observed that "the one to whom the lie is told and the one who lies are one and the same person, which means that I must know the truth in my capacity as deceiver, though it is hidden from me in my capacity as the one deceived", adding that "I must know that truth very precisely, in order to hide it from myself the more carefully—and this not at two different moments of temporality ..."

==In theology==
Various commentators and translators have discussed being of two [[beliefs]] or [[faiths]] in being double hearted or double minded.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P119.113" /&gt; ''Webster's Dictionary'' equates bad faith with "being of two hearts".&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; "Double hearted" is translated also as "double minded", or "of two hearts" or "of two minds" or souls, two beliefs, [[Attitude (psychology)|two attitudes]], [[loyalty|two loyalties]], [[mind|two thinkings]], [[belief|two beliefs]], or being as [[Soul (spirit)|two souls]] at the same time. The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle]]s admonish religious believers not to be double minded. In [[Psalm 119|Psalms&amp;nbsp;119:113]], one translation is "I hate double-minded men, but I love your law."&lt;ref name="P119.113"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/psalms/119-113.htm|title=Psalm 119:113 I hate double-minded people, but I love your law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Living Translation]] emphasises divided loyalty translating the passage as "I hate those with divided loyalties, but I love your instructions."&lt;ref name="P119.113"/&gt;

The [[Epistle of James]] warns against trusting a person that "perpetually [[self deception|disagrees with ''himself'']]".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; "Taking the Lord's name in vain", bad faith justifies actions known to be wrong by claiming a direction from God or religious authority to take unethical positions or untrue beliefs, when a person ''should'' know otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion and Morality," Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/].&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on double mindedness in James&amp;nbsp;1 and its relation to [[hypocrisy]] in Matthew&amp;nbsp;6:22, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary says "double-minded-literally, 'double-souled', the one soul directed towards God, the other to something else ... It is not a hypocrite that is meant, but a fickle, 'wavering' man, as the context shows".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[Henry Alford|Alford's]] translation of the Bible uses the ancient Greek literature's "waverer" to express "double minded".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;

In James 1:8, it denotes instability of a cognitive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], "he is a double-minded man, unstable in attitude". In the [[God's Word Translation]], "a person who has doubts is thinking about two different things at the same time and can't make up his mind about anything".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[Young's Literal Translation]] translates this as being "two souled".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; In Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, a double-minded man is one of two souls in that one is for earth, and the other for heaven, wishing to secure both worlds at once.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[John Gill (theologian)|Gill's]] exposition of the Bible refers to asking for one thing and meaning another, honoring in word but not in heart, confused in the mind.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;

[[Clarke's commentary on the Bible]] commented on Deuteronomy 26:17 and [[Jewish theology]] regarding being double hearted, in that Rabbi Tanchum (fol. 84) remarked, "Behold, the Scripture exhorts the Israelites, and tells them when they pray, that they should not have two hearts, one for the holy blessed God, and one for something else."&lt;ref name="James"&gt;[https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/acc/james-1.html James 1 Commentary.]&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke comments that "James refers to those Jews who were endeavoring to incorporate the law with the Gospel, who were divided in their minds and affections, not willing to give up the Levitical rites, and yet unwilling to renounce the Gospel. Such persons could make no progress in Divine things."&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] does not consider everyone with heretical views to have bad faith: for example, people who earnestly seek the truth and lead exemplary lives.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies'', Orlando O. Espín and James B. Nickoloff, p.551, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k85JKr1OXcQC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+Theology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=31M2KNLajc&amp;sig=PKjISREYwlrVOR941GCeTtlbeHs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y4RATbipCo_CsAPN6qyUCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy, psychology, and psychoanalysis==

===Freudian psychoanalysis===
[[Freudian psychoanalysis]] answers how bad faith self-deception is made possible by postulating an unconscious dimension of our being that is amoral, whereas the [[conscious]] is in fact regulated by morality, law, and custom, accomplished by what Freud calls [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"/&gt; The true desires of the subconscious express themselves as [[wish fulfillment]] in dreams, or as an ethical position unconsciously taken to satisfy the wishes of the unconscious mind.&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"/&gt;

===Ethics, phenomenology, existentialism===
{{Further|Ethics of belief|Authenticity (philosophy)|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
Bad faith [[wish fulfillment]] is central to the [[ethics of belief]], which discusses questions at the intersection of [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], Freudian [[psychoanalysis]], and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, Journal of Value Inquiry 91, 339–347, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Irony and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, SUNY, Albany, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"psychological strategies such as ..."bad faith"... become germane in the ethics of belief", ''Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception Unmasked'', Alfred R. Mele, Princeton, NJ: Princeton, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is not lying to himself is [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]. "Authenticity" is being faithful to internal rather than external ideas.

Bad faith in ethics may be when an unethical position is taken as ethical, and justified by appeal to being forced to that belief as an excuse, e.g., by God or by that person's natural disposition due to genetics, even though facts disconfirm that belief and [[honesty]] would require it.&lt;ref&gt;''"... required by honesty, and to hide this from ourselves is 'bad faith'. One form of bad faith is to pretend that there is a God who is giving us our tasks. Another is to pretend that there is a 'human nature' that is doing the same thing"'', ''Religion and Morality'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] plays a role leading to discussions of bad faith. It has a role in ethics by an analysis of the structure of [[Will (philosophy)|will]], valuing, happiness, and care for others (in [[empathy]] and [[sympathy]]). Phenomenologist [[Heidegger]] discussed care, [[conscience]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], moving to "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]", which in turn led to the [[feminism]] of [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and existentialism of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], both based on phenomenology's considerations of authenticity and its role in bad faith. Sartre analyzed the logical problem of "bad faith" as it relates to authenticity, and where he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in [[good faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/|title=Phenomenology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into existentialism]]
Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|existentialism]], using the concepts of bad faith and "authenticity" in the ethics of belief.&lt;ref&gt;''"The 'ethics of belief' refers to a cluster of questions at the intersection of epistemology, philosophy of mind, psychology, and ethics ... central ... is ... bad faith wish-fulfillment ..."'', ''The Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre begins his discussion of bad faith by raising the question of how bad faith self-delusion is possible.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; Sartre calls "bad faith" a kind of project of self-deception. In order to produce excuses, bad faith first takes a third-person stance toward itself. When it becomes necessary to elude this stance it has made of itself, it then adopts the first-person perspective. In neither case can the deception fully succeed. Without these two facets of existence, if [[consciousness]] was unitary and not divisible, as in the indivisible "I" in "[[I think, therefore I am]]", it would be impossible to explain how the very project of self-deception could be possible. The Freudian theory of the unconscious is viewed by Sartre as based on an incoherent view of consciousness, but the project of psychoanalysis as an uncovering of the "fundamental project" of an individual's life is considered to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/notes.html|title=Existentialism &gt; Notes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existentialist]] philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the belief that there is something intrinsically good in itself, which is inherent in the world as absolute value and is discoverable by people, the "[[spirit of seriousness]]", which he argued leads to bad faith. He argued that people fall into the spirit of [[seriousness]] because they take their values too seriously, and forget that values are contingent, chosen and assigned subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Spirit of Seriousness", The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt; In Sartre's words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] ''givens'',  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of 'desirable' from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
Psychologists have proposed answers as to how bad faith self-delusion can be possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Self Deception and Bad Faith", Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

A "tropism" is an action done without conscious thought.&lt;ref&gt;''"action done without cognitive thought"'', Websters Dictionary Online, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tropism]&lt;/ref&gt; While self-deception may be a tropism, not consciously done, it may be guided by "projects" one may set for one's life, such as a desire for personal pleasure, wealth, power, or to get into heaven. For example, a creationist has a project to get into heaven, and a racist with feelings of personal inadequacy may have a project to be superior or to have power over some others. The project may create self-deception without conscious thought, as a tropism creates action without conscious thought.

A [[homunculus]] is a little person (or map of the person) inside a person, and homuncularism is the theory in psychology that there are subsystems of the mind performing different operations; the homuncularist answer to the question as to how bad faith is possible is that one such subunit deceives the other.&lt;ref&gt;''"There is a natural homuncularist response to this surface paradox of self deception. Distinct subsystems that play the distinct role of deceiver and deceived are located within the self deceiver. So no single subject of belief is required to both believe (know) a proposition and not believe (know) it."'', Self Deception and the Nature of Mind, ''"Tropisms and Reason''", ''Perspectives on Self Deception'', Brian P.

In [[humanistic psychology]], recognition of bad faith in one's own acts by the actor results in [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[regret (emotion)|regret]].&lt;ref&gt;''"Existential Regret: A Crossroads of Existential Anxiety and Existential Guilt"'', ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'', Marijo Lucas, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine, hypochondria===
Hypochondria is a kind of bad faith self-deception.&lt;ref name=PMREN/&gt;

===Truth values===
There is controversy as to whether propositions made in bad faith are true or false, such as when a hypochondriac has a complaint with no physical symptom.&lt;ref name=PMREN&gt;"Absent a lesion or a physiological disturbance to account readily for the complaint, the complaint was likely to be regarded as male fide", Post-Modern Reflections on the Ethics of Naming, The Ethics of Diagnosis Philosophy and Medicine, 1992, Volume 40, Section V, 275-300, George Khushf, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r6735871m3782056/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bad Luck, Bad Blood, Bad Faith:Ideological Hegemony and the Oppressive Language of Hoodoo Science'', Joyce E. King&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"... bad faith ... pseudoscience ... hoodoo science"'', ''Measured Lies: The Bell Curve Examined'', Joe L. Kincheloe, p. 186, {{ISBN|0-312-12520-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVLaKci3uOIC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=%22bell+curve%22+%22bad+faith%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Vs4dUiQt_Z&amp;sig=2tqhRJCOu4vSFTGYiUcftT8IEIk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lBxFTbDqMo-asAOy2oi-Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[pseudoscience]] of racial eugenics, bad faith is proposed to be a motivator for self-defensive action against an objectified race of people to justifiably uphold a desire for racial supremacy; e.g., a minority group of whites who believe that blacks are inferior in bad faith to motivate the preservation of their white-race differences, while their faith is motivated in fear of elimination from within a volatile racial environment.&lt;ref&gt;''"... bad faith can be defined as fleeing a displeasing truth for a pleasing falsehood.

===Zen Buddhism===
Persons practicing [[Zen]] claim not to be subject to the "bad faith" in "self-deception", since they do not ''explain'' a motivation for action, as a [[rationalist]] would; a rationalist must rationalize an irrational desire that is actually rooted in the body and the unconscious as if it were not.&lt;ref&gt;''"Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy"'', ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical philosophy and the error theory of moral statements===
For philosophers in the Anglo-American [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] tradition statements involving moral values have caused concern because of their similarity to statements about objects and events in the physical world. Compare:
#Littering is commonplace in Chiang Mai
#Littering is wrong

Both have the same grammatical structure, but the way we might verify the first is quite different from the way we might want to verify the second. We can verify the first statement by observations made in the physical world, but, according to [[David Hume]], no amount of physical world observation can verify statements of the second type. Hume's view is summarized as "you can not derive ought from is". Whereas statements of the first type must be true or false, some philosophers have argued that moral statement are neither true nor false. [[Richard M. Hare]], for example, argues that moral statements are in fact imperatives (commands). For him the statement "littering is wrong" means "do not litter", and "do not litter" is neither true nor false.

In sharp contrast to people like Hare, [[J.L. Mackie]] contended that moral statements are false. Mackie's view discomforts [[Crispin Wright]] who says that it "relegates moral discourse to bad faith".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism/ Miller, Alexander ''Realism'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Wright is not saying that all moral statements are bad faith. What he is saying is that if Mackie is correct, and somebody believes that Mackie is correct, then that person will be guilty of bad faith whenever he makes a moral statement.

==In law==
In law, there are inconsistent definitions of bad faith, with one definition much more broad than used in other fields of study discussed in the above sections. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' equates [[fraud]] with bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;definition of "bad faith", Black's Law Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; But one goes to jail for fraud, and not necessarily for bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocking Chair Plaza v Brampton'', 1988 29 CPC 2d 82, Duhaime online Legal Dictionary, [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The Duhaime online law dictionary similarly defines bad faith broadly as "intent to deceive", and "a person who intentionally tries to deceive or mislead another in order to gain some advantage".&lt;ref name="duhaime1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx|title=Bad Faith Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian labor arbitrator wrote, in one case, that bad faith is related to rationality in reasoning, as it is used in other fields, but is ill-defined in the law.&lt;ref name="duhaime1"/&gt;

{{quote|The concept of bad faith is likely not capable of precise calibration and certainly has not been defined in the same way by all adjudicators. At its core, bad faith implies malice or ''ill will''. A decision made in bad faith is ''grounded, not on a rational connection between the circumstances and the outcome, but on antipathy toward the individual for non-rational reasons'' ... The absence of a rational basis for the decision implies that factors other than those relevant were considered. In that sense, a decision in bad faith is also arbitrary. These comments are not intended to put to rest the debate over the definition of bad faith. Rather, it is to point out that bad faith, which has its core in malice and ill will, at least touches, if not wholly embraces, the related concepts of ''unreasonableness'', discrimination and arbitrariness.}}
What was called "Canada's best judicial definition of 'bad faith{{'"}} by ''Duhaime's Legal Dictionary'' is similarly more consistent with use in other fields discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins v Transport &amp; Allied Worker's Union'', 1991, 6 CPC 3d 206, Newfoundland, Duhaime Legal Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Good faith and its opposite, bad faith, imports a ''subjective state of mind'', the former ''motivated by'' honesty of purpose and the latter by ''ill-will''.}}

Duhaime also refers to another description, "... bad faith refers to a subjective state of mind ... motivated by ill will ... or even ''sinister purposes''."&lt;ref name="duhaime1"/&gt;

The current standard legal definition of "bad faith" in the law of England and Wales is that of Lindsay J in Gromax Plasticulture Ltd. v. Don and Low Nonwovens Ltd: "Plainly it includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, includes also some dealings which fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the particular area being examined. Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short in order to amount to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by the Courts (which leads to the danger of the Courts then construing not the Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a regard to all material surrounding circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/1998/316.html|title=Gromax Plasticulture Ltd v. Don &amp; Low Nonwovens Ltd [1998] EWHC Patents 316 (12th June, 1998)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance bad faith===
{{Main|Insurance bad faith}}
[[Insurance bad faith]] is a [[tort]] claim that an insured may have against an insurer for its bad acts, e.g. intentionally denying a claim by giving spurious citations of exemptions in the policy to mislead an insured, adjusting the claim in a dishonest manner, failing to quickly process a claim, or other intentional misconduct in claims processing.&lt;ref&gt;"The tort of bad faith in first-party insurance transactions after two decades," Roger C. Henderson, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/arz37&amp;div=64&amp;id=&amp;page=].&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance bad faith has been broadened beyond use in other fields to include total inaction, a refusal to respond to a claim in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bad Faith Claims Address Insurer Violations|url=https://www.ohiobar.org/ForPublic/Resources/LawYouCanUse/Pages/LawYouCanUse-696.aspx|website=Ohio State Bar Association|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts can award [[Punitive damages|punitive or exemplary damages]], over and above actual damages against any insurance company which is found to have adjusted a claim in bad faith; the damages may be awarded with the aim of deterring such behavior among insurers in general, and may far exceed the amount of the damage due under the [[insurance policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations|url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/130-laws-regs-hearings/05-CCR/fair-claims-regs.cfm|website=California Department of Insurance|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], one case of this type resulted in a record punitive award of [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] $1 million when an [[insurance company]] pressed a claim for [[arson]] even after its own experts and adjusters had come to the conclusion that the fire was accidental; the company was advised by legal counsel that the desperate insured parties would be willing to settle for much less than what they were owed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc18/2002scc18.html|title=CanLII - 2002 SCC 18 (CanLII)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social sciences==

===Feminism===
Central to [[feminism]] is the idea that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] to this subordination, e.g., acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God; Simone de Beauvoir labels such women "mutilated" and "[[immanent]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Look as Bad Faith'', Debra B. Bergoffen, Philosophy Today 36, 3 (1992), 221-227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It argues, with Simone de Beauvoir, that patriarchal marriage is both a perversion of the meaning of the couple and an institution in transition"'', Marriage, Autonomy, and the Feminine Protest'', Hypatia, Volume 14, Number 4, Fall 1999, pp. 18-35, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/hypatia/v014/14.4bergoffen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"mutilated ... immanent ... ''", ''The Second Sex'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]], H.M. Parshley (Trans), Vintage Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... women are systematically subordinated ... de Beauvoir labels women "mutilated" and "immanent"...  women succumb to 'bad faith' and surrender their agency ...", Feminist Perspectives on the Self, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Simone de Beauvoir developed modern conceptions of bad faith and modern feminism together in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]''.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of justice===
Bad faith is important to the concept of [[original position]] in [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], where mutual commitment of the parties requires that the parties cannot choose and agree to principles in bad faith, in that they have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice; a party cannot take risks with principles he knows he will have difficulty voluntarily complying with, or they would be making an agreement in bad faith which is ruled out by the conditions of the original position.&lt;ref&gt;''"Rawls ... parties ... cannot choose and agree to principles in 'bad faith' ... have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice ..."'', ''Original Position'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation theory===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-27106-0001, Paris, Verhandlungen über NATO-Beitritt.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used an "inherent bad faith" model when negotiating with the Soviet Union in International relations.]]

Bad faith is a concept in [[negotiation theory]] whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.&lt;ref name=BFN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"negotiating in bad faith"'', example of use of "bad faith" from definition in Oxford Online Dictionary, [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bad+faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad faith in [[political science]] and [[political psychology]] refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of [[information processing]].&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt; The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;''"The 'Inherent Bad Fatih Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger"'', ''Political Psychology'', Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref name="HSP"&gt;''"... the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent ..."'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt; A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref name=HSP/&gt;

===Loyalty and patriotism===
Bad faith is associated with being double minded, or of divided loyalty. (See [[#In theology|theology section above]].)

The philosophy of [[loyalty]] examines unchosen loyalties, e.g., one does not choose one's family or country, but when there is excessive wrongdoing, there is a general unwillingness to question these unchosen loyalties, and this exhibits bad faith as a type of lack of [[integrity]]; once we have such loyalties, we are resistant to their scrutiny and self-defensively discount challenges to them in bad faith.&lt;ref name="PBF"&gt;''"Patriotism as Bad Faith"'',''Ethics'', 115, Simon Keller, pp. 563–92, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/loyalty/|title=Loyalty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of [[patriotism]] (loyalty to one's country) bad faith is hiding from oneself the true source of some of one's patriotic beliefs, such as when one fights for a racist [[totalitarian dictatorship]] against a free and [[egalitarian]] democracy.&lt;ref name=PBF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"This leads her to hide from herself the true source of some of the beliefs involved. This is bad faith."'', Patriotism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2431">'''CONWIP''' ('''CONstant [[work in process]]''') are pull-oriented [[production control]] [[system]]s. Such systems can be classified as pull and push systems (Spearman et al. 1990&lt;ref&gt;Spearman, M., Woodruff, D. and Hopp, W. (1990) CONWIP: a pull alternative to kanban. International Journal of Production Research 28, 879-894&lt;/ref&gt;). In a [[Push-pull strategy|push system]], the production order is scheduled and the material is pushed into the [[production line]]. In a [[Push-pull strategy|pull system]], the start of each product assembly process is triggered by the completion of another at the end of production line. This pull-variant is known for its ease of implementation.

CONWIP is a kind of single-stage [[kanban]] system and is also a hybrid push-pull system. While Kanban systems maintain tighter control of system WIP through the individual cards at each workstation, CONWIP systems are easier to implement and adjust, since only one set of system cards is used to manage system WIP.&lt;ref&gt;Marek, Richard P. et al., Understanding the fundamentals of Kanban and CONWIP pull systems using simulation, Proceedings of the 2001 VCDFGter Simulation Conference [http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc01papers/122.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; CONWIP uses cards to control the number of [[Work in process|WIP]]s. For example, no part is allowed to enter the system without a card (authority). After a finished part is completed at the last [[workstation]], a card is transferred to the first workstation and a new part is pushed into the sequential process route. In their paper, Spearman et al. (1990) used a simulation to make a comparison among the CONWIP, kanban and push systems, and found that CONWIP systems can achieve a lower WIP level than kanban systems.

==Card control policy ==

In a CONWIP system, a card is shared by all kinds of products.  However, Duenyas (1994) proposed a dedicated card control policy in CONWIP and he stated that this policy could perform as a multiple chain closed queuing network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4492">{{planes of existence}}
'''Causal plane''' is a term used in [[Neo-Theosophy]], some contemporary [[Vedanta]], the [[New Age]], (especially some [[Mediumship|channelled]] communications), and sometimes [[Occultism]], to describe a high spiritual [[Plane (cosmology)|plane of existence]], i.e. ([[hyperplane]], which even the physical is). However there is great variation between the different definitions.

==Neo-theosophy==
The Neo-theosophy of [[Annie Besant]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]] replaced [[Blavatsky]]'s "Higher Manas" [[Septenary (Theosophy)|principle]] with the "Higher Mental", "Abstract Mind" (as opposed to Lower Mental or "Concrete Mind"), or Causal Body. The equivalent cosmic plane is the Causal Plane. A detailed description of the Causal Plane, along with the Causal Body, is provided by A. E. Powell, who has compiled information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

The Neo-theosphical concept of Causal Plane proved very influential both in India (via the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar branch of Theosophy]]) and in the [[New Age]], via [[Alice Bailey]].

==Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami==
[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] incorporates Theosophical ideas into the traditional Hindu Vedic [[cosmology]], when he describes three worlds of existence ([[trailokya|triloka]]) as ''Bhuloka'' or [[physical plane]], ''Antarloka'' or the [[subtle realm|subtle]] or [[astral plane]], and ''Sivaloka'' ("World of Siva") or the causal plane or Karanaloka, the world of the [[deity|Gods]] and highly developed [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s. About this latter he says

&lt;blockquote&gt;The causal plane is the world of light and blessedness, the highest of heavenly regions, extolled in the scriptures of all faiths. It is the foundation of existence, the source of visions, the point of conception, the apex of creation. The causal plane is the abode of Lord Siva and His entourage of Mahadevas and other highly evolved souls who exist in their own self-effulgent form—radiant bodies of [[centillion]]s of [[Quantum|quantum light particles]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further says that this region, present as the clear white light that illumines the mind, can be accessed through the three higher [[chakras]], the [[vishuddha]], [[ajna]] and [[sahasrara]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/dws/dws_mandala-09.html Dancing With Siva]'', pp.125-131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astral travel==
Although Neo-theosophy presents the sequence Physical-Astral-Mental-Causal, in the jargon of some [[astral projection|astral travelling]] teachings, the causal plane is the one just above the astral plane. According to the Astral Voyage website (see [http://www.astralvoyage.com/projection/Glossary.html glossary]) this is the region where [[Akashic Records|memories and karmic patterns]] are stored, and where a practitioner can access information regarding the past and future.

==Michael cosmology==
The complex metaphysics of the Channelled entity Michael includes a description of the universe in terms of seven planes. These are the Physical plane, the Astral plane, the Causal plane, the Akashic plane, the Mental plane, the Messianic plane, and the Buddhaic plane. Here the Causal plane is the third plane of creation, and its medium is concrete intellectual energy. In [[The Michael Teachings]], this is Michael's plane of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd Hoodwin, ''The 7 Planes of Existence,''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concerned Officers Movement Logo.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|Newsletter Logo of the Concerned Officers Movement.]]
The '''Concerned Officers Movement''' (COM) was an organization of mainly junior officers formed within the U.S. military in the early 1970s whose principal purpose was opposition to the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="EVW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1647C|title=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War, A Political, Social, and Military History, Second Edition 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very quickly, however, it also found itself fighting for [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights within the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Antiwar Officers See Retaliation|date=1970-10-23|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area by [[commissioned officers]] who were also [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam Veterans]],&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/6596/rec/38|title=Concerned Officers' Movement newsletter: GI Press Collection|website=content.wisconsinhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rapidly expanded throughout all branches and many bases of the U.S. military, ultimately playing an influential role in the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Franklin NYT 1970-09-27"&gt;{{cite news|last=Franklin|first=Ben|date=1970-09-27|title=Vietnam War Policy Denounced by 28 Armed Service Officers|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|The cite does not prove the assertion|date=September 2017}}

==Founding==
[[File:COM First Leaflet 14Mar1970.jpg|thumb|Concerned Officers Movement first leaflet issued for GI Rally for Peace and Justice in Washington, DC March 14, 1970]]COMs genesis sprang from the participation of Marine Captain Bob Brugger in the November 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|March on Washington]] against the Vietnam War. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' carried an article about Bob and his wife that caused his superior officers to enter an unsatisfactory mark for loyalty in his fitness report and generated supportive phone calls from other officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacPherson|first=Myra|date=1969-11-15|title=Marine Captain: Mobilization Marshal|work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmberg|first=David|date=1970-06-01|title=Officers Form Unit as Outlet for Dissent|work=The Evening Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brugger's opposition to "blind patriotism" and his stand against racism at home and in Vietnam had struck a chord with other officers who read the article.

Over several months a group of officers agreed to work together and on March 14, 1970, they participated as ''Officers' Resistance'' in a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] Rally for Peace and Justice in [[Washington, D.C.]] By the end of March 1970 they had changed their name to the '''Concerned Officers Movement'''.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"/&gt; Early members who signed the first published newsletter were LT Jim Crawford, USN, CPT Ed Fox, USA, CPT Gerry Giovaniello, USAR, LTJG Tono Hixon, USNR, LTJG Phil Lehman, USNR, LTJG Randy Thomas, USNR; CAPT Larry Wasser, USMC, and CPT Bob Gaines, USAR.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"/&gt; Other early members were 1LT Louis Font, a [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] honor graduate, who received extensive national media coverage for his stand against the war and CAPT Mike Mullen, USMCR who was one of the contacts on the organization's first leaflet (see image to right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charlton|first=Linda|date=1970-03-17|title=West Point Graduate Seeking Discharge Over Vietnam Issue|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COM's first newsletter, published in April 1970, described the organization's political views:

{{quote|The Concerned Officers' Movement was formed by a group of active duty and reserve officers who could no longer continue to be passive, unquestioning agents of military and national policies they found untenable.

Paramount in the program of COM is a fervent opposition to the continuing military effort in Vietnam. COM decries the military policies that turned an internal political struggle into a nation-destroying bloodbath. The application of American military power in Vietnam was as unnecessary as it was unworkable.

COM further abhors the military mentality that promotes absurd measures like the body count; that leads to the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent civilians; that destroys land and villages and calls it victory.}}

While stating they were "loyal, responsible military officers", they supported "a cease-fire and the rapid disengagement of American troops from [[Southeast Asia]]", opposed the "preponderant share of national resources devoted to the military", and called for the "free expression of dissenting opinion" within the military.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt;

==Media coverage and growth==
The fact that military officers had formed a group openly speaking out against the war and the U.S. military was unprecedented and quickly reached the national media. On June 3, 1970, ''[[The New York Times]]'' announced that the "antiwar movement has reached the United States military officers corps." "Calling themselves the Concerned Officers Movement, about 25 officers based in Washington, most of them Navy men, have banded together to provide a forum for what they say is growing disillusionment among their ranks with the Indochina war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1970-06-03|title=Military Officers Join Drive Against the War|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COM continued to grow and on September 26, 1970, 28 members representing about 250 others on active duty from the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Marines|Marine Corps]] held a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] to announce "their intention to speak against the war in Vietnam" and "to encourage other officers to express antiwar opinions". Font told the press, "I reject this war....I have asked myself time and again: 'When the law becomes a crime, consensus and conformity becomes a crime, am I to condone it?' My answer is no." Major Albert Braverman, a physician at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, stated that COM had active chapters at the Marine base at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], NC, at Navy and Marine bases in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], VA, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], FL and [[San Diego]], at Army bases at [[Fort Bragg]], NC, and [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], SC, at the Air Force base in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks, ND]], and in [[Iceland]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="Franklin NYT 1970-09-27" /&gt; They also read an open letter to Secretary of Defense [[Melvin Laird]] demanding an immediate withdrawal from the war written by LTJG John Kent, USN, an [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] graduate, all-American wrestler and jet fighter pilot, and signed by 29 officers of the [[San Diego]] chapter of COM ranging in rank from [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]].&lt;ref name="retaliation"&gt;{{cite news |last=Franklin |first=Ben |date=1970-10-23 |title=Antiwar Officers See Retaliation |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="COMLATimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sell |first=Ted |date=1970-10-26 |title=Navy Officers Unite to From Antiwar Group |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Kent_Letter_to_the_Secretary_of_Defense_25Sep1970.pdf|title=English: Letter written by LTJG John Kent and signed by 28 other officers to the Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird demanding an immediate withdrawal from the Vietnam War.|first=|last=JohnKent|date=25 September 1970|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COM carried out a variety of antiwar activities throughout 1970 and 1971. It published a newsletter, which by the fourth issue was called ''COMmon Sense'', distributing it throughout the armed services.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt; It bought newspaper ads calling for an immediate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, wrote leaflets, printed posters and held press conferences. COM's Norfolk Naval Base chapter paid for a billboard outside the base that read '''Peace Now''' &lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;

== Military retaliation ==

Initially, many COM members wanted to stay within the military and felt they had a right to express dissenting views. In fact, their third newsletter argued that responsible dissent "can and must be allowed to exist in the military, if it is to keep pace with the times in which we live." "We believe that such expressions of our convictions are within our rights, and that in expressing them, we are following our obligations as officers to defend the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]." The organization felt the armed forces were an insular and hidebound world and explored ways to establish the right of free speech for active duty servicemen, both officers and [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]].&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt;

The military, however, disagreed and in many cases reprimanded, discharged and transferred COM members soon after their participation became known. Within three weeks of their September 26, 1970 press conference many COM members were facing retaliation. One Navy doctor in the [[San Diego]] chapter was discharged on 48 hours' notice after making his membership known. Official military spokespeople blamed budget cutbacks or force reductions, but COM members were told privately they were being discharged due to their membership. ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted a Pentagon spokesman who denied the existence of a "purge" of antiwar officers, but then went on to admit the military did get concerned when these officers "go public". He argued that public statements "[d]raw the radicals to them like bees to honey", making them "duck soup for radicals" and raising "questions about the officers' reliability." Ironically, some members who did want to get out were forced to stay in the military against their will and given orders transferring them to remote military bases like [[Adak, Alaska]] or even [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="retaliation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kondracke|first=Morton|date=1970-07-13 |title=Anti-War Officers Fight Discharge |work=Washington Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakin|first=Jim |date=1970-11-19|title=Navy punishes anti-war advocates|work=San Diego Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cortright|first=David|date=2005|title=Soldiers In Revolt|url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt|location=Chicago, IL|publisher=Haymarket Books|page=109|isbn=1931859272|author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, COM had a high turnover rate as the military discharged or transferred its members.&lt;ref name="EVW"/&gt; This, combined with its focus on active duty officers, meant the national organization was relatively short-lived, tapering off considerably by the end of 1971.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"/&gt;

==Controversial activity==
In early 1971 COM created quite a stir by holding press conferences on both coasts calling for an investigation into the military's top brass for possible war crimes. Under the auspices of The National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam [[Citizens Commission of Inquiry|(Citizens Commission of Inquiry)]], COM held press conferences on January 12 in [[Washington, D.C.]] and January 20 in [[Los Angeles]] calling for an investigation into the "responsibility for war crimes of key military figures", including Generals [[William Westmoreland]] and [[Creighton Abrams]], and Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt]]. While formally they were only calling for an investigation, they presented evidence of war crimes and catastrophic environmental damage, leaving the impression they were accusing their own commanders of war crimes. The [[Washington, D.C.]] COM members involved were CPT Robert Master, USA, CPT Grier Merwin, USA, Fox, Font and LTJG Peter Dunkelberger, USN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|date=1971-01-13|title=Five Officers Say They Seek Formal War Crimes Inquiries|url=http://www.veteranscholar.com/docu21.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Los Angeles]] were LT Norman Banks, USAF, LTJG Ted Shallcross, USN, LT James Skelly, USN, and Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-01-21|title=4 More Officers Seek U.S. War Crimes Inquiry|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-01-21|title=Military Leader Inquiry Is Urged|work=Independent Press-Telegram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cortright|first=David|date=2005|title=Soldiers In Revolt |url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt|location=Chicago |publisher=Haymarket Books|page=110|isbn=1931859272|author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year COM members used the military's own practice of encouraging the wearing of uniforms to religious services to conduct antiwar demonstrations in uniform, a prohibited activity under military regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133401p.pdf], DoD Directive 1334.1, "Wearing of the Uniform".&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 1971, ignoring warnings from higher ups that their actions would be considered a political demonstration, COM organized a memorial service at [[Washington National Cathedral|Washington's National Cathedral]] involving more than 250 officers in uniform honoring all the war dead, on both sides of the war.&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Richard |date=1996 |title=The New Winter Soldiers:GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-new-winter-soldiers/9780813522425 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=89 |isbn=978-0-8135-2242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EVW" /&gt; On May 2, 45 officers and enlisted men from the [[San Diego]] Chapter wore their uniforms to a similar antiwar "religious" event in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] in Los Angeles led by a prominent antiwar Episcopal minister, [[George F. Regas|George Regas]].&lt;ref name="LibertyCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/1620/rec/1892|title=Liberty call (San Diego Concerned Officers Movement) :: GI Press Collection|website=content.wisconsinhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the men who participated later recalled in his memoir: "Thus, with one of our men playing the haunting lament on his bugle that is heard at military funerals, we marched with [a] coffin draped with the flags of the Viet Cong, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the United States."&lt;ref name="Skelly"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skelly |first=James |date=2017 |title=The Sarcophagus of Identity: Tribalism, Nationalism, and the Transcendence of the Self |location=Stuttgart |publisher=ibidem Verlag |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one was ever reprimanded or punished for these actions, probably because the military decided it would be better to ignore the whole thing and pretend it never happened.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt;

== The San Diego Chapter ==

The San Diego COM, located in the principal homeport of the Pacific Fleet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/port-san-diego/], Naval Base San Diego&lt;/ref&gt; may have been the most active chapter and was certainly the longest lasting, continuing actively until late 1973.&lt;ref name="LibertyCall1973"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/1625/rec/1891], Liberty Call, Concerned Military Newsletter 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Chapter was initiated by Kent and local antiwar activist Jeannie Boyle and formally founded in July 1970 by Kent, LT Harold Appel, USN, Skelly and Shallcross.&lt;ref name ="COMLATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/45211/rec/1889],
 San Diego COM Leaflet Announcing Formation&lt;/ref&gt; Very quickly it broadened its outreach to include enlisted men and women and by 1972 had changed its name to Concerned Military.&lt;ref name="LibertyCall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LibertyCall1973"/&gt; On May 15, 1971, which they called ''Armed Farces Day'', they hosted the touring [[Free The Army tour|FTA]] "political vaudeville" antiwar show, known to most G.I.'s as the "Fuck The Army" Show, featuring [[Jane Fonda]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Peter Boyle]], [[Dick Gregory]], and [[Country Joe McDonald]]. The show, held in the auditorium of [[San Diego High School]], was a tremendous success with a capacity crowd of over 2,400 enthusiastic sailors and marines, and contributed to the growth and reputation of the chapter.&lt;ref name="LibertyCall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"/&gt;

===Efforts to stop an aircraft carrier===

[[File:Connstellation Vote Poster.jpg|thumb|Poster used for the Constellation Vote]]

They also joined with other antiwar activists in major efforts to mobilize opposition to the departure for Vietnam of several aircraft carriers. The first of these projects attracted antiwar activists from all over California and was aimed at trying to keep the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']] from sailing. The project was initiated by a group called '''San Diego Nonviolent Action''', which united with COM to focus on the role of aircraft carriers. They had the initial goal of stopping the ''Constellation'' from returning to Vietnam through education and non-violent activity like a blockade or by preventing military personnel from getting to the naval base. Very quickly, this effort expanded into a multi-faceted campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Nonviolent_Action_Harbor_Project_Initial_Statement_April_1971.jpg], ''San Diego Nonviolent Action'' Anti-Aircraft Carrier Initial Statement; accessed December 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constellation Vote===
As veteran antiwar activists, including [[Joan Baez]] and [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]], became involved, Harris suggested organizing a citywide referendum on whether the Constellation should set sail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/dg760vz2991 Joan Baez Wearing Stay Home For Peace T-Shirt], Joan Baez Prior to Singing at a Constellation Vote Rally&lt;/ref&gt; This '''Constellation Vote''' became a major antiwar campaign over several months that led to a citywide straw vote in late September 1971 with 54,721 votes counted. Over 82% of voters elected to keep the ship home, including 73% of the military personnel who voted. While not a "real" vote, the impact on public opinion was appreciable.&lt;ref name="War Foes"&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-09-19 |title=WAR FOES FIGHTING CARRIER'S RETURN; San Diego Poll Being Taken on Constellation's Future|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-09-26|title=Protest Vote Fails To Bar the Sailing Of Carrier to Asia|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LibertyCall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/19335/rec/2] Constellation Vote Poster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/browse/the-connie-vote-the-uss-constellation-and-the-peace-movement-in-san-diego-1971 The Connie Vote: The USS Constellation and the Peace Movement in San Diego, 1971], The Bob Fitch Photography Archive at Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; Even an unsympathetic observer deemed the overall effort to stop the Constellation "an impressive campaign", and the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet was quoted as saying "never was there such a concerted effort to entice American servicemen from their posts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guttridge|first=Leonard|date=1992|title=Mutiny: A History of Naval Insurrection |url=https://www.usni.org/store/books/bluejacket-books/mutiny|location=Annapolis, MD|publisher=Naval Institute Press|pages=255–56|isbn=0870212818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable amount of research was conducted into the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare by Professor William Watson of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] who was then a visiting Professor of History at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/wbwatson/www/|title=MIT History|website=web.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in a widely distributed pamphlet that aircraft carriers had become weapons "used to crush popular uprisings and to bully the weaker and poorer countries of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10318752], ''Attack Carrier: The Constellation Papers'', September 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creative protest methods===
The involvement of large numbers of antiwar officers and enlisted men created significant debate in the traditionally pro-military town. It also permitted creative methods not normally available to other antiwar groups, such as the CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE banner frequently seen being towed over the city by recently retired navy flight instructor LT John Huyler, and the Constellation Vote stickers found everywhere on board the USS ''Constellation'', including in the captain's personal bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/cj188gr6022|title=Plane flying over San Diego with banner "CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE"|last=Fitch|first=Bob|date=1971|quote=John Huyler flying with banner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/qn860wq8461 Constellation Vote Logo], Constellation Vote Logo Used on Stickers and Flyers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-598566010/praxis-underground-newspaper-v1-no7-october-6#fullscreen Praxis Underground Newspaper V.1 No.7, October 6, 1971 p.9], "Stay Home For Peace Stickers" Land GI in Brig&lt;/ref&gt; Bathroom stickers weren't the only complication the Captain had to deal with. Over 1,300 of the ship's sailors signed a petition requesting the [[Free The Army tour|FTA]] Show be allowed onboard. The captain refused this request but then got himself in hot water by intercepting and destroying 2,500 pieces of U.S. mail sent by antiwar activists to crewmembers. Faced with a possible court of inquiry and health problems, the captain was removed from command before the ship sailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-06-07 |title=Inquiry Asked in Navy Antiwar Material Case|work=The San Diego Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="War Foes"/&gt;

===Connie 9===
When the ''Constellation'' actually did sail for Vietnam, no visible blockade occurred but nine of its crew publicly refused to go and took sanctuary in a local Catholic church, [https://www.ctksandiego.org Christ the King], with the support of COM members and other activists. The "Connie 9" as they were quickly dubbed, were soon arrested in an early morning raid by [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] and flown back to the ship, but within weeks were honorably discharged from the navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-10-03 |title=9 Constellation Sailors Seized, Flown to Ship|work=The San Diego Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-12-08 |title='We've Won,' 8 Sailors Say on Discharge|work=The San Diego Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitty Litter"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/98297/rec/12], Kitty Litter (USS Kitty Hawk Newsletter) 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This action led to other [[Stop Our Ship (SOS)]] campaigns in [[San Diego]] and other California ports in a wider effort to prevent navy ships from heading to Southeast Asia.

==Significance==
At its height, COM had as many as 28 chapters in all the military branches and has been estimated to have "had approximately 3,000 members, including many supporters from the enlisted ranks." At one point it even had a chapter in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]].&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EVW" /&gt; It had no formal leadership, although various people stepped forward at different times to play central roles.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} COM did not attract the media attention as dramatically as its more well-known partner and ally, [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]], but it played a key and underappreciated role in the antiwar movement of the early 1970s. The fact that officers not only resisted the war, but spoke out publicly and formed a significant organization, speaks to the depth of the anti-Vietnam War and anti-U.S. military sentiment in the U.S. at the time.

The '''contrast ratio''' is a property of a display system, defined as the [[ratio]] of the [[luminance]] of the brightest color (white) to that of the darkest color (black) that the system is capable of producing. A high contrast ratio is a desired aspect of any display. It has similarities with [[dynamic range]].

There is no official, standardized way to measure contrast ratio for a system or its parts, nor is there a standard for defining "Contrast Ratio" that is accepted by any standards organization so ratings provided by different manufacturers of display devices are not necessarily comparable to each other due to differences in method of measurement, operation, and unstated variables.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Powell. [http://www.projectorcentral.com/contrast_ratios.htm Let's Ignore Contrast Specs]. March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manufacturers have traditionally favored measurement methods that isolate the device from the system, whereas other designers have more often taken the effect of the room into account. An ideal room would absorb all the light reflecting from a [[projection screen]] or emitted by a [[cathode ray tube]], and the only light seen in the room would come from the display device. With such a room, the contrast ratio of the [[image]] would be the same as the contrast ratio of the [[display device|device]]. Real rooms reflect some of the light back to the displayed image, lowering the contrast ratio seen in the image.

'''Static contrast ratio''' is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest color the system is capable of producing simultaneously at any instant of time, while '''dynamic contrast ratio''' is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest color the system is capable of producing over time (while the picture is moving). Moving from a system that displays a static motionless image to a system that displays a dynamic, changing picture slightly complicates the definition of the contrast ratio, due to the need to take into account the extra temporal dimension to the measuring process.

== Methods of measurement ==

Many display devices favor the use of the ''full on/full off'' method of measurement, as it cancels out the effect of the room and results in an ideal ratio. Equal proportions of light reflect from the display to the room and back in both "black" and "white" measurements, as long as the room stays the same. This will inflate the light levels of both  measurements proportionally, leaving the black to white luminance ratio unaffected.

Some manufacturers have gone as far as using different device parameters for the three tests, even further inflating the calculated contrast ratio. With [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projectors, one method to do this is to enable the clear sector of the color filter wheel for the ''"on"'' part and disable it for the ''"off"'' part&lt;ref name=practical&gt;''www.practical-home-theater-guide.com''. [http://www.practical-home-theater-guide.com/contrast-ratio.html Extensive coverage of practical contrast ratio]&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice is rather dubious, as it will be impossible to reproduce such contrast ratios with any useful image content.

Another measure is the ''[[ANSI]] contrast'', in which the measurement is done with a checker board patterned test image where the black and white luminosity values are measured simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carltonbale.com/the-truth-about-inflated-hdtv-contrast-ratios The Truth About Inflated HDTV Contrast Ratios]. August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a more realistic measure of system capability, but includes the potential of including the effects of the room into the measurement, if the test is not performed in a room that is close to ideal.

It is useful to note that the ''full on/full off'' method effectively measures the dynamic contrast ratio of a display, while the ''ANSI contrast'' measures the static contrast ratio.

== Dynamic contrast (DC) ==
A notable recent development{{When|date=July 2017}} in LCD technology is '''dynamic contrast''' (DC), also called '''advanced contrast ratio''' (ACR) and various other designations. When there is a need to display a dark image, a display that supports dynamic contrast underpowers the backlight lamp (or decreases the aperture of the projector's lens using an iris), but proportionately amplifies the transmission through the LCD panel; this gives the benefit of realizing the potential static contrast ratio of the LCD panel in dark scenes when the image is watched in a dark room. The drawback is that if a dark scene contains small areas of superbright light, the resulting image will be over exposed.

The trick for the display is to determine how much of the highlights may be unnoticeably blown out in a given image under the given ambient lighting conditions.

Brightness, as it is most often used in marketing literature, refers to the emitted luminous intensity on screen, measured in [[candela per square metre]] (cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The higher the number, the brighter the screen.

It is also common to market only the dynamic contrast ratio capability of a display (when it is better than its static contrast ratio only on paper), which should not be directly compared to the static contrast ratio. A plasma display with a 4,000,000:1 static contrast ratio will show superior contrast to an LCD (with LED or CCFL backlight) with 30,000,000:1 dynamic and 20,000:1 static contrast ratio when the input signal contains a full range of brightnesses from 0 to 100% simultaneously. They will, however, be on par when input signal ranges only from 0 to 20% brightness.

== Contrast ratio in a real room ==
In marketing literature, contrast ratios for emissive (as opposed to reflective) displays are always measured under the optimum condition of a room in total darkness. In typical viewing situations, the contrast ratio is significantly lower due to the reflection of light from the surface of the display, making it harder to distinguish between different devices with very high contrast ratios.&lt;ref name=realenv&gt;''www.poynton.com''. [http://www.poynton.com/notes/Timo/Weber_and_contrast_ratio.html On practical contrast ratios in real environments]&lt;/ref&gt; How much the room light reduces the contrast ratio depends on the [[luminance]] of the display, as well as the amount of light reflecting off the display.&lt;ref&gt;HomeTheaterMag.com - [http://blog.hometheatermag.com/geoffreymorrison/111705contrast/ Contrast Ratio – The Useless Statistic]&lt;/ref&gt;

A clean print at a typical [[movie theater]] may have a contrast ratio of 500:1,&lt;ref name=dalite&gt;''www.da-lite.com''. [http://www.da-lite.com/education/angles_of_view.php?action=details&amp;issueid=56 Contrast - From Dark to Light]. Angles of View vol. III.&lt;/ref&gt; a transmissive digital projector is around 200:1, and a reflective digital projector (i.e. DLP) is around 500:1 under nearly ideal circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Evan|title=Let's Ignore Contrast Specs|url=http://www.projectorcentral.com/contrast_ratios.htm?page=Projector-Central-Measurements|website=ProjectorCentral.com|accessdate=11 March 2016|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern computer LCD monitor is typically at 1000:1,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|title=Apple Thunderbolt Display|url=https://www.apple.com/displays/specs.html|publisher=Apple|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TVs might be over 4000:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Demers|first1=Cedric|title=Contrast Ratio of 2015 TVs|url=http://www.rtings.com/info/contrast-ratio-tvs|website=rtings.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic contrast ratio is usually measured at factory with two panels (one versus another) of the same model as each panel will have an inherent dark and light (hot) spot. Static is usually measured with the same screen showing half screen full bright vs half screen full dark. This usually results in a lower ratio as brightness will creep into the dark area of the screen thus giving a higher luminance.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

{{Selfref|For geographical coordinates on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates]].}} --&gt;
[[File:3D Spherical.svg|thumb|300px|right|The [[spherical coordinate system]] is commonly used in ''physics''. It assigns three numbers (known as coordinates) to every point in [[Euclidean space]]: radial distance ''r'', polar angle ''&amp;theta;'' ([[theta]]), and azimuthal angle ''&amp;phi;'' ([[phi]]). The symbol ''&amp;rho;'' ([[rho]]) is often used instead of ''r''.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''coordinate system''' is a system that uses one or more [[number]]s, or '''coordinates''', to uniquely determine the position of the [[Point (geometry)|points]] or other geometric elements on a [[manifold]] such as [[Euclidean space]].&lt;ref&gt;Woods p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Coordinate System|urlname=CoordinateSystem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered [[tuple]] and sometimes by a letter, as in "the ''x''-coordinate". The coordinates are taken to be [[real number]]s in [[elementary mathematics]], but may be [[complex number]]s or elements of a more abstract system such as a [[commutative ring]]. The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and ''vice versa''; this is the basis of [[analytic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Coordinates|urlname=Coordinates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common coordinate systems==

===Number line===
{{main|Number line}}
{{anchor|Number line}} &lt;!-- [[Negative distance]] redirects here. I considered the main but this is better. Courtesy note per [[WP:SPECIFICLINK]]. --&gt;
The simplest example of a coordinate system is the identification of points on a line with real numbers using the ''number line''. In this system, an arbitrary point ''O'' (the ''origin'') is chosen on a given line. The coordinate of a point ''P'' is defined as the signed distance from ''O'' to ''P'', where the signed distance is the distance taken as positive or negative depending on which side of the line ''P'' lies. Each point is given a unique coordinate and each real number is the coordinate of a unique point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James B. | last2 = Redlin | first2 = Lothar | last3=Watson | first3=Saleem | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=College Algebra | publisher=[[Brooks Cole]]  | year=2008 | edition = 5th | pages=13&amp;ndash;19 | isbn=0-495-56521-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Number-line.svg|center|The number line]]

===Cartesian coordinate system===
{{main|Cartesian coordinate system}}
[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in the plane.]]
The prototypical example of a coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system. In the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], two [[perpendicular]] lines are chosen and the coordinates of a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines. 
[[File:Rectangular coordinates.svg|left|thumb|250px]]
In three dimensions, three mutually orthogonal planes are chosen and the three coordinates of a point are the signed distances to each of the planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Moon P, Spencer DE |year=1988 |chapter=Rectangular Coordinates (x, y, z) |title=Field Theory Handbook, Including Coordinate Systems, Differential Equations, and Their Solutions |edition=corrected 2nd, 3rd print |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |pages=9–11 (Table 1.01) |isbn=978-0-387-18430-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be generalized to create ''n'' coordinates for any point in  ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

Depending on the direction and order of the coordinate axes, the three-dimensional system may be a [[right-hand rule|right-handed]] or a left-handed system.  This is one of many coordinate systems.
{{Clear}}

===Polar coordinate system===
{{main|Polar coordinate system}}
Another common coordinate system for the plane is the ''polar coordinate system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Finney|first=Ross|author2=George Thomas |author3=Franklin Demana |author4=Bert Waits |title=Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic|edition=Single Variable Version|date=June 1994|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.|isbn=0-201-55478-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A point is chosen as the ''pole'' and a ray from this point is taken as the ''polar axis''. For a given angle θ, there is a single line through the pole whose angle with the polar axis is θ (measured counterclockwise from the axis to the line). Then there is a unique point on this line whose signed distance from the origin is ''r'' for given number ''r''. For a given pair of coordinates (''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ) there is a single point, but any point is represented by many pairs of coordinates. For example, (''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ), (''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ+2π) and (−''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ+π) are all polar coordinates for the same point. The pole is represented by (0, θ) for any value of θ. 
{{Clear}}

===Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems===
{{main|Cylindrical coordinate system|Spherical coordinate system}}
There are two common methods for extending the polar coordinate system to three dimensions. In the '''cylindrical coordinate system''', a ''z''-coordinate with the same meaning as in Cartesian coordinates is added to the ''r'' and ''θ'' polar coordinates giving a triple (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'',&amp;nbsp;''z'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margenau |first1=Henry |authorlink1=Henry Margenau |last2=Murphy |first2=George M. |year=1956 |title=The Mathematics of Physics and Chemistry |publisher=D. van Nostrand |location=New York City |page=178 |lccn=55010911 |isbn=9780882754239 |oclc=3017486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spherical coordinates take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') to polar coordinates (''ρ'',&amp;nbsp;''φ'') giving a triple (''ρ'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'',&amp;nbsp;''φ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Philip M. Morse|Morse PM]], [[Herman Feshbach|Feshbach H]] | year = 1953 | title = Methods of Theoretical Physics, Part I | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 0-07-043316-X | pages = 658 | lccn = 52011515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homogeneous coordinate system===
{{main|Homogeneous coordinates}}
A point in the plane may be represented in ''homogeneous coordinates'' by a triple (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') where ''x''/''z'' and ''y''/''z'' are the Cartesian coordinates of the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Algebraical Geometry|first=Alfred Clement|last=Jones
|publisher=Clarendon|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This introduces an "extra" coordinate since only two are needed to specify a point on the plane, but this system is useful in that it represents any point on the [[projective plane]] without the use of [[infinity]]. In general, a homogeneous coordinate system is one where  only the ratios of the coordinates are significant and not the actual values.

===Other commonly used systems===
Some other common coordinate systems are the following:
* [[Curvilinear coordinates]] are a generalization of coordinate systems generally; the system is based on the intersection of curves.
** [[Orthogonal coordinates]]: [[coordinate surfaces]] meet at right angles
** [[Skew coordinates]]: [[coordinate surfaces]] are not orthogonal
* The [[Log-polar coordinates|log-polar coordinate system]] represents a point in the plane by the logarithm of the distance from the origin and an angle measured from a reference line intersecting the origin.
* [[Plücker coordinates]] are a way of representing lines in 3D Euclidean space using a six-tuple of numbers as [[homogeneous coordinates]].
* [[Generalized coordinates]] are used in the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] treatment of mechanics.
* [[Canonical coordinates]] are used in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] treatment of mechanics.
* [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|Barycentric coordinates]] as used for [[ternary plot]]s and more generally in the analysis of [[triangle]]s.
* [[Trilinear coordinates]] are used in the context of triangles.

There are ways of describing curves without coordinates, using [[intrinsic equation]]s that use invariant quantities such as [[curvature]] and [[arc length]]. These include:
*The [[Whewell equation]] relates arc length and the [[tangential angle]].
*The [[Cesàro equation]] relates arc length and curvature.

==Coordinates of geometric objects==
Coordinates systems are often used to specify the position of a point, but they may also be used to specify the position of more complex figures such as lines, planes, circles or spheres. For example, [[Plücker coordinates]] are used to determine the position of a line in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Hodge
  | first = W. V. D.

  | origyear = 1947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is a need, the type of figure being described is used to distinguish the type of coordinate system, for example the term ''[[line coordinates]]'' is used for any coordinate system that specifies the position of a line.

It may occur that systems of coordinates for two different sets of geometric figures are equivalent in terms of their analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in a case like this are said to be ''dualistic''. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the ''principle of [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Woods p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformations==
{{See also|Active and passive transformation}}
{{main|List of common coordinate transformations}}
Because there are often many different possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, it is important to understand how they are related. Such relations are described by ''coordinate transformations'' which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') and polar coordinates (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'') have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive ''x'' axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;cos''θ'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;sin''θ''.

With every [[bijection]] from the space to itself two coordinate transformations can be associated:
* such that the new coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the old coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the inverse of those for the coordinate transformation)
* such that the old coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the new coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the same as those for the coordinate transformation)

For example, in [[Dimension|1D]], if the mapping is a translation of 3 to the right, the first moves the origin from 0 to 3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 less, while the second moves the origin from 0 to −3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 more.

{{distinguish-redirect|Coordinate line|Line coordinates}}
{{distinguish-redirect|Coordinate plane|Plane coordinates}}

In two dimensions, if one of the coordinates in a point coordinate system is held constant and the other coordinate is allowed to vary, then the resulting curve is called a '''coordinate curve'''. In the Cartesian coordinate system the coordinate curves are, in fact, [[straight line]]s, thus '''coordinate lines'''. Specifically, they are the lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes. For other coordinate systems the coordinates curves may be general curves. For example, the coordinate curves in polar coordinates obtained by holding ''r'' constant are the circles with center at the origin. Coordinates systems for Euclidean space other than the Cartesian coordinate system are called [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear coordinate systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods for Engineers and Scientists |volume=2|first=K. T.|last=Tang|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=3-540-30268-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure does not always make sense, for example there are no coordinate curves in a [[homogeneous coordinate system]].

[[File:Parabolic coordinates 3D.png|thumb|left|190px|Coordinate surfaces of the three-dimensional paraboloidal coordinates.]]
In three-dimensional space, if one coordinate is held constant and the other two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a '''coordinate surface'''. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding ρ constant in the [[spherical coordinate system]] are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of '''coordinate planes'''.

Similarly, '''coordinate hypersurfaces''' are the {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional spaces resulting from fixing a single coordinate of an ''n''-dimensional coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;

|first=Vladimir D.|last=Liseikin|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=3-540-34235-4|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordinate maps==
{{main|Coordinate map}}
{{further|Manifold}}
The concept of a ''coordinate map'', or ''coordinate chart'' is central to the theory of manifolds. A coordinate map is essentially a coordinate system for a subset of a given space with the property that each point has exactly one set of coordinates. More precisely, a coordinate map is a [[homeomorphism]] from an open subset of a space ''X'' to an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. (2000) ''Topology''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-181629-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often not possible to provide one consistent coordinate system for an entire space. In this case, a collection of coordinate maps are put together to form an [[atlas (topology)|atlas]] covering the space. A space equipped with such an atlas is called a ''manifold'' and additional structure can be defined on a manifold if the structure is consistent where the coordinate maps overlap. For example, a [[differentiable manifold]] is a manifold where the change of coordinates from one coordinate map to another is always a differentiable function.

==Orientation-based coordinates==
In [[geometry]] and [[kinematics]], coordinate systems are used not only to describe the (linear) position of points, but also to describe the [[orientation (geometry)|angular position]] of axes, planes, and [[rigid bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems |author1=Hanspeter Schaub |author2=John L. Junkins |chapter=Rigid body kinematics |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXvESNWrfpUC&amp;pg=PA71 |isbn=1-56347-563-4 |year=2003 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, the orientation of a second (typically referred to as "local") coordinate system, fixed to the node, is defined based on the first (typically referred to as "global" or "world" coordinate system). For instance, the orientation of a rigid body can be represented by an orientation [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], which includes, in its three columns, the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of three points. These points are used to define the orientation of the axes of the local system; they are the tips of three [[unit vectors]] aligned with those axes.

'''Counter-mapping''' refers to efforts to [[map]] "against dominant power structures, to further seemingly progressive goals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=D.L|author2=Schroeder, R.A.|title=Dilemmas of Counter-Mapping: Community Resources in Tanzania|journal=Development and Change|year=2002|volume=33|pages=79–100|doi=10.1111/1467-7660.00241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Nancy Peluso&lt;ref name="Peluso"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peluso|first=N.L|title=Whose Woods are These? Counter-Mapping Forest Territories in Kalimantan, Indonesia|journal=Antipode|year=1995|volume=27|series=4|pages=383–406|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1995.tb00286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 to describe the commissioning of maps by forest users in [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], as a means of contesting state maps of forest areas that typically undermined [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] interests. The resultant counter-hegemonic maps had the ability to strengthen forest users' resource claims.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; There are numerous expressions closely related to counter-mapping: ethnocartography, alternative cartography, mapping-back, counter-hegemonic mapping, and public participatory mapping.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; Moreover, the terms: [[critical cartography]], subversive cartography, bio-regional mapping, and remapping are sometimes used interchangeably with counter-mapping, but in practice encompass much more.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;

Whilst counter-mapping still primarily refers to indigenous cartographic efforts, it is increasingly being applied to non-indigenous [[map]]ping initiatives in economically developed countries.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; Such counter-mapping efforts have been facilitated by processes of [[neoliberalism]],&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryan|first=J|title=Walking the Line: Participatory Mapping Indigenous Rights, and Neoliberalism|journal=Geoforum|year=2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=40–50|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and technological [[democratisation]].&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; Examples of counter-mapping include attempts to demarcate and protect traditional territories, community mapping, [[PPGIS|Public Participatory Geographical Information Systems]], and [[map]]ping by a relatively weak state to counter the resource claims of a stronger state.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=K|title=On the Politics and Possibilities of Participatory Mapping and GIS: Using Spatial Technologies to Study Common Property and Land Use Change Among Pastoralists in Central Tibet|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=229–252|doi=10.1177/1474474008101518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of counter-maps to advocate policy change in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] manner led commentators to affirm that counter-mapping should be viewed as a tool of [[governance]].&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

Despite its emancipatory potential, counter-mapping has not gone without criticism. There is a tendency for counter-mapping efforts to overlook the knowledge of women, minorities, and other vulnerable, disenfranchised groups.&lt;ref name="Rocheleau"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rocheleau|first=D.B|author2=Edmunds, D|title=Women, Men and Trees: Gender, Power and Property in Forest and Agrarian Landscapes.|journal=World Development|year=1997|volume=25|series=8|pages=1351–1371|doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(97)00036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, counter-mapping is only empowering for a small subset of society, whilst others become further marginalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=B.H|title=Community Participation and Geographic Information Systems|journal=The Professional Geographer|year=2004|volume=56|series=2|pages=315–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Nancy Peluso, professor of forest policy, coined the term 'counter-mapping' in 1995, having examined the implementation of two forest [[map]]ping strategies in [[Kalimantan]]. One set of maps belonged to state forest managers, and the [[international financial institutions]] that supported them, such as the [[World Bank]]. This strategy recognised mapping as a means of protecting local claims to territory and resources to a government that had previously ignored them.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The other set of maps had been created by Indonesian [[NGOs]], who often contract international experts to assist with mapping village territories.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The goal of the second set of maps was to co-opt the cartographic conventions of the Indonesian state, to legitimise the claims by the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] people, indigenous to Kalimantan, to the rights to forest use.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;  Counter-mappers in Kalimantan have acquired [[GIS]] technologies, satellite technology, and computerised [[resource management]] tools, consequently  making the Indonesian state vulnerable to counter-maps.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; As such, counter-mapping strategies in Kalimantan have led to successful community action to block, and protest against, oil palm plantations and logging concessions imposed by the central government.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt;

It must, however, be recognised that counter-mapping projects existed long before coinage of the term.&lt;ref name="Rundstrom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rundstrom|first=R|title=Counter-Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=314–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-maps are rooted in map art practices that date to the early 20th century; in the [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] movement of the 1960s; in indigenous and bioregional mapping; and parish mapping.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=Rethinking the Power of Maps|year=2010|publisher=Guilford Press|location=London |author2=Fels, J. |author3=Krygier, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parish Maps Project ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Parish Map.jpg|thumb|right|text-top|border|alt=Salle parish map.|Salle parish map.]] --&gt;In 1985, the charity [[Common Ground (United Kingdom)|Common Ground]] launched the [[Parish Maps Project]], a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] initiative encouraging local people to map elements of the environment valued by their [[parish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=A|title=Holding Your Ground: An Action Guide to Local Conservation|year=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|author2=Clifford, S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more than 2,500 English parishes have made such maps.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; Parish mapping projects aim to put every local person in an 'expert' role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aberley|first=D|title=Boundaries of Home: Mapping for Local Empowerment|year=1993|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=S|title=From Place to Place: Maps and Parish Maps|year=1996|publisher=Common Ground|location=London|pages=3–7|editor=Clifford, S. |editor2=King, A.|chapter=Places, People, and Parish Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt; exemplifies this notion, affirming: "making a parish map is about creating a community expression of values, and about beginning to assert ideas for involvement. It is about taking the place in your own hands". The final map product is typically an artistic artefact, usually painted, and often displayed in village halls or schools.&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt;  By questioning the biases of cartographic conventions and challenging predominant power effects of mapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=L.M|author2=Hazen, H.D|title=Power of Maps: (Counter) Mapping for Conservation|journal=ACME|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1|pages=99–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parish Maps Project is an early example of what Peluso&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; went on to term 'counter-mapping'

== Development ==

=== Neoliberalism ===
The development of counter-mapping can be situated within the [[neoliberal]] political-economic restructuring of the state.&lt;ref name=Leszcynski /&gt; Prior to the 1960s, equipping a map-making enterprise was chiefly the duty of a single agency, funded by the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodchild|first=M,F|title=Virtual Geographic Environments as Collective Constructions|url=http://www.iseis.cuhk.edu.hk/downloads/vge/44.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, maps have conventionally been the products of privileged knowledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica|year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, processes of [[neoliberalism]], predominantly since the late 1970s, have reconfigured the state's role in the cartographic project.&lt;ref name=Bryan /&gt; Neoliberalism denotes an emphasis on markets and minimal states, whereby individual choice is perceived to have replaced the mass-production of commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larner|first=W|title=Neoliberalism|year=2009|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|pages=374–378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that citizens are now performing cartographic functions that were once exclusively state-controlled can be partially explained through a shift from "roll-back neoliberalism", in which the state dismantled some of its functions, to "roll-out neoliberalism", in which new modes of operating have been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=L|author2=Tickell,A|title=Neoliberalizing Space|journal=Antipode|year=2002|volume=34|pages=380–404|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brief, the state can be seen to have "hollowed out" and delegated some of its [[map]]ping power to citizens.&lt;ref name="Jessop"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=H|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Counter-mapping as Neoliberal Governmentality ====
[[Governmentality]] refers to a particular form of state power that is exercised when citizens self-discipline by acquiescing to state knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=M|author2=Knopp, L|title=Places and Polygons? Governmentality, Scale, and the Census in the Gay and Lesbian Atlas|year=2006|journal=Population, Space and Place|volume=12|pages=223–242|doi=10.1002/psp.410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[cartography]] has been a fundamental governmentality strategy,&lt;ref name="Crampton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping: A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technology of power, used for surveillance and control.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=J|title=Theorizing the State in Environmental Governance|journal=Review of International Political Economy|year=2006|volume=14|issue=1|pages=176–194|doi=10.1080/09692290601081244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competing claimants and boundaries made no appearance on state-led maps.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; This links to [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=M|title=Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings:1972-1977|year=1988|publisher=Randon House|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; notion of "subjugated knowledges" - ones that did not rise to the top, or were disqualified.&lt;ref name=Crampton /&gt; However, through neoliberalising processes, the state has retracted from performing some of its cartographic functions.&lt;ref name="Leszcynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leszcynski|first=A|title=Situating the Geoweb in Political Economy|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2011|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, rather than being passive recipients of top-down map distribution, people now have the opportunity to claim sovereignty over the mapping process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=M|author2=Perkins, P|title=Reclaiming the Map: British Geography and Ambivalent cartographic Practice|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2008|volume=40|issue=6|pages=|doi=10.1068/a4172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this new regime of neoliberal cartographic governmentality the "insurrection of subjugated knowledges" occurs,&lt;ref name=Foucault /&gt; as counter-mapping initiatives incorporate previously marginalised voices.

=== Technological democratisation? ===
In response to technological change, predominantly since the 1980s, cartography has increasingly been democratised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rood|first=J |author2=Ormeling, F. |author3=van Elzakker, C|title=An Agenda for Democratising Cartographic Visualisation|journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=38–41|doi=10.1080/002919501300061427}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide availability of high-quality location information has enabled mass-market cartography based on [[Global Positioning System]] receivers, home computers, and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|author2=Weber, P|title=OpenStreetMap: User-Generated Street Maps|journal=Pervasive Computing|year=2008|volume=1536|pages=12–18|doi=10.1109/mprv.2008.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that civilians are using technologies which were once elitist led Brosius ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosius|first=P.J|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London |author2=Tsing, A.L. |author3=Zerner, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assert that counter-mapping involves "stealing the master's tools". Nevertheless, numerous early counter-mapping projects successfully utilised manual techniques, and many still use them. For instance, in recent years, the use of simple sketch mapping approaches has been revitalised, whereby maps are made on the ground, using natural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=P|title=Geomatics: Who Needs it?|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of scale model constructions and felt boards, as means of representing cartographic claims of different groups, have become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=Rocheleau /&gt; Consequently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; assert that counter-mappers can "make gateau out of technological crumbs".

==== Public Participation Geographical Information Systems ====
In recent years, [[Public Participation Geographical Information Systems]] (PPGIS) have attempted to take the power of the map out of the hands of the cartographic elite, putting it into the hands of the people. For instance, Kyem&lt;ref name="Kyem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kyem|first=K|title=Promoting Local Community Participation in Forest Management Through the Application of a Geographical Information System: A PPGIS Experience from Southern Ghana|url=http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/varenius/ppgis/papers/kyem/kyem.html|accessdate=2011|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed a PPGIS method termed Exploratory Strategy for Collaboration, Management, Allocation, and Planning (ESCMAP). The method sought to integrate the concerns and experiences of three rural communities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana into official [[forest management]] practices.&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; Kyem&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; concluded that, notwithstanding  the potential of PPGIS, it is possible that the majority of the rich and powerful people in the area would object to some of the participatory uses of [[GIS]]. For example, loggers in Ghana affirmed that the PPGIS procedures were too open and democratic.&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; Thus, despite its democratising potential, there are barriers to its implementation. More recently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al''.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  disputed the notion of PPGIS entirely, affirming that it is "scarcely [[GIS]], intensely hegemonic, hardly public, and anything but participatory".

== Counter-mapping as governance ==
[[Governance]] makes problematic state-centric notions of regulation, recognising that there has been a shift to power operating across several [[spatial scales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridge|first=G|title=A Companion to Environmental Geography|year=2009|author2=Perreault, T|editor=Castree, N.M |editor2=Demeritt, D. |editor3=Liverman, D. |editor4=Rhoads, B|pages=475–497|chapter=Environmental Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, counter-mapping complicates state distribution of [[cartography]], advocating [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] participatory mapping projects (see [[GIS and environmental governance]]). Counter-mapping initiatives, often without state assistance, attempt to exert power. As such, counter-mapping conforms to [[Bob Jessop|Jessop]]'s&lt;ref name=Jessop /&gt; notion of "governance without government". Another characteristic of governance is its "purposeful effort to steer, control or manage sectors or facets of society" towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kooiman|first=J|title=Modern Governance. New Government-Society Interactions|year=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as maps exude power and authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colchester|first=M|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London|pages=271–304|editor=Brosius, P.J. |editor2=Tsing, A.L. |editor3=Zerner, C|chapter=Maps, Power, and the Defense of Territory: The Upper Mazarini Land Claim in Guyana}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are a trusted medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=B|title=West with the Night|year=1983|publisher=North Point Press|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability to 'steer' society in a particular direction. In brief, [[cartography]], once the tool of kings and governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=The Power of Maps|year=1992|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now being used as a tool of governance - to advocate policy change from the [[grassroots]].&lt;ref name="Alcorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcorn|first=J.B|title=Borders, Rules and Governance: Mapping to Catalyse Changes in Policy and Management|year=2000|publisher=Gatekeeper Series|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental sphere is one context in which counter-mapping has been utilised as a governance tool.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

=== Counter-mapping as environmental governance ===
In contrast to expert knowledges, lay knowledges are increasingly valuable to decision-makers, in part due to the scientific uncertainty surrounding environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Taylor Francis|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Participatory]] counter-mapping projects are an effective means of incorporating lay knowledges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narayan|first=P|title=Empowerment through Participation: How Effective is this Approach?|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2003|volume=38|issue=25|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; into issues surrounding [[environmental governance]]. For instance, counter-maps depicting traditional use of areas now protected for biodiversity have been used to allow resource use, or to promote public debate about the issue, rather than forcing relocation.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt; For example, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] used the results of counter-mapping to advocate for the reclassification of several strictly protected areas into Indonesian national parks, including Kayan Mentarang and Gunung Lorentz.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt; The success of such counter-mapping efforts led Alcorn&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;  to affirm that [[governance]] ([[grassroots]] mapping projects), rather than government ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]] map distribution), offers the best hope for good [[natural resource management]]. In short, it can be seen that "maps are powerful political tools in ecological and governance discussions".&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

== Types of counter-mapping ==
Numerous counter-mapping types exist, for instance: protest maps, map art, counter-mapping for conservation, and [[PPGIS]]. In order to emphasise the wide scope of what has come to be known as counter-mapping, three contrasting counter-mapping examples are elucidated in this section: indigenous counter-mapping, community mapping, and state counter-mapping, respectively.

=== Indigenous counter-mapping ===
Counter-mapping has been undertaken most in the Third World.&lt;ref name="perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|title=Community Mapping|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127–137|doi=10.1179/000870407x213440}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous peoples]] are increasingly turning to [[participatory]] mapping, appropriating both the state's techniques and manner of representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wainwright|first=J|author2=Bryan, J|title=Cartography, Territory, Property: Postcolonial Reflections on Indigenous Counter-Mapping in Nicaragua and Belize|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=153–187|doi=10.1177/1474474008101515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-mapping is a tool for indigenous identity-building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J.J|title=Naming the Land: San Countermapping in Namibia's West Caprivi|journal=Geoforum|year=2008|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1766–1775|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for bolstering the legitimacy of customary resource claims.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The success of counter-mapping in realising indigenous claims can be seen through Nietschmann's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neitschmann|first=B|title=Defending the Misiko Reefs with Maps and GIS: Mapping with Sail, Scuba and Satellite|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; assertion:
{{quote box |quote = ''More indigenous territory has been claimed by maps than by guns. And more Indigenous territory can be reclaimed and defended by maps than by guns.''
|align  = left
|bgcolor =#FFF8E7
 |quoted = 1
}}
{{clear}}

==== Creation of Nunavut ====
The power of indigenous counter-mapping can be exemplified through the creation of [[Nunavut]]. In 1967, [[Frank Arthur Calder]] and the Nisaga'a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the [[Province of British Columbia]] for a declaration that [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating [[treaties]] with the people who had not signed them.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; As a first step, the [[Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]] studied [[Inuit]] land occupancy in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the ''Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=M.M.R|title=Land Use and Occupancy, Vol. 1 of Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project Report|year=1976|location=Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry-pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; As Usher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=P.J|title=Environment, Race and Nation Reconsidered: Reflections on Aboriginal Land Claims in Canada|journal=Canadian Geographer|year=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=365–382|doi=10.1111/j.0008-3658.2003.00029.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted:

{{quote box |quote = ''We were no longer mapping the 'territories' of Aboriginal people based on the cumulative observations of others of where they were…but instead, mapping the Aboriginal peoples’ own recollections of their own activities''.
|align  = left
|bgcolor =#FFF8E7
 |quoted = 1
}}

These maps played a fundamental role in the negotiations that enabled the Inuit to assert an aboriginal title to the 2 million km² in Canada, today known as Nunavut.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; Evidently, counter-mapping is a tool by which indigenous groups can re-present the world in ways which destabilise dominant representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kwan|first=M|title=Feminist Visualisation: Re-Envisioning GIS as a Method in Feminist Geographic Research|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=92|issue=4|pages=645–661|doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community mapping ===
[[Community]] mapping can be defined as: "local mapping, produced collaboratively, by local people and often incorporating alternative
local knowledge".&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt; [http://www.openstreetmap.org/ OpenStreetMap] is an example of a community mapping initiative, with the potential to counter the hegemony of state-dominated map distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elwood|first=S|title=Citizen Cartographies and the Shifting Politics of Expertise. Paper Presented at the 24th Annual International Cartography Conference|year=2009|location=Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== OpenStreetMap ====
[[File:OpenStreetMap homepage 2018 en.png|thumb|"border"text-topalt=OpenStreetMap home page.|OpenStreetMap home page.]]
[[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM), a citizen-led spatial data collection website, was founded by [[Steve Coast]] in 2004. Data are collected from diverse public domain sources; of which [[GPS]] tracks are the most important, collected by volunteers with GPS receivers.&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt;  {{as of|2011|January|10}} there were 340,522 registered OSM users, who had uploaded 2.121 billion GPS points onto the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins, C|title=Review OSM: Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World by Ramm, F., Topf, J and Chilton, S.|year=2011|publisher=(in press)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of map creation explicitly relies upon sharing and participation; consequently, every registered OSM user can edit any part of the map. Moreover, 'map parties' - social events which aim to fill gaps in coverage, help foster a community ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|author2=Dodge, M|title=The Potential of User-Generated Cartography: A Case Study of the OpenStreetMap Project and Mapchester Mapping Party|journal=North West Geography|year=2008|volume=8|issue=1|pages=19–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the [[grassroots]] OSM project can be seen to represent a [[paradigm shift]] in who creates and shares geographic information - from the state, to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=S |author2=Goodchild, M.F |author3=Sui, D.Z|title=Researching VGI: Spatial Data, Geographic Research and New Social Practice|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|year=2011|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/00045608.2011.595657}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, rather than countering the state-dominated cartographic project, some commentators have affirmed that OSM merely replicates the 'old' socio-economic order.&lt;ref name="Haklay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|title=How Good is Volunteered Geographical Information? A Comparative Study of OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey Datasets|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|year=2008|volume=37|pages=682–703|doi=10.1068/b35097}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Haklay&lt;ref name=Haklay /&gt; affirmed that OSM users in the United Kingdom tend not to map council estates; consequently, middle-class areas are disproportionately mapped. Thus, in opposition to notions that OSM is a radical cartographic counter-culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=A.J|title=Cartographic Blandscapes and the New Noise: Finding the Good View in a Topographical Mashup|journal=SoC Bulletin|year=2008|volume=42|pages=29–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; are contentions that OSM "simply recreates a mirror copy of existing [[topographic mapping]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodge|first=M|title=Rethinking Maps: New Frontiers in Cartographic Theory|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London |author2=Perkins, C. |author3=Kitchin, R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State counter-mapping ===
What has come to be known as counter-mapping is not limited to the activities of [[Stateless nation|non-state]] actors within a particular nation-state; relatively weak states also engage in counter-mapping in an attempt to challenge other states.&lt;ref name="Nevins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nevins|first=J|title=Contesting the Boundaries of International Justice: State Countermapping and Offshore Resource Struggles Between East-Timor and Australia|journal=Economic Geography|year=2004|volume=80|issue=1|pages=470–484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Competing cartographic representations: East Timor versus Australia ====
[[East Timor]]'s on-going effort to gain control of gas and oil resources from Australia, which it perceives at its own, is a form of counter-mapping. This dispute involves a cartographic contestation of Australia's mapping of the seabed resources between the two countries.&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; As Nevins&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; contends: whilst Australia's map is based on the status quo - a legacy of a 1989 agreement between Australia and the Indonesian occupier of East Timor at that time, East Timor's map represents an enlarged notion of what its sea boundaries should be, thereby entailing a redrawing of the map. This form of counter-mapping thus represents a claim by a relatively weak state, East Timor, to territory and resources that are controlled by a stronger state, Australia.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; However, Nevins&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; notes that there is limited potential of realising a claim through East Timor's counter-map: counter-mapping is an effective strategy only when combined with broader legal and political strategies.&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Counter-mapping's claim to incorporate counter-knowledges, and thereby empower traditionally disempowered people, has not gone uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turow|first=J|title=Playing Doctor: Television, Storytelling, and Medical Power|year=2010|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of criticisms leveled at counter-mapping:

* Counter-mapping fails to recognise that community is a constantly shifting, fluid process, too often relying on a notion of community as bounded and fixed. As such, the process of mapping communicates and naturalises who does, and who does not, belong within particular boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosek|first=J|title=Mapping Politics|journal=Quarterly Publication of the International Association for the Study of Common Property|year=1998|volume=45|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to the power imbalance between [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] claims and those of the state, the language and tools of the dominant society must be used by those under its control. The process of using another's tools can change the ideas represented, resulting in a map of unpredictable quality.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;
* Counter-mapping is in danger of becoming the 'thing to do'; a "magic bullet applied uncritically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=J|title=Mapping Communities: Ethics, Values, Practice|year=2005|publisher=East-West Center|location=Hawaii |author2=Suryanata, K. |author3=Hershock, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a geography to the success of counter-mapping. In Tibet, counter-mapping is of limited political utility as [[mapmaking]] is not enfranchised and cannot be scaled up, for instance, to settle legal battles over land tenure and resource rights through the regulatory offices of the state.&lt;ref name=Bauer /&gt;
* Counter-mapping projects utilising [[GIS]] require significant knowledge and [[computer literacy]] above that of lay individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milla|first=K.A |author2=Lorenzo, A. |author3=Brown,C|title=GIS, GPS, and Remote Sensing Technologies in Extension Services: Where to Start, What to Know|journal=Extension Journal|year=2005|volume=43|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investment in specialised computers and software often results in prohibitive mapping costs for a large majority of local people, particularly in poor areas. As some groups prove more capable of adopting the technologies than others, counter-mapping projects can deepen divisions within communities along gender and economic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corbett|first=J.M |author2=Chaplin, L. |author3=Gibson, G.R|title=Indigenous Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=377–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To summarise, whilst counter-mapping has the potential to transform map-making from "a science of princes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Silences and Secrecy: The Hidden Agenda of Cartography in Early Modern Europe|journal=Imago Mundi, Ltd|year=1988|volume=40|pages=57–76|doi=10.1080/03085698808592639}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investment required to create a map with the ability to challenge state-produced cartography means that counter-mapping is unlikely to become a "science of the masses".&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46814">A '''DNA database''' or '''DNA databank''' is a [[database]] of [[DNA profiling|DNA profile]]s which can be used in the analysis of [[genetic disease]]s, [[genetic fingerprinting]] for [[criminology]], or [[genetic genealogy]].  DNA databases may be public or private, the largest ones being [[national DNA database]]s.

When a match is made from a national DNA database to link a crime scene to a person whose DNA profile is stored on a database, that link is often referred to as a ''cold hit''.  A cold hit is of particular value in linking a specific person to a crime scene, but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made without the use of a DNA database.&lt;ref&gt;Rose &amp; Goos "DNA - A Practical Guide" (Carswell Publications, Toronto).&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that DNA databases of criminal offenders reduce crime rates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doleac|first=Jennifer L.|date=2017-01-01|title=The Effects of DNA Databases on Crime|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20150043|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|volume=9|issue=1|pages=165–201|doi=10.1257/app.20150043|issn=1945-7782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Forensic===
A centralised DNA database for storing DNA profiles of individuals that enables searching and comparing of DNA samples collected from a crime scene against stored profiles. The most important function of the forensic database is to produce matches between the suspected individual and crime scene bio-markers, and then provides evidence to support criminal investigations, and also leads to identify potential suspects in the criminal investigation. Majority of the National DNA databases are used for forensic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lsspjournal.com/content/9/1/12|title=Forensic DNA databases in European countries: is size linked to performance?|journal=Life Sciences, Society and Policy|first1=Filipe|last1=Santos|first2=Helena|last2=Machado|first3=Susana|last3=Silva|date=3 December 2013|publisher=|volume=9|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/2195-7819-9-12|pmc=4513018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Interpol]] DNA database is used in criminal investigations. Interpol maintains an automated DNA database called DNA Gateway that contains DNA profiles submitted by member countries collected from crime scenes, missing persons, and unidentified bodies.&lt;ref name="interpol.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/INTERPOL-expertise/Forensics/DNA|title=DNA / Forensics / INTERPOL expertise / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA Gateway was established in 2002, and at the end of 2013, it had more than 140,000 DNA profiles from 69 member countries. Unlike other DNA databases, DNA Gateway is only used for information sharing and comparison, it does not link a DNA profile to any individual, and the physical or psychological conditions of an individual are not included in the database.&lt;ref name="interpol.int"/&gt;

===Genealogical===
A national or forensic DNA database is not available for non-police purposes. DNA profiles can also be used for genealogical purposes, so that a separate [[genetic genealogy]] database needs to be created that stores DNA profiles of [[genealogical DNA test]] results. GenBank is a public genetic genealogy database that stores genome sequences submitted by many genetic genealogists. Until now, GenBank has contained large number of DNA sequences gained from more than 140,000 registered organizations, and is updated every day to ensure a uniform and comprehensive collection of sequence information. These databases are mainly obtained from individual laboratories or large-scale sequencing projects. The files stored in GenBank are divided into different groups, such as BCT (bacterial), VRL (viruses), PRI (primates)…etc. People can access GenBank from NCBI’s retrieval system, and then use “BLAST” function to identify a certain sequence within the GenBank or to find the similarities between two sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/11/26/nar.gks1195|title=GenBank|first1=Dennis A.|last1=Benson|first2=Mark|last2=Cavanaugh|first3=Karen|last3=Clark|first4=Ilene|last4=Karsch-Mizrachi|first5=David J.|last5=Lipman|first6=James|last6=Ostell|first7=Eric W.|last7=Sayers|date=27 November 2012|publisher=|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=41|issue=Database issue|pages=D36–42|via=nar.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/nar/gks1195|pmid=23193287|pmc=3531190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical===
A medical DNA database is a DNA database of medically relevant genetic variations. It collects an individual's DNA which can reflect their medical records and lifestyle details. Through recording DNA profiles, scientists may find out the interactions between the genetic environment and occurrence of certain diseases (such as cardiovascular disease or cancer), and thus finding some new drugs or effective treatments in controlling these diseases. It is often collaborated with the National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hagmann | first1 = M | year = 2000 | title = UK plans major medical DNA database | url = | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5456| pages = 1184–1184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National===
A national DNA database is a DNA database maintained by the government for storing DNA profiles of its population. Each DNA profile based on PCR and uses STR (Short Tandem Repeats) analysis. They are generally used for forensic purposes which includes searching and matching of DNA profiles of potential criminal suspects.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44tX9Ole490C&amp;pg=PP2|title=Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Methodology|first=John M.|last=Butler|date=27 July 2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-387823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Interpol]] reported there were 54 police national DNA databases in the world at the time and 26 more countries planned to start one.&lt;ref name = Interpol&gt;{{cite web|title=Global DNA Profiling Survey; Results and Analysis|url=http://www.dnaresource.com/documents/2008INTERPOLGLOBALDNASURVEYREPORTV2.pdf|publisher=Interpol DNA Unit|page = Appendix  1|date = 2009|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe Interpol reported there were 31 national DNA databases and six more planned.&lt;ref name = Interpol/&gt; The European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) DNA working group made 33 recommendations in 2014 for DNA database management and guidelines for auditing DNA databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enfsi.eu/sites/default/files/documents/enfsi_2014_document_on_dna-database_management_0.pdf ENFSI DNA Working Group. (2010). DNA database management: Review and Recommendation. The Hague (The Netherlands): ENFSI.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911172729/http://www.enfsi.eu/sites/default/files/documents/enfsi_2014_document_on_dna-database_management_0.pdf |date=2014-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have adopted privately developed DNA databases, such as Qatar, which has adopted Bode dbSEARCH.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodetech.com/bodedbsearch{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a tiny subset of the individual's genome is sampled from 13 or 16 regions that have high individuation.

====United Kingdom====
The first national DNA database in the [[United Kingdom]] was established in April 1995, called [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|National DNA Database]] (NDNAD). By 2006, it contained 2.7 million DNA profiles (about 5.2% of the UK population), as well as other information from individuals and crime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linacre | first1 = A | year = 2003 | title = The UK National DNA Database | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9372| pages = 1841–1842 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13539-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had increased to 5.7 million profiles by 2015.&lt;ref name=UKGOV&gt;{{cite web|title=National DNA Database statistics, Q1 2015 to 2016|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-dna-database-statistics|website=National DNA Database statistics|publisher=UK Government Home Office|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NPIA UK (Communications), Gav Ireland, Simon Lewis, Dan Fookes |url=http://www.npia.police.uk/en/13338.htm |title=NPIA: Statistics |publisher=Npia.police.uk |date=2012-03-31 |accessdate=2012-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617063258/http://www.npia.police.uk/en/13338.htm |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information is stored in the form of a digital code, which is based on the nomenclature of each STR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/02322rv01_10609a.pdf Gill, P. (2002). Role of short tandem repeat DNA in forensic casework in the UK-past, present, and future perspectives. Biotechniques, 32(2), 366–385.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, police have wide-ranging powers to take DNA samples and retain them if the subject is convicted of a recordable offence.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=Retention of offenders' DNA profiles not illegal, supreme court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/retention-of-offenders-dna-does-not-breach-privacy-supreme-court-rules|accessdate=11 October 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples Restrictions on use and destruction of fingerprints and samples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223205051/http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions |date=2007-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the large amount of DNA profiles which have been stored in NDNAD, "cold hits" may happen during the DNA matching, which means finding an unexpected match between an individual's DNA profile and an unsolved crime-scene DNA profile.This can introduce a new suspect into the investigation, thus helping to solve the old cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/7/1S/S26|title=The UK National DNA Database|journal=EMBO Reports|first=Helen|last=Wallace|date=1 July 2006|publisher=|volume=7|issue=1S|pages=S26–S30|via=embor.embopress.org|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400727|pmid=16819445|pmc=1490298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales, anyone arrested on suspicion of a [[recordable offence]] must submit a DNA sample, the profile of which is then stored on the DNA database. Those not charged or not found guilty have their DNA data deleted within a specified period of time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Freedoms Act 2012: DNA and fingerprint provisions|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protection-of-freedoms-act-2012-dna-and-fingerprint-provisions/protection-of-freedoms-act-2012-how-dna-and-fingerprint-evidence-is-protected-in-law|website=Protection of Freedoms Act 2012: how DNA and fingerprint evidence is protected in law|publisher=UK Government Home Office|date = 4 April 2014|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, the law similarly requires the DNA profiles of most people who are acquitted be removed from the database.

====New Zealand====
[[New Zealand]] was the second country to set up a DNA database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esr.cri.nz/forensic-science/ Forensic Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The [[United States]] national DNA database is called [[Combined DNA Index System]] (CODIS). It is maintained at three levels: national, state and local. Each level implemented its own DNA index system. The  national DNA index system (NDIS) allows DNA profiles to be exchanged and compared between participated laboratories nationally. Each state DNA index system (SDIS) allows DNA profiles to be exchanged and compared between the laboratories of various states and the local DNA index system (LDIS) allows DNA profiles collected at local sites and uploaded to SDIS and NDIS.

CODIS software integrates and connects all the DNA index systems at the three levels. CODIS is installed on each participating laboratory site and uses a standalone network known as Criminal Justice Information Systems Wide Area Network (CJIS WAN)&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/biometric-analysis/codis/codis_brochure CODIS Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; to connect to other laboratories. In order to decrease the number of irrelevant matches at NDIS, the Convicted Offender Index requires all 13 CODIS [[Short tandem repeat|STR]]s to be present for a profile upload.  Forensic profiles only require 10 of the STRs to be present for an upload.

As of 2011, over 9 million records were held within CODIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/|title=Laboratory Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2011, 361,176 forensic profiles and 9,404,747 offender profiles have been accumulated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/ndis-statistics|title=CODIS - NDIS Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest DNA database in the world.  As of the same date, CODIS has produced over 138,700 matches to requests, assisting in more than 133,400 investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/aidedmap.htm Investigations Aided] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406115009/https://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/aidedmap.htm |date=April 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing public approval of DNA databases has seen the creation and expansion of many states' own DNA databases.  [[California]] currently maintains the third largest DNA database in the world.  Political measures such as [[California Proposition 69]] (2004), which increased the scope of the DNA database, have already met with a significant increase in numbers of investigations aided. Forty-nine states in the [[United States|USA]], all apart from Idaho, store DNA profiles of violent offenders, and many also store profiles of suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-says-police-can-take-dna-swabs-after-arrest/ |title=Supreme Court says police can take DNA swabs after arrest| work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study showed that DNA databases in U.S. states "deter crime by profiled offenders, reduce crime rates, and are more cost-effective than traditional law enforcement tools".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CODIS is also used to help find missing persons and identify human remains.  It is connected to the [[National Missing Persons DNA Database]]; samples provided by family members are sequenced by the [[University of North Texas Center for Human Identification]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://identifyus.org/help/NamUs-DNA_Protocol_for_Collection.pdf Family DNA Collection Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt; which also runs the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]].  UNTCHI can sequence both nuclear and [[mitochondrial DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.untchi.org/MissingPersons.html Missing Persons Unit]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Defense maintains a DNA database to identify the remains of servicemembers.  The [[Department of Defense Serum Repository]] maintains more than 50,000,000 records, primarily to assist in the identification of human remains.  Submission of DNA samples is mandatory for US servicemen, but the database also includes information on military dependents.  The National Defense Authorization Act of 2003 provided a means for federal courts or military judges to order the use of the DNA information collected to be made available for the purpose of investigation or prosecution of a felony, or any sexual offense, for which no other source of DNA information is reasonably available.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/geneticprivacy/DNA_mil.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
The Australian national DNA database is called the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database (NCIDD).

====Canada====
The Canadian national DNA database is called the National DNA Data Bank (NDDB) which was established  in 1998 but first used in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3834530 | pmid=24312124 | doi=10.3389/fgene.2013.00249 | volume=4 | title=The National DNA Data Bank of Canada: a Quebecer perspective | journal=Front Genet | pages=249 | last1 = Milot | first1 = E | last2 = Lecomte | first2 = MM | last3 = Germain | first3 = H | last4 = Crispino | first4 = F| year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation that Parliament enacted to govern the use of this technology within the criminal justice system has been found by Canadian courts to be respectful of the constitutional and privacy rights of suspects, and of persons found guilty of designated offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/cor/tls/dna-eng.aspx "National DNA Data Bank"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625081506/http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/cor/tls/dna-eng.aspx |date=2013-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 1999, The Canadian Government agreed upon the [[DNA Identification Act (Canada)|DNA Identification Act]]. This would allow a Canadian DNA data bank to be created and amended for the criminal code. This provides a mechanism for judges to request the offender to provide blood, buccal swabs, or hair samples from DNA profiles. This legislation became official on June 29, 2000. Canadian police has been using forensic DNA evidence for over a decade. It has become one of the most powerful tools available to law enforcement agencies for the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/nddb-bndg/index-accueil-eng.htm|title=National DNA Data Bank|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, National DNA Data|last=Bank|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDDB consists of two indexes: the Convicted Offender Index (COI) and National Crime Scene Index (CSI-nat). There is also the Local Crime Scene Index (CSI-loc) which is maintained by local laboratories but not NDDB as local DNA profiles do not meet NDDB collection criteria. Another National Crime Scene Index (CSI-nat) is a collection of three labs operated by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Laboratory Sciences Judiciary Medicine Legal (LSJML) and Center of Forensic Sciences (CFS).

==== Dubai ====
In 2017 Dubai announced an initiative called Dubai 10X which was planned to create 'disruptive innovation' into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itp.net/611476-hh-sheikh-mohammed-launches-10x-initiative|title=HH Sheikh Mohammed launches 10x initiative|last=Sutton|first=Mark|date=2017-02-14|work=ITP.net|access-date=2018-03-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the projects in this initiative was a DNA database that would collect the genomes of all 3 million citizens of the country over a 10-year period.

The collection includes DNA profiles from suspected and accused persons and convicted offenders. The Israeli database also include an “elimination bank” of profiles from laboratory staff and other police personnel who may have contact with the forensic evidence in the course of their work.

In order to handle the high throughput processing and analysis of DNA samples from FTA cards, the Israeli Police DNA database has established a semi-automated program LIMS, which enables a small number of police to finish processing a large number of samples in a relatively small period of time, and it is also responsible for the future tracking of samples.

S. (2012). Compression of Large DNA Databases (Doctoral dissertation, The University of Melbourne)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DNA databases occupy more storage when compared to other non DNA databases due to the enormous size of each '''DNA sequence'''. Every year DNA databases grow exponentially. This poses a major challenge to the storage, data transfer, retrieval and searchin of these databases. To address these challenges DNA databases are compressed to save storage space and bandwidth during the data transfers. They are decompressed during search and retrieval. Various compression algorithms are used to compress and decompress. The efficiency of any compression algorithm depends how well and fast it compresses and decompresses, which is generally measured in compression ratio. The greater the compression ratio, the better the efficiency of an algorithm. At the same time, the speed of compression and decompression are also considered for evaluation.

DNA sequences contain palindromic repetitions of A, C, T, G. Compression of these sequences involve locating and encoding these repetitions and decoding them during decompression.

Some approaches used to encode and decode are:

# [[Huffman coding|Huffman Encoding]]
# [[Huffman coding#Adaptive Huffman coding|Adaptive Huffman Encoding]]
# [[Arithmetic coding]]
# [[Arithmetic coding#Adaptive arithmetic coding|Arithmetic coding]]
# [[Context tree weighting]] method

The [[compression algorithm]]s listed below may use one of the above encoding approaches to compress and decompress DNA database

# COMRAD
# RLZ
# GenCompress
# BioCompress
# DNACompress
# CTW+LZ

==Medicine==
Many countries collect newborn blood samples to [[Newborn screening|screen for diseases]] mainly with a genetic basis. Mainly these are destroyed soon after testing. In some countries the [[Dried blood spot testing|dried blood]] (and the DNA) is retained for later testing.  
 
In [[Denmark]] the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank at Statens Serum Institut keeps a blood sample from people born after 1981. The purpose is to test for [[phenylketonuria]] and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssi.dk/sw62846.asp#516_66584 &lt;!-- accessdate December 19, 2014 --&gt; ]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also used for DNA profiling to identify deceased and suspected criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/danmark/blodbank-som-forbryderalbum|title=Blodbank som forbryderalbum|date=16 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can request that the blood sample of their newborn be destroyed after the result of the test is known.

Nowadays, the privacy and security issues of DNA database has caused huge attention. Some people are afraid that their personal DNA information will be let out easily, others may define their DNA profiles recording in the Databases as a sense of "criminal", and being falsely accused in a crime can lead to having a "criminal" record for the rest of their lives.

UK laws in [[Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001|2001]] and [[Criminal Justice Act 2003|2003]] allowed DNA profiles to be taken immediately after a person was arrested and kept in a Database even if the suspect was later acquitted.&lt;ref name = Wallace&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090536X14000239|title=Forensic DNA databases–Ethical and legal standards: A global review|first1=H.

In European countries which have established a DNA database, there are some measures which are being used to protect the privacy of individuals, more specifically, some criteria to help removing the DNA profiles from the databases. Among the 22 European countries which have been analyzed, most of the countries will record the DNA profiles of suspects or those who have committed serious crimes. For some countries (like Belgium and France) may remove the criminal’s profile after 30–40 years, because these “criminal investigation” database are no longer needed. Most of the countries will delete the suspect’s profile after they are acquitted…etc. All the countries have a completed legislation to largely avoid the privacy issues which may occur during the use of DNA database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lsspjournal.com/content/9/1/12/abstract|title=Forensic DNA databases in European countries: is size linked to performance?|journal=Life Sciences, Society and Policy|first1=Filipe|last1=Santos|first2=Helena|last2=Machado|first3=Susana|last3=Silva|date=3 December 2013|publisher=|volume=9|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/2195-7819-9-12|pmc=4513018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy issues surrounding DNA databases not only means privacy is threatened in collecting and analyzing DNA samples, it also exists in protecting and storing this important personal information. As the DNA profiles can be stored indefinitely in DNA database, it has raised concerns that these DNA samples can be used for new and unidentified purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hascietlj2&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Concerns Associated with Expanding DNA Databases Note 2 Hastings Science and Technology Law Journal 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase of the users who access the DNA database, people are worried about their information being let out or shared inappropriately, for example, their DNA profile may be shared with others such as law enforcement agencies or countries without individual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dna-databank-proposal-raises-privacy-concerns|title=DNA databank proposal raises privacy concerns - The National|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of DNA databases have been expanded into two controversial areas: arrestees and familial searching. An arrestee is a person arrested for a crime and who has not yet been convicted for that offense. Currently, 21 states in the a United States have passed legislation that allows law enforcement to take DNA from an arrestee and enter it into the state's CODIS DNA database to see if that person has a criminal record or can be linked to any unsolved crimes. In familial searching, the DNA database is used to look for partial matches that would be expected between close family members.  This technology can be used to link crimes to the family members of suspects and thereby help identify a suspect when the perpetrator has no DNA sample in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnaforensics.com/|title=DNA Forensics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40077.pdf Compulsory DNA Collection: A Fourth Amendment Analysis] [[Congressional Research Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, DNA databases could fall into the wrong hands due to [[data breach]]es or data sharing.

==DNA collection and human rights==
In a judgement in December 2008, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that two British men should not have had their DNA and fingerprints retained by police saying that retention "could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7764069.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; DNA database 'breach of rights' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-04 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA fingerprinting pioneer Professor [[Alec Jeffreys|Sir Alec Jeffreys]] condemned UK government plans to keep the genetic details of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in England and Wales for up to 12 years. Jeffreys said he was "disappointed" with the proposals, which came after a European court ruled that the current policy breaches people's right to privacy. Jefferys said "It seems to be as about as minimal a response to the European court of human rights judgment as one could conceive. There is a presumption not of innocence but of future guilt here … which I find very disturbing indeed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Sturcke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/07/dna-database-plans-condemned |title=DNA pioneer condemns plans to retain data on innocent &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-05-07|accessdate=2012-08-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on crime ==
A 2017 study in the ''[[American Economic Journal|American Economic Journal: Applied Economics]]'' showed that databases of criminal offenders' DNA profiles in US states "deter crime by profiled offenders, reduce crime rates, and are more cost-effective than traditional law enforcement tools."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Monozygotic Twins==

[[Monozygotic twins]] share around 99.99% of their DNA, while other siblings share around 50%. Some [[next generation sequencing]] tools are capable of detecting rare [[de novo mutations]] in only one of the twins (detectable in rare [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s).&lt;ref name="Weber-LehmannSchilling2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber-Lehmann|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Schilling|first2=Elmar|last3=Gradl|first3=Georg|last4=Richter|first4=Daniel C.|last5=Wiehler|first5=Jens|last6=Rolf|first6=Burkhard|title=Finding the needle in the haystack: Differentiating “identical” twins in paternity testing and forensics by ultra-deep next generation sequencing|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=9|year=2014|pages=42–46|issn=18724973|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2013.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most DNA testing tools would not detect these rare SNPs in most twins.

Each person’s DNA is unique to them to the slight exception of identical (monozygotic and monospermotic) twins, who start out from the identical genetic line of DNA but during the twinning event have incredibly small mutations which can be detected now (for all intents and purposes, compared to all other humans and even to theoretical "clones, [who would not share the same uterus nor experience the same mutations pre-twinning event]" identical twins have more identical DNA than is probably possible to achieve between any other two humans). Tiny differences between identical twins can now (2014) be detected by next generation sequencing. For current fiscally available testing, "identical" twins cannot be easily differentiated by the most common DNA testing, but it has been shown to be possible. While other siblings (including fraternal twins) share about 50% of their DNA, monozygotic twins share virtually 99.99%. Beyond these more recently discovered twinning-event mutation disparities, since 2008 it has been known that people who are identical twins also each have their own set of copy number variants, which can be thought of as the number of copies they each personally exhibit for certain sections of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Am J Hum Genet. 2008 Mar;82(3):763-71. doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.12.011. Epub 2008 Feb 14.
Phenotypically concordant and discordant monozygotic twins display different DNA copy-number-variation profiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dany Bébel-Gisler''' (7 April 1935 – 28 September 2003) was an Afro-Guadeloupean writer and [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] who specialized in [[Antillean Creole]] and [[ethnology]]. She was one of the first linguists to defend the preservation and teaching of [[Creole language]]s and study how the interplay of the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Caribbean reflected the social hierarchy, as well as the assimilation or lack thereof of both the colonizers and colonized. She was instrumental in the development of [[UNESCO]]'s [[The Slave Route Project]], tracing the intersection of African, Caribbean and European cultures and published several novels and children's books on Guadeloupean culture.

==Early life==
Dany Bébel was born on 7 April 1935 in [[Pointe-à-Pitre]] on the island of [[Guadeloupe]] in the [[French Antilles]]. Her father's family owned a [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]] in Guadeloupe and her mother was a [[mulatto]] woman who was an agricultural worker on the plantation.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} Growing up on her grandfather’s sugarcane plantation, she was encouraged to pursue her educational dreams in France.{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} During her teens, she moved to France and attended a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Toulouse]].{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} She then went on to study at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris. When she graduated, Bébel became the first person in her mother's family to have earned her [[baccalauréat]].{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} Receiving the Prix Spécial de Français, she went on to study at the [[Grandes écoles]], under the tutelage of [[Michel Leiris]], focusing on ethnology, linguistics and sociology.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}}

==Career==
Bébel-Gisler began working in France in the 1960s,{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} while she was completing her university studies. She taught in [[Nanterre]] and [[Aubervilliers]], focusing on educating immigrants and working-class students. She led an adult literacy program in Paris, which targeted African and Algerian immigrants.  In 1976, she returned to Guadeloupe with the goal of launching an experimental teaching project for rural residents living in the area around [[Lamentin]]. Her target group was illiterate adults who were not French-speaking, so that she could create a spelling system for the local [[Creole language]]. At the time, there were few Creole texts that did not look at the language from an [[Etymology|etymological]] analysis standpoint. Publishing a booklet, ''Kèk Prinsip Pou Ékri Kréyól'' (Some Principles for Writing in Kreol), in 1975, she proposed designing a notational system for [[Antillean Creole|Guadeloupean Creole]] based upon the [[Haitian Creole|Haitian]] model which had been developed, but which could be researched, refined, and applied to create a written standard for educational purposes.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=89}} In 1976, she published ''La Langue créole, force jugulée'' (The Creole language, forced suppression), which evaluated the system in French schools which placed immigrant children in remedial classes because they could not speak standard French. Removing them from regular classes, she believed, caused students to feel inferior and impacted their further education and later their ability to get jobs.{{sfn|Mesh|1997|pp=30–31}} Thus, language, rather than being a commonality between peoples became a means of maintaining social boundaries.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}

In 1979, Bébel-Gisler founded the alternative-educational Centre d'Education Populaire Bwadoubout, to provide literacy for disadvantaged adults or children who wanted access to learning, but may have been obstructed because formal schools taught only in French. She directed the center and received funding from the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]],{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|pp=89–90}} though in effect, her work at Bwadoubout undermined the governmental objectives of assimilation.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=91}} Language became a vehicle for activism,{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=90}}{{sfn|Berrian|2000|p=40}} for Bébel-Gisler, who recognized that controlling access to knowledge insured that certain social classes or those with certain backgrounds controlled the power. By refusing to use French, Guadeloupeans were creating a distinction between themselves, their colonizer, and other Antillean colonies, as well as rejecting assimilation.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=90}}

In addition to her educational efforts, Bébel-Gisler began publishing novels. In 1985, her biographical novel ''Lénora: l’histoire enfouie de la Guadeloupe'' (Leonora: the buried story of Guadeloupe) described the period between 1940 and 1943, when Governor {{ill|Constant Sorin|fr}} instituted policies to isolate Guadeloupe and [[Martinique]] from the potentiality of American or British occupation, leading to widespread suffering on the islands.{{sfn|Berrian|2000|p=111}} The book was released in English in 1994 and she published the children's book, ''Grand'mère, ça commence où la Route de l'esclave?'' (Grandmother, where does the Slave Route begin?) in 1998.{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} The book retraced the slave triangle and was a means of acknowledging the past and its impact on history.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} In 2000, she published, ''À la recherche d’une odeur de grand’mère; D’en Guadeloupe une « enfant de la Dass » raconte…'' (In Search of Grandmother's Smell: Tales from a "child of the Dass" in Guadeloupe).{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} The book tells how the sugar plantation shaped both the landscape and the people who worked within it, replacing family ties with communal relationships and changing the nature of the relationships between men and women and parents and children. It explores the competing themes prevalent in Guadeloupean society where matrifocality and patriarchy  meet.{{sfn|Cases Rebelles|2017}}

In 1996, Bébel-Gisler became affiliated with [[UNESCO]]'s [[The Slave Route Project]], tracing the intersection of African, Caribbean and European cultures through the monuments of the [[slave trade]]. She was responsible for documenting the Caribbean portion of the route.{{sfn|MAXImini|2003}}{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} Bringing the project to Guadeloupe, she identified eighteen significant extant sites including plantations, forts, and jails.{{sfn|Young|2016}} 

==Death and legacy==
Bébel-Gisler died unexpectedly of a heart attack on 28 September 2003 at her home in Lamentin.{{sfn|MAXImini|2003}}{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} She is widely remembered for her activism in preserving Guadeloupean Creole.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|pp=31–32}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17045">'''Dominant narrative''' can be used to describe the lens in which history is told by the perspective of the dominant culture. This term has been described as an "invisible hand" that guides reality and perceived reality.&lt;ref name="onegreenplanet.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Speaking Truth to Power: Understanding the Dominant, Animal-Eating Narrative for Vegan Empowerment and Social Transformation|url = http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/speaking-truth-to-power-understanding-the-dominant-animal-eating-narrative-for-vegan-empowerment-and-social-transformation/|website = One Green Planet|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant narrative can refer to multiple aspects of life, such as history, politics, or different activist groups. [[Dominant culture]] is defined as the majority cultural practices of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-dominantculture.html|title = Dominant Culture|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = A Dictionary of Sociology|last = Marshall|first = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative]] can be defined as story telling, either true or imaginary.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = narrative: definition of narrative in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/narrative|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pairing these two terms together create the notion of dominant narrative, that only the majority story is told and therefore heard. It is a common theme to hear or learn only about the dominant narrative as it comprises the perspective of the majority culture. Examples of dominant narrative can be seen throughout history. Dominant narrative can be defined and decided by the sociopolitical and socioeconomic setting someone lives his or her life in. 

Dominant narrative is similar in some ways to the ideas of [[metanarrative]] or [[grand narrative]].  These two terms refer to the notion that there is a common lived experience, or a totalizing narrative, experience, or account of history.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Unlike the above terms, dominant narrative as a concept is used to explain not just only that there is one narrative told, but what makes it possible for that to be the narrative that is told. This term addresses what the reasons are that the dominant narrative is, in fact, dominant or the majority account.

It is also important to look at who is not included in the dominant narrative and how this can affect society and people in those [[marginalized]] groups. Not everyone has access to being a part of the dominant narrative. Counter-narrative has been coined as the term regarding the stories and lived experiences of those not in the dominant narrative or not allowed to be a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Postmodern Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pX_azoDGfpAC|publisher = Pluto Press|date = 1985-01-01|isbn = 9780745300030|first = Hal|last = Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-narrative are used as a way to share minorities stories excluded and combat the dominant narrative. 

== Who is the dominant narrative? ==
The dominant narrative can most often be seen as those that occupy scholar [[Judith Lorber|Judith Lorber's]] A-Categories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Social Construction of Gender|last = Lorber|first = Judith|date = 2006|journal = Inequality Reader: Contemporary &amp; Foundational Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber defines and describes A-category members as those that occupy the dominant group in different aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, that can be seen in the topic of [[race (human categorization)]] with white being the A-category and all minorities being the not-A; or in the topic of [[gender]] with man being the A-category while woman being the not-A. This notion includes all [[Intersectionality|intersectionalities]] such as age, sexual orientation, CIS/Transgender, ableism, education, and citizenship. The dominant narrative are those that take part in and benefit from being associated with the dominant culture. Having forms of privilege and power that come from being in Lorber's A Categories, can directly relate to being in the dominant culture. The dominant narrative simply consists of whose voice can be recognized and represented when retelling stories, or whose voice/story is perceived as valid or real.

== Critiques and concerns with dominant narrative. ==
There are a number of critiques and concerns with there being a dominant narrative in society. Many of the critiques of there being a dominant narrative come from the exclusion of counter-narratives. To fully understand what the dominant narrative is and understand examples of it is necessary to understand its limitations. Some limitations with there being a dominant narrative include the following:

=== Metanarrative among dominant group ===
Having a dominant narrative can create a notion that there is a metanarrative among the dominant group, meaning all apart of the dominant group are experiencing life the same way. In using the example of the caucasian dominant narrative, this would mean that all Caucasians of somewhat similar sociopolitical and socioeconomic standing are experiencing life and events the same, and that is not true. A dominant narrative can generalize the lived experiences of people within the dominant culture. The metanarrative among the dominant culture creates the notion that whiteness is the norm, and that the dominant culture is the normal culture to which other cultures need to adapt.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://evolutioncounseling.com/dominant-culture/|title = Dominant Culture|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = Evolution Counseling|publisher = |last = Schreiner|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived sense of normalcy can be very problematic because it encourages people within the majority to not change and question what could be wrong with having such a strong dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Ignores the lived experiences of minorities ===
Having a dominant narrative based on the dominant culture, therefore means anyone not in the dominant culture cannot be a part of the dominant narrative. Since the dominant narrative is accepted as the norm this, therefore, means those not in the dominant narrative are abnormal.

=== How does society ever know the truth? ===
Jeyn Roberts is quoted for saying "there are three sides to every story. Yours. Mine. What really happened: the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A quote from Rage Within|url = http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/638626-there-are-three-sides-to-every-story-yours-mine-what|website = Goodreads|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant narrative makes it so only one side of any story is told, this completely ignores any other sides or even the truth. By definition, a dominant narrative does not include every and all aspects of any event. By only learning about and studying the dominant narrative then people are only being educated partially about any historical or current events. This creates a false historical account of most of history. [[Winston Churchill]] has been associated with the saying "history is written by the victors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Winston Churchill Quotes at BrainyQuote.com|url = http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/winstonchu380864.html|website = BrainyQuote|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saying directly relates to the concept of dominant narrative and how the full truth of events as it relates to minorities is not being retold. This means that through mainstream education and media people are not being put forth the most accurate information and historical accounts.

== Examples of dominant narrative ==
Dominant narrative can be seen in almost any aspect of life from media, history, advertising, and activism. The following are some examples of places dominant narrative can be present:

=== History ===
History is one of the most important fields to acknowledge that dominant narrative is present. It is important for people to have a full and accurate understanding of historical events, this is often muddled by the dominant narrative. A historical example of dominant narrative ignoring contributions of people of color can be seen in the military realm. A historical example of black men being ignored for their contributions to the US Military can be understood in the instance of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. The Tuskegee Airmen was a program based out of Tuskegee, AZ in 1941, in which African-American men were trained and educated in multiple aspects relating to war aircraft.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A brief History - Tuskegee Airmen Inc. - The legacy of The Tuskegee Airmen|url = http://tuskegeeairmen.org/explore-tai/a-brief-history/|website = tuskegeeairmen.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to racist ideologies many opposed African-American men being trained to become US Military pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ebony and Ivory: White Officer Foes and Friends of the Tuskegee Airmen|last = Haulman|first = Daniel|date = 2015|journal = Air Power History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Tuskegee Airman overcame great obstacles and contributed immensely to US Military acts in [[World War II]], they have not been given considerable recognition until [[Bill Clinton]] commemorated Tuskegee as a national historic site.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though the Tuskegee Airmen deserved recognition for all they were contributing to the war and in terms of overcoming racial prejudices, because of the WWII dominant narrative they were not given recognition until people fought for their behalf. There are many other historical contributions made by people not in the dominant culture, which are never retroactively recognized and acknowledged. 

=== News Media ===
Like historical accounts, journalism and news media can also be framed in the dominant narrative lens. This historical dominant narrative can affect what news people are actually being exposed to. This is problematic because only news that the dominant narrative deems important receives the most media attention. 
An example of the dominant narrative at play in the media can be seen in the way the [[Rwandan Genocide]]  was almost completely ignored by Western media and news.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |website=www.idrc.ca |accessdate=2015-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105001141/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |archivedate=2015-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This genocide consists of the ethnic majority group, the [[Hutu]], attempting to extinguish the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rwandan Genocide - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|url = http://www.history.com/topics/rwandan-genocide|website = HISTORY.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Rwandan Genocide was not framed by the media as a genocide, in an attempt to ignore the severity of the event.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ignoring Genocide (HRW Report - Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda, March 1999)|url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-01.htm|website = www.hrw.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early developments  of the Rwandan Genocide where minimalized as a way to justify a lack of intervention by many countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Since the events in Rwanda did not directly affect US citizens the genocide did not seem to be as big of a deal in media, especially because the genocide consisted of black non-Americans this genocide was hardly discussed, as it is a counter-narrative to the dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |website=www.idrc.ca |accessdate=2015-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105001141/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |archivedate=2015-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But even when race is not a factor at play the mass media can shape the dominant narrative in a way to instil indifference and avoid intervention. This happened, for instance, during the early phases of the breakup of Yugoslavia, as many international authorities disputed and denied that a genocide was taking place in Bosnia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Time We Knew: Western Responses to Genocide in Bosnia|last=Cushman T and Meštrović SG (eds)|first=|publisher=New York: NYU Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism ===
People who do not fit into the dominant narrative can also be written out of activist movements, and in turn written out of history later on. There are some needs and intersections of privilege that are necessary to participate in some forms of activism. Not everyone is able to participate in activist work because of their socioeconomic status, their sociopolitical status, their job safety, their families or childcare needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The privilege and cost of activism {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|url = http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2012/privilege-and-cost-activism|website = gender.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations like those just mentioned can greatly affect who is active and participates in social activism. Because someone, most likely not in the dominant culture, may not have the means to participate that means their narrative may not be shared. An example of dominant narrative in activism can be seen in [[Women's rights]] movements. [[First-wave feminism]] has been critiqued for a lack of inclusion of black women and race in their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Black feminism and intersectionality {{!}} International Socialist Review|url = http://isreview.org/issue/91/black-feminism-and-intersectionality|website = isreview.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist history is often explained in a framework of the contributions made by white affluent and educated American or British women.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Documenting First Wave Feminisms. Volume 1: Transnational Collaborations and Crosscurrents ed. by Maureen Moynagh and Nancy Forestell (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/university_of_toronto_quarterly/v083/83.2.dunst.html|journal = University of Toronto Quarterly|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1712-5278|pages = 481-482|volume = 83|issue = 2|first = Maura|last = Dunst}}&lt;/ref&gt; White women with higher socioeconomic standings were not the only women that took part in the first-wave feminist activism, but most often were the only ones that were given access to political gains and recognition.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The '''European Pirates''' ('''PIRATES''') or '''European Pirate Party''' ('''PPEU''') is an association of parties aspiring to be recognised as a [[European political party]] by the European Union. It was founded on 21 March 2014 at the European Parliament in Brussels in the context of a conference on "''European Internet Governance and Beyond"'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://europeanpirates.eu/programme PPEU founding &amp; European Internet Governance and Beyond - Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311021217/https://europeanpirates.eu/programme |date=2014-03-11 }}, PPEU
&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of [[Pirate Party|pirate parties]] of European countries. The parties cooperate to run a joint campaign for the [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://euobserver.com/institutional/115888|title='Pirates' to run joint campaign in next EU elections|date=16 April 2012|publisher=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Evolve''''' is a 2008 [[Documentary film|documentary television series]] on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]. The series premiere, "Eyes", was nominated for an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Science, Technology and Nature Programming.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Each episode attempts to explain the evolutionary origins of a particular trait of living creatures: for example, [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]'s 13-inch teeth, the [[gecko]]'s "[[Velcro]]-like" toe pads, and the [[bald eagle]]'s "telescopic" vision capable of spotting a [[hare]] a mile away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.history.com/detail.php?p=70393|title=History Channel Store|accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of episodes==
To date, there are 11 episodes, which are available to buy in a compilation box set. The box incorrectly lists 13 episodes but does list the correct 11 episode running time total.

'''''Fluxus 1''''' is an [[Artist's Book|artists' book]] edited and produced by the [[Lithuanian-American]] artist [[George Maciunas]], containing works by a series of artists associated with [[Fluxus]], the international collective of avant-garde artists primarily active in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally published in New York, 1964, the contents vary from edition to edition, but usually contain work by [[Ay-O]], [[George Brecht]], [[Alison Knowles]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] and [[La Monte Young]] amongst many others.&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p110&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has become famous as an early example of [[conceptual art]], and as one of the defining products of the Fluxus collective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lib.stanford.edu/art-architecture-library/fluxus-1 Stanford University Online Retrieved 07-06-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early fluxus==
[[Image:AnthologyFlynt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A single page from ''An Anthology'', by La Monte Young and Jackson Mac Low, 1963. Designed and printed by George Maciunas.]]

===The AG Gallery and proposals for a Yearbox===
Maciunas had originally set up the AG Gallery, 925 [[Madison Avenue]], [[New York City]], to exhibit abstract art and to sell ancient musical instruments; upon meeting [[La Monte Young]] and [[Richard Maxfield]] in late 1960, however, he 'was suddenly confronted with the most radical ideas in art.' Overnight, the gallery  was transformed into a greenhouse for 'the germination of Fluxus',&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p22&lt;/ref&gt; hosting events by [[Dick Higgins]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Yoko Ono]], La Monte Young and others. All of these artists would be included in the forthcoming ''Fluxus 1''; the first known mention of the name ''Fluxus'' came on the invitation cards to 3 events held at the gallery, Spring 1961, in which guests were asked to contribute $3 to 'help publish Fluxus magazine'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/fluxone.htm The Assault on Culture, Stuart Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery had gone bankrupt by mid 1961; to avoid his creditors, Maciunas took a job working for the US Army as a freelance designer in [[Wiesbaden]], West Germany. He took many of the scores collected by La Monte Young for ''AN ANTHOLOGY'', and whilst working on the design and printing for that, also began work on his own anthology ''Fluxus 1''. Modelled in many ways on An Anthology, both works would prove difficult to publish. ''AN ANTHOLOGY'' appeared in Spring 1963; Most of Fluxus 1 was printed by the same German printers contemporaneously, but Maciunas doesn't seem to have put any copies together until sometime in early 1964, by which time he'd left his job in Germany due to bad health and had returned to New York. His letters leave a paper trail of torturous dealings with German printers;

{{quote|''Fluxus 1'' deadline is now closed, (all works are at the printer who is scratching his head to the bone.) It should be out in Jan ...|George Maciunas, Dec 2 1962 &lt;ref name="print"&gt;quoted in Fluxus Codex, p107-8&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

{{quote|''Fluxus 1'' $2000 (now 400 pages thick) is 80% completed - very slow printer! but I think I will have them ready end of March ...|George Maciunas, March 11, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|... I will stay in Wiesbaden till Printer completes Fluxus 1 ... (2 printers are working now.) They should have it completed by June 15 ...|George Maciunas, before June 8, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Please accept our belated acknowledgement of your order for ''Fluxus 1'' yearbook. Due to financial difficulties, this fat book will not be issued but the contents will be included in the monthly Fluxus newspaper ...|George Maciunas, Nov 19, 1963 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

{{quote|''FLUXUS 1964 EDITIONS, AVAILABLE NOW ... Fluxus 1'' Anthology of yet unpublished works ... Loose leaf binding (nonperiodically renewable), with objects in wood box $6|Fluxus Newspaper no3, March 1964 &lt;ref name="print"/&gt;}}

Originally intended as a six-part series of yearboxes covering America (1), Northern Europe (2), Japan (3), 'Homage To The Past' (4), Southern Europe (5) and Eastern Europe (6), only ''Fluxus 1'' was actually published; whilst predominantly anthologising American artists, both European and Japanese artists were included from material that had originally been intended for other volumes in the series. The book originally sold for $6, with a 'Luxus Fluxus' edition costing $12 containing 'film, tape, objects and accessories' &lt;ref&gt;cc Valise e TRanglE, Fluxus Newspaper no3, march 1964 quoted in Fluxus Codex, p108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus, collectivism &amp; Anti-art===
Amongst many other influences, Maciunas was directly inspired by [[LEF (journal)|LEF]], the communist journal founded by [[Mayakovsky]] and [[Ossip Brik]]; an artistic organisation aimed at unifying left-wing artists to help build the newly emerging communist state in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"Fluxus objectives are social (not aesthetic). They are connected to the group of LEF group of 1929 (sic) in Soviet Union (ideologically) and concern itself with: Gradual elimination of fine arts (music, theatre, poetry, fiction, painting, sculpture etc. etc.) ... Thus Fluxus is definitely against art-object as non-functional commodity - to be sold &amp; to make livelihood for an artist. It could temporarily have the pedagogical function of teaching people the needlessness of itself. It should not be therefore permanent ...
Fluxus therefore is ANTIPROFESSIONAL (against professional art or artists making livelihood from art or artists spending their full time, their life on art.) Secondly FLUXUS is against artas medium or vehicle promoting artist's ego, since applied art should express the objective problem to be solved not artist's personality or his ego. Fluxus should therefore tend towards collective spirit, anonymity and ANTI-INDIVIDUALISM ..... 
These Fluxus concerts, publications etc - are at best transitional (a few years) &amp; temporary until such time when art can be totally eliminated (or at least its institutional forms) and artists find other employment." George Maciunas, January 1964 Quoted in Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p37&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fluxus 1'' was Maciunas' first attempt at creating a coherent collective voice, an attempt to erode the artist's status as heroic individual &amp; his first attempt to 'communicate the concept of the self-sufficiency of the audience, an art where anything can substitute for an art work and anyone can produce it.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10457 Michael Corris from Grove Art Online, quoted on MOMA online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lecture given on the June 9, 1962, [[Wuppertal]], West Germany, to coincide with the launch of the ''Brochure Prospectus for the Fluxus Yearboxes'', Maciunas stated that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The anti-art forms are primarily directed against art as a profession, against the artificial separation of producer or performer, of generator and spectator or against the separation of art and life. They oppose forms artificial in themselves, models or methods of composition, of artificially constructed phenomena in the various areas of artistic practice, against intentional, conscious formalism and against the fixation of art on meaning, against the demand of music to be heard and that of plastic art to be seen; and finally against the thesis that both should be acknowledged and understood. Anti-art is life, nature; true reality is the one and all. The bird song is anti-art. The pouring rain, the chattering of an impatient audience, sneeze noises ... or compositions like "letting a butterfly caught in a net fly away" or "what an audience left to its own devices does for amusement"- all of these examples may be viewed in this sense as anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, Kleinen Sommerfest lecture June 9, 1962, quoted in Fluxus Codex p23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maciunas sent out requests for 'critical or non-critical, rational or irrational essays'; scores, instructions ... visual compositions for reproductions, collages, photographs ... solid objects, scraps, smears, junk, garbage, rags, ready-makes (sic), found objects ... or an object (like a flat painting) cut into 200 parts.' &lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p104&lt;/ref&gt; As the yearbox developed, Maciunas became increasingly interested in what he referred to as 'Concretism', derived from [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] ideas about the '[[readymade]]'. In effect, concretism refers to works that don't attempt to transform themselves; objects such as George Brecht's ''Exit'' that remains resolutely a sign indicating the exit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The best Fluxus 'Composition' is a most non-personal, 'readymade' one like Brecht's 'Exit'—it does not require any of us to perform it since it happens daily without any 'special' performance of it. Thus our festivals will eliminate themselves (and our need to participate) when they become total readymades (like Brecht's exit) &lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__FSXbtt4Jv4/RyDip8DbmhI/AAAAAAAAAGU/oseRlklVgic/s320/brecht_exit.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The book itself==
[[Image:AFavoriteSong.jpg|thumb|left|250px|2 versions of a single page from ''Fluxus 1'', ''A Favorite Song'' by Joe Jones, next to a version of the same from a copy of the slightly later ''Fluxkit''. These copies in the Silverman collection.]]
The book consists of a number of envelopes bound together by metal bolts, each containing printed works by a single artist. Some copies have the names of the works and of the artists printed onto the envelopes; others are hand-stamped. There is a printed folded sheet attached featuring Maciunas' typographic representations of each artist's name, and the whole book is contained in a wooden case sprayed with the title. The box was used, in part, to facilitate sending the work by post. A number of copies have the recipient's address written directly onto the cover.

Contents might include: a ''Finger Envelope'' by Ay-O featuring an envelope with a slit in it containing a nylon stocking; ''A Favorite Song'' by [[Joe Jones (Fluxus artist)|Joe Jones]] containing 'a scramble of used music typewriter ribbons';&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p279&lt;/ref&gt; ''Disappearing Music for Envelopes'' by Mieko Shiomi consisting of a sequence of envelopes of diminishing sizes within each other; the music score for ''Trois Bagatelles'' by Györgi Ligeti; or ''An Opera'' (see [http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/ewilliams-anopera.html]), a short story written on a long scroll by [[Emmett Williams]].

Copies of ''Fluxus 1'' were assembled over a period of 13 years, and whilst the form and much of the content remained fairly stable, 'Maciunas' attitude toward certain artists and/or works in the anthology changed, some works got lost or mislaid, and others ran out of stock.' &lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Marginal figures in Fluxus, such as [[Giuseppe Chiari (artist-composer-philosopher)|Giuseppe Chiari]] and Sohei Hashimoto, were dropped in favour of artists such as Yoko Ono and the Hi Red Center, whilst [[Dick Higgins]] is noticeable by his absence after a feud with Maciunas over the setting up of the [[Something Else Press]].

There are thought to be more than a hundred boxes manufactured between 1964 and 1977 in New York, and a further one hundred or so pieced together in [[Amsterdam]] by Willem De Ridder, for sale in the european Flux Mail Order Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lib.stanford.edu/art-architecture-library/fluxus-1 Stanford University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sims and Reed, quoting Philpot and Hendricks, [http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=7787669833&amp;searchurl=bt.x%3D0%26bt.y%3D0%26kn%3Dfluxus%2B1%26sortby%3D1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''principal of generic views''' in the study of [[cognition]] stipulates that the interpretation made by an observer of a distal phenomenon should be such as to not require that the observer be in a special position to,  or relationship with, the phenomenon in question.  The principal is a fairly general account of the inductive bias that allows an observer to reconstruct distal phenomena from an impoverished proximal datum.  This principle has been advanced particularly in vision research as an account of how, for example, three-dimensional structure is extracted from an inadequate two-dimensional projection.

The principal of generic views has been discussed by Richards&lt;ref&gt;Knill, D. C., &amp; Richards, W., eds., ''Perception as Bayesian Inference'' ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tcx-XfmXegUC&amp;pg=PA478 p. 478].&lt;/ref&gt; and Hoffman&lt;ref&gt;Gefter, A., [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-illusion-of-reality/479559/ "The Case Against Reality"], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Apr. 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|''Suppose in reality there’s a resource, like water, and you can quantify how much of it there is in an objective order—very little water, medium amount of water, a lot of water. Now suppose your fitness function is linear, so a little water gives you a little fitness, medium water gives you medium fitness, and lots of water gives you lots of fitness—in that case, the organism that sees the truth about the water in the world can win, but only because the fitness function happens to align with the true structure in reality. Generically, in the real world, that will never be the case. Something much more natural is a bell curve—say, too little water you die of thirst, but too much water you drown, and only somewhere in between is good for survival. Now the fitness function doesn’t match the structure in the real world. And that’s enough to send truth to extinction. For example, an organism tuned to fitness might see small and large quantities of some resource as, say, red, to indicate low fitness, whereas they might see intermediate quantities as green, to indicate high fitness. Its perceptions will be tuned to fitness, but not to truth. It won’t see any distinction between small and large—it only sees red—even though such a distinction exists in reality.''—Donald D. Hoffman to Amanda Gefter|group=n}}, and has been given a sophisticated [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] formalization by Freeman{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

==Relation to Bayesian inference==
Another expression of the generic views principal is that the inference of distal structure should be such that the inference would remain substantially the same if the "position" of the observer were moderately altered (perturned).  If the inference made would have been qualitatively or categorically different under a perturbation of the observer, then the inference does not satisfy the '''generic views assumption''', and should be rejected.  (The question of what constitutes a qualitative or categorical difference is an interesting point of detail.)  On this view, it can be argued that the principal of generic views is nothing more than an inference based on the maximum [[posterior probability]] (MAP) which accounts for aspects of observation.  Thus, we infer the distal phenomenon which possess the highest probability of having generated the observations in question, and this probability incorporates (in addition to relevant priors) both the likelihood of the distal phenomenon generating certain observable signals, and the likelihood of the observer transducing those signals in a manner consistent with the observations.  On such an analysis (and with various assumptions invoked), one can obtain a behavior approximating the generic views principal.

== Etymology ==
The word "graphology" is derived from ''grapho-'' (from the Greek γραφή, "writing") and ''[[logos]]'' (from the Greek [[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]], which relates to discussion or theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.finedictionary.com/graphology.html|title = Fine Dictionary|date = |accessdate = 2014-09-22|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Jean-Charles Gille|Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani]] stated in 1991 that [[Juan Huarte de San Juan]]'s 1575 ''Examen de ingenios para las ciencias'' was the first book on handwriting analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gille-Maisani |first= Jean-Charles |year=1991 |title=Psicología de la Escritura |trans-title=Psychology of Handwriting) |location=Barcelona |publisher=Herder|isbn=978-84-254-1705-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huarte |first=Juan |title=Examen de ingenios para las ciencias |trans-title=Examination of inventions for the sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6v4rNcFzqUC |year=1846 |publisher=Imprenta R.

[[Alfred Binet]] was convinced to conduct research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He called it "the science of the future" despite rejection of his results by graphologists.

After [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe as well as the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, [[Ludwig Klages]] founded and published his finding in ''Zeitschrift für Menschenkunde'' (''Journal for the Study of Mankind''). His major contribution to the field can be found in ''Handschrift und Charakter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1929 Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching [[graphoanalysis]]. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between graphoanalysis or holistic graphology. While hard data is lacking, anecdotal evidence indicates that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society (IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Regarding a proposed correlation between gender and handwriting style, a paper by published by James Hartley in 1989 concluded that there was some evidence in support of this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Hartley| first = James| title = Sex Differences in Handwriting: a comment on Spear| journal = British Educational Research Journal| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 141–45| doi=10.1080/0141192910170204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study.&lt;ref&gt;

Rowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: "[i]t's very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting", adding that the practice is "useless... absolutely hopeless".&lt;ref name="duff"&gt;{{cite news

Graphology was also dismissed as a pseudo-science by the skeptic [[James Randi]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|NeYkOHQ683k|James Randi and a Graphologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his May 21, 2013 [[Brian Dunning (author)#Skeptoid podcast|Skeptoid podcast]] episode titled "All About Graphology," [[Skeptical movement|scientific skeptic]] author [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] reports:&lt;ref name= Dunning /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In his book ''The Write Stuff'', Barry Beyerstein summarized the work of Geoffrey Dean, who performed probably the most extensive literature survey of graphology ever done. Dean did a meta-analysis on some 200 studies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Dean showed that graphologists have failed unequivocally to demonstrate the validity or reliability of their art for predicting work performance, aptitudes, or personality. Graphology thus fails according to the standards a genuine psychological test must pass before it can ethically be released for use on an unsuspecting public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;!-- paragraph break in source Dunning --&gt;
Dean found that no particular school of graphology fared better than any other... In fact, no graphologist of any stripe was able to show reliably better performance than untrained amateurs making guesses from the same materials. In the vast majority of studies, neither group exceeded chance expectancy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dunning concludes:&lt;ref name = Dunning/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Other divining techniques like [[iridology]], [[phrenology]], [[palmistry]], and [[astrology]] also have differing schools of thought, require years of training, offer expensive certifications, and fail just as soundly when put to a scientific controlled test. Handwriting analysis does have its plausible-sounding separation from those other techniques though, and that's the whole "handwriting is brainwriting" idea — traits from the brain will be manifested in the way that it controls the muscles of the hand. Unfortunately, this is just as unscientific as the others. No amount of sciencey sounding language can make up for a technique failing when put to a scientifically controlled test.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Additional specific objections===
* The [[Forer effect|Barnum effect]] (the tendency to interpret vague statements as specifically meaningful) and the [[Dr. Fox effect]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ware|first=J.&amp;nbsp;E.|title=The Dr. Fox effect: a study of lecturer effectiveness and ratings of instruction|date=February 1975|last2=Williams|first2=R.&amp;nbsp;G.|author-link=|author2-link=|journal=Journal of Medical Education|volume=50|issue=2|pages=149–56|doi=10.1097/00001888-197502000-00006|pmid=1120118|id=}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2007-05-24--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (the tendency for supposed experts to be validated based on likeability rather than actual skill)  make it difficult to validate methods of personality testing. These phenomena describe the observation that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. See, for example, Tallent (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Tallent, N|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|year=1958|volume=14|pages=243–44|title=On Individualizing the Psychologists's Clinical Evaluation | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(195807)14:3&lt;243::AID-JCLP2270140307&gt;3.0.CO;2-A|postscript=.|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-individualized graphological reports give credence to this criticism.

* Vagueness: Some important principles of graphology are vague enough to allow significant room for a graphologist to skew interpretations to suit a subject or preconceived conclusion. For example, one of the main concepts in the theory of [[Ludwig Klages]] is ''form-niveau'' (or ''form-level''): the overall level of originality, beauty, harmony, style, ''etc.'' of a person's handwriting—a quality that, according to Klages, can be perceived but not measured. According to this theory, the same sign has a positive or negative meaning depending on the subject's overall character and personality as revealed by the ''form-niveau''. In practice, this can lead the graphologist to interpret signs positively or negatively depending on whether the subject has high or low social status.&lt;ref&gt;Ulfried Geuter, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nG9TDItv-QQC&amp;pg=PA95 The Professionalization of Psychology in Nazi Germany]'',  pp. 95–96.

Four academic institutions offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis:
* The [[University of Urbino]], Italy: MA (Graphology)
* Instituto Superior Emerson, Buenos Aires, Argentina: BA (Graphology)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grafologiaemerson.com.ar/ |title=Instituto Superior Emerson |trans-title=Emerson Higher Institute |website=Grafología Emerson |year=2016 |language=Spanish |access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]], Barcelona, Spain: MA (Graphology)

The majority of material in the field is oriented toward the Latin writing system. Courses offered in the subject reflect that bias.

== Vocabulary ==
Every system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means annoyance. In [[Graphoanalysis]], the term indicates a fear of imposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==== Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ====
One of the rules of thumb in [[human resources]]{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} is that if an individual who has an [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]]-defined disability cannot take a test, then nobody can. As a result, tests that cannot be adapted for use by those individuals will not be used by a company.

Handwriting clearly falls into the group of tests that cannot be adapted to be administered to individuals who fall within one or more ADA-defined disabilities. Blind people, for example, do not develop the required fluency in handwriting, for the writing to be correctly analyzed.

Questions that handwriting analysts ask before doing an analysis can be illegal under this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools.

Research in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lighton |first=R.&amp;nbsp;E. |title=A Graphological Examination of the Handwriting of Air Pilots|work=Thesis in the Faculty of Arts |publisher=University of Pretoria|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; to guarded
success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Luca, E. S.|title=Major Aptitudes and Personality Characteristics of 42 Dental Students as Evaluated Through Their Handwriting|journal=New York Journal of Dentistry|year=1973|volume=43|pages=281–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Steven L. |last2=Vaught |first2=Steve |title=The write stuff: What the evidence says about using handwriting analysis in hiring |work=SAM Advanced Management Journal |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=31–35 |date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical grounds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Daryl |last=Koehn|title=Handwriting Analysis In Pre-Employment Screening|journal=The Online Journal of Ethics|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on legal grounds in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Julie |last=Spohn|title=The Legal Implications of Graphology|journal=Washington University Law Quarterly|volume=73|issue=3|date=Fall 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological analysis ===
Graphology has been used clinically by European counselors and psychotherapists.&lt;ref name="Wittlich 1956"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wittlich 1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Müller 1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Müller 1943"/&gt; When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, marital counseling, or vocational counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Poizner, Annette (2012). Clinical Graphology: An Interpretive Manual for Mental Health Practitioners. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital compatibility===
In its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s) within the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Karohs, Erika (1994) SSS. Pebble Beach, CA&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that after knowing and understanding how each individual in the relationship differs from every other individual in the relationship, the resulting marriage will be more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;IGAS (1976) MGA. Chicago, IL: IGAS&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical diagnosis ===
Medical graphology is probably the most controversial branch of handwriting analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

''The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice'', amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4637">According to the '''growing block universe theory of time''' (or the '''growing block view'''), the past and present exist and the future does not exist. The present is an objective property, to be compared with a moving spotlight. By the passage of time more of the world comes into being; therefore, the block universe is said to be growing. The growth of the block is supposed to happen in the present, a very thin slice of [[spacetime]], where more of spacetime is continually coming into being.

The growing block view is an alternative to both [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (according to which past, present, and future all exist) and [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] (according to which only the present exists). It is held to be closer to [[common sense|common-sense]] intuitions than the alternatives. [[C. D. Broad]] was a proponent of the theory (1923). Some modern defenders are [[Michael Tooley]] (in 1997) and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]] (in 2004).

==Criticism==
Recently several philosophers, David Braddon-Mitchell (2004), Craig Bourne and [[Trenton Merricks]] have noted that if the growing block view is correct then we have to conclude that we do not know whether now is now. (The first occurrence of "now" is an [[indexical]] and the second occurrence of "now" is the [[objective tensed property]]. Their observation implies the following sentence: "This part of spacetime has the property of being present".)

Take [[Socrates]] discussing, in the past, with [[Gorgias]], and at the same time thinking that the discussion is occurring now. According to the growing block view, [[Grammatical tense|tense]] is a real property of the world so his thought is about now, the objective present. He thinks, tenselessly, that his thought is occurring on the edge of being.  But we know he is wrong because he is in the past; he does not know that now is now. But how can we be sure we are not in the same position? There is nothing special with Socrates. Therefore, we do not know whether now is now.

However, some{{who|date=October 2017}} have argued that there is an ontological distinction between the past and the present. For instance, Forrest (2004) argues that although there exists a past, it is lifeless and inactive. Consciousness, as well as the flow of time, is not active within the past and can only occur at the boundary of the block universe in which the present exists.

'''Han Seung-oh''' ({{ko-hhrm|한승오|韓昇旿}}; born 1978) was a [[South Korea]]n human rights activist and civil activist. He was one of founding members of [[Man of Korea]] (남성연대) also 2nd leader of [[Man of Korea]], July 29, 2013 until August 14.

Han was born in Seoul. In 2008 he was a founding member of Man of Korea, also May 1, 2012, he was appointed to one Leader of General Affairs Team for [[Sung Jae-gi]]. On July 8 and July 22 he was Participation of Visit protest for [[Jecheon Women's Library]] with [[Sung Jae-gi]]. 8 month later, he was appointed to Secretary General of [[Man of Korea]].

In July 25, 2013, he was nominated as successor to [[Sung Jae-gi]], before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wstarnews.hankyung.com/apps/news?popup=0&amp;nid=01&amp;c1=01&amp;c2=01&amp;c3=00&amp;nkey=201307271400311&amp;mode=sub_view ‘투신’ 성재기, 실종 25시간 지나도록 생사 확인 안돼] 한국경제 2013.07.27 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 26, 2013 Han was one of visitors [[Sung Jae-gi]]'s suicide, but he was did not discourage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vop.co.kr/A00000661759.html ‘성재기 투신’ 사고사로 수사 종료···남성연대 대국민 사과] 민중의 소리 2013.07.30 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; after four days, Seoul city police investigated, with an innocent disposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2013&amp;no=653152 경찰 "성재기 투신 지켜본 사람들…자살방조 아냐"] 매일경제 2013.07.30 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 26 to August 14, Han was Sung Jae-gi's funeral and case settled. but this did not rectify infighting so there was demand resignation from some member of [[Man of Korea]]. On August 21 2013, he resigned.

The '''heath hen''' (''Tympanuchus cupido cupido'') was a distinctive subspecies of the [[greater prairie chicken]], ''Tympanuchus cupido'', a large [[North America]]n [[bird]] in the [[grouse]] family, or possibly a distinct species, that became extinct in 1932.

Heath hens lived in the scrubby [[Pine barrens|heathland barrens]] of coastal [[North America]] from southernmost [[New Hampshire]] to northern [[Virginia]] in historical times, but possibly south to [[Florida]] prehistorically.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  The prairie chickens, ''[[Tympanuchus]]'' species, on the other hand, inhabited [[prairie]]s from [[Texas]] north to [[Indiana]] and the [[Dakotas]], and in earlier times in mid-southern [[Canada]].

Heath hens were extremely common in their habitat during Colonial times, but being a [[Galliformes|gallinaceous]] bird, they were hunted by settlers extensively for food. In fact, many have speculated that the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]]' [[first Thanksgiving]] dinner featured heath hens and not [[wild turkey]]. By the late 18th century, the heath hen had a reputation as poor man's food for being so cheap and plentiful; somewhat earlier [[Thomas L. Winthrop]] had reported that they lived on the [[Boston Common]] (presumably when it was still used to graze cows, etc.) and that servants would sometimes bargain with a new employer for ''not'' being given heath hen for food more often than two or three days a week.&lt;ref name=thompson1971&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Daniel Q.|author2=Ralph H. Smith|year=1971|title=The Forest Primeval in the Northeast&amp;nbsp;– A Great Myth?|journal=Proceedings Annual Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference|volume=10|pages=263–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Heath Hen, Boston.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stuffed female specimen at [[Boston Museum of Science]]]]
A first [[mtDNA]] [[D-loop]] [[haplotype]] comparison between heath hen specimens and prairie-chickens&lt;ref name=Palkovacs/&gt; brought the unexpected result that all heath hens tested formed a group very distinct from mainland birds, being most similar genetically to greater prairie chickens from [[Wisconsin]]. A more recent study&lt;ref name=Johnson2006/&gt; of the same parameter by Johnson and Dunn verified these results, but disagreed in the placement of the heath hen respective to its relatives, suggesting a closer relationship with the [[lesser prairie chicken]] instead.

However, Johnson and Dunn caution against reading too much into these results: while the lesser prairie chicken is considered a distinct species and the genetically apparently equally distinct heath hen would thus likewise deserve species status.&lt;ref&gt;In this case, the correct nomenclature for the Greater Prairie-Chicken would be ''Tympanuchus pinnatus pinnatus''; ''Tympanuchus pinnatus attwateri'' for [[Attwater's Prairie Chicken]].&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA haplotypes in small populations that have undergone [[population bottleneck|bottlenecks]] are likely to show higher divergence than they would judging from taxonomic status alone&lt;ref name=Johnson2003/&gt; (see also [[genetic drift]]). Thus, given the fact that all heath hen specimens from known localities studied by Johnson and Dunn are Martha's Vineyard birds&amp;nbsp;– where the population may never have exceeded several thousand due to the limited space and limited genetic exchange with the mainland&amp;nbsp;– it is possible that the low genetic diversity and apparent distinctness of the heath hen are an artifact of the small number of useful specimens, all from the same close-knit population.

Prairie chickens were indiscriminately introduced to the Eastern Seaboard after the heath hen was gone from the mainland, but failed to thrive. There exist a considerable number of supposed heath hen specimens in public collections today, but many&amp;nbsp;– all mainland specimens and those with insufficient locality information&amp;nbsp;– cannot be unequivocally assumed to be heath hens. For example, a mere 7 unequivocal heath hen eggs&amp;nbsp;– equivalent to a very small [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]&lt;ref name=Luther/&gt; – are known to be held in public collections today. That the [[genus]] ''Tympanuchus'' apparently evolved rapidly and therefore has high morphological but low genetic distinctness between taxa further complicates research.
[[File:Heath Hen display.jpg|thumb|Photo of a displaying male from 1900]] 
It is also important to note that while introductions of the greater prairie chicken (''Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus'') were occurring, true heath hens (''Tympanuchus cupido cupido'') are distinct enough in morphological features to be separated from the greater prairie chicken. Taking a generous starting date of ~1810 when introductions could have started, and taking into account that [[Lewis and Clark]] did not even return from their expedition until 1806,  gives roughly a 60-year period of possible introductions. From an evolutionary biology aspect, in a 60, or even 100-year timeframe, a species like the greater prairie chicken would not have been able to evolve to the point where he would so closely resemble the native heath hen that he could not be distinguished.

A prime example of this would be in opposing the lesser prairie chicken (''[[Tympanuchus pallidicinctus]]'') which differs from the greater prairie chicken in being smaller, lighter, and having less distinct barring, to the heath hen, which was smaller, darker, and had more distinct barring. Meaning that the lesser prairie chicken can be readily distinguished from the greater prairie chicken both morphologically and genetically (much like the heath hen) even if he were found in an area that the greater prairie
chicken inhabited.

The apparent distinctness of the species and the failure of the early introductions raises the question of whether the heath hen was uniquely (by comparison with its relatives) adapted to the more [[oceanic climate]] of its former area of occurrence, and in consequence, whether a future attempt to establish a population of the western birds on Martha's Vineyard could be bound to fail, possibly even by competing for funding and other resources jeopardizing the extant but much declined populations of the prairie-chickens. Clearly, more research is necessary, for example by analyzing mainland specimens to determine whether they can be assigned to a taxon from molecular and morphological characters.

==Description==
[[File:Heath Hens.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Male and female]]
Very similar to the [[greater prairie chicken]] of the [[Great Plains]], but slightly smaller,&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt; the length of the bird was approximately 17&amp;nbsp;inches (43&amp;nbsp;cm) and weight was about two pounds (0.9&amp;nbsp;kg). A specimen weighing three pounds was claimed by [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] but that figure was not verified by later ornithologists.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbush/&gt; Several key plumage characteristics separated the heath hens from their Great Plains counterparts: heath hens generally displayed a strong reddish hue in their plumage, especially in their [[Crop (anatomy)#Birds|crop]] area, and much thicker barring throughout the breast and sides. Their pinnae (horns) were generally pointed, and tails were a greyish brown.

==Extinction==
[[Image:Tympanuchus cupido cupidoAEP11LA.png|thumb|Two displaying males with a female in the background]]
Owing to intense hunting pressure, the population declined rapidly. Perhaps as early as the 1840s, at any rate by 1870, all heath hens were [[Local extinction|extirpate]]d on the mainland. There were about 300 left on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], off [[Massachusetts]], but by 1890 this number had declined to 120–200 birds, mainly due to predation by [[feral]] cats and [[poaching]]. By the late 19th century, there were about 70 left. These were protected by a hunting ban and by the establishment in 1908 of the "Heath Hen Reserve" (today the [[Manuel F. Correllus State Forest]]), and the population rapidly grew to almost 2000: by the mid-1910s, observing the birds on their [[Lek (animal behaviour)|lekking grounds]] had become something of a tourist attraction. However, a destructive fire during the 1916 nesting season, severe winters, an unusual influx of predatory [[northern goshawk|goshawk]]s, [[inbreeding]], an excess number of male individuals and apparently an epidemic of [[Histomoniasis|blackhead disease]], which might have been transmitted by [[poultry]], brought the numbers down quickly; after a last recovery to 600 in 1920, the population began its final decline.

In 1927, only about a dozen were left&amp;nbsp;– a mere two being females&amp;nbsp;– despite being afforded the best protection according to contemporary science; that number had declined to a handful, all males, by the end of the year. After December 8, 1928, apparently only one male survived,&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt; lovingly nicknamed "Booming Ben". He was last seen on his traditional lekking ground between [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]] and today's [[Martha's Vineyard Airport]] on March 11, 1932 – early in the breeding season -, and thus presumably died, about 8 years old, days or only hours afterwards from unknown causes.

Heath hens were one of the first bird species that Americans tried to save from [[extinction]]. As early as 1791, a bill "for the preservation of heath-hen and other game" was introduced in the [[New York State legislature]]. Some representatives misinterpreted the bill when it was read as an act to protect "[[Iroquois|Indians]] and other {{linktext|heathen}}";&lt;ref&gt;"The bill was entitled, 'An Act for the preservation of Heath-Hen, and other game.' The honest Chairman of the Assembly&amp;nbsp;— no sportsman, I suppose&amp;nbsp;— read the title, 'An Act for the preservation of Heathen, and other game' !" ([Alexander Wilson], Thomas Mayo Brewer, ed. ''Wilson's American Ornithology: with notes by Jardine...'', 1840: 257).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the legislation was passed, it turned out to be unenforceable.

Although the effort to save the heath hen from extinction was ultimately unsuccessful, it paved the way for conservation of other species. The establishment of the reserve on the open shrubland of what was then called the Great Plain in the Vineyard may have accelerated the heath hen's extinction. Fires were a normal part of the environment, but with the attempt to suppress fires instead of enforcing [[ecological succession]] with [[controlled burn]]s, open habitat quality decreased and undergrowth accumulated until a normally limited fire would have disastrous consequences, as it did in 1916.&lt;ref name="thompson1971" /&gt;  Lack of awareness of the region's historical [[fire ecology]] also led the state legislature to require [[firebreak]]s when protecting the heath hen.&lt;ref name="thompson1971" /&gt;

Realizing the degradation that has affected the State Forest (and although it does hold remarkable [[biodiversity]], prevents it from being utilized to its full potential), reestablishment of the original shrubland/heath/woods mosaic and eventual introduction of the closely related Greater Prairie Chickens as an "[[umbrella species]]" that serves as an indicator of good habitat quality has been discussed since the late 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17181">'''Ho{{okina}}oponopono''' (IPA [ho.ʔo.po.no.po.no]) is a [[Hawaii]]an practice of [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]] and [[forgiveness]]. The Hawaiian word translates into English simply as ''correction'', with the synonyms ''manage'' or ''supervise'', and the antonym ''careless''.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=google+translate&amp;oq=google+translate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l4.4119j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.co.uk/#auto/en/Ho%CA%BBoponopono Translation for Hoʻoponopono given as 'Edit' or 'Correction'] ''translate.google.co.uk'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0824807030 Mary Kawena Pukui, Samuel H. Elbert - 1986: Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English, English-Hawaiian] ''books.google.com'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar forgiveness practices are performed on islands throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]] and [[New Zealand]]. Traditional ''Ho{{okina}}oponopono'' is practiced by [[Native Hawaiians|Indigenous Hawaiian]] healers, often within the extended family by a family member. There is also a [[New Age]] practice that goes by the same name.

==Polynesian antecedents==
[[File:Oceania (World-Factbook).jpg|thumb|Map of Oceania]]
In many [[Polynesian culture]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} it is believed that a person's errors (called ''hara'' or ''hala'') caused [[illness]]. Some believe error angers the gods, others that it attracts malevolent gods, and still others believe the guilt caused by error made one sick. "In most cases, however, specific 'untie-error' rites could be performed to atone for such errors and thereby diminish one's accumulation of them."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the islands of [[Vanuatu]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], people believe that illness usually is caused by sexual misconduct or anger. "If you are angry for two or three days, sickness will come," said one local man.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy that counters this sickness is confession. The patient, or a family member, may confess. If no one confesses an error, the patient may die. The Vanuatu people believe that secrecy is what gives power to the illness. When the error is confessed, it no longer has power over the person.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other islanders, including Hawaiians, people of [[Tikopia]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], and on [[Rarotonga]] in the [[Cook Islands]], believe that the sins of the father will fall upon the children. If a child is sick, the parents are suspected of quarreling or misconduct. In addition to sickness, social disorder could cause sterility of land or other disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Harmony could be restored only by confession and apology.

In [[Pukapuka]], it was customary to hold sort of a confessional over patients to determine an appropriate course of action in order to heal them.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar traditions are found in [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tahiti]],&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; and among the [[Māori people|Maori]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buck, pp. 405–06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handy, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hala lei.JPG|thumb|right|A lei made from the fruit of the hala or pandanus tree. A hala lei was given at the completion of ho{{okina}}oponopono in the tradition of kahuna Makaweliweli of Moloka{{okina}}i]]

"Ho{{okina}}oponopono" is defined in the ''Hawaiian Dictionary'' as:

(a) "To put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up make orderly or neat, administer, superintend, supervise, manage, edit, work carefully or neatly; to make ready, as canoemen preparing to catch a wave."

(b) "Mental cleansing: family conferences in which relationships were set right (''ho{{okina}}oponopono'') through prayer, discussion, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and [[forgiveness]]." &lt;ref name="HDict"&gt;Pukui, Elbert, pp. 340–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally, ''ho{{okina}}o'' is a particle used to make an actualizing verb from the following noun, as would "to" before a noun in English. Here, it creates a verb from the noun ''[[pono]]'', which is defined as: "...goodness, uprightness, morality, moral qualities, correct or proper procedure, excellence, well-being, prosperity, welfare, benefit, true condition or nature, duty; moral, fitting, proper, righteous, right, upright, just, virtuous, fair, beneficial, successful, in perfect order, accurate, correct, eased, relieved; should, ought, must, necessary."&lt;ref name="HDict" /&gt;

''Ponopono'' is defined as "to put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up, make orderly or neat."

==Traditional practice==
Hawaiian scholar Nana Veary in her book, ''Change We Must: My Spiritual Journey''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3VsHAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=9781877982071&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN_PGD3c3WAhVR2WMKHQ4BAtoQ6AEIKDAA Nana Veary: Change We Must: My Spiritual Journey]  ''books.google.com'', accessed 19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that ho'oponopono was a practice in [[Ancient Hawaii]]&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee, pp. 61–62, 67&lt;/ref&gt; and this is supported by oral histories from contemporary Hawaiian elders.&lt;ref&gt;Chai, pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt; Pukui first recorded her experiences and observations from her childhood (born 1895) in her 1958 book.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Handy, pp. 184–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word ''ho{{okina}}oponopono'' was not used, early Hawaiian historians documented a belief that illness was caused by breaking [[kapu]], or spiritual laws, and that the illness could not be cured until the sufferer atoned for this transgression, often with the assistance of a praying priest (''[[kahuna]] pule'') or healing priest (''kahuna lapa{{okina}}au''). Forgiveness was sought from the gods&lt;ref&gt;Kamakau, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malo, p. 75 (English)&lt;/ref&gt; or from the person with whom there was a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Titcomb&lt;/ref&gt;

Pukui described it as a practice of extended family members meeting to "make right" broken family relations. Some families met daily or weekly, to prevent problems from erupting.&lt;ref&gt;Chai, pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; Others met when a person became ill, believing that illness was caused by the stress of anger, guilt, recriminations and lack of forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Kupuna Nana Veary wrote that when any of the children in her family fell ill, her grandmother would ask the parents, "What have you done?" They believed that healing could come only with complete forgiveness of the whole family.&lt;ref&gt;Veary, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==
Ho{{okina}}oponopono corrects, restores and maintains good relationships among family members and with their gods or God by getting to the causes and sources of trouble. Usually the most senior member of the family conducts it. He or she gathers the family together. If the family is unable to work through a problem, they turn to a respected outsider.

The process begins with prayer. A statement of the problem is made, and the transgression discussed. Family members are expected to work problems through and cooperate, not "hold fast to the fault". One or more periods of silence may be taken for reflection on the entanglement of emotions and injuries. Everyone's feelings are acknowledged. Then confession, repentance and forgiveness take place. Everyone releases (''kala'') each other, letting go. They cut off the past (''{{okina}}oki''), and together they close the event with a ceremonial feast, called ''pani'', which often included eating ''limu kala'' or [[kala seaweed]], symbolic of the release.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Haertig, Lee pp. 60–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In a form used by the family of ''kahuna'' Makaweliweli of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i, the completion of ho{{okina}}oponopono is represented by giving the person forgiven a [[lei (Hawaii)|lei]] made from the fruit of the [[Hala (tree)|hala tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern uses==
"Aunty" Malia Craver, who worked with the Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani Children's Centers (QLCC) for more than 30 years, taught courses in traditional ho{{okina}}oponopono.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keepers of culture named  |work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/01/13/news/story09.html |date=January 13, 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2000, she spoke about it to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2000/08/09/news/story9.html "Aunty" Malia Craver to address United Nations] 8 September 2000, ''archives.starbulletin.com'', accessed  19 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional applications===
In the late 20th century, courts in Hawai{{okina}}i began to order juvenile and adult offenders to work with an elder who would conduct ho{{okina}}oponopono for their families, as a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]]. The ho{{okina}}oponopono is conducted in the traditional way, without court interference, with a practitioner picked by the family from a list of court-approved providers.&lt;ref&gt;Steuterman, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Some native practitioners provide ho{{okina}}oponopono to clients who otherwise might seek family counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Shook&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom from karma===
[[File:Lapakahi3.jpg|thumb|right|The site of the partially restored remains of the village of Koai{{Okina}}e in the ''Lapakahi State Historical Park'' of the island of ''Hawaii'', North Kohala district. Beginning in the early 20th century, this village has been a center for lapa{{okina}}au]]
In 1976 [[Morrnah Simeona]], regarded as a healing priest or ''[[kahuna]] lapa{{okina}}au'', adapted the traditional ho{{okina}}oponopono of family mutual forgiveness to the social realities of the modern day. For this she extended it both to a general problem solving process outside the family and to a psycho-spiritual self-help rather than group process.

Simeona's version is influenced by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and [[Edgar Cayce]]. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative [[karma]], saying that "you have to experience by yourself what you have done to others." But that you are the creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;Pali Jae Lee, Koko Willis, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past [[reincarnation]]s, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'."&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, pp. 45–61&lt;/ref&gt; She did not use [[mantra]]s or conditioning exercises.

Her teachings include: there is a Divine Creator who takes care of altruistic pleas of Men; "when the phrase 'And it is done' is used after a prayer, it means Man's work ends and God's begins."&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; "Self-Identity" signifies, e.g. during the ho{{okina}}oponopono, that the three selves or aspects of consciousness are balanced and connected with the Divine Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Different from egoistic prayers, "altruistic prayers like ho{{okina}}oponopono, where you also pray for the release of other entities and objects, reach the Divine plane or Cosmos because of their high vibrations. From that plane the Divine energy or "mana" would come,"&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; which would transform the painful part of the memory of the wrong actions in all participants to "Pure Light", on whatever plane they are existing; "all are set free".&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Through this transmutation in the mind the problems will lose their energy for physical effects, and healing or balancing is begun. In this sense, Simeona's mana is not the same as the traditional Polynesian understanding of [[mana]].

Pacifica Seminars, founded by [[Morrnah Simeona]], started the first Ho'oponopono seminars in [[Germany]]. Seminars are still held on a regular basis in Germany, Poland, France, and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, Morrnah, ''Selbst-Identität durch Ho{{okina}}oponopono'', ''Self-identity through Ho´oponopono'' p. 128, Pacifica Seminars (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Simeona, Morrnah |url=http://www.hooponopono.eu/artykul_anny_kligert.htm |title=''Parę słów o moim spotkaniu z Ho´oponopono'' lit.

===State of Zero===
After Simeona's death in 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored a book with Joe Vitale called ''Zero Limits''&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Simeona's Ho{{okina}}oponopono teachings. Len makes no claim to be a ''kahuna''. In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Ho{{okina}}oponopono is getting to "the state of Zero, where we would have zero limits. No memories. No identity."&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the [[mantra]], "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.  Thank you."&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility,&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If one would take complete responsibility for one's life, then everything one sees, hears, tastes, touches, or in any way experiences would be one's responsibility because it is in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The problem would not be with our external reality, it would be with ourselves. Total Responsibility, according to Hew Len, advocates that everything exists as a projection from inside the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Len, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Identity politics''' are [[political]] positions based on the interests and perspectives of social groups with which people identify. Identity politics includes the ways in which people's politics are shaped by aspects of their identity through loosely{{Clarification needed|loosely or "somewhat"?|date=September 2018}} correlated social organizations. Examples include social organizations based on age, [[religion]], [[social class]] or [[caste]], [[culture]], [[dialect]], [[disability]], [[education]], [[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[sex]], [[gender identity]], [[generation]], [[Job|occupation]], [[profession]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[political party]] affiliation, [[sexual orientation]], [[human settlement|settlement]], [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] habitation, and [[military veteran|veteran status]].

The term "identity politics" has been in use in various forms since the 1960s or 1970s, but has been applied with, at times, radically different meanings by different populations.&lt;ref name="Wiarda-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|title=Identity Politics|first=Cressida|last=Heyes|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|CSLI]], [[Stanford University]]| accessdate=2012-11-11|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''identity politics'' has been used in political discourse since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Wiarda-2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiarda |first=Howard J. |title=Political Culture, Political Science, and Identity Politics: An Uneasy Alliance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hHtCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150 |date=8 April 2016 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |isbn=978-1-317-07885-2 |oclc=982044314 |orig-year=1st pub. [[Ashgate]]:2014 |accessdate=21 February 2018 |quote=There are disputes regarding the origins of the term 'identity politics' .... Almost all authors, even while disagreeing over who was the first to use the term, agree that its original usage goes back to the 1970s and even the 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aim of identity politics has been for those feeling oppressed by and actively suffering under systemic social inequities to articulate their suffering and felt oppression in terms of their own experience by processes of [[consciousness-raising]] and collective action. One of the older written examples of it can be found in the April 1977 statement of the [[black feminist]] group, [[Combahee River Collective]], which was subsequently reprinted in a number of anthologies,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism'', ed. Zillah R. Eisenstein (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Smith]] and the Combahee River Collective have been credited with coining the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier-Thomas|first1=edited by Bettye|last2=Franklin|first2=V.P.|title=Sisters in the struggle African American women in the civil rights-black power movement|date=2001|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-1603-2|page=39|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iR6NVzFEntgC&amp;pg=PA194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Duchess.

In the process of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we began to recognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression....We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation are us. Our politics evolve from a healthy love for ourselves, our sisters and our community which allows us to continue our struggle and work. This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression.

Identity politics, as a mode of categorizing, are closely connected to the ascription that some social groups are oppressed (such as women, [[ethnic minorities]], and [[sexual minorities]]); that is, the claim that individuals belonging to those groups are, by virtue of their identity, more vulnerable to forms of oppression such as [[cultural imperialism]], [[violence]], [[exploitation of labour]], [[marginalization]], or powerlessness.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida|title=Identity Politics|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=3 May 2017|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these lines of social difference can be seen as ways to gain empowerment or avenues through which to work towards a more equal society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some groups have combined identity politics and [[Marxist]] [[social class]] analysis and [[class consciousness]] — the most notable example being the [[Black Panther Party]] — but this is not necessarily characteristic of the form. Another example is [[MOVE]], members of which mixed [[black nationalism]] with [[anarcho-primitivism]] (a radical form of [[green politics]] based on the idea that civilization is an instrument of oppression, advocating the return to a [[hunter gatherer]] society).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=by Committee|title=Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (MOVE) Records {{!}} Temple University Libraries|url=https://library.temple.edu/scrc/philadelphia-special-1|website=library.temple.edu|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=no attrib.|title=On a Move – Website of the MOVE Organization|url=http://onamove.com/|website=onamove.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity politics can be left wing or right wing, with examples of the latter being [[Ulster Loyalism]], [[Islamism]] and [[Christian Identity]] movements.

During the 1980s, the politics of identity became very prominent and it was linked to a new wave of social movement activism.&lt;ref name='Calhoun'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calhoun |first1=Craig |authorlink1=Craig Calhoun |chapter=Social Theory and the Politics of Identity|title=Social Theory and the Politics of Identity|editor=Craig Calhoun (Ed.) |publisher=Blackwell |year=1994 |isbn=978-1-55786-473-4}}{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-2010s have seen a marked rise of identity politics, including [[White nationalism|white identity politics in the United States]].  This phenomenon is attributed to increased demographic diversity and the prospect of whites becoming a minority in America.  Such shifts have driven many to affiliate with conservative causes including those not related to diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bartels |first=Larry |date=16 April 2014 |title=Can the Republican Party thrive on white identity? |url= |newspaper=The Washington Post |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the presidential election of [[Donald Trump]], who won the support of prominent white supremacists such as [[David Duke]] and [[Richard B.

==Debates and criticism==

===Nature of the movement===
The term ''identity politics'' has been applied and misapplied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book ''[[The Disuniting of America]]''.  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerless (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that "movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than...perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference".&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Chaudhary &amp; Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, {{ISBN|978-81-8220-233-7}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has similarly suggested that identity politics causes (rather then simply recognizes and acts on) political schisms along lines of social identity. Thus, he contrasts the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying "... [[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, ... a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview—which has nothing to do with the world—from any questioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these and other ways, a political perspective oriented to one's own well being can be recast as causing the divisions that it insists upon making visible.

In this same vein, author [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] argues that identity politics often marginalize the [[working class]], saying that: {{quote|In the 1950s and 1960s, left-wing intellectuals who were both inspired and informed by a powerful labour movement wrote hundreds of books and articles on working-class issues. Such work would help shape the views of politicians at the very top of the Labour Party. Today, progressive intellectuals are far more interested in issues of identity. ... Of course, the struggles for the emancipation of women, gays, and ethnic minorities are exceptionally important causes. New Labour has co-opted them, passing genuinely progressive legislation on gay equality and women's rights, for example. But it is an agenda that has happily co-existed with the sidelining of the working class in politics, allowing New Labour to protect its radical flank while pressing ahead with Thatcherite policies.|Owen Jones|''[[Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen|title=Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class|date=2012|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1-84467-864-8|page=255|edition=updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===LGBT issues===

The [[gay liberation]] movement of the late 1960s through the mid-1980s urged [[lesbian]]s and [[gay men]] to engage in radical [[direct action]], and to counter societal shame with [[gay pride]].&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first= Amy |title=An Army of Ex-Lovers: My life at the Gay Community News |year=2007 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |isbn=978-1558496217 |pages=xi-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[feminism|feminist]] spirit of the personal being political, the most basic form of activism was an emphasis on [[coming out]] to family, friends and colleagues, and living life as an openly lesbian or [[gay]] person.&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro/&gt; While the 1970s were the peak of "gay liberation" in New York City and other urban areas in the United States, "gay liberation" was the term still used instead of "gay pride" in more oppressive areas into the mid-1980s, with some organizations opting for the more inclusive, "lesbian and gay liberation".&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first= Amy |title=An Army of Ex-Lovers: My life at the Gay Community News |year=2007 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |isbn=978-1558496217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While women and [[transgender]] activists had lobbied for more inclusive names from the beginning of the movement, the [[initialism]] [[LGBT]], or "[[Queer]]" as a counterculture shorthand for [[LGBT]], did not gain much acceptance as an umbrella term until much later in the 1980s, and in some areas not until the '90s or even '00s.&lt;ref name=HoffmanIntro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hollibaugh&gt;{{cite web|author1=phoenix|title=Gay Rights Are Not Queer Liberation|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/gay-rights-are-not-queer-liberation-the-nation-interviews-amber-hollibaugh-140431/|website=autostraddle.com|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period in the United States, identity politics were largely seen in these communities in the definitions espoused by writers such as self-identified, "black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother" [[Audre Lorde]]'s [[Audre Lorde#Personal identity|view]], that [[lived experience]] matters, defines us, and is the only thing that grants authority to speak; that, "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive."&lt;ref name=Zami&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]|last=Lorde|first=Audre|publisher=Crossing Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-89594-123-7|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;Kemp, Yakini B.

By the 2000s, in some areas of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[queer studies]], notably those around [[gender]], the idea of "identity politics" began to shift away from that of naming and claiming lived experience, and authority arising from lived experience, to one emphasizing choice and performance.&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality|work=Homosexuality|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 November 2011|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/#QueTheSocConSex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some who draw on the work of authors like [[Judith Butler]], stress the importance of not assuming an already existing identity, but of remaking and unmaking identities through "performance".&lt;ref name=ButlerPerformative&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|last = Butler|first = Judith|date = 1988 |journal = Theatre Journal |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=519–531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in the field of [[Queer theory]] have at times taken this to the extent as to now argue that "queer", despite generations of specific use, no longer needs to refer to any specific sexual orientation at all; that it is now only about disrupting the mainstream, with author [[David M. Halperin]] arguing that straight people may now also self-identify as "queer,"&lt;ref name=Halperin&gt;{{cite book |author=Halperin, David M. |title=[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]: And Other Essays on Greek Love |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-415-90097-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some believe, is a form of [[cultural appropriation]] which robs gays and lesbians of their identity and makes invisible and irrelevant the actual, lived experience that causes them to be marginalized in the first place.

There are also supporters of identity politics who have developed their stances on the basis of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s work (namely, "Can the Subaltern Speak?") and have described some forms of identity politics as [[strategic essentialism]], a form which has sought to work with [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] discourses to reform the understanding of "universal" goals.&lt;ref name=Spivak&gt;{{Cite book|title=Other Asias|last=Spivak|first=Gayatri Chakrovotry|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1405102070|location=Malden, M.A.|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abraham&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Susan|year=2009|title=Strategic Essentialism in Nationalist Discourses: Sketching a Feminist Agenda in the Study of Religion|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/266799|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|volume=25| issue = 1|pages=156–161|via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritze&gt;G.

===Critiques of identity politics===
[[File:Anti-capitalism color— Restored.png|right|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster "[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]" (1911)]]
Some critics argue that groups based on a particular shared identity (e.g. race, or gender identity) can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, similar to the history of [[divide and rule]] strategies. Sociologist [[Charles Derber]] asserts that the American left is "largely an identity-politics party" and that it "offers no broad critique of the political economy of capitalism. It focuses on reforms for blacks and women and so forth. But it doesn’t offer a contextual analysis within capitalism." Both he and [[David North (socialist)|David North]] of the [[Socialist Equality Party (United States)|Socialist Equality Party]] posit that these fragmented and isolated identity movements which permeate the left have allowed for a far-right resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hedges |first=Chris |date=5 February 2018 |title=The Bankruptcy of the American Left|url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/bankruptcy-american-left/|work=Truthdig |location= |access-date=9 February 2018|authorlink= Chris Hedges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critiques of identity politics have also been expressed on other grounds by writers such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]],&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric (2 May 1996).

Hence, Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as [[queer nationalism]], [[Islamism]], [[Cornish nationalism]] or [[Ulster Loyalism]] are just other versions of [[bourgeois nationalism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The view that identity politics rooted in challenging racism, sexism, and the like actually obscures class inequality is widespread in the United States and many other Western nations; however, this framing ignores how class-based politics are identity politics themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/18/class-and-identity-politics-are-not-mutually-exclusive-the-left-should-use-this-to-its-benefit|title=Class and identity politics are not mutually exclusive.

=== Intersectional critiques ===
In her journal article ''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color,'' [[Kimberle Crenshaw]] treats identity politics as a process that brings people together based on a shared aspect of their identity. Crenshaw applauds identity politics for bringing African Americans (and other non-white people), gays and lesbians, and other oppressed groups together in community and progress.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|author-link=Kimberle Crenshaw|date=1 January 1991|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|jstor=1229039|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–99|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Crenshaw also points out that frequently groups come together based on a shared political identity but then fail to examine differences among themselves within their own group: "The problem with identity politics is not that it fails to transcend differences, as some critics charge, but rather the opposite—that it frequently conflates or ignores intragroup differences."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Crenshaw argues that when society thinks "black", they think black&amp;nbsp;''male'', and when society thinks feminism, they think&amp;nbsp;''white''&amp;nbsp;woman. When considering black women, at least two aspects of their identity are the subject of oppression: their race and their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|publisher=University of Chicago Legal Forum|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=139–68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crenshaw proposes instead that identity politics are useful but that we must be aware of&amp;nbsp;[[intersectionality]]&amp;nbsp;and the role it plays in identity politics. Nira Yuval-Davis supports Crenshaw's critiques&amp;nbsp;in ''Intersectionality and Feminist Politics''&amp;nbsp;and explains that "Identities are individual and collective narratives that answer the question 'who am/are I/we?"&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuval-Davis|first=Nira|date=1 August 2006|title=Intersectionality and Feminist Politics|url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/content/13/3/193|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=193–209|doi=10.1177/1350506806065752|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her journal article &amp;nbsp;''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color'', Crenshaw provides the example of the&amp;nbsp;[[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]]/[[Anita Hill]]&amp;nbsp;controversy to expand on her point. Anita Hill came forward and accused Supreme Court Justice Nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment; Clarence Thomas would be the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court. Crenshaw argues that when Anita Hill came forward she was deemed anti-black in the movement against racism, and though she came forward on the feminist issue of sexual harassment, she was excluded because when considering feminism, it is the narrative of white middle-class women that prevails.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crenshaw concludes that acknowledging intersecting categories when groups unite on the basis of identity politics is better than ignoring categories altogether.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:st anne mosaic.jpg|thumb|right|La Scapigliata in Carnelian, with close-up of mouth. ([[Roy Feinson]])]]
Unlike traditional [[mosaics]] which rely on differently colored material arranged in arbitrary configurations to make an image, '''impressionist mosaics''' are created using the natural flaws and marbling in the tiles to create the impression of an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.com/impressionism-mosaic-art/ | title=Impressionist Mosaics: Portraying a Perceptual Impression | publisher=Mozaico | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=24 November 2015 | author=Menhem, Chantal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the definition, this may be limited to arranging square, homogeneously colored tiles in a grid-like, non-overlapped fashion.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Using stones that are of relatively uniform color and texture (typically pre-cut natural [[gemstones]] such as jasper, marble, or amethyst), the resulting mosaics have a uniquely ethereal quality that distinguishes them from traditional processes. Since the technique uses uniformly cut stones, it does not require [[grouting]]. 

==Process==
By [[Roy Feinson]]'s definition, impressionist mosaics are created by taking dozens of measurements of every tile in the artist's "palette".  The measurements are obtained by digitally photographing each tile and separating it into a grid of sixteen equal sections and analyzing each section for color, contrast and marbling. The resultant data are stored in a [[database]] and operated on by proprietary software, which recommends placements for all the tiles. Since the tiles are generally square, the software considers all four possible rotations for each tile, which greatly increases the odds that a given tile will find a good 'home'.  Each tile is equivalent to sixteen pixels in the final mosaic since its final location is a function of sixteen sections. While the software is an important component of this process, the artist must still rely on traditional hand-eye techniques to complete the image.
Care must be taken to balance the color curves in the target image to that of the component tiles. For example, if the darkest color to be found on any of the component tiles is only a mid-tone gray, then any blacks in the target image's must be converted to mid-tone gray.  This process would be repeated for the reds, greens, blues, and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://royfeinson.com/mozaicartz/home/ | title=Impressionist Mosaics | publisher=Roy Feinson | accessdate=24 November 2015 | author=Feinson, Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from traditional mosaics==
Traditional mosaics have a history dating back to at least the fourth century BC, and employ a variety of methodologies to create their images. However, traditional mosaics share the common feature of employing small, uniformly colored materials ([[tesserae]]) to create a pattern or picture. Because the tiles can be cut into irregular shapes to conform to the base pattern, mosaisists are able to create works of astonishing detail and color. 
 
Alternatively, pixel tile mosaics, such as those found on the floor of the [[University of Toronto]] pool, employ standard sized tiles (generally 1 x 1 or 2 by 2 inch) in a variety of colors arranged in a uniform matrix.   Each tile is a different color and represents a single 'pixel' in the final image. The resulting mosaic is typically coarse and of very low resolution.

==History==
Pioneering work in this field was conducted in the 1990s by California mosaic artist [[Roy Feinson]], who because of its underlying similarities to 19th century [[impressionism]] coined the term Impressionist Mosaics.

In 2006, mosaic artists Nick Berg and Alan Roth made custom mosaics using this technique commercially available in marble and wood. Because of the increased image resolution inherent in the impressionist mosaic process, they coined the terms High Definition Mosaics and Photo-realistic Mosaics.

'''Intellectual freedom''' encompasses the freedom to hold, receive and disseminate ideas without restriction.&lt;ref name="ala_faq"&gt;{{cite web | date = May 29, 2007 | url =http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorshipfirstamendmentissues/ifcensorshipqanda | title = Intellectual Freedom and Censorship Q &amp; A | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as an integral component of a democratic society, intellectual freedom protects an individual's right to access, explore, consider, and express ideas and information as the basis for a self-governing, well-informed citizenry. Intellectual freedom comprises the bedrock for freedoms of expression, speech, and the press and relates to freedoms of information and privacy.

The [[United Nations]] upholds intellectual freedom as a basic human right through Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which asserts:
:Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a19 | title =Universal Declaration of Human Rights | format = | work = | publisher =UN| accessdate =2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution of libraries in particular values intellectual freedom as part of their mission to provide and protect access to information and ideas. The [[American Library Association]] (ALA) defines intellectual freedom as "the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction. It provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a question, cause or movement can be explored."&lt;ref name="ala_faq"/&gt;

The modern concept of intellectual freedom developed out of an opposition to book censorship.&lt;ref name="ifmanual.org"&gt;{{cite web | last= | first = | authorlink = | url =http://ifmanual.org/Part1 | title= Intellectual Freedom Manual: Eighth edition | format = | work = | publisher = ALA| accessdate =2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is promoted by several professions and movements. These entities include, among others, [[library|librarianship]], [[education]], and the [[Free Software Movement]].

==Issues==
Intellectual freedom encompasses many areas including issues of [[academic freedom]], [[Internet censorship|Internet filtering]], and [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/ifissues/default.cfm | title =ALA Intellectual Freedom Issues | format = | work = | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because proponents of intellectual freedom value an individual's right to choose informational concepts and media to formulate thought and opinion without repercussion, restrictions to access and barriers to privacy of information constitute intellectual freedom issues. 
Issues surrounding restrictions to access include:
*[[Banned-books|banned books]], [[book burning]], and [[Challenge (literature)|challenges to literature]]
*censorship and attempts to censor including, but not limited to [[book censorship]], [[film censorship]], [[censorship of music]], [[censorship of maps]], censorship of individual words, censorship of comic books, and [[video game censorship]]
*[[self-censorship]] by authors, editors, journalists, or library materials selectors
*internet filtering through [[content-control software]]
*internet filtering through [[internet censorship]]
*internet safety legislation and initiatives such as [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA) and Neighborhood Internet Protection Act (NCIPA)
*[[net neutrality]]
*government information and [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]]
Issues concerning barriers to privacy of information include:
*[[data mining]]
*[[surveillance]]
*[[data protection]] and [[information privacy]] laws and practices
*confidentiality of library users' records of access
*legislation that suspends civil liberties in the name of [[national security]] such as the [[Patriot act|Patriot Act]] and the [[Homeland Security Act]]
While proponents of intellectual freedom work to prohibit acts of censorship, calls for censorship are valued as free speech. "In expressing their opinions and concerns, would-be censors are exercising the same rights librarians seek to protect when they confront censorship. In making their criticisms known, people who object to certain ideas are exercising the same rights as those who created and disseminated the material to which they object."&lt;ref name="ala_faq"/&gt; The [[first amendment]] right to voice opinions and persuade others—both for the exclusion and inclusion of content and concepts—should be protected.

==History==
The contemporary definition, limits, and inclusions of intellectual freedom primarily developed through a number of [[common law]] judgments by the [[US Supreme Court|United States Supreme Court]] regarding the [[First amendment|First Amendment]] and policy statements of groups dedicated to the advocacy and defense of [[civil liberties]].

===''Abrams v. United States'' (1919)===
{{Main|Abrams v. United States}}
In his oft-quoted dissent on the free speech case of two defendants convicted of inciting anti-war sentiment and action, Supreme Court justice [[Louis Brandeis]] aligns the freedoms of speech and expression with the freedom of thought as follows:
:Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition . . . But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas. . . The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be safely carried out."&lt;ref&gt;''Abrams v. United States,'' 250 U.S. 616, 626 (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Whitney v. California'' (1927)===
{{Main|Whitney v. California}}
A case in which the Supreme Court sustains the conviction of a woman for anti-government speech akin to terrorism. In his opinion on the matter, Justice Brandeis delineates the role of freedom of thought to inform free speech, attributing the value of intellectual freedom as a civil liberty to the founders of the United States, asserting:
:Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties. . . They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.&lt;ref&gt;"Whitney v. California," 274 U.S. 357 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Olmstead v. United States'' (1928)===
{{Main|Olmstead v. United States}}
A case in which the US Supreme Court deliberated whether a citizen's Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights were violated when evidence to convict him of bootlegging was obtained through wiretapping. Justice Brandeis provides precedence for the inclusion of intellectual freedom as a constitutional right in his dissenting opinion, claiming the US Constitution's authors "recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, his feelings, and his intellect" and "sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations." Brandeis would ultimately argue for the right to privacy, another important dimension of intellectual freedom, as an extension of American civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Olmstead v. United States," 277 U.S. 438 (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. Schwimmer'' (1929)===
{{Main|United States v. Schwimmer}}
In the Supreme Court's upheld decision to deny citizenship to Rosika Schwimmer, a Hungarian immigrant, because she refused to pledge to take up arms to defend the United States out of her pacifist views and beliefs, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. personally disagrees with the defendant's views but professionally upholds Schwimmer's position when he writes,
:Some of her answers might excite popular prejudice, but if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought – not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought we hate.&lt;ref&gt;"United States v. Schwimmer," 279 U.S. 644 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library Bill of Rights (1939)===
{{Main|Library Bill of Rights}}
The [[American Library Association]] adopts the Library Bill of Rights affirming "that all libraries are forums for information and ideas." Originally a three-point declaration to guide services in American free public libraries including statements on "growing intolerance, suppression of free speech, and censorship," today the Library Bill of Rights includes six basic policies to guide library services that affirm intellectual freedom.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)===
{{Main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}
Following World War II, the [[United Nations]] adopts The Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a "foundation of human rights law" consisting of 30 articles on international freedoms among the nations of the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Law, http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/hr_law.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Articles 18 and 19 specifically affirm rights to freedoms of thought, opinion, and expression, as well as the right to "seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights", http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lauterbach Award acceptance speech (1953)===
In his 1953 acceptance speech for the Lauterbach Award for support of civil liberties, Supreme Court justice [[William O. Douglas]] affirms that "safety of our civilization lies in making freedom of thought and freedom of speech vital, vivid features of life" and condemns "[r]estriction of free thought and free speech," labeling it "the most dangerous of all subversions," and an "un-American act."&lt;ref&gt;The One Un-American Act. Nieman Reports, vol. 7, no. 1 (January 1953): p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Freedom to Read (1953)===
The American Library Association adopts The Freedom to Read, a key library policy endorsing an individual's civil rights to free expression and intellectual freedom through the exchange of ideas through reading and writing. The ALA's [http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/freedomreadstatement The Freedom to Read] includes seven affirmations and responsibilities to protect an individual's right to read as a basic tenet of democracy.  In 1979, the ALA expands upon The Freedom to Read, adopting The Freedom to View, a policy which extends the understanding of intellectual freedom to include the visual acquisition of information through visual media such as art, video, movies, pictures, the internet, and more.

===''Brandenburg v Ohio (1969)''===
{{Main|Brandenburg v. Ohio}}
A case in which the US Supreme Court established the [[Imminent lawless action|Imminent Lawless Action]] standard.  The Supreme Court overturned KKK leader, Clarence Brandenburg's conviction of one to ten years in prison and a fine of $1000 sentenced by the [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] of [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]]. The Court ruled that hate speech is protected under [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights as long as it does not incite violence. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://landmarkcases.c-span.org/Case/23/Brandenburg-v-Ohio|title=C-SPAN Landmark Cases {{!}} Brandenburg v Ohio|website=landmarkcases.c-span.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling established the modern doctrine of [[clear and present danger]] which determines what limits may be placed on First Amendment freedoms.  Only speech that directly incites lawless action may be restricted. 

==Intellectual freedom and librarianship==

The profession of librarianship views intellectual freedom as a core responsibility. [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions']] (IFLA) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070207075253/http://www.ifla.org/faife/policy/iflastat/iflastat.htm Statement on Libraries and Intellectual Freedom] "calls upon libraries and library staff to adhere to the principles of intellectual freedom, uninhibited access to information and freedom of expression and to recognize the privacy of library user."  IFLA urges its members to actively promote the acceptance and realization of intellectual freedom principles.  IFLA states: "The right to know is a requirement for freedom of thought and conscience; freedom of thought and freedom of expression are necessary conditions for freedom of access to information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.ifla.org/faife/policy/iflastat/iflastat.htm| title =IFLA Statement on Libraries and Intellectual Freedom| work =| publisher =IFLA| accessdate =2007-03-04| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070207075253/http://www.ifla.org/faife/policy/iflastat/iflastat.htm| archivedate =2007-02-07| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual national library associations expand upon these principles when defining intellectual freedom for their constituents. For example, the [[American Library Association]] defines intellectual freedom as: "[T]he right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction. It provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a question, cause or movement may be explored. ....  Intellectual freedom encompasses the freedom to hold, receive and disseminate ideas."&lt;ref name="ala_faq"/&gt;

The [[Canadian Library Association|Canadian Library Association's]] ''Position Statement on Intellectual Freedom'' states that all persons possess "the fundamental right ... to have access to all expressions of knowledge, creativity and intellectual activity, and to express their thoughts publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.cla.ca/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/PositionStatements/Statement_on_Intell.htm| title =Canadian Library Association / Association canadienne des bibliothèques Position Statement on Intellectual Freedom| work =| publisher =CLA| accessdate =2007-03-04| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080303081400/http://www.cla.ca/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/PositionStatements/Statement_on_Intell.htm| archivedate =2008-03-03| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right was enshrined into law in 2004 in [[British Columbia]], which grants protection against litigation for libraries for their holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://leg.bc.ca/37th5th/1st_read/gov62-1.htm |title=ATTORNEY GENERAL STATUTES AMENDMENT ACT, 2004 | publisher=BC | accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other national library associations have similarly adopted [https://web.archive.org/web/20070207034904/http://www.ifla.org/faife/ifstat/ifstat.htm statements on intellectual freedom].

The ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom organizes the relationship between librarianship and intellectual freedom into five distinct categories:
*The library user's access to information through a library collection
*The librarian's professional responsibilities to select a diverse collection of library materials for users and protect library users' confidentiality and rights to privacy in their use of library materials
*The librarian's personal rights to free expression and choices of lifestyle and public participation without professional repercussion
*The library's institutional role as an agent of social change, democracy, and education
*The issue of advocacy v. neutrality for libraries and librarians&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Libraries protect, defend, and advocate for intellectual freedom through a variety of organizations and resources.

===Intellectual Freedom Committee===
The Intellectual Freedom Committee (IFC) is a council committee of the American Library Association (ALA), composed of 11 ALA members who are appointed by ALA's Council to serve 2-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/groups/committees/ala/ala-if | title =IFC | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intellectual Freedom Committee functions as an advisory and educational arm of the ALA's commitment to intellectual freedom. The IFC recommends policies concerning intellectual freedom and censorship, drafts guidelines for library professionals to advocate and defend intellectual freedom including The Universal Right to Free Expression and Importance of Education to Intellectual Freedom, and drafts policy statements adopted by the ALA including several interpretation statements on the Library Bill of Rights such as:
*Access to Electronic Information, Services, and Networks
*Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Gender or Sexual Orientation
*Free Access to Libraries for Minors
*Prisoners' Right to Read
*Statement on Library Use of Filtering Software&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;
The IFC drafts and submits statements to the ALA as part of the committee's charge to "recommend such steps as may be necessary to safeguard the rights of library users, libraries, and librarians, in accordance with the first amendment to the united states constitution and the Library Bill of Rights as adopted by the ALA Council [and] work closely with the Office for Intellectual Freedom and with other units and officers of the association in matters touching intellectual freedom and censorship."&lt;ref&gt;"IFC"&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 1940 and originally titled 'Committee on Intellectual Freedom to Safeguard the Rights of Library Users to Freedom of Inquiry,' the committee has also been known as 'Committee on Intellectual Freedom' before the currently titled 'Intellectual Freedom Committee.'&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Louise S. ''Censorship and the American Library: The American Library Association's Response to Threats to Intellectual Freedom, 1939-1969'.' (Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1996). p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ALA's formation of the IFC to promote intellectual freedom on a national level, many regional and state library associations have established additional intellectual freedom committees on the state level.

===Office for Intellectual Freedom===
The American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) serves as an administrative arm of ALA committees such as the Intellectual Freedom Committee and the Committee on Professional Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Principally charged with implementing ALA policies concerning intellectual freedom, the OIF focuses efforts on intellectual freedom education and coordination of intellectual freedom activities, events, and organizations and views the "responsibility of the office to recommend, develop, implement, and maintain a total intellectual freedom program for ALA.&lt;ref name="ALA Offices"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/ | title =ALA Offices | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
OIF functions include:
*'''Banned Books Week''', an annual event that celebrates the freedom to read sponsored by publishing, bookselling, civil rights, teaching, and library organizations associated with intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.ala.org/bbooks/bannedbooksweek| title =Banned Books Week| format =| work =| publisher =American Library Association| accessdate =2014-07-20| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161202030807/http://www.ala.org/bbooks/bannedbooksweek#| archive-date =2016-12-02| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Choose Privacy Week''', an annual event that promotes conversation and provides resources for individuals to think more critically about digital-age privacy rights. The OIF partners with many national coalitions focused upon digital rights and privacy such as the [[Aclu|American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the Center for Information Policy Research (CIPR), the [[Center for Democracy and Technology|Center For Democracy &amp; Technology]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC), and [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]] (PRC).&lt;ref name="ALA Offices"/&gt;
*'''Frequently Challenged Books List''', a database of challenged materials collected from news reports and individuals (often through the OIF's electronic ''Challenge Reporting Form''. Although the database provides information on banned books, challenged books, frequently challenged authors, and challenged classics since 1990, the OIF asserts that they "do not claim comprehensiveness in recording challenges as research suggests that for each challenge reported there are as many as four or five that go unreported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks | title =Frequently Challenged Books | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom''''' ('''''NIF'''''), a bimonthly digital publication serving as "the only journal that reports attempts to remove materials from school and library shelves across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/oifprograms/ifpubs/nif/newsletterintellectual | title =Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intellectual Freedom Action Network (IFAN)''', an ad hoc, grassroots group of volunteers who liaison between the national efforts of the OIF and intellectual freedom issues within members' communities. IFAN members monitor censorship issues in their communities and lend support to anti-censorship and intellectual freedom instances through civic involvement such as letters to the editor or political representatives and/or attendance at public meetings and hearings concerning intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?section=archive&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=164217 | title =Intellectual Freedom Action Network | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''IFACTION''', an e-list education forum on intellectual freedom issues and concepts that replaced the OIF's former print newsletter, ''Intellectual Freedom News''.&lt;ref&gt;"Intellectual Freedom Action Network"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Webinars''', including a sizable archive of webinars concerning intellectual freedom issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/oifprograms/webinars | title =Webinars | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual Freedom Round Table===
The ALA's Intellectual Freedom Round Table (IFRT) functions as a forum for ALA members to participate in intellectual freedom initiatives and efforts. The IFRT serves as a communication channel and promotional group for ALA members seeking increasing participation and knowledge in intellectual freedom concepts and issues. While the IFRT mirrors other intellectual freedom organizations through monitoring, support, and educational efforts, the IFRT provides more varied intellectual freedom discussion forums for librarians in two ways:
*Organizing state and local level intellectual freedom discussion programs and activities
*Planning and sponsoring conference programs on topics related to intellectual freedom
In addition to encouraging and fostering a community of librarians learning, promoting, and defending intellectual freedom principles, the IFRT administers three intellectual freedom awards (see below) and produces an Intellectual Freedom Report to members of the American Library Association four times per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/ifrt/ | title =IFRT | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom to Read Foundation===
The [[Freedom to Read Foundation]] was incorporated in 1969 by members of the American Library Association. Although founded by ALA members, the FTRF is a separate organization from ALA with separate membership focused upon the legal defense of intellectual freedom for libraries, librarians, library staff, and library trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; While the FTRF participates in intellectual freedom education efforts, the FTRF primarily aims to "support and defend librarians whose positions are jeopardized because of their resistance to abridgments of the First Amendment; and to set legal precedent for the freedom to read on behalf of all the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ftrf.org/?page=About | title =About FTRF | format = | work = | publisher =Freedom to Read Foundation | accessdate =2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foundation's commitment to "the principle that the solution to offensive speech is more speech, and the suppression of speech on the grounds that it gives offense to some infringes on the rights of all to a free, open and robust marketplace of ideas,"&lt;ref name="About FTRF"&gt;"About FTRF"&lt;/ref&gt; the FTRF awards and distributes grants to aid intellectual freedom litigation, directly participates as a party to intellectual freedom litigation, and submits amicus curiae briefs in freedom of speech and freedom of the press cases.&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; FTRF assistance to library staff whose jobs have been jeopardized due to their defense of intellectual freedom "attempts to obviate the choice between upholding intellectual freedom principles and" what lauded librarian and library-science scholar [[Lester Asheim]] called "three square meals a day."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asheim, Lester. "Not Censorship but Selection," ''WLB'' 28 (September 1953): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The organization's charter describes four purposes for the Foundation, including:
*Promoting and protecting the freedom of speech and of the press;
*Protecting the public's right of access to information and materials stored in the nation's libraries;
*Safeguarding libraries' right to disseminate all materials contained in their collections; and
*Supporting libraries and librarians in their defense of First Amendment rights by supplying them with legal counsel or the means to secure it.&lt;ref name="About FTRF"/&gt;

===LeRoy C. Merritt Humanitarian Fund===
The LeRoy C. Merritt Humanitarian Fund provides financial assistance to librarians who are:
*"Denied employment rights or discriminated against on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, color, creed, religion, age, disability, or place of national origin; or
*Denied employment rights because of defense of intellectual freedom; that is, threatened with loss of employment or discharged because of their stand for the cause of intellectual freedom, including promotion of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, the freedom of librarians to select items for their collections from all the world’s written and recorded information, and defense of privacy rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/groups/affiliates/relatedgroups/merrittfund/merritthumanitarian | title =Merritt Fund | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally established by the Freedom to Read Foundation in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; the Merritt Fund now functions independently, governed by three trustees elected by donors to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;"Merritt Fund"&lt;/ref&gt; The fund's namesake LeRoy C. Merritt participated in the defense and advocacy of intellectual freedom throughout his life in a variety of ways including authoring numerous intellectual freedom and anti-censorship books and articles, editing the ALA's Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom from 1962 to 1970, as the first recipient of the Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award, and, donating the entirety of the Downs prize to the Freedom to Read Foundation, as the FTRF's first benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.ala.org/groups/affiliates/relatedgroups/merrittfund/leroycmerritt/leroycmerritt| title =LeRoy C.

==Intellectual freedom in democratic countries during times of crises==

During times of crises there is often debate within democratic countries as to the balance between national security, a successful conclusion to the crises and the maintenance of democratic civil liberties. This debate often takes the form of to what extent a democratic government can curtail civil liberties in the interest of successfully ending the crises.

===Canada===
Such a debate existed in Canada during the Second World War. Since the [[Military history of Canada during World War I|First World War]] the [[War Measures Act]] had existed as legislation in Canada to allow the government to operate with greater powers during times of national crises, such as in wartime. During the [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Second World War]] the federal Liberal government of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King]] enacted the measure by [[Order in Council|Order-in-Council]]. The War Measures Act and with it the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] were passed by the federal government in early September 1939. With their implementation civil liberties, especially the intellectual freedom of political dissenters, were curtailed.&lt;ref name="Horn, Michiel 1942. p. 171"&gt;Horn, Michiel, The League for Social Reconstruction: Intellectual Origins of the Democratic Left in Canada 1930-1942. Toronto: U of Toronto Press, 1980. p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;   As well, in Quebec the [[Union nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of [[Maurice Duplessis|Premier Maurice Duplessis]] enacted “An Act Respecting Communist Propaganda”, which came to be known as the [[Padlock Act]]. It gave Premier Duplesis, as Attorney General of Quebec, the power to close (hence padlock) any premises used for the purposes of “propagating Communism or Bolshevism.” The Act was criticized by [[Eugene Forsey]], for example, as being far too broad in definition and that it gave the Premier the power to suppress any opinions that he wished to. Forsey cited examples of such abuse in the [[Canadian Forum]].&lt;ref name="Milligan, Frank 2004. p. 139"&gt;Milligan, Frank, Eugene A. Forsey: An Intellectual Biography. Calgary: U of Calgary Press, 2004. p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these measures were criticized by writers in the Canadian Forum such as Eugene Forsey&lt;ref name="Milligan, Frank 2004. p. 139"/&gt;  and [[F. R. Scott|Frank R. Scott]] and by the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] in general; a group to which both Forsey and Scott belonged. Indeed, during the Second World War the Canadian Forum printed an anonymous monthly column outlining civil liberties abuses by Canadian authorities.&lt;ref name="Horn, Michiel 1942. p. 171"/&gt;

===United States===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11th attacks]] issues concerning the suspension or reduction of civil liberties in the name of national security have arisen. Legislation such as the [[Homeland Security Act]] (HSA) of 2002 and the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] (often shortened to the Patriot Act) of 2001 encroach upon intellectual freedom rights to privacy and freedom of information to enhance domestic security from potential terrorist threats and acts.

The Patriot Act in particular has come under fire from numerous intellectual freedom organizations. The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) has criticized the Patriot Act as unconstitutional, especially when "the private communications of law-abiding American citizens might be intercepted incidentally,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/#Analysis |title=Analysis of Specific USA PATRIOT Act Provisions: Expanded Dissemination of Information Obtained in Criminal Investigations|accessdate=2014-08-22|work= |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) maintains that the lower standard applied to wiretaps "gives the FBI a 'blank check' to violate the communications privacy of countless innocent Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/206.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524032236/http://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/206.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-05-24|title=Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT - Section 206|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Library Association]] (ALA) has partnered with American libraries in opposition to a provision in Section 215 which allows the FBI to apply for an order to produce materials that assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The "tangible things" that can be targeted include "books, records, papers, documents, and other items".&lt;ref name="Section215"&gt;USA PATRIOT Act (U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|H.R.]] 3162, Public Law 107-56), Title II, Sec. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cosmology|comp/struct}}
The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''Lambda-CDM''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM'''). It is frequently referred to as the '''standard model''' of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:
* the existence and structure of the [[cosmic microwave background]]
* the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] in the distribution of galaxies
* the [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium]]
* the accelerating [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[supernova]]e

The model assumes that [[general relativity]] is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.
It emerged in the late 1990s as a '''concordance cosmology''', after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding [[cosmological inflation]], [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, and scale invariance of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Andre|date=2017|title=An Alternative to the ΛCDM Model: The Case of Scale Invariance|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/834/i=2/a=194|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=834|issue=2|pages=194|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1701.03964|bibcode=2017ApJ...834..194M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavel Kroupa|P.

==Overview==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Most modern cosmological models are based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that our observational location in the universe is not unusual or special; on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions ([[isotropy]]) and from every location ([[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Liddle. ''An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.).'' London: Wiley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the [[red shift]] of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a [[Doppler shift]] in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) represents the [[cosmological constant]], which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or [[dark energy]] in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, &lt;math&gt; p = - \rho c^{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which contributes to the [[stress-energy tensor]] that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is currently (2015) estimated to be 0.692 ± 0.012, or even 0.6911 ± 0.0062 based on [[Planck satellite]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-upholds-standard-cosmology-0210201523/ Camille M. Carlisle, ''Planck Upholds Standard Cosmology'', Sky &amp; Telescope, February 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark matter]] is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" [[rotation curve]]s of galaxies; the [[gravitational lens]]ing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter. [[Cold dark matter]] is ''non-[[baryon]]ic'', i.e. it consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons); ''cold'', i.e. its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation-matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold); ''dissipationless'', i.e. it cannot cool by radiating photons; and ''collisionless'', i.e. the dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force. The dark matter component is currently (2013) estimated to constitute about 26.8% of the mass-energy density of the universe.

The remaining 4.9% (2013) comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in [[relic neutrinos]]. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift &gt; 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding [[space-time]] containing radiation at temperatures of around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; K. This was immediately (within 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; or more, known as [[cosmic inflation]]. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual [[cosmic microwave background]], or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|lighter elements in the universe]] (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities ([[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "[[horizon problem]]" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable [[particle horizon]].

The model uses the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equations of state]] to describe the observable universe from right after the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Inflationary epoch|inflationary epoch]] to present and future.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[dimensionless]] [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a = a(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so &lt;math&gt;a_0 = a(t_0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]&lt;ref name="Dodelson"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the light emitted at time &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{em}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over a(t_\mathrm{em})} = 1 + z.&lt;/math&gt;
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,}} the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,}} and the [[cosmological constant]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,}}&lt;ref name="Dodelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2008|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego, CA [etc.]|isbn=978-0122191411|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}, &lt;/math&gt;

where as usual {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;}} is the speed of light and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. 
A critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit}&lt;/math&gt; is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} = 1.878\;47(23) \times 10^{-26} \; h^2 \; \text{kg} \; \text{m}^{-3},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|name=constants|{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-astrophysical-constants.pdf |title=The Review of Particle Physics. 2.

where &lt;math&gt; h \equiv H_0 / (100 \; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}}) &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a [[Big Crunch]], or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the [[dark energy]] is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day '''density parameter''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_x&lt;/math&gt; for various species as the dimensionless ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x(t=t_0)}{\rho_\mathrm{crit} } = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x(t=t_0)}{3 H_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; for [[Baryon|baryons]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for [[cold dark matter]], &lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt; for [[radiation]] ([[Photon|photons]] plus relativistic [[Neutrino|neutrinos]]), and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; for [[dark energy]].

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;a^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for matter etc.,
the [[Friedmann equation]] can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
:&lt;math&gt;H(a) \equiv \frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \sqrt{ (\Omega_c + \Omega_b) a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_{DE} a^{-3(1+w)} } &lt;/math&gt;
where w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; parameters add up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
In the general case this is integrated by computer to give
the expansion history &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as [[supernovae]] and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt; w = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, so this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; H(a) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda } &lt;/math&gt;

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frieman|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = (\Omega_m / \Omega_\Lambda)^{1/3} \, \sinh^{2/3} ( t / t_\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; t_\Lambda \equiv 2 / (3 H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} ) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
this is fairly accurate for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;million years.
Solving for &lt;math&gt; a(t) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; gives the present age of the universe &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; crossing zero) occurred when
:&lt;math&gt; a = ( \Omega_m / 2 \Omega_\Lambda )^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;a \sim 0.6&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \sim 0.66&lt;/math&gt; for the best-fit parameters estimated from the [[Planck spacecraft]].

==Historical development==
The discovery of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density. During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] motivated models with critical density. During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988-1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted. These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or [[dark energy]]. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from [[WMAP]] in 2003 – 2010 and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] in 2013 - 2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and possibly detect deviations. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination. A large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]], [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], and [[Pavel Kroupa|Kroupa]] are leading critics, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of [[galaxy formation]] models and supporting the alternative [[MOND]] theory, which requires a modification of the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Friedmann equations]] as seen in proposals such as [[MOG theory]] or [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS theory]]. Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include [[f(R) gravity]], [[Scalar–tensor theory|scalar–tensor theories]] such as [[galileon]] theories, [[brane cosmology|brane cosmologies]], the [[DGP model]], and [[massive gravity]] and its extensions such as [[bimetric theory|bimetric gravity]].

==Successes==
In addition to explaining pre-2000 observations,
the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the
[[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak [[gravitational lensing]], first observed in 2000 by several teams. The [[Cosmic microwave background#Polarization|polarization]] of the CMB, discovered in 2002 by DASI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovac|first1=J. M.|last2=Leitch|first2=E.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.

==Challenges==
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection;
the dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is [[cosmological constant problem|unnaturally small]] compared to [[vacuum energy|naive theoretical predictions]].

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon), but may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting [[Dwarf galaxy problem|too many dwarf galaxies]] and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It has been argued that the ΛCDM model is built upon a foundation of [[conventionalism|conventionalist stratagems]], rendering it [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, David]] [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219816301563 "Cosmology and Convention"], ''Studies In History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies In History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', '''57'''(1):41-52, February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six [[parameter]]s: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dark side of the cosmology: dark matter and dark energy|author=Spergel, D. N.|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6226|year=2015|doi=10.1126/science.aaa0980|pmid=25745164|pages=1100–1102|bibcode=2015Sci...347.1100S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with [[Occam's razor]], six is the smallest number of parameters needed to give an acceptable fit to current observations; other possible parameters are fixed at "natural" values, e.g. total density parameter = 1.00, dark energy equation of state = −1. (See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "[[Theory of Everything]]"), except that most versions of [[cosmic inflation]] predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the [[dark energy]] density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

Parameter values listed below are from the Planck Collaboration Cosmological parameters 68% confidence limits for the base ΛCDM model from Planck CMB power spectra, in combination with lensing reconstruction and external data (BAO + JLA + H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Planck Collaboration | title = Planck 2015 results.

==Missing baryon problem==
{{main article|Missing baryon problem}}
Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0502178.pdf The baryon content of the universe, M. Persic and P. Salucci, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; firstly estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt;  M_b/L &lt;/math&gt;), weighted with the luminosity function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi(L)&lt;/math&gt; over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects: 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \sum \int L\phi(L) \frac{M_b}{L} \, dL.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was:

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_b=\Omega_*+\Omega_\text{gas}=2.2\times10^{-3}+1.5\times10^{-3}h^{-1.3}\simeq0.003&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h\simeq0.72 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis &lt;math&gt; \Omega_b\simeq0.048 &lt;/math&gt;, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; may be different from 1); or [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] rather than a [[cosmological constant]] where the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations ([[gravitational wave]]s). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow [[hot dark matter]] in the form of [[neutrino]]s more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally ''increase'' the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.

A '''location''' ('''spatial''') '''model''' refers to any [[monopolistic]] competition model in [[economics]] that demonstrates consumer preference for particular brands of goods and their locations. Examples of location models include [[Harold Hotelling|Hotelling]]’s Location Model, Salop’s Circle Model, and hybrid variations.

==Traditional vs. location models==

In traditional economic models, consumers display preference given the constraints of a [[Product (business)|product]] characteristic space. Consumers perceive certain brands with common characteristics to be [[substitute good|close substitutes]], and differentiate these products from their unique characteristics. For example, there are many brands of chocolate with nuts and others without them. Hence, the chocolate with nuts is a constraint of its product characteristic space.

On the other hand, consumers in location models display preference for both the [[utility]] gained from a particular brand’s characteristics as well as its geographic location; these two factors form an enhanced “product characteristic space”. Consumers are now willing to sacrifice pleasure from products for a closer geographic location, and vice versa. For example, consumers realize high costs for products that are located far from their spatial point (e.g. transportation costs, time, etc.) and also for products that deviate from their ideal features. Firms have greater [[market power]] when they satisfy the consumer’s [[demand]] for products at closer distance or preferred products.

==Hotelling's Location Model==

In 1929, [[Harold Hotelling|Hotelling]] developed a location model that demonstrates the relationship between location and pricing behavior of firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Harold |last=Hotelling |title=Stability in Competition |journal=Economic Journal |volume=39 |issue=153 |year=1929 |pages=41–57 |doi=10.2307/2224214}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented this notion through a line of fixed length. Assuming all consumers are identical (except for location) and consumers are evenly dispersed along the line, both the firms and consumer respond to changes in demand and the economic environment.

In Hotelling’s Location Model, firms do not exercise variations in product characteristics; firms compete and price their products in only one dimension, geographic location. Therefore, traditional usage of this model should be used for consumers who perceive products to be perfect substitutes or as a foundation for modern location models.

===An example of fixed firms===
====Assumptions====

Assume that the line in [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling’s location model]] is actually a street with fixed length.

All consumers are identical, except they are uniformly located at two equal quadrants &lt;math&gt; a \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b \, &lt;/math&gt;, which is divided in the center by point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;.  Consumers face a transportation/time cost for reaching a firm, denoted by &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;; they have no preferences for the firms.

There are two firms in this scenario, Firm x and Firm y; each one is located at a different end of the street, is fixed in location and sells an identical product.

====Advanced Analysis====

Given the assumptions of the Hotelling model, consumers will choose either firm as long as the combined price &lt;math&gt; P \, &lt;/math&gt; and transportation cost &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt; of the product is less than the competitive firm.

For example, if both firms sell the product at the same price &lt;math&gt; P \, &lt;/math&gt;, consumers in quadrants &lt;math&gt; a \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b \, &lt;/math&gt; will pick the firm closest to them. The price realized by the consumer is

&lt;math&gt; P+c=P1 \, &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; P1 \, &lt;/math&gt; is the price of the product including the cost of transportation.

As long as &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt; for Firm x is greater than Firm y, consumers will travel to Firm y to purchase their product; this minimizes &lt;math&gt; P1 \, &lt;/math&gt;.  Only the consumers who live at point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;, the halfway point between the two firms, will be indifferent between the two product locations.

===An example of firm relocation===
====Assumptions====

Assume that the line in Hotelling’s location model is actually a street with fixed length.

All consumers are identical, except they are uniformly located in four quadrants &lt;math&gt; a \, &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt; b \, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt;; the halfway point between the endpoints is point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;.  Consumers face an equal transportation/time cost for reaching a firm, denoted by &lt;math&gt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;; they have no preferences for the firms.

There are two firms in this scenario, Firm x and Firm y; each one is located at a different end of the street, is able to relocate at no cost, and sells an identical product.

====Analysis====

In this example, Firm x and Firm y will maximize their profit by increasing their consumer pool. Firm x will move slightly toward Firm y, in order to gain Firm y’s customers. In response, Firm y will move slightly toward Firm x to re-establish its loss, and increase the pool from its competitor. The cycle repeats until both firms are at point &lt;math&gt; o \, &lt;/math&gt;, the halfway point of the street where each firm has the same number of customers. This result is known as [[Hotelling's law]].

If only Firm x can relocate without costs and Firm y is fixed, Firm x will move to the side of Firm y where the consumer pool is maximized. Consequently, the profits gained from Firm X significantly increase, while Firm Y incurs a significant loss.

==Salop’s Circle Model==
One of the most famous variations of Hotelling’s location model is Salop’s circle model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Steven C. |last=Salop | title = Monopolistic competition with outside goods | year = 1979 | journal = The Bell Journal of Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 141–156 | jstor = 3003323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the previous spatial representations, the circle model examines consumer preference with regards to geographic location. However, Salop introduces two significant factors: 1) firms are located around a [[circle]] with no end-points, and 2) it allows the consumer to choose a second, heterogeneous good.

===An example of a second good===
====Assumptions====

Assume that the consumers are equidistant from one another around the circle. The model will occur for one time period, in which only one product is purchased. The consumer will have a choice of purchasing variations of Product A (a differentiated product) or Product B (an outside good; undifferentiated product).

There are two firms also located equidistant around the circle. Each firm offers a variation of Product A, and an outside firm offers a good, Product B.

====Analysis====

In this example, the consumer wants to purchase their ideal variation of Product A. They are willing to purchase the product, given that it is within the constraint of their utility, transportation/distance costs, and price.

The utility &lt;math&gt; u \, &lt;/math&gt; for a particular product at distance &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt; is represented in the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; U(d,d_1) = u - r|d-d_1| \,&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; u \, &lt;/math&gt; is the utility from a superior brand, &lt;math&gt; r \, &lt;/math&gt; denotes the rate at which an inferior brand lowers the utility from the superior brand, &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt; is the location of the superior brand, and &lt;math&gt; d_1 \, &lt;/math&gt; is the location of the consumer. The distance between the brand and the consumer is thereby given in &lt;math&gt;|d-d_1| \, &lt;/math&gt;.

The consumer’s primary goal is to maximize consumer surplus, i.e. purchase the product that best satisfies any combination of price and quality. Although the consumer may receive more pleasure from their superior brand, the inferior brand may maximize the surplus &lt;math&gt; CS \, &lt;/math&gt; which is given by:

&lt;math&gt; U(d,d_1) - P = CS \,&lt;/math&gt;, where the difference is  between the utility of a product at location &lt;math&gt; d \, &lt;/math&gt; and the price &lt;math&gt; P \, &lt;/math&gt;.

Now suppose the consumer also has the option to purchase an outside, undifferentiated Product B. The consumer surplus gained from Product B is denoted by &lt;math&gt; u^* \, &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, for a given amount of money, the consumer will purchase the superior variation of Product A over Product B as long as

&lt;math&gt; U(d,d_1) - P \ge u^* \,&lt;/math&gt;, where the consumer surplus from the superior variation of Product A is greater than the consumer surplus gained from Product B.

Alternatively, the consumer only purchases the superior variation of product A as long as

&lt;math&gt; u - u^* - r|d-d_1| - P \ge 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;, where the difference between the surplus of the superior variation of Product A and the surplus gained from Product B is positive.

'''Louisine Waldron Elder Havemeyer''' (July 28, 1855 &amp;ndash;  January 6, 1929) was an [[art collector]], [[feminist]], and [[philanthropist]]. In addition to being a [[patron]] of [[impressionist art]], she was one of the more prominent contributors to the [[suffrage movement]] in the United States. The impressionist painter [[Edgar Degas]] and feminist [[Alice Paul]] were among the renowned recipients of the [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]]'s support.

==Background==
Louisine Waldron Elder was born in New York City on July 28, 1855, to a merchant George W. Elder (1831–1873) and his wife, Matilda Adelaide Waldron (1834–1907). She was the second of four children: Anne Eliza Elder, later Mrs. Henry Norcross Munn (1853-1917), Adaline Deliverance Mapes Elder, later Mrs. Samuel Twyford Peters (1859-1943), and brother George Waldron Elder (1860-1916).

===Life in Paris===
Shortly after her father's death, Louisine Elder and her family travelled to Europe for a three-year stay. They set sail on May 25, 1873, aboard the ''S.S. Calabria'', accompanied by their extended family, aunt Amanda McCready and family, and cousin [[Mary Mapes Dodge]], the editor of ''St. Nicholas Magazine'' and author of ''Hans Brinker; or the Silver Skates''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Catharine Morris|title=Lady of the silver skates : the life and correspondence of Mary Mapes Dodge, 1830-1905|date=1979|publisher=Clingstone Press|location=Jamestown, R.I.|isbn=0-9602454-1-3|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Mapes Dodge's sister Sophie Mapes Tolles was living in Paris with her friend [[Emily Sartain]], studying art in the atelier of [[Evariste Luminais]] and boarding in the ''pensionnat'' of Mme. Del Sarte, widow of [[François Delsarte|François Del Sarte]], famed teacher of the art of expression. Louisine and her sister Addie joined Sophie Mapes Tolles and Emily Sartain in boarding at Mme. Del Sarte's, and it was during this time that [[Emily Sartain]] introduced Louisine to [[Mary Cassatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitzenhoffer|first1=Frances|title=The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America|date=1986|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1096-9|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Philadelphians, Cassatt and Sartain had studied together at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] in the early 1860s and travelled to Europe together in the fall of 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathews|first1=Nancy Mowll|title=Mary Cassatt: A Life|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-07754-4|pages=76-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Mary Cassatt took Louisine Elder under her wing, becoming a mentor and encouraging her to make her first art acquisition, a pastel by Edgar Degas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitzenhoffer|first1=Frances|title=The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America|date=1886|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1096-9|pages=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, particularly after Louisine married [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer|Henry O. Havemeyer,]] Cassatt became an advisor to the Havemeyers, helping to build their art collection and facilitating the working relationship which they would have with the [[Impressionism|Impressionist Artists]], including [[Edgar Degas]], [[Edouard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Claude Monet]]. A lifelong friendship developed between Louisine Havemeyer and Mary Cassatt, who later made several pastels of Louisine and her children.

===Art Collection===
Together with her husband, Louisine would build perhaps the finest art collection in America. Her three-story mansion at Fifth Avenue and East 66th Street in New York was filled with the finest possible examples of works by [[Manet]], [[El Greco]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]]. The home was decorated 1889-1890 by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Samuel Colman]], who made it an elegant showplace for their patron's varied and important collections.&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Weitzenhoffer|first=Frances|title=The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America|year=1986|publisher=Harry Abrams|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8109-1096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[J.P. Morgan]], and Mrs. [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] were among the collectors with which Mr. and Mrs. Havemeyer would have known and competed.

===Family life===
On August 22, 1883, a decade after her father's death, Louisine married [[Henry O. Havemeyer]] of the [[American Sugar Refining Company]].*

Louisine and Henry Osborne had three children:
*Adaline Havemeyer, a.k.a. Mrs. [[Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.|Peter H.B. Frelinghuysen]] &amp;mdash; (1884–1963)
*Horace Havemeyer &amp;mdash; (1886–1956)
*[[Electra Havemeyer Webb|Electra Havemeyer]], a.k.a. Mrs. James Watson Webb &amp;mdash; (1888–1960)

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''(Prior to his marriage to Louisine, Henry was married to Louisine's aunt Mary Louise Elder (1847-1897), but that marriage ended in divorce.)''

==Legacy==
In addition to her standing as an early and important collector of Impressionist art, Louisine Havemeyer was an advocate of women's rights.
[[File:Louisine havemeyer prison special.jpg|thumb|300px|Policeman in Syracuse welcoming Louisine Havemeyer on the arrival of the [[National Woman's Party|Prison Special]] in 1919.]]

===Suffrage activist===
After her husband's death in 1907, Mrs. Havemeyer focused her attention on the [[Suffrage movement|women's suffrage movement]]. In 1912 she lent her artistic collection to [[Knoedler]]'s Gallery in New York to raise money for the cause.&lt;ref name="Pollock2013"/&gt; In 1913, she founded the [[National Woman's Party]] with the radical suffragist [[Alice Paul]]. (The organization was previously known as the "Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage".) She repeated the money raising art exhibition at Knoedler's in 1915.&lt;ref name="Pollock2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Griselda Pollock|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJZF2IhysUcC&amp;pg=PA204|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-08440-0|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

With the financial backing of Mrs. Havemeyer and others like her, Ms. Paul launched an increasingly confrontational series of protests that agitated for the right to vote.  Paul's most famous efforts were the 1913 National Suffrage Parade, which produced a riot on the eve of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first inauguration, and the wartime picketing of the White House.  During the latter Paul used portions of the President's speeches heralding the defense of democracy in Europe which she masterfully contrasted with the denial of liberty to American women.  When jailed for obstructing traffic in 1917, she hunger struck, bringing tremendous pressure to bear on the Congress and Wilson Administration.  The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], which extended voting rights to women, was debated by Congress, gained the necessary 2/3 votes in 1919, was sent to the states for ratification, and gained the necessary 3/4 of states ratifying in 1920.  

Louisine Havemeyer became a well-known suffragist, publishing two articles about her work for the cause in [[Scribner's Magazine]]. The first, entitled "The Prison Special: Memories of a Militant", appeared in May 1922, and the other, "The Suffrage Torch: Memories of a Militant" appeared in June the same year.&lt;ref name="Great Women Collectors"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gere|first=Charlotte|title=Great women collectors|date=1999|publisher=P. Wilson|location=London|isbn=0856675032|page=138|author2=Vaizey, Marina }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912 and 1915, Mrs. Havemeyer organized exhibitions of art works from her collection at [[Knoedler]] Gallery to raise funds to support suffrage efforts.&lt;ref name=Canon&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollock|first=Griselda|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1135084475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She participated in marches, much to the dismay of her children {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, down New York's famed Fifth Avenue and addressed a standing room only audience at [[Carnegie Hall]] upon the completion of a nationwide speaking tour.  A famous photograph of Mrs. Havemeyer shows her with an electric torch, similar in design to that of the [[Statue of Liberty]], among other prominent suffragists. Her attempt to burn an effigy of President Wilson outside the White House in 1919 drew national attention.

After a period of failing health, Mrs. Havemeyer died in 1929. Mrs. Havemeyer is interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The terms of her will left a few choice paintings to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.  The final bequest, made possible by the generosity of her children, included nearly two-thousand works that enrich nearly every segment of the museum's collections.

Many Tiffany pieces from her Fifth Avenue home, including a magnificent peacock mantelpiece decoration, and a chandelier are on permanent display at the [[University of Michigan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Museum of Art catalog|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?rgn1=musart_an&amp;select1=starts&amp;q1=1986.146&amp;op2=And&amp;rgn2=ic_all&amp;select2=all&amp;q2=&amp;op3=And&amp;rgn3=ic_all&amp;select3=all&amp;q3=&amp;rgn4=musart_da_start&amp;op4=And&amp;q4=&amp;q4=&amp;rgn9=musart_iod&amp;sel9=ic_exact&amp;op9=And&amp;view=thumbnail&amp;type=boolean&amp;c=musart|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the Music Room furniture suite is on view at the [[Shelburne Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building at Shelburne Museum|url=http://shelburnemuseum.org/explore/buildings/galleries/electra-havemeyer-webb-memorial-building/|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family Legacy ===
Louisine's children would continue to build upon their family's legacy as art collectors. Louisine's daughter [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]] collected American fine and folk paintings and sculpture that helped to found the [[Shelburne Museum]]. The museum showcases a "collection of collections" in fine examples of early American homes and public buildings; a general store, meeting house, log cabin, and even a steamship dot the grounds. Her great-grandson, [[John Wilmerding]], is a well known professor of art, collector, and [[curator]], and is best known as a prolific author of books on American art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8644-2004May7_2.html|title=John Wilmerding, Giving His Awe for American Art (washingtonpost.com)|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Adeline and son Horace Havemeyer, and Horace Havemeyer, Jr. bequeathed several works from [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and others to the [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/global-site-search-page.html?searchterm=havemeyer&amp;:cq_csrf_token=undefined|title=Global Site Search Page|website=www.nga.gov|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''METIS''' is a software package for [[graph partitioning]] that implements various [[Graph partition#Multi-level methods|multilevel algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |author1=George Karypis |author2=Vipin Kumar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=METIS - Unstructured Graph Partitioning and Sparse Matrix Ordering System, Version 2.0 |year=1995 |url=ftp://ftp.cs.umn.edu/dept/users/kumar/metis/manual.ps }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A fast and high quality multilevel scheme for partitioning irregular graphs |author1=Karypis, G. |author2=Kumar, V. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=359 |year=1999 |doi=10.1137/S1064827595287997 |citeseerx=10.1.1.39.3415}}&lt;/ref&gt; METIS' multilevel approach has three phases and comes with several algorithms for each phase:
# Coarsen the graph by generating a sequence of graphs G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, where G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the original graph and for each 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N, the number of vertices in G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than the number of vertices in G&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Compute a partition of G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
# Project the partition back through the sequence in the order of G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, refining it with respect to each graph.
The final partition computed during the third phase (the refined partition projected onto G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a partition of the original graph.

During the summer of 2010, the military charged five members of the platoon with murder of three Afghan civilians in [[Kandahar Province]] and collecting their body parts as trophies. In addition, seven soldiers were charged with crimes such as [[hashish]] use, impeding an investigation, and attacking the [[whistleblower]], [[Private First Class]] Justin Stoner.&lt;ref name=Cnn-2010-09-09&gt;

In March 2011, U.S. Army [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Jeremy Morlock pleaded guilty to three counts of [[premeditated murder]]. He told the court that he had helped to kill unarmed native Afghans in faked combat situations. Under a plea deal, Morlock received 24 years in prison for murdering three Afghan civilians in return for testimony against other soldiers. [[Staff Sergeant]] Calvin Gibbs, the highest-ranking soldier and the ringleader, was also convicted on three counts of premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison. Private First Class Andrew Holmes pleaded guilty to murder without premeditation and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Specialist Adam C. Winfield, who informed his father after the first murder and whose father attempted to alert the Army, pleaded guilty to [[manslaughter]] and was sentenced to three years in prison. In total, eleven of the twelve soldiers charged were convicted of crimes. All charges against the twelfth soldier, Specialist Michael Wagnon, were dropped by the U.S. military "in the interest of justice" without further explanation.

[[File:Young Afghan farmer boy murdered by US soldiers.jpg|thumb|15-year-old Gul Mudin, killed by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] SPC Jeremy Morlock and PFC Andrew Holmes on 15 January 2010.]]
All of the three staged killings of Afghan civilians occurred in the [[Maywand District]] of [[Afghanistan]]:

*On January 15, 2010, in the village of [[La Mohammad Kalay]], fifteen-year-old Gul Mudin was doing farm work for his father. He was unarmed and killed "by means of throwing a fragmentary grenade at him and shooting him with a rifle," an action carried out by SPC Jeremy Morlock and PFC Andrew Holmes under the direction of Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs. The boy was then stripped and the soldiers took photos with his body. Then the boy was left on the ground, stark naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/03/31/v-printerfriendly/1606618/news-brief-31karzais.html |title=The News Tribune – Karzai 'hurt' by photos of killing by Stryker soldiers (print) |publisher=Thenewstribune.com |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2013-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908004259/http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/03/31/v-printerfriendly/1606618/news-brief-31karzais.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012712859_civiliandeaths25m.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827001420/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012712859_civiliandeaths25m.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-08-27 |work=The Seattle Times |first=Hal |last=Bernton |title=Stryker soldiers plotted to kill Afghan civilians |date=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On February 22, using thermal imagery, the soldiers discovered Marach Agha curled in a ball by a roadside. Gibbs and SPC Michael S.

Tribal elders had complained to Army officers that the cleric had been unarmed and that the shooting was a setup. "This guy was shot because he took an aggressive action against coalition forces," Lt. Stefan Moye, the platoon leader, explained to village residents in [[Qualaday]]. "We didn't just [expletive] come over here and just shoot him randomly. And we don't do that." This conversation was recorded by embedded photojournalist [[Max Becherer]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star.com.jo/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20571&amp;catid=41:issues&amp;Itemid=125 Stryker unit at heart of Afghan murder probe]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807170741/http://www.star.com.jo/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20571&amp;catid=41%3Aissues&amp;Itemid=125 |date=August 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that soldiers told the Army's [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Command]] (CID) that Gibbs bragged of his exploits while serving in the [[Iraq War]], saying how easily one could "toss a grenade at someone and kill them."&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews2010-09-09&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/09/09/2010-09-09_us_soldiers_charged_with_murdering_civilians_collecting_their_fingers_in_afghani.html |title=U.S. soldiers charged with murdering civilians, collecting their fingers in Afghanistan |publisher=[[New York Daily News]] |author=Meena Hartenstein |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-09-09&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/09/us-soldiers-afghan-civilians-fingers |title=US soldiers 'killed Afghan civilians for sport and collected fingers as trophies |publisher=The Guardian |author=Chris McGreal |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors said Gibbs was found in possession of "finger bones, leg bones and a tooth taken from Afghan corpses".

Andrew Holmes's attorneys argued they were constrained in defending him by the Army's decision to conceal photos of the man he had allegedly shot in January.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/14/AR2010121404247.html Washingtonpost.com]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute of Military Justice]] argued that the gruesome corpse photos should be made public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122104078.html Washingtonpost.com]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stevens, an Army medic from Portland, Oregon, knew Gibbs while serving with him in A-52, the Brigade Commander's Personnel Security Detachment, where they served under CPT Samuel Lynn. The two maintained a close friendship and remained in contact after Gibbs had been transferred from A-52 to 2–1 Infantry. SSG Stevens was sentenced to nine months in prison as part of a plea deal to testify against 11 other Lewis-McChord based Stryker soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernton |first=Hal |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013568480_stevens02m.html |title=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded guilty to four charges including shooting "in the direction of" two Afghan farmers for no reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334927/U-S-soldier-jailed-shooting-unarmed-Afghan-farmers.html |title=Dailymail.co.uk |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/12/2/headlines/us_soldier_sentenced_for_shooting_afghans |title=Democracynow.org |publisher=Democracynow.org |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens said Gibbs ordered him to shoot on the two farmers and that he regretted "not trying to stop Staff Sergeant Gibbs from trying to kill innocent people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/05d6781f4cf740e2bf0ae5220e5f78bc/US--Afghan-Probe/ |title=Witness: Sergeant accused of masterminding Afghan murders boasted of killing unarmed man |agency=Associated Press |date=July 22, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private First Class Justin Stoner===
PFC Justin Stoner was the soldier who caused the investigation to begin. He caught a few members of his unit smoking hashish and as a result was later beaten by unit members. When his injuries were taken up his chain of command, he had to explain what happened. He then admitted he knew of murders committed by SSG Gibbs and other unit members, which opened up the case. Stoner was not charged and was honorably discharged in 2012.

===Specialist Adam Winfield===
Christopher Winfield, the father of platoon member SPC Adam C. Winfield, attempted to alert the Army of the "kill team's" existence when his son explained the situation from Afghanistan via a [[Facebook chat]] after the first killing.&lt;ref name=DailyMail2010-09-10&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the news from his son, Christopher Winfield called the Army inspector general's 24-hour hotline, the office of Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] (D-Fla.), and a sergeant at [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] who told him to call the Army's [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Division]].  He then contacted the Fort Lewis command center and spoke to a sergeant on duty who agreed that SPC Winfield was in potential danger but he had to report the crime to his superiors before the Army could take action.&lt;ref name=post0918&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/18/AR2010091803935_pf.html |title=Members of U.S. platoon in Afghanistan accused of killing civilians for sport |author=Whitlock, Craig |publisher=Washington Post |date=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2011, Winfield, charged with [[premeditated murder]] and conspiracy to commit murder, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to involuntary [[manslaughter]] and use of an illegal controlled substance. The involuntary manslaughter charge stems from Winfield's failure to intervene and prevent the other soldiers from carrying out the attack against the Afghan in U.S. custody. Under the plea deal he didn't admit to the killing of Mullah Adahdad. He claimed that he fired his automatic weapon away from Adahdad but that he did nothing to stop the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-soldier-plot-20110805,0,4050714.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Kim | last=Murphy | title=Soldier pleads guilty to manslaughter in Afghan's killing | date=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/08/05/washington.winfield/ | work=CNN | title=Soldier gets 3 years for part he played in deaths of Afghan civilians | date=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015830986_winfield06m.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715030139/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015830986_winfield06m.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |work=The Seattle Times |first=Hal |last=Bernton |title=3 years for Lewis-McChord soldier in war-crimes case |date=2011-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iNhCeiqPbpwHjKwqON4K-Q0QO4yA?docId=CNG.c08d50927e48321e5e784e1f7b45cbbc.7a1 |title=AFP: US soldier pleads guilty in Afghan killing spree |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 3 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole |first=Matthew |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/kill-team-soldier-years-prison/story?id=14239130 |title='Kill Team' Soldier Gets Three Years in Prison – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2011-08-06 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from prison in August 2012.

The Army Times reported on the investigation into Harry Tunnell's leadership of the 5th Stryker Brigade and its conclusions.  The brigade, was reported to be "rife with lapses of discipline, misdirection and mixed signals about its mission."  Tunnell's leadership, which the report says included, a "lack of emphasis on administrative matters such as command inspections and urinalysis, 'may have helped create an environment in which misconduct could occur,' the investigation found".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20111127/NEWS/111270307/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20131228005523/http://www.armytimes.com/article/20111127/NEWS/111270307/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-12-28 | work=Army Times | title=Report blames lapses on Stryker commander | date=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See introduction|Introduction to the metric system}}
[[File:FourMetricInstruments.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Four metric measuring devices: a [[tape measure]] in [[centimetre]]s, a [[thermometer]] in [[Celsius|degrees Celsius]], a [[kilogram]] weight and a [[multimeter]] that measures [[volt]]s, [[ampere]]s and [[ohm]]s]]
The '''metric system''' is an internationally recognised [[decimalised]] [[system of measurement]]. It is in widespread use, and where it is adopted, it is the only or most common system of weights and measures (see [[metrication]]).  It is now known as the [[International System of Units]] (SI).  It is used to measure everyday things such as the mass of a sack of flour, the height of a person, the speed of a car, and the volume of fuel in its tank.  It is also used in science, industry and trade.

In its modern form, it consists of a set of [[base unit (measurement)|base units]] including ''metre'' for length, ''kilogram'' for mass, ''second'' for time and ''ampere'' for electrical current, and a few others, which together with their derived units, can measure any physical quantity. ''Metric system'' may also refer to other systems of related base and derived units defined before the middle of the 20th century, some of which are still in limited use today.

The metric system was designed to have properties that make it easy to use and widely applicable, including units based on the natural world, decimal ratios, prefixes for multiples and sub-multiples, and a structure of base and derived units.  It is also a [[coherent system]], which means that its units do not introduce conversion factors not already present in equations relating quantities.  It has a property called ''rationalisation'' that eliminates certain constants of proportionality in equations of physics.

The units of the metric system, originally taken from observable features of nature, are now defined by phenomena such as the microwave frequency of a caesium atomic clock which accurately measures seconds.  One unit, the kilogram, remains defined in terms of a man-made artefact, but scientists recently voted to change the definition to one based on [[Planck's constant]] via a [[Kibble balance]].  The new definition is expected to be formally propagated in 2019.

While there are numerous named derived units of the metric system, such as watt and lumen, other common quantities such as velocity and acceleration do not have their own unit, but are defined in terms of existing base and derived units such as metres per second for velocity.

Though other currently or formerly widespread systems of weights and measures continue to exist, such as the [[Imperial units|British imperial system]] and the [[United States customary units|US customary system]] of weights and measures, in those systems most or all of the units are now defined in terms of the metric system, such as the US ''foot'' which is now a defined decimal fraction of a metre.

The metric system is also extensible, and new base and derived units are defined as needed in fields such as radiology and chemistry.  The most recent derived unit, the [[katal]], for catalytic activity, was added in 1999.  Recent changes are directed toward defining base units in terms of invariant constants of physics to provide more precise realisations of units for advances in science and industry.

== Units ==
===Base units===
The modern metric system consists of four electromechanical base units representing seven fundamental dimensions of measure: length, mass, time, electromagnetism, thermodynamic temperature, luminous intensity, and quantity of substance.
The units are:
* the metre for length
* kilogram for mass
* second for time
* ampere for electromagnetism
* kelvin for temperature
* candela for luminous intensity
* mole for quantity

Together they are sufficient for measuring any known quantity,{{refn|Strictly speaking, weak and strong charges may add two base dimensions: see {{cite journal
|url = http://przyrbwn.icm.edu.pl/APP/PDF/120/a120z6p04.pdf

|date = December 2011
|journal = Acta Physica Polonica A
|number = 6
|volume = 120
|pages = 998–1011}}}} without reference to further quantities or phenomena.

The metre, ampere, candela, and mole are all defined in terms of other base units. For example, the speed of light is defined as 299792458 metres per second, and the metre is derived from that constant and the definition of a second. As a result, in [[dimensional analysis]], they remain wholly separate concepts.

===Derived units with special names===
There are currently 22 derived units with special names in the metric system, these are defined in terms of the base units or other named derived units.

Eight of these units are electromagnetic quantities:
* volt, a unit of electrical potential
* ohm, a unit of electrical resistance
* tesla, a unit of magnetic flux density
* weber, a unit of magnetic flux
* farad, a unit of electrical capacitance
* henry, a unit of electrical inductance
* siemens, a unit of electrical conductance (the inverse of ohm)
* coulomb, a unit of electrical charge

Four of these units are mechanical quantities:
* watt, a unit of mechanical or electrical power
* newton, a unit of mechanical force
* joule, a unit of mechanical, electrical or thermodynamic energy
* pascal, a unit of pressure

Five units represent measures of electromagnetic radiation and radioactivity:
* becquerel, a unit of radioactive decay
* sievert, a unit of absorbed ionising radiation
* gray, a unit of ionising radiation
* lux, a unit of luminous flux
* lumen, a unit of luminous intensity

Two units are measures of circular arcs and spherical surfaces:
* radian, a unit of circular arc
* steradian, a unit of spherical surface area

Three units are miscellaneous:
* degree Celsius, a unit of thermodynamic temperature
* katal, a unit of catalytic activity (enzymatic)
* hertz, a unit of cycles per second (inverse of second)

===Auxiliary and accessory units===
{{Main|Non-SI units mentioned in the SI}}
Although SI, as published by the CGPM, should, in theory, meet all the requirements of commerce, science, and technology, certain customary units of measure have acquired established positions within the world community. In order that such units are used consistently around the world, the CGPM catalogued such units in Tables 6 to 9 of the SI brochure. These categories are:&lt;ref&gt;{{SIBrochure8th|pages=124–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Non-SI units accepted for use with the International System of Units (Table 6)'''. This list includes the hour and minute, the angular measures (degree, minute and second of arc), and the historic [non-coherent] metric units, the [[litre]], [[tonne]] and [[hectare]] (originally agreed by the CGPM in 1879)
* '''Non-SI units whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally (Table 7)'''. This list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and in astronomy such as the [[Dalton (unit)|dalton]], the [[electron mass]], the [[electron volt]], the [[astronomical unit]], the [[solar mass]], and a number of other units of measure that are well-established, but dependent on experimentally-determined physical quantities.
* '''Other non-SI units (Table 8)'''. This list catalogues a number of units of measure that have been used internationally in certain well-defined spheres including the [[bar (unit)|bar]] for pressure, the [[ångström]] for [[atomic physics]], the [[nautical mile]] and the [[knot (unit)|knot]] in [[navigation]].
* '''Non-SI units associated with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of units (Table 9)'''. This table catalogues a number of units of measure based on the CGS system and dating from the nineteenth century. They appear frequently in the literature, but their continued use is discouraged by the CGPM.

The SI symbols for the metric units are intended to be identical, regardless of the language used&lt;ref name=noun&gt;{{SIBrochure8th|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; but unit names are [[common noun|ordinary nouns]] and use the character set and follow the grammatical rules of the language concerned. For example, the SI unit symbol for kilometre is "km" everywhere in the world, even though the local language word for the unit name may vary. Language variants for the kilometre unit name include: ''{{lang|it|chilometro}}'' (Italian), ''{{lang|de|Kilometer}}'' (German),&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In German all nouns start with an upper-case letter&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|nl|kilometer}}'' (Dutch), ''{{lang|fr|kilomètre}}'' (French), ''{{lang|el|χιλιόμετρο}}'' (Greek), ''{{lang|pt|quilómetro/quilômetro}}'' (Portuguese), ''{{lang|es|kilómetro}}'' (Spanish) and ''{{lang|bg|километр}}'' (Russian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Variations are also found with the spelling of unit names in countries using the same language, including differences in [[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|American English and British spelling]]. For example, ''meter'' and ''liter'' are used in the United States whereas ''metre'' and ''litre'' are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used [[deca-|SI prefix for ten]] is ''deka''. In American English the term ''metric ton'' is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of English ''tonne'' is common. ''Gram'' is also sometimes spelled ''gramme'' in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In SI, which is a coherent system, the unit of power is the "[[watt]]", which is defined as "{{em|one}} joule per second".&lt;ref name=SI_units /&gt; In the [[US customary system]] of measurement, which is non-coherent, the unit of power is the "[[horsepower]]", which is defined as "550 foot-pounds per second" (the pound in this context being the [[pound-force]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Realisation of units==
[[File:Kilometre definition.svg|pic|right|thumb|The '''metre''' was originally defined to be one ten millionth of the distance between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]] through Paris.&lt;ref name=Alder /&gt;]]
{{Main|Realisation (metrology)}}
The base units used in the metric system must be [[Realisation (metrology)|realisable]]. Each of the definitions of the base units in SI is accompanied by a defined ''mise en pratique'' [practical realisation] that describes in detail at least one way in which the base unit can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In practice, such realisation is done under the auspices of a [[International Organization of Legal Metrology#Conformance Certification|mutual acceptance arrangement]] (MAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The standard metre is defined as exactly 1/299,792,458 of the distance that light travels in a second.  The realisation of the metre depends in turn on precise realisation of the second.  There are both astronomical observation methods and laboratory measurement methods that are used to realise units of the standard metre.
Because the speed of light is now exactly defined in terms of the metre, more precise measurement of the speed of light does not result in a more accurate figure for its velocity in standard units, but rather a more accurate definition of the metre.  The accuracy of the measured speed of light is considered to be within 1&amp;nbsp;m/s,
and the realisation of the metre is within about 3 parts in 1,000,000,000, or an order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; parts.

The kilogram is defined by the mass of a man-made artefact of platinum-iridium held in a laboratory in France.
Replicas made in 1879 at the time of the artefact's fabrication and distributed to signatories of the Metre Convention serve as ''de facto'' standards of mass in those countries. Additional replicas have  been fabricated since as additional countries have joined the convention.  The replicas are subject to periodic validation by comparison to the original, called the IPK. It has become apparent that either the IPK or the replicas or both are deteriorating, and are no longer comparable: they have diverged by 50&amp;nbsp;μg since fabrication, so figuratively, the accuracy of the kilogram is no better than 5 parts in a hundred million or within an order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; parts. A [[proposed redefinition of SI base units]] is expected to include replacing the IPK with an exact definition of [[Planck's constant]], which will then define the kilogram in terms of the second and metre.

== Properties as a system ==
Although the metric system has changed and developed since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of [[units of measurement]], now known as [[base units]]. [[Derived units]] were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a [[SI prefixes|standard set of prefixes]].

===Units based on the natural world===
Like most units of measure, the units of the metric system were based on perceptual quantities of the natural world. But they also had definitions in terms of stable relationships in that world: a metre was defined not by the span of a man's arms like a ''toise'', but on a quantitative measure of the earth.  A kilogram was defined by a volume of water, whose linear dimensions were fractions of the unit of length. The earth was not easy to measure, nor was it uniformly shaped, but the principle that units of measure were to be based on quantitative relationships among invariant facets of the physical world was established. The units of the metric system today still adhere to that principle, but the relationships used are based on the physics of nature, rather than its sensory dimensions.

===Base and derived unit structure===
The metric system base units were originally adopted because they represented fundamental orthogonal dimensions of measurement corresponding to how we perceive nature: a spatial dimension, a time dimension, one for the effect of gravitation, and later, a more subtle one for the dimension of an "invisible substance" known as electricity or more generally, electromagnetism. One and only one unit in each of these dimensions was defined, unlike older systems where multiple perceptual quantities with the same dimension were prevalent, like inches, feet and yards or ounces, pounds and tons. Units for other quantities like area and volume, which are also spacial dimensional quantities, were derived from the fundamental ones by logical relationships, so that a unit of square area for example, was the unit of length squared.

Many derived units were already in use before and during the time the metric system evolved, because they represented convenient abstractions of whatever base units were defined for the system, especially in the sciences. So analogous units were scaled in terms of the metric units, and their names adopted into the system. Many of these were associated with electromagnetism.  Other perceptual units, like volume, which were not defined in terms of base units, were incorporated into the system with definitions in the metric base units, so that the system remained simple. It grew in number of units, but the system retained a uniform structure.

=== Decimal ratios ===
Some customary systems of weights and measures had duodecimal ratios, which meant quantities were conveniently divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6.  But it was difficult to do arithmetic with things like {{frac|1|4}} pound or {{frac|1|3}} foot. There was no system of notation for successive fractions: for example, {{frac|1|3}} of {{frac|1|3}} of a foot was not an inch or any other unit. But the system of counting in decimal ratios did have notation, and the system had the algebraic property of multiplicative closure: a fraction of a fraction, or a multiple of a fraction was a quantity in the system, like {{frac|1|10}} of {{frac|1|10}} which is {{frac|1|100}}. So a decimal radix became the ratio between unit sizes of the metric system.

=== Prefixes for multiples and submultiples ===
{{Main|Metric prefix}}
In the metric system, multiples and submultiples of units follow a decimal pattern.&lt;ref group = Note&gt;Non-SI units for time and plane angle measurement, inherited from existing systems, are an exception to the decimal-multiplier rule&lt;/ref&gt;
{{common metric prefixes}}
A common set of decimal-based prefixes that have the effect of multiplication or division by an integer power of ten can be applied to units that are themselves too large or too small for practical use. The concept of using consistent classical ([[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) names for the prefixes was first proposed in a report by the [[French Revolution]]ary Commission on Weights and Measures in May 1793.&lt;ref name=Alder&gt;{{cite book

Thus the ''[[kilogram]]'' and ''[[kilometre]]'' are a thousand [[gram]]s and [[metre]]s respectively, and a ''[[milligram]]'' and ''[[millimetre]]'' are one thousandth of a gram and metre respectively. These relations can be written symbolically as:&lt;ref name=SI_prefix&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=121,122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{block indent|1=1&amp;nbsp;mg = 0.001&amp;nbsp;g}}
{{block indent|1=1&amp;nbsp;km = 1000&amp;nbsp;m}}

In the early days, multipliers that were positive powers of ten were given Greek-derived prefixes such as  ''kilo-'' and ''mega-'', and those that were negative powers of ten were given Latin-derived prefixes such as ''centi-'' and ''milli-''. However, 1935 extensions to the prefix system did not follow this convention: the prefixes ''nano-'' and ''micro-'', for example have Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When applying prefixes to derived units of area and volume that are expressed in terms of units of length squared or cubed, the square and cube operators are applied to the unit of length including the prefix, as illustrated below.&lt;ref name=SI_prefix /&gt;

|}

Prefixes are not usually used to indicate multiples of a second greater than 1; the non-SI units of [[minute]], [[hour]] and [[day]] are used instead. On the other hand, prefixes are used for multiples of the non-SI unit of volume, the [[litre]] (l, L) such as millilitres (ml).&lt;ref name=SI_prefix /&gt;

=== Coherence ===
{{Main|Coherence (units of measurement)}}
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]] played a major role in developing the concept of a coherent CGS system and in extending the metric system to include electrical units.]]
Each variant of the metric system has a degree of coherence—the derived units are directly related to the base units without the need for intermediate conversion factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

hold without the introduction of unit conversion factors. Once a set of coherent units have been defined, other relationships in physics that use those units will automatically be true. Therefore, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy equation]], {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, does not require extraneous constants when expressed in coherent units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system]] had two units of energy, the [[erg]] that was related to [[mechanics]] and the [[calorie]] that was related to [[thermal energy]]; so only one of them (the erg) could bear a coherent relationship to the base units. Coherence was a design aim of SI, which resulted in only one unit of energy being defined – the [[joule]].&lt;ref name=SI_units /&gt;

===Rationalisation===
Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism contained a factor relating to steradians, representative of the fact that electric charges and magnetic fields may be considered to emanate from a point and propagate equally in all directions, i.e. spherically. This factor appeared awkwardly in many equations of physics dealing with the dimensionality of electromagnetism and sometimes other things.

== International System of Units ==
{{Main|International System of Units|List of physical quantities}}
The International System of Units is the modern metric system. It is based on the Metre-Kilogram-Second-Ampere (MKSA) system of units from early in the 20th century. It also includes numerous coherent derived units for common quantities like power (watt) and irradience (lumen). Electrical units were taken from the International system then in use.  Other units like those for energy (joule) were modeled on those from the older CGS system, but scaled to be coherent with MKSA units. Two additional base units, ''degree Kelvin'' equivalent to degree Centigrade for thermodynamic temperature, and ''candela'', roughly equivalent to the [[international candle]] unit of illumination, were introduced. Later, another base unit, the ''mole'', a unit of mass equivalent to Avogadro's number of specified molecules, was added along with several other derived units.

The system was promulgated by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (French: ''Conférence générale des poids et mesures'' – CGPM) in 1960.  At that time, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a spectral line of the [[krypton-86]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;A stable isotope of an inert gas that occurs in undetectable or trace amounts naturally&lt;/ref&gt; atom, and the standard metre artefact from 1889 was retired.

Today, the International system of units consists of 7 base units and innumerable coherent derived units including 22 with special names. The last new derived unit, the ''katal'' for catalytic activity, was added in 1999. Some of the base units are now realised in terms of invariant constants of physics. As a consequence, the speed of light has now become an exactly defined constant, and defines the metre as {{frac|299,792,458}} of the distance light travels in a second. The kilogram remains defined by a man-made artefact of platinum-iridium, and it is deteriorating. The range of decimal prefixes has been extended to those for 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;, ''yotta'', and 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt;, ''yocto'', which are unfamiliar because nothing in our everyday lives is that big or that small.

The International System of Units has been adopted as the official system of weights and measures by all nations in the world except for Myanmar, Liberia, and the United States, while the United States is the only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant system of units.

=== {{anchor|other metric systems}} Historical variants ===
A number of variants of the metric system evolved, all using the ''Mètre des Archives'' and ''Kilogramme des Archives'' (or their descendants) as their base units, but differing in the definitions of the various derived units.

====Gaussian second and the first mechanical system of units====
In 1832, Gauss used the astronomical second as a base unit in defining the gravitation of the earth, and together with the gram and millimetre, became the first system of mechanical units.

====The EMU, ESU and Gaussian systems of electrical units====
Several systems of electrical units were defined following discovery of Ohm's law in 1824.

==== Centimetre–gram–second systems ====
The [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]] (CGS) was the first coherent metric system, having been developed in the 1860s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson. In 1874, this system was formally promoted by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (BAAS).&lt;ref name=SI_1_8&gt;{{SIBrochure8th|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system's characteristics are that density is expressed in {{nowrap|g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, force expressed in [[dyne]]s and mechanical energy in [[erg]]s. Thermal energy was defined in [[calorie]]s, one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 16.5&amp;nbsp;°C. The meeting also recognised [[Centimetre gram second system of units|two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties]] – the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====International system of electrical units====
The CGS units of electricity were cumbersome to work with. This was remedied at the 1893 International Electrical Congress held in Chicago by defining the "international" ampere and ohm using definitions based on the [[metre]], [[kilogram]] and [[second]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== MKS and MKSA systems ====

In 1901, [[Giovanni Giorgi]] showed that by adding an electrical unit as a fourth base unit, the various anomalies in electromagnetic systems could be resolved. The metre–kilogram–second–[[coulomb]] (MKSC) and metre–kilogram–second–[[ampere]] (MKSA) systems are examples of such systems.&lt;ref name=IECGiorgi&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International System of Units]] (''Système international d'unités'' or SI) is the current international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world. It is an extension of Giorgi's MKSA system—its base units are the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, [[kelvin]], [[candela]] and [[mole (unit)|mole]].&lt;ref name=SI_units /&gt;
The MKS (Metre, Kilogram, Second) system came into existence in 1889, when artefacts for the metre and kilogram were fabricated according to the convention of the Metre.  Early in the 20th century, an unspecified electrical unit was added, and the system was called MKSX.  When it became apparent that the unit would be the ampere, the system was referred to as the MKSA system, and was the direct predecessor of the SI.

==== Metre–tonne–second systems ====
The [[metre–tonne–second system of units]] (MTS) was based on the metre, [[tonne]] and second – the unit of force was the [[sthène]] and the unit of pressure was the [[pièze]]. It was invented in France for industrial use and from 1933 to 1955 was used both in France and in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=ieeeghn&gt;{{cite web

==== Gravitational systems ====
[[Gravitational metric system]]s use the [[kilogram-force]] (kilopond) as a base unit of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the [[Gravitational metric system|hyl]], ''Technische Mass Einheit'' (TME), mug or [[slug (unit)|metric slug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Conversion, calculation and symbol confusion incidents ==
The dual usage of or confusion between metric and non-metric units and confusion of metric symbols have resulted in a number of serious incidents. These include:
* Due to serious medication errors having resulted from confusion between mg and μg, doses of less than one milligram must be expressed in micrograms written in full (the symbol μg being banned) in the [[NHS Scotland|Scottish health service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prescribing Information for Liquid Medicines |url=http://www.palliativecareguidelines.scot.nhs.uk/guidelines/about-the-guidelines/pharmacological-considerations/prescribing-information-for-liquid-medicines.aspx |website=NHS Scotland |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flying an overloaded American International Airways aircraft from [[Miami]], [[Florida]] to [[Maiquetia]], [[Venezuela]] on 26 May 1994. The degree of overloading was consistent with ground crew reading the kilogram markings on the cargo as pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.ntsb.gov/legal/alj/OnODocuments/Aviation/4510.pdf |title = NTSB Order No. EA-4510

* In 1999 the [[Patient safety organization#Institute for Safe Medication Practices|Institute for Safe Medication Practices]] reported that confusion between [[grain (mass)|grains]] and grams led to a patient receiving [[phenobarbital]] 0.5&amp;nbsp;grams instead of {{convert|0.5|gr|g|2|abbr=off}} after the practitioner misread the prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* The Canadian "[[Gimli Glider]]" accident in 1983, when a [[Boeing 767]] jet ran out of fuel in mid-flight because of two mistakes made when calculating the fuel supply of [[Air Canada]]'s first aircraft to use metric measurements: mechanics miscalculated the amount of fuel required by the aircraft as a result of their unfamiliarity with metric units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* The root cause of the loss in 1999 of [[NASA]]'s US$125 million [[Mars Climate Orbiter]] was a mismatch of units – the spacecraft engineers calculated the thrust forces required for velocity changes using US customary units (lbf⋅s) whereas the team who built the thrusters were expecting a value in metric units (N⋅s) as per the agreed specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA's metric confusion caused Mars orbiter loss |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric/

{{Main|Conversion of units}}
During its evolution, the metric system has adopted many units of measure. The introduction of SI rationalised both the way in which units of measure were defined and also the list of units in use. These are now catalogued in the official SI Brochure.&lt;ref name=SI_units&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages = 111–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below lists the units of measure in this catalogue and shows the conversion factors connecting them with the equivalent units that were in use on the eve of the adoption of SI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Recent studies have shown that MAP present in [[milk]] can survive [[pasteurization]], which has raised human health concerns due to the widespread nature of MAP in modern dairy herds. MAP survival during [[pasteurization]] is dependent on the D&lt;sub&gt;72C&lt;/sub&gt;-value of the strains present and their concentration in milk.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, W.M.A. (2015). HTST pasteurization. Is it time to raise statutory time / temperature conditions to destroy Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP)?. [On-line]. Available from: https://www.dairyscience.info/index.php/food-model/277-htst-pasteurization.html . Accessed: 30 July, 2018. Updated October, 2017; April 2018. [https://www.dairyscience.info/index.php/food-model/277-htst-pasteurization.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is heat resistant and is capable of sequestering itself inside white blood cells, which may contribute to its persistence in milk. It has also been reported to survive [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] in municipal water supplies.

MAP is a slow growing organism and is difficult to culture. Bacterial cultures were regarded as Gold standards for detection of MAP. Detection is very limited in fresh tissues, food, and water. Recently, John Aitken and Otakaro Pathways have discovered a method to culture MAP from human blood. Testing is ongoing. Professor John Hermon-Taylor of Kings College London is developing a new vector type anti MAP vaccine which he claims is both curative and preventative. Stage 1 human trials began in January 2017. He is also developing a companion MAP blood test.

It is not susceptible to antituberculosis drugs (which can generally kill ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''). MAP is susceptible to [[antibiotics]] used to treat Mycobacterium avium disease, such as [[rifabutin]] and [[clarithromycin]], however the capacity of these antibiotics to eradicate MAP infection in vivo has not been established.

===Crohn's disease===

'''Pars destruens'''/'''pars construens''' (''lat''.) is in common parlance about different parts of an [[argumentation]]. The negative part of [[criticism|criticizing]] views is the pars destruens. And the positive part of stating one's own position and [[argument]]s is the pars construens.

The distinction goes back to [[Francis Bacon]] and his work [[Novum Organum]], 1620. There he puts forth his inductive method that has two parts. A negative part, ''pars destruens'', that removes all prejudices and errors. And the positive part, ''pars construens'', that is about gaining knowledge and truth.

The native inhabitants of the Central Highlands are the [[Degar]] (Montagnard) peoples. The Vietnamese conquered the Central Highlands during their "march to the south" ([[Nam tiến]]). Ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese (Kinh) people]] now outnumber the indigenous Degars (considered derogatory term) after state-sponsored colonization directed by both the government of [[South Vietnam]] and the current Communist government of unified [[Vietnam]]. The Montagnards have engaged in conflicts with the Vietnamese, from the anti-Communist South Vietnamese government, the [[Viet Cong]], to the Communist government of unified Vietnam{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. There are contrasting views on this issue, as the constitution of the government of [[Vietnam]] states "Article 36 of the Constitution, the state invests heavily in education and supports various preferential programmes for ethnic minorities, like ethnic minority boarding schools, lower entry requirements and quota for minorities."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137455536_12|title=Language, Education and Nation-building|last=Le Ha|first=Phan|last2=Ha|first2=Vu Hai|last3=Dat|first3=Bao|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349546336|location=London|pages=232–244|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137455536_12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refworld.org"&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3c6a48474.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both the initial 1945 constitute and the revised 1992 constitution of [[North Vietnam]] and the successor state [[Vietnam|the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] stated that all minority groups in Vietnam have the right to maintain their mother tongues in their schooling as well as to use their languages to preserve their ethnic cultures and values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Champa state and Chams in the lowlands til 1471 were traditional suzerains whom the Montagnards in the highlands acknowledged as their lords, while autonomy was held by the Montagnards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=35–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II concept of "Nam tiến" and the southward conquest was celebrated by Vietnamese scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Zottoli|first= Brian A.|date=2011  |title=Conceptualizing Southern Vietnamese History from the 15th to 18th Centuries:  Competition along the Coasts from Guangdong to Cambodia  |type=A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (History) in The University of Michigan |chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/89821/bria?sequence=1 |page=5 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois was the name of the Central Highlands from 1946 under French Indochina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=155–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until French rule, the Central Highlands was alleged by one American source as almost never entered by the Vietnamese since they viewed it as a savage (Moi-Montaganrd) populated area with fierce animals like tigers, "poisoned water" and "evil malevolent spirits", but the Vietnamese expressed interest in the land after the French transformed it into a profitable plantation area to grow crops on,&lt;ref name="M.D.2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

In 1955, Northern Vietnamese migrants were settled in the Central Highlands after the autonomous Montagnard area was abolished by [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]. [[Y Bham Enuol]] founded [[Bajaraka]] on January 5, 1958 to resist the discrimination, Vietnamese settlement on Highlands and forced assimilation by the South Vietnamese government. The United Nations Secretary-General and foreign embassies were contacted by Y Bham Enuol. "Front for the Liberation of the Highlands of Champa" (Mặt Trận Giải Phóng Cao Nguyên Champa) and Bajaraka were both headed by Y Bham Enuol.

[[Les Kosem]], Y Bham Enuol and Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] worked together to found [[FULRO]] and launch an uprising against the South Vietnamese government to regain their land from the Vietnamese colonizers.

The Montagnard inhabited Central Highlands became open to the Vietnamese only under French rule{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The word savage (moi) was used by the Vietnamese against the Montagnard Degars. Both the South Vietnamese and the united Communist Vietnam government were fought against by the FULRO Degar fighters for the sake of the Central Highlands and Montagnard people under the direction of Y-Bham Enuol{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The Montagnards in FULRO fought the Vietnamese for twenty years after the end of the Vietnam War and the scale of Vietnamese attacks on the Montagnards are alleged by one US author as having killed over 200,000 Montagnards after 1975 during the war between FULRO and Vietnam in the Central Highlands, as the Vietnamese lease land for Japanese companies to harvest lumber in the area. Munitions, weapons, and 5,000 rifles were given by the Chinese to some Montagnard groups after some Montagnards requested help from China via Thai General Savit-Yun K-Yut since the United States refused to help the FULRO Montagnards against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="Dooley2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Dooley|title=Battle for the Central Highlands: A Special Forces Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAKbllE5bioC&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=18 December 2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-41463-2|pages=255–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures have not been validated by independent sources or third parties, however.

The Chinese, the Central Highlands Montagnards, Cham, and Delta Cambodians (Khmer Krom) were all alienated by the South Vietnamese government under Diem. The Montagnard Highlands were subjected to colonization by ethnic Vietnamese under Diem.

The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia)  and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien, while the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own native culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous natives of the region, and to hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term ''Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois'' PMSI emerged for the Central Highlands along with the natives being addressed by the name Montagnard.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003 1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MxRYU8TjBsmcyATZpIDQBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moi%20savages%20vietnamese&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent demonstrations with fatalities have broken out due to Montagnard anger at Vietnamese discrimination and seizure of their land since many Vietnamese Kinh were settled by the government in the Central Highlands.&lt;ref name="SullivanSullivan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Sullivan|author2=James Sullivan|title=Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WLfsdeJgHsC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MxRYU8TjBsmcyATZpIDQBg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6wEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=moi%20savages%20vietnamese&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=National Geographic Society|isbn=978-0-7922-6203-9|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Sullivan|title=National Geographic Traveler Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8cRgWpCXUoC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MxRYU8TjBsmcyATZpIDQBg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moi%20savages%20vietnamese&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=National Geographic|isbn=978-1-4262-0522-4|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Vietnamese and Communist Vietnamese colonization of the Central Highlands has been compared to the historic Nam tiến of previous Vietnamese rulers. During the Nam tiến (March to the South) Khmer and Cham territory was seized and militarily colonized ([[Tuntian|đồn điền]]) by the Vietnamese which was repeated by the state-sponsored colonization of Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees on Montagnard land by the South Vietnamese leader Diem and the introduction to the Central Highlands of "New Economic Zones" by the now Communist Vietnamese government.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003" /&gt; The thousand year violent war the Vietnamese in the lowlands had with the Montagnards in the mountains was a long-established custom and the Vietnamese used the derogatory word "Moi" (savages) to address the Montagnards, the South Vietnamese government was strongly against the autonomous Montagnard CIDG (Civilian Irregular Defense Groups) who were fighting against the Vietcong because they feared that the Montagnards would gain independence so the South Vietnamese and Montagnards violently clashed against each other{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

A colonization program of Kinh Vietnamese by the South Vietnamese government and united Vietnamese Communist government was implemented{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Leaving out any plans for autonomy for ethnic minorities, an assimilation plan was launched by the South Vietnamese government with the creation of the "Social and Economic Council for the Southern Highlander Country", the South Vietnamese based their approach to the highlanders by claiming that they would be "developed" since they were "poor" and "ignorant", making swidden agriculturalists sedentarize and settling ethnic Vietnamese colonists from the coastal regions into the highlands such as Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam, 50,000 Vietnamese settlers were in the highlands in 1960 and in 1963 the total number of settlers was 200,000 and up to 1974 the South Vietnamese were still implemented the colonization plan even though the highland natives experienced massive turbulence and disorder because of the colonization, and by 1971 less than half of a scheme back by the Americans to leave Montagnards with just 20% of the Central Highlands was completed, and even in the parts of the highlands which did not experience colonization, the South Vietnamese threw the native tribes into "strategic hamelets" to keep them away from places where communists potentially operated and the South Vietnamese consistently spurned any attempts too make overtures to the native Highlanders.&lt;ref name="Duncan2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher R.

===2001 mass protests===

After the Vietnamese government arrested Montagnards a demonstration was started in Chu Prong county by the Montagnards in the Central Highlands consisting of around 500 people in February 2001. Vietnam accused them of plotting for autonomy and accused them of trying to stir up ethnic animosity, and launched an anti-Highlander military operation. The traditional lands of the Central Highland had been taken by the Vietnamese and the Central Highland demonstrators had asked for it back. The Vietnamese government refused to return the lands and instead attacked the demonstrators, arresting hundreds and assaulting and pummeling the demonstrators{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The Vietnamese military took charge of the Central Highlands, severing telephone lines and keeping heavy watch over travel within the area. The Bahnar, Rhade, and Raglai participated in the mass demonstrations against the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. They carried no weapons while they started their mass protests. The natives regard the puppet leaders placed in their communities by the Vietnamese Communist government as collaborators who help persecute the natives for the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The tribal customs of the highlanders are ignored by the Vietnamese government which shows no regard for the traditional leaders of the Highlanders. The natives of the Central Highlands are mired in poverty and the Vietnamese are richer than them and are subjected to starvation. The Vietnamese government seized the land of the natives in the Central Highlands for Vietnamese settlers and coffee companies. They severely limited the amount of land farmed by the Highlanders and drove them away. Vietnamese colonizers also directly seize land from the natives in addition to the coffee companies{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.  The policies of the Vietnamese government impede the natives while helping the Vietnamese colonizers. The lumber and coffee companies are assisted by the Vietnamese government. Vietnamese government workers embezzle and steal aid meant for the Central Highlanders. After these provocations, when Buon xer village was seized by Vietnamese colonizers, they were attacked by the Rhade when the straw finally broke the camel's back on August 8, 2000. The massive amount of Vietnamese colonizers and land theft was the impetus for the mass 2001 demonstrations against the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Rahlan Djan and Rahlan Pon were the two Montagnards who were abused and arrested by the Vietnamese and ex-FULRO member Ksor Kok helped bring attention to their plight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316040520/http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001|title=The Uprising of the Central Highlanders in February 2001 |author=Nguyen Van Huy (Ph.D.) |others= Translated by Sean Tu|website=Cham Today|publisher=IOC-Champa|access-date=|archivedate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chamtoday.com/index.php/ngonngu/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316035131/http://chamtoday.com/index.php/ngonngu/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001 |title=The Uprising of the Central Highlanders in February 2001 |author=Nguyen Van Huy (Ph.D.) |others=Translated by Sean Tu|date= |website=Cham Today |publisher=IOC-Champa|access-date= |quote=|archivedate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jailed Montagnards had been subjected to torture by the Vietnamese government which caused the mass protests. There were 30 police officers wounded in Buon Ma Thuot in Daklak and Pleiku.

The Vietnamese has sterilized Degar women, and murdered and jailed Degar men to wipe out the Degars for the purpose of seizing their land and the Vietnamese despise the Degar way of life due to ethnic hatred by the Vietnamese against the Degar which led to ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degarfoundation.org/kok-ksors-statement-to-cerd-80th-session/HRUE-DƯM...21-02-2012/MRO=718|archiveurl=http://www.degarfoundation.org/kok-ksors-statement-to-cerd-80th-session/HRUE-D%C6%AFM...21-02-2012/MRO=718|title=Kok Ksor's Statement to CERD 80th Session|author=Mr. Kok Ksor|date=21 February 2012|website=DEGAR FOUNDATION, INC.|publisher=|access-date=|archivedate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese police assaulted and brutalized the Montagnard Foundation President Kok Ksor's mother, Ksor H'Ble, especially following the Degar February 2001 demonstrations over land and religion and the April 2004 demonstrations. The Vietnamese police bullied and assaulted her for years. She died on 18 August 2011.

Degars were violently assaulted and brutalized by racist ordinary Vietnamese citizens on 27 September 2007. Degars were targeted for murder by Vietnamese citizens on 5 October 2007.

Ethnic minority lands are subjected to settlement and colonization by ethnic Vietnamese Kinh supported by the Vietnamese government, as the native populations are driven out and their lands stolen in addition to their bad economic situation.

Demanding that the Vietnamese regime stop repressing ethnic minorities and religion, the "Coalition for Indigenous Peoples in Vietnam" was formed out of the Thai, Khmer Krom, and Montagnards after they combined forces against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degar-Montagnards: Vietnamese Minority Groups Unite|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/14284|author=Voice of America |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=May 15, 2012 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Voice of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese brutally suppressed, imprisoned and tortured Montagnards after the Montagnards asked for their lands back during protests in Gia Lai province in 2012 so 85 of the Montagnards were forced to escape from the Vietnamese by going to Rattanakiri province in Cambodia. The religion and ethnicity of the Montagnards is distinct from the Vietnamese. Prospect of a new insurgency by Montagnards for independence were shot down by the Hun Sen regime in Cambodia which refused to aid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/15157 |title=Degar-Montagnards: Refugees In Cambodia’s Jungles |author=Voice of America|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 20, 2012 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Voice of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trouble and chaos in the Central Highlands after the Vietnamese abused and jailed Montagnard leader Y'Soai Eban he managed to run away from Vietnamese custody. The Montagnards were subjected to genocide after the Vietnam War in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/15451 |title=Degar-Montagnards: Father Reunited With His Family After 6 Years |author=Wral.com|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 4, 2013 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Wral.com |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence from the Communist authorities was desired by the Montagnards after the Vietnam War since they were killed, abused, discriminated against and jailed by the Vietnamese authorities so many of them were forced to run away from the Central Highlands as refugees. Cambodia and eventually the United States were their destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/16663 |title=Degar-Montagnards: 11 Christian Vietnamese And Cambodian Refugees Ordained |author=Biblical Recorder|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=December 4, 2013 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Biblical Recorder |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death, torture, and incarceration were the punishments inflicted on Montagnards gathering in groups of three or more by the Vietnamese with their religion severely persecuted and repressed at the hands of the Vietnamese Communist regime since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/9642|title=Montagnard: Government Destroys First Christian Degar Church|author=Montagnard Foundation|date=May 28, 2009|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Montagnard Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States State Department showed little concern at the plight of the Montagnards at the hands of the Vietnamese. A thirteen-year-old Montagnard girl Y Kang was severely assaulted, beaten and kicked along with 16 Montagnard women and men by Vietnamese police in Gai Lai province, Plei Ku city, district Mang Yang, commune H'ra in Buon Kret Krot village on July 7, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degar Montagnard: Beaten for Worshiping in Church.|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/13058|author=Charisma Magazine|date=August 19, 2011|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO|publisher=Charisma Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death was a possible consequence of getting caught with a Bible. The Vietnamese regime claims that Montagnard separatism is conducted by religious matters and uses this as a reason to attack their religion. Montagnard land was seized by the Vietnamese government after the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1492-i-dont-know-my-age-5-things-i-learned-in-my-isolated-tribe.html|title=I Don't Know My Age: 5 Things I Learned in My Isolated Tribe|last1=Evans|first1=Robert|last2=Enuol|first2=Rich|date= November 16, 2014|website=Cracked.com|publisher=Cracked.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of [[propaganda]] is most commonly defined as "information", especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/propaganda|title=propaganda - definition of propaganda in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the deliberate sharing of realities, views, and philosophies intended to alter behavior and stimulate people to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbes|first=Renee|date=|title=Teaching about Propaganda: An Examination of the Historical Roots of Media Literacy|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1046525.pdf|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|pages=57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain the close associations between media and propaganda, Richard Alan Nelson observed propaganda as a form of [[persuasion]] with intention with the aid of controlled transmission of single-sided information through [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy|last=Snow|first=Nancy|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media and propaganda are inseparable.

Mass media as a system for spreading and disseminating information and messages to public plays a role in amusing, entertaining and informing individuals with rules and values that situate them in social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chomsky.info/consent01/|title=A Propaganda Model, by Noam Chomsky (Excerpted from Manufacturing Consent)|website=chomsky.info|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, propaganda is a necessity for creating conflicts between different classes in society. In a media-saturated modern society, mass media is the main channel for the carrying out the propaganda action and fulfill the propaganda practices.

Modern propaganda includes using a variety of media in order to spread messages. This could include using press, radio, television, film, computers, fax machines, posters, meetings, door-to-door canvassing, handbills, buttons, billboards, speeches, flags, street names, monuments, coins, stamps, books, plays, comic strips, poetry, music, sporting events, cultural events, company reports, libraries, and awards and prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html|title=Media's Use of Propaganda to Persuade People's Attitude, Beliefs and Behaviors|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

"Propaganda" was a term that was commonly used in 1914, the beginning of the World War,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/what-is-propaganda/the-story-of-propaga)|title=What Is Propaganda? {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its origin can be traced back to the ancient Greece. In Athens, the original place of civilization as well as the centre of humankind culture, the citizen class was conscious and well informed of their interests and public affairs. Thus, conflicts and divergence on individual interests and other religious matters demands propaganda. Without the modern mass media such as newspaper, radio and televisions functioning as a medium for information spreading, a series of alternatives can play a role for propagandizing values and beliefs to shape and mould the opinions of men. These can include dramas, games and religious festivals. Additionally, another tool for propaganda in an oral-biased society is articulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/what-is-propaganda/the-story-of-propaganda|title=The Story of Propaganda {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Propaganda today is endowed with negative connotative meanings in a political context, despite that the word entered language with religious origins. Pope Gregory XV established an institution for spreading the faith and addressing a series of church affairs, which is namely the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. Further, a College of Propaganda was set up under Pope Urban VIII to train priests for missions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:STOP THIS MONSTER THAT STOPS AT NOTHING. PRODUCE TO THE LIMIT. THIS IS YOUR WAR. - NARA - 513557.jpg|thumb|Nazi propaganda poster.]]
Throughout the historical stages, propaganda has always been evident in momentum social movements such as American independence, the French Revolution,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and especially during wartimes. Wartime propaganda is often demanded for shaping public opinions to gain more allies on an international level, as well as calling for citizens to make a contribution and sacrifice to the war on a domestic level. Governments during the First World War devoted massive resources and huge amounts of effort to producing material designed to shape opinion and action internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/propaganda-as-a-weapon|title=Propaganda as a weapon? Influencing international opinion|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Clark claimed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-studies.ca/articles/war_propaganda.htm|title=Propaganda and War|website=www.media-studies.ca|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; posters in wartime with some visual codes are powerful tools to make people adapt to the new conditions and norms arising from the wars and to accommodate the needs of the war. During the Second World War, the power of propaganda came to the extreme, under the horrors of Nazi Germany. And since then, the word carries more negative connotations than neutral.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.tavbooks.com/?p=755|title=A Brief History of Propaganda|date=2014-02-20|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, the term is used in journalism, advertising, and education mostly in a political context. In non-democratic countries, propaganda continues to flourish as a means for indoctrinating citizens, and this practice is unlikely to cease in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In its origins, "propaganda" is an ancient and honorable word.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Propaganda on social media ==
[[Social media]] become a powerful tool for propaganda as the Internet is unprecedentedly accessible for each individual, and interactive social networking sites provide a strong platform for debate and sharing opinions. Propaganda, in forms of a video uploaded to YouTube, a post on Facebook or Twitter, or even a piece of comment, has far-reaching effectiveness to disseminate certain values and beliefs.

Another element that makes social media effective for sharing propaganda is that it can reach many people with little effort and users can filter the content to remove content they do not want while retaining what they would like to see.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2017/10/23/tech/how-social-media-brought-political-propoganda-21st-century|title=How social media brought political propaganda into the 21st century|last=Wood|first=Molly|last2=Schwab|first2=Kristin|date=October 23, 2017|website=MarketPlace|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ease of use can be used by ordinary people as well as government agencies and politicians, who can take advantage of the platforms to spread [[fake news website|"junk" news]] in favor of their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-07-social-media-globally.html|title=Social media manipulation rising globally, new report warns|last=University of Oxford|first=|date=July 20, 2018|website=Phys.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Youtube Propaganda ===
As it is reported in New York Times,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  "A propaganda video is released by North Korea on YouTube mainly depicting a United States aircraft carrier and a warplane being destroyed in computer-generated balls of fire, the latest salvo in an escalating war of words between the two. The video released by a state media outlet is narrated by a woman and including images of North Korea’s military. According to the video, North Korea’s missiles will be "stabbed into the throat of the carrier," and the jet will "fall from the sky," it warns."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/world/asia/north-korea-propaganda-video-attack-us.html|title=North Korea Flexes Its Military Muscle on YouTube, With Added Effects|last=Goldman|first=Russell|date=2017-03-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-19|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards of the event of Westminster terrorism attacking, YouTube is also an important tool for ISIS terrorism propaganda. ISIS flooded YouTube with hundreds of violent recruitment videos with terrifying visual or audio effects to promote and awake Westminster terror attack to capitalise on the atrocity. As ''The Sun'' reported, "many of the videos glorify terrorist Khalid Masood while others feature beheadings and extreme violence carried out by children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3185533/isis-floods-youtube-with-sick-propaganda-praising-westminster-terror-attacker/|title=ISIS floods YouTube with sick propaganda praising Westminster terror attacker|date=2017-03-27|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twitter propaganda ===

==== The Computational Propaganda Research Project ====
In 2017 the University of Oxford announced the launch of a series of studies researching how social media is globally used to manipulate public opinion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The study, which used interviews and "tens of millions posts on seven different social media platforms during scores of elections, political crises, and national security incidents", found that in Russia, approximately 45% of Twitter accounts are bots and in Taiwan, a campaign against [[Tsai Ing-wen|President Tsai Ing-wen]] involved thousands of accounts being heavily coordinated and sharing Chinese propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/working-papers/computational-propaganda-worldwide-executive-summary/|title=Computational Propaganda Worldwide: Executive Summary|work=The Computational Propaganda Project|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to like, share, and post on social networks were used. The bot accounts were used to "game algorithms" to push different content on the platforms. Real content put out by real people can be covered up and bots can make online measures of support, such as the number of likes or retweets something has received, look larger than it should, thus tricking users into thinking that specific piece of content is popular, a process identified as manufacturing consensus.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/19/social-media-proganda-manipulating-public-opinion-bots-accounts-facebook-twitter|title=Facebook and Twitter are being used to manipulate public opinion – report|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=2017-06-19|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russian Propaganda on Twitter ====
During the 2016 presidential election, 200,000 tweets deemed as "malicious activity" from Russia-linked accounts were outed on Twitter. The accounts pushed hundreds of thousands of these tweets claiming that Democrats were practicing witchcraft and posed as [[Black Lives Matter]] activists. Investigators were able to trace the account to a Kremlin-linked propaganda outfit. It was founded in 2013 and known as the [[Internet Research Agency]] (IRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731|title=Twitter deleted Russian troll tweets.

==== Terrorism propaganda on Twitter ====
[[File:Twitter logo.svg|thumb]]
"Using little-known content uploading services, anonymous text-pasting sites and multiple backup Twitter accounts, a select group of ISIS operatives managed to evade administrators’ controls to spread the Cantlie video, titled Lend Me Your Ears, around the web within a few hours."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/isis-twitter-youtube-message-social-media-jihadi|title=Isis in duel with Twitter and YouTube to spread extremist propaganda|last=Malik|first=Shiv|date=2014-09-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-19|last2=Laville|first2=Sandra|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Cresci|first3=Elena|last4=Gani|first4=Aisha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example of propaganda, Abdulrahman, the operator al-Hamid used the techniques of hashtagging in a Twitter post to gain the heat of the topics to disseminate the information. A great deal of followers of Hamid on Twitter were demanded to find the highest trending topics in the UK and popular account names they could jump on to get the largest possible reach. As @Abu_Laila wrote: "We need those who can supply us with the most active hashtags in the UK. And also the accounts of the most famous celebrities. I believe that the hashtag of Scotland's separation from Britain should be the first."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Propaganda on Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has made huge impact on society by allowing thousands of people to communicate with their family and friends, and be able to keep up-to-date with the rest of the world. But the usage of Facebook leads to the activity of propaganda online. For example, the Facebook pages of Syrian [[Bashar al-Assad|President Bashar al-Assad]] and the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces in 2013 and 2014, uses images to promote their agendas relating to politics during the conflicts following 2011 uprisings in Syria.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seo|first=Hyunjin|last2=Ebrahim|first2=Husain|date=2016-12-01|title=Visual propaganda on Facebook: A comparative analysis of Syrian conflicts|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1750635216661648|journal=Media, War &amp; Conflict|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=227–251|doi=10.1177/1750635216661648|issn=1750-6352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their government uses visual frames to help support the image that President Assad is a "fearless leader protecting its people and that life has continued normally through Syria," and to help strengthen the images of the violence and sufferings of the civilians caused by the Assad regime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There is also research that "cloaked" Facebook accounts are behind the creation of spreading political propaganda online to "imitate the identity of an opponent so they can spark hateful and aggressive reactions" from the media and the opponent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farkas|first=Johan|last2=Schou|first2=Jannick|last3=Neumayer|first3=Christina|date=2018-05-01|title=Cloaked Facebook pages: Exploring fake Islamist propaganda in social media|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444817707759|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1850–1867|doi=10.1177/1461444817707759|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process goes after a case study on a Danish Facebook pages that are cloaking their pages to resemble radical Islamist pages to help "[provoke} racist and anti-Muslim reactions as well as negative sentiments towards refugees and immigrants in Denmark."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The research founded on the pages analyzes the challenges of propaganda online, such as epistemological, methodological and conceptual challenges. The information also adds to the reader's "understanding of disinformation and propaganda in an increasingly interactive social media environment and contributes to a critical inquiry into social media and subversive politics."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Propaganda in Music ==
Music has always played a major role in popular culture.  Political ideology is often spread through media; however, the use of music reaches an extremely wide and varying audience.  The point of propaganda, according to Manzaria and Bruck, is to “Persuade people’s attitude, beliefs, and behaviors”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html|title=Media's Use of Propaganda to Persuade People's|last1=Manzaria|first1=Johnie|last2=Bruck|first2=Jonathon|website=EDGE ethics od development in a global environment|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Music of all genres is constantly being used to portray a [[Music and politics|political view]], shed light, or bring validity to a subject the author, or artist, feels is worth venturing.  Propaganda through modes like advertisement and campaign, while effective, will only reach a small group of the desired recipients. 

According to Putman, musical propaganda has a great deal to do with the audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/30/4/361/200108?redirectedFrom=PDF|title=The Aesthetic Relation of Musical Performance and Audience|last1=Putman|first1=Daniel|website=Oxford Academic|publisher=British Journal of Aesthetics|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each musical genre can reach a specific demographic within a few minutes, along with the propaganda intertwined. Purfleau brings a more social view to the concept of politically motivated music, stating that musical propaganda is "the basis for a certain kind of political art that aspires to contest the contemporary economic and social order"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/ca/7523862.0012.007/--reflections-on-music-and-propaganda?keywords=rgn...;rgn=main;view=fulltext|title=Reflections on Music and Propaganda|last1=Pufleau|first1=Luis|website=Contemporary Aesthetics|publisher=Michigan Publishing|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Purfleau's approach to understanding musical propaganda explains the timeless manor by which music has been used to portray viewpoints. Though music is not always the first media thought of when contemplating propaganda, it is an extremely effective mode and has proved to influence popular culture throughout human history.

'''Pseudohermaphroditism''', or '''pseudo-hermaphroditism''', is an old clinical term for an organism that is born with primary sex characteristics of one sex but develops the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s&lt;ref name="Dorlands Medical Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_p_39zPzhtm#12675444| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228012313/http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_p_39zPzhtm| archivedate=2007-12-28|title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-07 |format= |work=}}{{dead_link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH MESH"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2008/MB_cgi?field=uid&amp;term=D011545 |title=MESH |accessdate=2007-12-07 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are different from what would be expected on the basis of the [[gonad]]al tissue ([[ovary]] or [[testis]]). It can be contrasted with the term [[true hermaphroditism]], which described a condition where testicular and ovarian tissue were present in the same individual. This language has fallen out of favor due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice D.|last2=Chase|first2=Cheryl|last3=Sousa|first3=Aron|last4=Gruppuso|first4=Phillip A.|last5=Frader|first5=Joel|date=18 August 2005|title="Changing the Nomenclature/Taxonomy for Intersex: A Scientific and Clinical Rationale."|url=http://www.aissg.org/PDFs/Dreger-Nomenclature-2005.PDF|journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=27 July 2016|via=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220154642/http://www.aissg.org/PDFs/Dreger-Nomenclature-2005.PDF|archive-date=2016-12-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a shift to nomenclature based on genetics.

The term ''male pseudohermaphrodite'' was used when a testis is present, and the term ''female pseudohermaphrodite'' was used when an ovary is present.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-9485-4"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Langman, Jan |author2=Thomas Sadler |title=Langman's medical embryology |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9485-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, external [[sex organs]] associated with pseudohermaphroditism look intermediate between a typical [[clitoris]] and [[penis]]. In other cases, the external sex organs have an appearance that would be expected to be seen with the "opposite" gonadal tissue. Because of this, pseudohermaphroditism is sometimes not identified until [[puberty]] or adulthood.&lt;ref name="pmid6485686"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michiels I, Peperstraete L, De Wever I, Gruwez JA |title=Inguinal hernia repair leading to the diagnosis of internal male pseudohermaphroditism |journal=Acta Chir.

Associated conditions include [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency|5-α-reductase deficiency]]&lt;ref&gt;[[5-alpha-reductase deficiency|5ARD]] is also known as '''5-α-reductase 2 deficiency''' because the [[SRD5A2|5-α-reductase 2 gene]] is deficient&lt;/ref&gt; and [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;

Perplexing and difficult problems remain unresolved, e.g., whether the variability in manifestations is due to variable expressions of steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 or to effects of testosterone itself. It is also imperative to establish whether defects in steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2, perhaps in the heterozygous state, are responsible for a portion of cases of sporadic hypospadias, to determine whether 5 alpha-reductase plays a role in progesterone action in women, and to elucidate the relation between androgen action and gender role behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

One study also showed them scoring around dull normal IQs. A greater prevalence of liberal body hair growth in men with higher IQs and/or educational levels was also observed in several samples. The exceptions to this statistical trend are too unsettling, however. Nevertheless, the results of a number of published studies, including one showing higher DHT-to-T ratio in homosexual men, done with different objectives over a span of 80 years, together strongly support these findings. Furthermore, in an animal model, "cognitive-enhancing effects" of "5alpha-reduced androgen [metabolites]" were recently demonstrated. | doi = 10.1196/annals.1314.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==

Sex determination and differentiation is generalized with chromosomal sex during fertilization. At early stages, phenotypic sex does not match chromosomal sex—until later during intrauterine development, sexual maturation is reached. During intrauterine development, females change to male with the testes moving down from a blind vaginal pouch with a developing scrotum, as well as a penis which initially resembled a clitoris. What seems like a female phenotype is altered by increased testosterone levels secretion.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, Michael R. "Human Heredity: Principles and Issues". Cengage Learning, 2011, 2009. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations affecting the androgen receptor (AR) gene may cause either complete or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. Androgen, a hormone used to describe a group of sex steroid hormones, is responsible for affecting male pseudohermaphroditism. The differentiation of the fetus as male takes place during the sixth or seventh week of gestation. The development is directed by the testicular determining factor: the gene SRY (sex determining region on Y chromosome). Throughout 9th to 13th week, the development of a male genitalia is dependent upon the conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen by the action of 5α-reductase within the target tissues of the genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lane PH, Steffes MW, Mauer SM |title=Renal histologic changes in diabetes mellitus |journal=Seminars in Nephrology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=254–9 |date=May 1990  |pmid=2190282}}&lt;/ref&gt; A type of internal male pseudohermaphroditism is Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome, which is developed through synthesis of Müllerian-inhibiting factor defects. In such instances, duct derivatives are now in 46XY males—this includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina. These individuals with a hernia sac and bowel loops were found with duct derivatives as well as testes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patil V, Muktinaini S, Patil R, Verma A |title=Persistent müllerian duct syndrome: a case report |journal=The Indian Journal of Surgery |volume=75 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=460–2 |date=June 2013  |pmid=24426648 |doi=10.1007/s12262-013-0831-6 |pmc=3693295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Intersex in history|History of intersex surgery}}
[[John Money]] is perhaps the best-known early researcher in this area. His [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] [[thesis]] was titled ''Hermaphroditism: An Inquiry into the Nature of a Human Paradox'', and awarded by [[Harvard University]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Money |first=John W. |year=1952 |title=Hermaphroditism: An inquiry into the nature of a human paradox |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Harvard University |oclc=81648824}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money's general views on gender identity as something learned during childhood were later directly contradicted by a biography published in 2001 by one of his former patients, [[David Reimer]]. Among the repercussions was damage to John Money's reputation. Not only had his theory of gender plasticity been dealt a severe blow but Reimer's biography described bizarrely unpleasant childhood therapy sessions, and implied that Money had ignored or concealed the developing evidence that Reimer's reassignment to female was not going well. Money's defenders have suggested that some of the allegations about the therapy sessions may have been the result of [[False memory syndrome]]. However, Reimer's brother and mother both agreed that the therapy was not "working" in the sense that Reimer wasn't in any way developing a female self-image during his treatment with Dr. Money. Dr. Money never publicly stated that his conclusions were incorrect.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Milton Diamond]] become a well known expert public advocate on intersex in the early 21st century. He is the director of the Pacific Center for Sex and Society.&lt;ref name="Pacific Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/ |title=Pacific Center for Sex and Society, Dept. Anatomy &amp; Reproduction Biology - John A. Burns School of Medicine, UHM |accessdate=2007-11-26 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Use of the term "pseudohermaphroditism" can be problematic, and is now considered redundant.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; The term "pseudohermaphroditism" was created by [[Edwin Klebs]] in 1876,&lt;ref name="Intersexuality and gender identity differentiation Annual Review of Sex Research - Find Articles"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zucker KJ |title=Intersexuality and gender identity differentiation |journal=Annual Review of Sex Research |volume=10 |issue= |pages=1–69 |year=1999 |pmid=10895247 |doi=10.1080/10532528.1999.10559774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klebs, T. A. E. (1876). Handbuch der pathologischen Anatomie [Handbook of pathological anatomy]. Berlin: A. Hirschwald,{{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; long before the genetic roles of the [[X chromosome]] and [[Y chromosome]] and the social components of [[gender identity]] were well characterized, which is why the term is usually used to describe the dissonance between gonadal histology and external genital appearance.

The term "[[intersexuality]]" was introduced by [[Richard Goldschmidt]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="Intersexuality and gender identity differentiation Annual Review of Sex Research - Find Articles" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt, R. (1923). The Mechanism and Physiology of Sex Determination, Methuen &amp; Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "intersex" has also been challenged; the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and the European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology have adopted a nomenclature system based on [[disorders of sex development]] (DSD), which covers "congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical" and thus replaces many disparate terms, including but not limited to those based on "hermaphrodite".&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee PA, Houk CP, Ahmed SF, Hughes IA |title=Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders. International Consensus Conference on Intersex |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=e488–500 |date=August 2006  |pmid=16882788 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0738|pmc=2082839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it adopted the term to open "many more doors", the now defunct [[Intersex Society of North America]] itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder.&lt;ref name="Why is ISNA using DSD? | Intersex Society of North America"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/node/1066 |title=Why is ISNA using 'DSD'? | work=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=2007-12-07 |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'DSD' is itself heavily contested, including by [[Intersex civil society organizations|civil society organizations]], human rights institution and academics. Academics like [[Georgiann Davis]]&lt;ref name="davis-dsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/books.htm?chapterid=1943090 |first=Georgiann |last=Davis|authorlink=Georgiann Davis| date =2011|title =DSD is a Perfectly Fine Term": Reasserting Medical Authority through a Shift in Intersex Terminology|editor1-first= PJ |editor1-last=McGann|editor2-first=David J. |editor2-last=Hutson|journal=Sociology of Diagnosis (Advances in Medical Sociology)|volume =12|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=155–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morgan Holmes]], and clinical psychologists like [[Tiger Devore]]&lt;ref name="tiger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wewhofeeldifferently.info/interview.php?interview=108 |title=An Interview with Dr. Tiger Howard Devore PhD|work=We Who Feel Differently|date=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the term DSD was designed to "reinstitutionalise" medical authority over intersex bodies, making intersex bodies more treatable and more of a stigma" (Holmes).&lt;ref name="morgan-name"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011| title = The Intersex Enchiridion: Naming and Knowledge in the Clinic | url = http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/soma.2011.0026?journalCode=soma | journal = Somatechnics | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 87–114 | doi = 10.3366/soma.2011.0026 | last1 = Holmes| first1 = Morgan|authorlink = Morgan Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or place intersex "neatly into medical turf and safely away from critics of its medicalisation" (Davis).&lt;ref name="davis-dsd" /&gt; In May 2016, [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth]] published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = interACT| title = interACT Statement on Intersex Terminology| work = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth]]| accessdate = 30 May 2016| date = May 2016 | url = http://interactadvocates.org/interact-statement-on-intersex-terminology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the challenges involved in the use of the term is the case of women with [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (CAIS). These women often have primary and secondary sexual characteristics typical of other women; however, they are karyotypically XY and have internal testes, rather than ovaries. They have the same likelihood of a karyotypically XX woman of enjoying sexual pleasure but are unable to biologically reproduce. Their sexuality (homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual etc.) is not necessarily determined by this syndrome. However scientifically precise the description "male" ''pseudohermaphrodite'' may be for such women, its social inappropriateness is in controversy.

The framework suggests four stages – [[awareness]], attraction, [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]] and allegiance to describe how sport and event involvement progressively develops with corresponding behaviours (e.g., playing, watching, buying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Shilbury, Westerbeek, Quick, Funk| year=2009| title = Strategic Sport Marketing, 3rd ed., p. 41-61, |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74175-626-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCM uses a vertical framework to characterise various [[psychological]] connections that individuals form with objects to explain the role of attitude formation and change that directs behaviours across a variety of consumption activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C.

==Framework==
[[Image:PsychologicalContinuumModel.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Please click the box to enlarge'']]

The figure shows the four stages of the PCM - awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance. On each stage, there is a horizontal decision making process. Inputs (green arrows) influence the internal processing (blue boxes) that creates outputs (yellow arrows). The outcomes are shown in the four different stages of the PCM (grey boxes). The unique decision making process is based upon the level of involvement of the consumer towards a sport/team/event. The following sequence is shown in each stage:

Inputs --&gt; Internal Processing &lt;--&gt; Output

The PCM framework states that, through the processing of internal and external inputs, individuals progress upward along the four psychological connection stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Lock, D., Darcy, S., &amp; Taylor, T.| year=2009| title= ''Starting with a clean slate: An analysis of member identification with a new sports team''| publisher = Sport Management Review, 12, 15-25..}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall evaluation of an object at a specific stage is the product of the processing of personal, psychological and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C. Funk |year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7506-8666-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==

===Awareness===

|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Awareness'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John’s introduction to road cycling occurred at the age of 15 through a key socialising agent, his uncle Jack. Jack bought John his first bike, which he rode to school every day. When John was 15 and saw the Tour the France on television, he was amazed by the event. When Jack gave John one of his old road bikes and took him cycling on the weekend, John's progression to the Attraction stage began.
}}
[[Awareness]] stands for the notion when an individual first learns that a certain sport, event or team exists. In this stage the individual has not formed a preference or favourite. The PCM suggests that awareness of sport, teams and events stems from formal and informal channels, for examples parents, friends, school and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Funk, D. C.| year=2002| title= Consumer-based marketing: The use of micro-segmentation strategies for understanding sport consumption| journal = [[International Journal of Sports Marketing &amp; Sponsorship]] |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=231–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases awareness begins during [[childhood]], but can also derive from other socializing agents. The value placed on the specific sport and event from a societal perspective is important in the awareness stage. The examples of ''I know about football'' and ''I know about Liverpool FC'' illustrate the awareness stage box.

===Attraction===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attraction'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John began to realize that cycling provided him a number of positive outcomes. He was able to meet other cyclists, make new friends and spend time with his uncle. He received pleasure from riding outside and the thrill of riding down hills at fast speed. His self-esteem rose by getting into shape and being one of the fastest riders among his friends. He also enjoyed the break from his daily routine when riding the bike. }}

In the attraction stage, the individual has a favourite sport, event, team or leisure hobby.   Attraction is based upon a number of extrinsic and intrinsic motives.  In other words,  the sport, event, or leisure hobby provides the opportunity to satisfy needs and receive benefits. The motives stem from a combination of personal, psychological and environmental factors. The Attraction processing creates outcomes of positive affect and intentions, as well as engaging in consumption behaviour related to the sport and event. The examples of ''I like football'' and ''I like Liverpool FC'' illustrate the attraction stage box.

===Attachment===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attachment'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progresses into the attachment stage relatively quickly and within a year begins riding every Saturday and Sunday morning. Cycling now is an important part in his life. He often wears cycling clothes to class, spent time visiting bike shops and uses the Internet to follow international cycling events. He even joins a cycling club and travels to regional cycling competitions with his friends who are predominantly cyclists.
}}

In the attachment stage the benefits and the sport object are internalised taking on a collective emotional, functional, and symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Filo, K., Funk, D.C., &amp; O’Brien, D.| year=2009| title= ''The Meaning Behind Attachment: Exploring Camaraderie, Cause, and Competency at a Charity Sport Event''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 23, 361-387.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological connection towards a sport, event, team or leisure hobby strengthens. Internal processes become more important and the influence of socializing agents decreases. Examples for the attachment stage are ''I am a football player'' or ''I am a Liverpool Fan''.

===Allegiance===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Allegiance'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progressed into the allegiance stage during his last year of college as the strength of his connection to cycling became durable. He thought of cycling and related activities daily. He always found time to ride and follow the sport regardless of university and work requirements or other sport opportunities. John’s psychological connection to cycling has strengthened and is now guiding his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Funk, D.C., &amp; James, J.| year=2006| title= ''Consumer Loyalty: The Meaning of Attachment in the Development of Sport Team Allegiance''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 20, 189-217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the attachment processing continues, the internal collective meaning becomes more durable in terms of persistence and resistance and has greater impact on activities and behaviour. This is noted by the examples of ''I live for football'' and ''I live for Liverpool FC'' within the allegiance stage.

'''Rāhula''' ([[Pāli]] and Sanskrit) was the only son of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama (commonly known as the Buddha)]]  ({{nowrap|{{circa}} 563 or 480 {{en dash}}}} {{nowrap|483 or 400 BCE}}), and his wife and princess [[Yasodharā|Yaśodharā]]. He is mentioned in numerous Buddhist texts, from the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early period]] onward. Accounts about Rāhula indicate a mutual impact between Prince Siddhārtha's life and those of his family members. According to the [[Pali Canon|Pāli tradition]], Rāhula is born on the day of Prince Siddhārta's [[great renunciation|renunciation]], and is therefore named ''Rāhula'', meaning a fetter on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. According to the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] tradition, and numerous other [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|later sources]], however, Rāhula is only ''conceived'' on the day of Prince Siddhārtha, and is born six years later, when Prince Siddhārtha becomes enlightened as the [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]. This long gestation period is explained by bad [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] from previous lives of both Yaśodharā and of Rāhula himself, although more [[religious naturalism|naturalistic]] reasons are also given. As a result of the late birth, Yaśodharā needs to prove that Rāhula is really Prince Siddhārtha's son, which she eventually does successfully by an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]]. Historian {{ill|Wolfgang Schumann|de|Wolfgang Schumann (Historiker)}} has argued that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula and waited for his birth, to be able to leave the palace with the king and queen's permission, but Orientalist {{ill|Noël Péri|fr}} considered it more likely that Rāhula was born after Prince Siddhārtha left his palace.

Between seven and fifteen years after Rāhula is born, the Buddha returns to his [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|hometown]], where Yaśodharā has Rāhula ask the Buddha for the throne of the [[Shakya|Śākya]] clan. The Buddha responds by having Rāhula [[pabbajja|ordain]] as the first Buddhist [[samanera|novice monk]]. He teaches the young novice about [[sacca|truth]], self-reflection, and [[anatta|not-self]], eventually leading to Rāhula's enlightenment. Although early accounts state that Rāhula dies before the Buddha does, later tradition has it that Rāhula is one of the disciples that outlives the Buddha, guarding the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of the [[Maitreya|next Buddha]]. Rāhula is known in Buddhist texts for his eagerness for learning, and was honored by novice monks and [[samaneri|nuns]] throughout Buddhist history. His accounts have led to a perspective in Buddhism of seeing children as hindrances to the spiritual life on the one hand, and as people with potential for enlightenment on the other hand.

== Accounts ==
Some early texts such as those of the [[Pali Canon|Pāli tradition]] do not mention Rāhula at all;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=113}} but he is mentioned in later Pāli texts such as the [[Apadana|Apadāna]] and the [[atthakatha|commentaries]], as well as in the texts on [[Vinaya|monastic discipline]] of the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] and [[Mahasanghika|Mahāsaṇghika]] traditions.{{refn |For the [[Apadana|Apadāna]], see {{harvtxt |Crosby |2013 |page = 105}}. The other information is mentioned in {{harvtxt |Meeks |2016 |p=139}}.}} Earliest texts do not describe Rāhula in much detail, and he remains an ideal figure without much depth in character.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=109}} Because of the lack of detail, especially after Rāhula's ordination, some scholars have argued Rāhula did not have an important role in Buddhism.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} Apart from the early texts, there are many [[post-canonical Buddhist texts]] that contain accounts about Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}} The accounts about Rāhula reveal that when Prince Siddhārtha leaves his palace to become a monk, his decision and subsequent spiritual quest is not just a personal matter, but also affects his family every step during the way, as they respond to and affect the prince on his path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. Thus, the prince's life before enlightenment is about two parallel spiritual lives, that of the Buddha and that of his family.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |pp=122{{en dash}}4}}

=== Birth ===
==== Pāli tradition ====
[[File:Siddhartha leaving sleeping Yashodhara and Rahula Roundel 17 buddha ivory tusk.jpg|thumb|Just before the prince leaves the palace for the spiritual life, he takes one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child.|alt=Ivory tusk showing a woman and a child sleeping on a bed, and a man standing besides the bed.]]
Rāhula is born on same day Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] renounces the throne by leaving the palace,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} when the prince is 29 years old,{{sfn |Keown |2004 |page=233}}{{sfn |Irons |2007 |p=400}}{{refn |group=note |According to some traditional sources, the prince is sixteen then.{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=267}} Furthermore, some sources say that Rāhula is born seven days before Prince Siddhārtha leaves the palace.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/rahulamata.htm Rāhulamātā]}}{{sfn |Sarao |2017 |loc=Biography of the Buddha and Early Buddhism}}}} on the full moon day of the eight [[lunar month]] of the [[Hindu calendar|ancient Indian calendar]].{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} That day, Prince Siddhārtha is preparing himself to leave the palace. The Pāli account claims that when he receives the news of his son's birth he replies "{{IAST|rāhulajāto bandhanaṃ jātaṃ}}", meaning 'A ''rāhu'' is born, a fetter has arisen',{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} that is, an impediment to the search for enlightenment. Accordingly, [[Suddhodana|Śuddhodana]], Prince Siddhārtha's father and king of the [[Shakya|Śākya clan]], names the child ''Rāhula'',{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} because he does not want his son to pursue a spiritual life as a mendicant.{{sfn |Irons |2007 |p=400}} In some versions, Prince Siddhārtha is the one naming his son this way, for being a hindrance on his spiritual path.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} Just before the prince leaves the palace for the spiritual life, he takes one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child. Fearing his resolve might waver, Prince Siddhārtha resists to hold his son and leaves the palace as he has planned.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} Rāhula therefore becomes Prince Siddhārtha's first, but also last and only son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Violatti |first1=Cristian |title=Siddhartha Gautama |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Siddhartha_Gautama/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825002210/http://www.ancient.eu:80/Siddhartha_Gautama |archive-date=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=29 October 2018 |date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}

==== Other traditions ====
Other texts derive ''rāhu'' differently. For example, the Pāli ''[[Apadana|Apadāna]]'', as well as another account found in the texts of [[vinaya|monastic discipline]] of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, derive ''rāhu'' from the eclipse of the moon, which traditionally was seen to be caused by the [[asura (Buddhism)|asura]] (demon) [[Rāhu]].{{sfn |Gnoli |1977 |page = 119}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} The ''Apadāna'' states that just like the moon is obstructed from view by Rāhu, Prince Siddhārtha is obstructed by Rāhula's birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=105}} The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition relates, however, that Rāhula is conceived on the evening of the [[great renunciation|renunciation]] of Prince Siddhārtha, and born six years later, on the day that his father achieves enlightenment,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} which was during a lunar eclipse.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=119}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=105}} Further credence is given to the astrological theory of Rāhula's name by the observation that sons of [[list of Buddhas|previous Buddhas]] are given similar names, related to constellations.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}}

Mūlasarvāstivāda and later Chinese texts such as the ''[[Dharmaguptaka#Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra|Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra]]'' give two types of explanation for the long gestation period.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}40}}{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |p=69}} The first type involves the [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] of Princess Yaśodharā and Rāhula himself.&lt;!--139-40--&gt; According to this interpretation, Yaśodharā has to bear the suffering of carrying a child in her womb for six years, because in a previous life as a cow herder she had refused to help her mother to carry a pail of milk and left it for her mother to carry the extra pail for six [[yojana|leagues]].{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}40}}{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |pp=69{{en dash}}70}} As for Rāhula, his karma was that in a previous life as a king he unintentionally had a sage wait for six days.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=143}} In this life, he was a king and his brother, [[Bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|a previous life of the Buddha]],{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}} was a [[rishi|hermit]] who had taken a vow he would only live from what was given by people. One day, the brother broke his vow to take some water, and feeling guilty, asked the king to punish him.{{refn |group=note |In the texts of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, the brother is another hermit, not the king, but he sends his brother to see the king for punishment.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=8}}}} The king refused to issue a punishment for such a trivial matter, but had his brother wait for his final decision and constrained in the royal gardens. After six days, the king suddenly realized he had forgotten about the hermit and immediately set him free, including apologies and gifts. As a result, Rāhula had to wait for six years before being born.{{sfn |Sasson |Law |2008 |p=69}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=117}} In some versions, the king did not allow a sage to enter his kingdom and accumulated the same bad karma of a long gestation period.{{sfn |Shirane |2013 |pp=168{{en dash}}9}} The later Mahāyāna commentary ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' ({{zh|t=大智度論|p=Dazhidulun}}) does not blame Yaśodharā's karma for the six years gestation period, but does mention Rāhula's same karma as a king. However, in the 13th-century Japanese devotional text ''Raun Kōshiki'', Rāhula's late birth is seen as evidence of a miracle, rather than a result of karma.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=141}}{{refn |group=note |In the Pāli texts, no long gestation period of Rāhula is mentioned, but a similar motif occurs in the story of Suppāvāsā, with a similar karma in a past life.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=136}}}}

The second type of explanation consists of the more [[Religious naturalism|naturalistic]] argument that Yaśodharā is practicing [[Asceticism#Buddhism|religious austerities]] involving fasting and sleeping on a straw bed, which causes Rāhula's growth to slow down. She is involved in these practices during the time when Siddhārtha is practicing self-mortification. Later, King Śuddhodana prevents Yaśodharā from hearing any news of her former husband, and she gradually becomes healthier, as the pregnancy continues normally. However, some time later, the false rumor spreads that the former prince has died of his ascetism.&lt;!--118--&gt; Yaśodharā becomes very desperate and depressed, endangering her own pregnancy. When the news reaches the palace that Siddhārtha has attained enlightenment, Yaśodharā is overjoyed and gives birth to Rāhula. Buddhist Studies scholar [[John S. Strong]] notes that this account draws a parallel between the quest for enlightenment and Yaśodharā's path to being a mother, and eventually, they both are accomplished at the same time.&lt;!--119--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |pp=118{{en dash}}9}}

The late childbirth leads to doubts in the Śākya clan as to who is the father, as told in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, in the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'' and in the later Chinese ''Zabaozang jing'' ({{zh|t=雜寶藏經}}).{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}} Since Rāhula's birth was not regarded by Buddhists to be a virginal or miraculous birth, tradition had to explain that Prince Siddhārtha was actually the father.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=119}} Yaśodharā responds by putting her child on a stone in a pond of water and making an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]] that if Rāhula is really her child, that he and the stone may not sink, but rather float back-and-forth. After she makes the declaration, the child floats according to her vow.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=142}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}} Strong notes that this is a symbolic parallel with the attainment of enlightenment by the Buddha, described as the "further shore", and coming back to teach humankind.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=140}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}} The ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'' contains another account, in which Prince Siddhārtha has several wives,&lt;!--140--&gt; and a wife other than Yaśodharā is the one defending her, being witness of her innocence.&lt;!--141--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}41}}

Furthermore, in both the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts and the ''Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa'', there is a third account that proves Yaśodharā's innocence: the Buddha makes everyone around him look identical to him, through a [[ṛddhi|supernatural accomplishment]]. Rāhula proves that the Buddha is his true father when he manages to approach the real Buddha straight away.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}}{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=32{{en dash}}3}}{{refn |group=note |Yaśodharā had Rāhula present a gift to his real father, and he manages to find him straight away. In one version of the story the gift is a ring signet,{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=32{{en dash}}3}} in another version it is an aphrodisiac.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}}(''See [[Rāhula#Ordination|§ Ordination]], below.'')}} In a fourth story about proving Yaśodhara's purity, appearing in Chinese [[Avadana|Avadāna]]-style texts from the 5th century CE onward, she is burnt alive, but miraculously survives. In this account, King Śuddhodana orders that she be killed by burning her alive as punishment for her alleged impurity. Instead of being hurt by the flames, however, she performs an act of truth and the fire transforms into a pond of water. Śuddhodana welcomes her and her son back into the clan, and later becomes very fond of Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=142}} Some Chinese [[Jataka|Jātakas]] say that he recognizes his son Siddhārtha in the child, and manages to better cope with the loss of Prince Siddhārtha.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=22}} Religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma sees the fire ordeal as a metaphor that parallels the Buddha's enlightenment, a similar argument that Strong makes.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=142}}

==== Historical analysis ====
Historian {{ill|Wolfgang Schumann|de|Wolfgang Schumann (Historiker)}} hypothesized that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula to please his parents, obtain their permission for leaving the palace and becoming a mendicant. He further speculated that the prince only conceived a son thirteen years after his marriage, because Yaśodharā initially did not want to bear a child, for fear that the prince would leave the palace and the throne as soon as the child was conceived.{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=46}} Orientalist and missionary {{ill |Noël Péri |fr}} believed that a late gestation period was more historically probable than the birth on the same day as in the Pāli tradition. She believed that if Prince Siddhārtha had left an heir to the throne, there would have been no sound reason for him to leave secretly at night. She further argued that there are many sources that try to explain the long gestation period, indicating an established tradition.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}}

Besides historical speculations, Buddhist Studies scholar Kate Crosby argues that Prince Siddhārtha conceiving or giving birth to a son before his renunciation functions as a motif to prove that he is the best at each possible path in life: after having tried the life of a father to the fullest, he decides to leave it behind for a better alternative.&lt;!--108--&gt; In [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] India, being a father and bearing a son was seen as a spiritual and religious path as well as that of renouncing one's family, and Prince Siddhārtha's bringing a son in the world before renunciation proves he is capable of both.&lt;!--108-9--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=108{{en dash}}9}}

=== Ordination ===

The accounts continue and describe that Rāhula is raised by his mother Yaśodharā and grandfather King Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} When Rāhula is seven,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} nine{{sfn |Meeks|2016 |p=136}}{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=123}} or fifteen{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=110}} years old, the Buddha returns to his home city of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] at the request of Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} The [[Mahavastu|Mahāvastu]] text from the [[Lokottaravāda]] tradition states that the royals try to prevent Rāhula from learning about the return of his father, but eventually he insists to know who the "Great Ascetic" about to arrive is, and he is told&lt;!--133-4--&gt;{{em dash}}indologist Bhikkhu Telwatte Rahula {{sic}} argues that the child was conscious of being without father.&lt;!--134--&gt;{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |pp=133{{en dash}}4}} Next, the Mahāvastu and the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts relate that Yaśodharā tries to tempt the Buddha back into his life as a prince by having Rāhula offer the Buddha an [[aphrodisiac]].{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}} Mūlasarvāstivāda texts continue and tell that her plan backfires when the Buddha has Rāhula eat it himself, and Rāhula therefore becomes enamored by his father and wishes to follow him.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2012 |p=145}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}} In the Pāli version of the story, on the seventh day of the Buddha's return, Yaśodharā takes Rāhula to see his father, the Buddha. She tells Rāhula that since his father has renounced the palace life and as he is the next royal prince in line, he should ask his father for his inheritance of crown and treasure, for his future sake when his grandfather will no longer rule the kingdom.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}} After the Buddha has had a meal, Rāhula follows the Buddha, asking him for his inheritance.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} The Buddha does not try to prevent Rāhula from following him,{{sfn |Penner |2009 |p=68}} but in some versions of the story, some women from the court do try to, yet Rāhula persists.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |p=5}} He then looks at his father and says, "Pleasant is your shadow, [[shramana|recluse]]".{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} Reaching the [[Nigrodharama|Park of Nigrodha]], where the Buddha is staying,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} the Buddha considers that the heritage of the throne will one day perish, and is tied up with suffering and stress: "I will give him the wealth I obtained under the [[Bodhi tree|tree of enlightenment]] thus making him the heir of an inheritance that does not perish."{{sfn |Penner |2009 |p=68}}

Most traditions relate that the Buddha then calls [[Sariputta|Śāriputra]] and asks him to ordain Rāhula. Rāhula ordains and is the first [[Samanera|''śrāmaṇera'']] (novice monk),{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and probably the first person in the [[sangha|monastic order]] to [[pabbajja|ordain in a formal way]].{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=83}} In some versions of the story, such as the 9th century Chinese ''Weicengyou Yinyuan Jing'' ({{zh|t=未曾有因緣經}}), a group of young boys ordain together with him.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=143}}{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}} The king discovers that now his grandson, [[Nanda (half-brother of Buddha)|his son Nanda]] and a number of other young men in the royal family have ordained and left the palace. Seeing his daughter grieve, he asks the Buddha that from now on, he only ordain people with the consent of his parents.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=281}} Śuddhodana explains that Rāhula's ordination was a great shock to him. The Buddha assents to the proposal.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} This rule is later expanded in the case of women ordaining, as both parents and the husband have to give permission first to allow women to join the order of monks and nuns.{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=163}} In some versions of the story of Rāhula's ordination, Yaśodharā also protests, but relents in the end.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |p=34}} The Mahāvastu states, however, that Rāhula asks to ordain himself, and is eventually granted permission by Yaśodharā and Śuddhodana.{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=134}}

Archaeologist Maurizio Taddei has noted that in many [[Gandhara]]n art depictions, Rāhula's life is linked to that of a previous life of the Buddha, the hermit [[Sumedho (Buddhist figure)|Sumedho]]. The Buddha giving his spiritual heritage to his son is compared to that of Sumedho allowing the [[Dipankara|Buddha Dīpaṃkara]] to walk over him, which is followed by Dipaṃkara predicting that Sumedho will become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] in a future life.&lt;!--119--&gt; Both the figure of Gautama Buddha giving his inheritance to his son, and the figure of Dīpaṃkara Buddha giving his inheritance of [[Buddhahood]] to Sumedho are depicted with flames emitting from their bodies; both scenes are depictions of inheritance, [[filial piety|filial]] and disciple piety; both may have been considered by 5th-century Buddhists to be representations of "eager youth".&lt;!--120--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=119{{en dash}}20}}

=== Enlightenment and death ===

According to the Pāli texts, once Rāhula has become novice, the Buddha teaches Rāhula regularly.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} His instructions are very age-specific, using vivid metaphors&lt;!--113--&gt; and simple explanations.&lt;!--115--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=113, 115}} The Buddha's teachings have led to numerous [[sūtra|discourses]] being named after Rāhula in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} Pāli texts relate how Rāhula grows up to become a novice that is diligent,&lt;!--Nakagawa--&gt; dutiful, amenable and eager for learning,&lt;!--Malalasekera--&gt;{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=34}} but there are also some early medieval Chinese and Japanese accounts which relate that Rāhula initially struggles with being a novice and only later appreciates the Buddha's teaching.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=143}} Besides the Buddha, Śāriputra and [[Maudgalyayana|Maugalyayāna]] also help to teach Rāhula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |author2=Stefon, Matt |title=Shariputra {{en dash}} Disciple of the Buddha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shariputra |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114220448/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shariputra |archive-date=14 November 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=34}} Rāhula often assists Śāriputra on his rounds for [[alms (Buddhism)|alms]] in the morning, and sometimes on other travels.{{refn |Both {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} mention the alms, but only {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} mentions the other travels.}} Every morning, Rāhula wakes up and throws a handful of sand in the air, making the wish that he may be counselled by good teachers as much as those grains of sand.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}

Still in the same year as Rāhula's ordination, the Buddha teaches his son the importance of telling the truth in a discourse known as the ''Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta''.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} In this discourse, the Buddha teaches and encourages consistent self-reflection, to help let go of all evil actions that lead to harm to oneself and others, and to develop self-control and a moral life.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}} He encourages reflection before, during and after one's actions,{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}} and explains that lying makes the spiritual life void and empty,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} leading to many other evils.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/am/ambalatthika_raahulovaada_s.htm Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta]}}

When Rāhula becomes eighteen years old, the Buddha instructs Rāhula in a [[Kammaṭṭhāna|meditation technique]] to counter the desires that hinder him during his tours for alms. Rāhula has grown enamored with his own and his father's handsome appearance. To help Rāhula, the Buddha teaches another discourse to him. He tells Rāhula that all [[rūpa|matter]] is [[anatta|not-self]], and the same holds for the [[skandhas|different parts of one's mental experience]].{{refn |For the part on alms rounds, see {{harvtxt|Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}}. For the part about not-self, see {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and {{harvtxt|Crosby |2013 |p=115}}.}} Having heard the discourse, Rāhula starts to practice meditation. His teacher Śāriputra recommends him to practice [[anapanasati|breathing meditation]],{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=189{{en dash}}93}} but is unable to give Rāhula the instructions he needs.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=110}} Rāhula therefore asks the Buddha to explain the meditation method in more detail and the Buddha responds by describing several meditation techniques to him.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |pp=189{{en dash}}93}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=115}} On a similar note, the Buddha teaches Rāhula at a place called Andhavana about the [[anicca|impermanence]] of all things, and instructs him how to overcome the [[asava|"taints"]] inside the mind. As a result, Rāhula attains enlightenment.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |pp=482{{en dash}}3}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=116}} Pāli tradition has it that the sermon is also attended by a [[crore]] of [[deva (Buddhism)|heavenly beings]], who once had vowed to witness the enlightenment of the son of the Buddha. Rāhula obtains the name "Rāhula the Lucky" ({{lang-pi|Rāhula-bhadda|italic=no |link=no}}; {{lang-sa|Rāhula-bhadra|link=no}}), which he himself explains is because of being the son of the Buddha, and because of having attained enlightenment.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}.

Later, the Buddha declares that Rāhula is [[etatagga|foremost]] among all disciples in eagerness in learning ({{lang-pi|sikkhākamānaṃ|italic=yes |link=no}}).{{sfn |Powers |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and in the Pāli [[Udana|Udāna]], the Buddha includes him as one of eleven particularly praiseworthy disciples.{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=720}} Chinese sources add that he is also known for his [[khanti|patience]], and that he is foremost in 'practicing with discretion' ({{zh|p=mixing diyi}}), meaning practicing the Buddha's teaching consistently, dedication to the [[śila|precepts]] and study, but without seeking praise or being proud because of being the son of the Buddha.{{refn |For the aspect of dedication to the [[śila|precepts]] and to study, as well as avoiding being proud, see {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=163}}; for the aspect of seeking praise, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}.}} Pāli texts give examples of Rāhula's strictness in monastic discipline. E.g. after there was a rule established that no novice could sleep in the same room as a [[bhikkhu|fully ordained monk]], Rāhula is said to have slept in an outdoor toilet.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} When the Buddha becomes aware of this, he admonishes the monks for not taking proper care of the novices. After that, the Buddha adjusts the rule.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tipallatthamiga_jat_16.htm Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (No.16)]}}

Pāli texts state that despite Rāhula being his son, the Buddha did not particularly favor him: he is said to have loved problematic disciples such as [[Aṅgulimāla]] and [[Devadatta]] as much as his own son, without any bias.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}

Later in Rāhula's life his mother Yaśodharā becomes ordained as a [[bhikkhuni|nun]]. In one story, the nun Yaśodharā falls ill with [[flatulence]]. Rāhula helps her recover by asking his teacher Śāriputra to find sweetened mango juice for her, which is the medicine she is used to and requires. Therefore, with Rāhula's help, she eventually recovers.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/rahulamata.htm Rāhulamātā]}} and {{harvtxt |Crosby |2013 |p=112}}. Only Malalasekera mentions the mango juice and the recovery.}}

When he is 20 years old, Rāhula [[upasampada|fully ordains]] as a monk in [[Savatthi|Sāvatthī]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Baroni |2002 |p=261}} and {{harvtxt |Schumann |2004 |p=123}}. For the information that he was fully ordained in Sāvatthī, see {{harvtxt |Sarao |2013 |p=157}}.}}

Rāhula's death receives little attention in the earliest sources.{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=106}} Rāhula dies before the Buddha and his teacher Śariputra do. According to Pāli{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and Chinese{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} sources, this happens as he is travelling through the [[Tavatimsa|second Buddhist heaven]] ({{lang-sa|Trāyastriṃśa|link=no}}). According to the early ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara Āgama]]'' ([[Sarvastivada|Sārvastivāda]] or Mahāsaṅghika tradition) and the later ''Śāriputrapṛcchā'', however, Rāhula is one the four [[arhat|enlightened disciples]] whom Gautama Buddha asks to prolong their lives to stay in the world until the [[Maitreya|next Buddha Maitreya]] has risen, to protect the current Buddha's dispensation.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}}

=== Previous lives ===
Following the Pāli and Sanskrit language sources, Rāhula is the son of the [[Bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|Buddha-to-be]] throughout many lifetimes.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} He develops his habit of being amenable and easy to teach in previous lives.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=482}} Pāli texts explain that in a previous life he was impressed by the son of a previous Buddha, and vowed to be like him in a future life.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Rahula - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Rāhula on a Tibetan painting, 16th century |alt=Elderly monk in green and red robes, holding his hands in front of his chest.]]
Texts in the [[Mahayana|Mahayāna]] tradition describe that Rāhula is the eleventh of the [[16 arhats|16 Elders]] ({{lang-sa|Ṣoḍaśasthavira|italic=yes}}; Chinese tradition added two elders in the 10th century, making for 18 Elders{{sfn |Dong |2010 |p=33}}), enlightened disciples that have been entrusted with taking care of the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of Maitreya Buddha. Tradition states therefore that Rāhula is still alive, and resides with 1,100 of his pupils in an island called the 'land of chestnuts and grains' ({{zh|t=畢利颺瞿洲|p=Biliyangqu zhou}}).{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} and {{harvtxt |Meeks |2016 |pp=137{{en dash}}8}}. For the number of 18, see {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=400}}; {{harvtxt|Strong |1997 |pp=121{{en dash}}22}}. For the information that ''Biliyangqu zhou'' is an island, see {{harvtxt |Dong |2010 |p=59 n.11}}.}} The pilgrim [[Xuan Zang]] ({{circa}}602{{en dash}}664) heard a [[brahmin]] claim that he met Rāhula as an old man, who had delayed his passing into [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] and was therefore still alive.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=146}}{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=122}} On a similar note, Rāhula is considered one of the [[Ten Principal Disciples]],{{sfn |Keown |2004 |p=298}} known for his dedication to training new monks and novices.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=262}} Moreover, he is considered to be one of the 23{{en dash}}28 masters in the lineage of the [[Tiantai]] tradition, one of the 28 in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] lineage,{{refn |{{harvtxt |Welter |2004 |pp=462{{en dash}}3}} says [[Tiantai]] has only 23 patriarchs, whereas {{harvtxt |Irons |2007 |p=526}} states they later expanded to 28.}} and one of the [[eight arahants (Burma)|eight enlightened disciples]] in the Burmese tradition.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=122}}

As one of the enlightened disciples responsible for protecting the Buddha's dispensation, Rāhula has often been depicted in East Asian art. He is depicted with a large, "umbrella-shaped" head, prominent eyes and a hooked nose.{{sfn |Watters |1898 |p=340}}

The Chinese monks Xuan Zang and [[Faxian]] ({{circa}}320{{en dash}}420 CE) noted during their pilgrimages in India that a cult existed that worshiped Rāhula, especially in the [[Madhura]] area. Whereas monks would worship certain early male disciples following their particular specialization, and nuns would honor [[Ānanda]] in gratitude for helping to set up the nun's order, novices would worship Rāhula.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=135{{en dash}}6}} The two Chinese pilgrims noted that Emperor [[Ashoka|Aśoka]] built a [[stupa|monument]] in honor of Rāhula, especially meant for novices to pay their respects.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} Religious studies scholar Lori Meeks points out with regard to Japan, however, that Rāhula was not the individual object of any devotional cult, but was rather honored as part of a group of enlightened disciples, such as the 16 Elders.&lt;!--132--&gt; Exception to this was the 13th{{en dash}}14th century, when the figure of Rāhula became an important part of a revival of devotion to early Buddhist disciples among the old [[Nara prefecture|Nara]] schools,&lt;!--131--&gt; as [[kōshiki|chanted lectures]] (''kōshiki'') rites,&lt;!--137--&gt; and images&lt;!--147--&gt; were used in dedication to Rāhula. On regular [[uposatha|days of religious observance]],&lt;!--137--&gt; male&lt;!--133--&gt; and [[samaneri|female]]&lt;!--134--&gt; novices performed rites and gave lectures in honor of Rāhula. These were popular with the laypeople,&lt;!--133--&gt; as well as with priests that aimed to revive early Buddhist [[vinaya|monastic discipline]].&lt;!--134--&gt;{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=131{{en dash}}3, 147}} In the ''kōshiki'' Rāhula was praised extensively, and was described as the "Eldest Child", ''eldest'' being a devotional term, since Prince Siddhārtha had no other children.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=137, n.2}}

The ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'', as well as later East Asian texts such as the ''Raun Kōshiki'', relate that Gautama Buddha predicts Rāhula will become a [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] in a future life,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} named "Stepping on Seven Treasure Flowers" ({{lang-sa|Saptaratnapadmavikrama |link=no}}). In these texts, Rāhula was seen as a [[Bodhisattva#In_Mahāyāna_Buddhism|Mahāyāna type of Buddha-to-be]], who would save many [[sentient being (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] and live in a [[Pure Land]].{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=144}}

The exhortations the Buddha gives to Rāhula have also become part of his legacy. The ''Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta'' became one of the seven Buddhist texts recommended for study in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|inscriptions]] of the Emperor Aśoka.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/am/ambalatthika_raahulovaada_s.htm Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta]}}{{sfn |Hazzra |1995 |p=38}} This discourse has been raised by modern ethicists as evidence for [[consequentalism|consequentalist]] ethics in Buddhism, though this is disputed.{{sfn |Schlieter |2014 |p=319}}

Rāhula is mentioned as one of the founders of a system of Buddhist philosophy called the ''[[Vaibhāṣika]]'', which was part of the Sarvāstivāda schools.{{sfn |Burnouf |2010 |p=418}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=107}} He is also considered by some Thai schools of Buddhist [[Tantric Theravada|''boran'']] meditation to be the patron of their tradition, which is explained by referring to Rāhula's gradual development in meditation as opposed to the instant enlightenment of [[disciples of the Buddha|other disciples]].{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=121}}

=== Childhood in Buddhism ===
[[File:Novices_studying_Dhamma_and_Pali_language.jpg |The acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries.|thumb |alt=Teenage novices studying in class. |upright=1.2]]
From the narratives surrounding Rāhula several conclusions have been drawn with regard to Buddhist perspectives on childhood. Several scholars have raised Rāhula's example to indicate that children in Buddhism are seen as an obstacle to spiritual enlightenment,{{sfn |Thompson |Mauk |Kelly |Cook |2012 |p=61}} or that Buddhism, being a monastic religion, is not interested in children.{{sfn |Sasson |2014 |pp=594{{en dash}}5}} Education scholar Yoshiharu Nakagawa argues, however, that Rāhula's story points at two ideals of childhood which exist parallel in Buddhism: that of the common child, subject to the [[human condition]], and that of the child with a potential for enlightenment, who Crosby describes as a heroic disciple.{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=41}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=119, 121}} Religion scholar Vanessa Sasson notes that although Prince Siddhārtha initially abandons his son, he comes back for him and offers a spiritual heritage to him as opposed to a material one. This heritage is given from a viewpoint of trust in the potential of the child Rāhula, presuming that the Buddhist path can also be accessed by children.{{sfn |Sasson |2014 |p=595}}

The acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries.{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}} The numerous teachings given to Rāhula have left behind teaching material which could be used for teaching children of different ages,&lt;!--117--&gt; and were sophisticated for the time period.&lt;!--118--&gt; [[Theravada|Theravāda]] tradition further built on this genre, with Pāli manuals of religious teaching for novices.&lt;!--117--&gt;{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |pp=117{{en dash}}8}}

'''Scalping''' is the act of cutting or tearing a part of the human [[scalp]], with hair attached, from the head.

This can either occur as part of war with the scalp being a [[Human trophy collecting|trophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Anastasia M. (2008). [[Georg Friederici]]'s (1906) "Scalping and Similar Warfare Customs in America" with a Critical Introduction. ProQuest. {{ISBN|9780549562092}} p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; or as an accident. Scalp-taking is considered part of the broader cultural practice of the taking and display of human body parts as trophies, and may have developed as an alternative to the taking of human heads, for scalps were easier to take, transport, and preserve for subsequent display. Scalping independently developed in various cultures in both the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Trophy Taking in Eastern North America During the Archaic Period: The Relationship to Warfare and Social Complexity|author1=Mensforth, Robert P. |work=The Taking and Displaying of Human Body Parts as Trophies by Amerindians|author2=Chacon, Richard J.

== Asia, Africa, and Europe ==

In England in 1036,  [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Earl Godwin]], father of [[Harold Godwinson]], was reportedly responsible for scalping his enemies. According to the ancient [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Abingdon manuscript]], 'some of them were blinded, some maimed, some scalped. No more horrible deed was done in this country since the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] came and made peace here'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://classesv2.yale.edu/access/content/user/haw6/Vikings/AS%20Chronicle%20Abingdon%20MS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820140611/https://classesv2.yale.edu/access/content/user/haw6/Vikings/AS%20Chronicle%20Abingdon%20MS.html |archivedate=2017-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Frederici noted that “[[Herodotus]] provided the only clear and satisfactory portrayal of a scalping people in the old world” in his description of the [[Scythians]], a nomadic people then located to the north and west of the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Griffin, Anastasia M. (editor) |title=Critical Introduction|date=2008| author2=Frederici, Georg |work=Scalping and Similar Warfare Customs in America |publisher= ProQuest|isbn=9780549562092|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus related that Scythian warriors would behead the enemies they defeated in battle and present the heads to their king to claim their share of the plunder. Then, the warrior would skin the head “by making a circular cut round the ears and shaking out the skull; he then scrapes the flesh off the skin with the rib of an ox, and when it is clean works it with his fingers until it is supple, and fit to be used as a sort of handkerchief. He hangs these handkerchiefs on the bridle of his horse, and is very proud of them. The best man is the man who has the greatest number.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herodotus|title= The Histories|author2= De Selincourt, Aubrey (translator)|publisher= Penguin Books|location= London|date= 2003|pages= 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] noted the taking of scalps by the [[Alani]], a people of Asiatic [[Scythia]], in terms quite similar to those used by Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcellinus, Ammianus |title= Roman History, Book XXXI, II|location= London|publisher= Bohn|date= 1862|page= 22|author2=Yonge, C.D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbé [[Emmanuel H. D. Domenech]] referenced the ''decalvare'' of the ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] and the ''capillos et cutem detrahere'' of the code of the [[Visigoths]] as examples of scalping in early [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Domenech, Abbe Emmanuel |title= Seven Years’ Residence in the Great Deserts of North America, Vol. 2|location= London|publisher= Longman Green|date= 1860|page= 358}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some more recent interpretations of these terms relate them to shaving off the hair of the head as a legal punishment rather than scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crouch, Jace |title=The Judicial Punishment of Delcavatio in Visigothic Spain: A Proposed Solution based on Isidore of Seville and the Lex Visigothorum|pages=  1–5}} and Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, mercenary John Duncan observed what he estimated to be 700 scalps taken in warfare and displayed as trophies by a contingent of female soldiers  — [[Dahomey Amazons]] — employed by the King of Dahomey (present-day [[Republic of Benin]]). Duncan noted that these would have been taken and kept over a long period of time and would not have come from a single battle. Although Duncan travelled widely in Dahomey, and described customs such as the taking of heads and the retention of skulls as trophies, nowhere else does he mention scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels in Western Africa in 1845 &amp; 1846, Comprising a Journey from Whydah, through the Kingdom of Dahomey, to Adofoodia, in the Interior, Vol. I|author=Duncan, John |location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley|date= 1847|pages= 233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels in Western Africa in 1845 &amp; 1846, Comprising a Journey from Whydah, through the Kingdom of Dahomey, to Adofoodia, in the Interior, Vol. II|author=Duncan, John |location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley|date= 1847|pages= 274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques===
Specific scalping techniques varied somewhat from place to place, depending on the cultural patterns of the scalper regarding the desired shape, size, and intended use of the severed scalp, and on how the victims wore their hair, but the general process of scalping was quite uniform.  The scalper firmly grasped the hair of a subdued adversary, made several quick semicircular cuts with a sharp instrument on either side of the area to be taken, and then vigorously yanked at the nearly-severed scalp. The scalp separated from the skull along the plane of the [[Loose_connective_tissue#Areolar_tissue|areolar connective tissue]], the fourth (and least substantial) of the five layers of the human scalp. Scalping was not in itself fatal, though it was most commonly inflicted on the gravely wounded or the dead. The earliest instruments used in scalping were stone knives crafted of [[flint]], [[chert]], or [[obsidian]], or other materials like [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] or [[oyster]] shells that could be worked to carry an edge equal to the task. Collectively, such tools were also used for a variety of everyday tasks like skinning and processing game, but were replaced by metal knives acquired in trade through European contact. The implement, often referred to as a “scalping knife” in popular [[American literature|American]] and European literature, was not known as such by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], a knife being for them just a simple and effective multi-purpose utility tool for which scalping was but one of many uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton, Richard F. |title=Anthropological Review, Vol. 2, No. 4 |date=February 1864|pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Griffin, Anastasia M.

===Intertribal warfare===
[[File:Sauvages Tchaktas matachez en Guerriers qui portent des Chevelures.jpg|thumb|Choctaw American Indians, in warpaint, bearing scalps, Alexandre de Batz, 1732]]
Author and historian Mark van de Logt wrote, "Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of 'total war{{'"}}, in which civilians are targeted, "for conflicts between modern industrial nations," the term "closely approaches the state of affairs between the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]], the [[Great Sioux Nation|Sioux]], and the [[Cheyennes]]. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy's territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=van de Logt |year=2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bbgh_hA4ib4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=War Party in Blue: Pawnee Scouts in the U.S. Army |publisher= [[University of Oklahoma Press]] | page=35 |isbn=0806184396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tribes of Native Americans practiced scalping, in some instances up until the end of the 19th century. Of the approximately 500 bodies at the [[Crow Creek massacre]] site, 90 percent of the skulls show evidence of scalping. The event took place ''circa'' 1325 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Bounties for indigenous captives or their scalps appeared in the legislation of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] during the [[Susquehannock]] War (1675–77).&lt;ref&gt;Grenier. 2005. p.39&lt;/ref&gt; [[New England]] offered bounties to white settlers and [[Narragansett people]] in 1675 during [[King Philip's War]].&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt; By 1692, [[New France]] also paid their native allies for scalps of their enemies.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt; In 1697, on the northern frontier of Massachusetts colony, settler [[Hannah Dustin]] killed ten of her [[Abenaki]] captors during her nighttime escape, presented their ten scalps to the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts General Assembly]], and was rewarded with bounties for two men, two women, and six children.&lt;ref name="Dunbar"/&gt; There were six colonial wars with New England and the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] fighting New France and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] over a 75-year period, starting with [[King William's War]] in 1688.

=== American Revolution ===
In the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], the Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at [[Fort Detroit]], was known by [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Patriots]] as the "hair-buyer general" because they believed he encouraged and paid his Native American allies to scalp American settlers. When Hamilton was captured in the war by the colonists, he was treated as a [[war criminal]] instead of a [[prisoner of war]] because of this. However, American historians have conceded that there was no positive proof that he had ever offered rewards for scalps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Arthur |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hamilton_henry_4E.html |title=Hamilton, Henry |volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now assumed that during the American Revolution, no British officer paid for scalps.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Sullivan Expedition]], the September 13, 1779 journal entry of Lieutenant William Barton tells of patriots participating in scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924095654384#page/n38/mode/1up/ |title=Journals of the military expedition of Major General John Sullivan against the Six nations of Indians in 1779; with records of centennial celebrations; prepared pursuant to chapter 361, laws of the state of New York, of 1885 |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322181618/http://archive.org/stream/cu31924095654384#page/n38/mode/1up/ |archivedate=2016-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
In 1835, the government of the Mexican state of [[Sonora]] put a bounty on the [[Apache]] which,&lt;ref name="haley"/&gt; over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each scalp of a male 14 or more years old {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. In 1837, the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] also offered a bounty on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child.&lt;ref name="haley"&gt;{{cite book |first=James L. |last=Haley |authorlink=James L.

===Civil War===
Some scalping incidents even occurred during the [[American Civil War]].  For example, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War|guerrillas]] led by [[William T.

===Continued Indian Wars===

In 1851, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] displayed Indian scalps in [[Stanislaus County, California]]. In [[Tehama County, California]], U.S. military and local volunteers razed villages and scalped hundreds of men, women, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfaelzer|first1=Jean|title=Driven Out: The Forgotten War against Chinese Americans|date=2007|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=July 2018}}

Scalping also occurred during the [[Sand Creek Massacre]] on November 29, 1864, during the [[American Indian Wars]], when a 700-man force of U.S. Army volunteers destroyed the village of [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] in southeastern [[Colorado Territory]], killing and mutilating&lt;ref name="A Century of Dishonor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Helen|title=A Century of Dishonor|date=1994|publisher=Indian Head Books|location=United States|isbn=1-56619-167-X|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoig_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoig|first=Stan|title=The Sand Creek Massacre|year=2005|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|page=153|isbn=978-0-8061-1147-6|origyear=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; an estimated 70–163 Native Americans.&lt;ref name=Dee_book&gt;{{cite book| last = Brown| first = Dee| title = Bury my heart at Wounded Knee| origyear  = 1970| publisher = Macmillan| chapter = War Comes to the Cheyenne| pages = 86–87| isbn = 978-0-8050-6634-0| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/four/whois.htm |title=THE WEST - Who is the Savage? |website=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726000602/http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/four/whois.htm |archivedate=2016-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Evans Study Report|url=https://portfolio.du.edu/downloadItem/286858|publisher=University of Denver|accessdate=6 January 2016|date=November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207203926/https://portfolio.du.edu/downloadItem/286858|archivedate=7 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1867 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article reported that "settlers in a small town in Colorado Territory had recently subscribed $5,000 to a fund ‘for the purpose of buying Indian scalps (with $25 each to be paid for scalps with the ears on)’ and that the market for Indian scalps ‘is not affected by age or sex’." The article noted this behavior was "sanctioned" by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and was modeled on patterns the U.S. had begun a century earlier in the "American East".&lt;ref name="Kakel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kakel|first1=Carroll P.|title=The American West and the Nazi East, A Comparative and Interpretive Perspective|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206}}

From one writer's point of view, it was a "uniquely American" innovation that the use of scalp bounties in the wars against indigenous societies "became an indiscriminate killing process that deliberately targeted Indian non-combatants (including women, children, and infants), as well as warriors."&lt;ref name="Kakel"/&gt;{{rp|204}}

[[File:Mano cornuta by-RaBoe001.jpg|thumb|upright|A demonstration of the sign of the horns.]]

The '''sign of the horns''' (also known as '''metal horns''', '''devil horns''', '''rock horns''', and other names) is  a gesture often used when listening to heavy metal.

==Spiritual and superstitious meaning==

In [[Hinduism]], the hand gesture is known as the "[[List of mudras (yoga)#Hasta (hand mudras)|Apana yogic mudra]]."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajinikanth-politics-party-symbol-apana-mudra-detoxification-purification-5007863/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indian classical dance]] forms, the hand gesture symbolises the [[Asiatic lion#In mythology, religion, culture and art|Lion]].&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; In [[Buddhism]], it is seen as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] gesture very commonly used by [[Gautama Buddha]] as "Karana Mudra" which is synonymous with [[Exorcism#Buddhism|expulsion of demons]] and removal of obstacles like sickness or negative thoughts.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;

The [[apotropaic]] usage of the sign can also be seen in [[Italy]] and in other [[Mediterranean]] cultures where, when confronted with unfortunate events, or simply when these events are mentioned, the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck. It is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the "[[evil eye]]" (''malocchio'' in Italian). In Italy specifically, the gesture is known as the ''corna''. With fingers pointing down, it is a common Mediterranean apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (it is thus a more Mediterranean equivalent of [[knocking on wood]]). Thus, for example, the [[President of the Italian Republic]], [[Giovanni Leone]], shocked the country when, while in [[Naples]] during an [[outbreak]] of [[cholera]], he shook the hands of [[patient]]s with one hand while with the other behind his back he superstitiously made the ''corna'', presumably to ward off the disease or in reaction to being confronted by such misfortune. This act was well documented by the [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment.

In Italy and other parts of the [[Mediterranean region]], the gesture must usually be performed with the fingers tilting downward to signify the warding off of bad luck; in the same region and elsewhere, the gesture may take a different, offensive and insulting meaning if it is performed with fingers upward or if directed aggressively towards someone in a swiveling motion (see section below). In Italy, one can also "touch iron" (''tocca ferro'') or touch one's nose to ward off bad luck. Males in Italy may also grab their [[testicle]]s when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.

In [[Peru]], one says ''contra'' (against). In the [[Dominican Republic]], the expression is ''zafa'', said against curses known as ''fukú''. All of these gestures are meant to conjure supernatural protection.

The sign of the horns is used during religious rituals in Wicca, to invoke or represent the [[Horned God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner'' by Scott Cunningham, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offensive gesture==
In many [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] and Latin countries, such as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/8788932/Rude-hand-gestures-of-the-world.html?image=5 |title=Rude hand gestures of the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |title=International field guide to rude hand gestures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214213945/http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hand-gestures-in-different-cultures.html |title=Hand Gestures in Different Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHS39OG4GG4C |title=Rude Hand Gestures of the World: A Guide to Offending without Words By Romana Lefevre |isbn=9781452110172 |author1=Lefevre |first1=Romana |date=2011-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when directed towards someone and swiveled back and forth, the sign implies [[cuckold]]ry; the common words for ''cuckolded'' in Italian, Greek and Spanish are {{lang|it|cornuto}}, {{lang|el|κερατάς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|keratas}}) and {{lang|es|cornudo}}, respectively, literally meaning "horned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reading-body-language.co.uk/gestures2.html |title=Hand Gestures Part Two — The Cuckold Gesture |publisher=Reading-Body-Language.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[European Union]] meeting in February 2002, then-current Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] was photographed performing this gesture behind the back of the Spanish foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874139,00.html|title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes|date=8 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northwestern European and North American popular culture==

===Contemporary use by musicians and fans===

[[Marlon Brando]] makes the sign whilst singing "[[Luck Be a Lady]]" in the film ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), seeming to indicate it was a sign for snake eyes in the craps game he is playing for the gamblers' souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marlon Brando-Luck Be a Lady|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-JzdRJCcsg|website=youtube.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the cover of [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]'' album (1969), the cartoon of [[John Lennon]]'s right hand is making the sign above [[Paul McCartney]]'s head. Some fans interpreted this as one of the many supposed "[[Paul is dead]]" clues. Some may think it is possible that the cartoonist misrepresented the [[ILY sign|sign for "I love you"]], which is very similar and more in keeping with the band's public message and image. However, the 1969 cartoon is based on many photos of John Lennon making the hand sign in 1967. One of these photos of Lennon doing the hand sign appears on the cover of a Beatles single release shortly after, making it the first time the hand sign appears on a rock release.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The back cover of the album ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls]]'' (1969) by Chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]] pictured band members giving the "sign of the horns". Starting in early 1968, Coven concerts always began and ended with singer [[Jinx Dawson]] giving the sign on stage.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The sign is also used in various Disney movies. It can be seen in the medieval-style opening sequence of the British-American Disney movie ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971) as a goat-legged figure with a jester's cap, leading a procession of outlandish-looking figures, flashes the sign.

Beginning in the early 1970s, the horns were known as the "P-Funk sign" to fans of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]. It was used by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Bootsy Collins]] as the password to the Mothership,&lt;ref name=appleford&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=1216&amp;IssueNum=66 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122030548/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=1216&amp;IssueNum=66 |archivedate=November 22, 2007 |title=Odyssey of the Devil Horns |first=Steve |last=Appleford |publisher=Los Angeles City Beat |date=September 9, 2004 |quote=A friend arranges a meeting with Clinton. I hand him a photograph of Dio making the hand signal, and tell him this is the man (or one of them) credited with bringing it to rock. Clinton stares at the picture for a long, silent minute, breathing heavily. Another minute passes. He's never heard of Ronnie James Dio. It's the P-Funk sign, man.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a central element in Parliament's science-fiction [[P-Funk mythology|mythology]], and fans used it in return to show their enthusiasm for the band. Collins is depicted showing the P-Funk sign on the cover of his 1977 album ''[[Ahh... The Name Is Bootsy, Baby!]]''

In 1977, a painting&lt;!-- animated painting??? --&gt; of [[Gene Simmons]] (of the band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]) exhibits the sign on the cover of ''[[Love Gun]]'', the band's sixth studio album. Simmons still utilizes the sign, both on and off stage.

[[Frank Zappa]] can be seen jokingly making the gesture in the film ''[[Baby Snakes]]'' (1979) in response to the audience, commenting, "That's right, spindle twice."

For the Indian movie ''[[Rock On 2]]'' (2016), the sign of the horns is used to represent "2".

===Heavy metal culture===
[[File:Dio throwing Horns.jpg|thumb|Vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] making the sign at a [[Heaven &amp; Hell (band)|Heaven and Hell]] concert in 2007. The gesture is quite common within [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] culture.]]

[[Ronnie James Dio]] was known for popularizing the sign of the horns in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref name="appleford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/columns/junkyard/the_devils_horns_a_rock_and_roll_symbol.html |title=The Devil's Horns: A Rock And Roll Symbol |publisher=Ultimate-Guitar.com |date=September 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed his Italian grandmother used it to ward off the [[evil eye]] (which is known in Southern Italy as ''[[Evil eye|malocchio]]''). Dio began using the sign soon after joining the metal band [[Black Sabbath]] in 1979. The previous singer in the band, [[Ozzy Osbourne]], was rather well known for using the [[V Sign|"peace"]] sign at concerts, raising the index and middle finger in the form of a V. Dio, in an attempt to connect with the fans, wanted to similarly use a hand gesture. However, not wanting to copy Osbourne, he chose to use the sign his grandmother always made.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie James Dio interview in the 2005 documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]''. In the interview he also ridicules Gene Simmons for taking credit for originating use of the sign in heavy metal, attributing the claim to Simmons' well-known egotism.&lt;/ref&gt; The horns became famous in metal concerts very soon after Black Sabbath's first tour with Dio. The sign would later be appropriated by heavy metal fans under the name "maloik", a corruption of the original ''malocchio''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Geezer Butler|Terry "Geezer" Butler]] of Black Sabbath can be seen "raising the horns" in a photograph taken in 1971. The photograph is included in the CD booklet of the ''[[Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970–1978]]'' compilation album. This would indicate that there had been some association between the "horns" and heavy metal before Dio's popularization of it.

When asked if he was the one who introduced the hand gesture to metal subculture, Dio said in a 2001 interview with Metal-Rules.com:

{{quote|I doubt very much if I would be the first one who ever did that. That's like saying I invented the wheel, I'm sure someone did that at some other point. I think you'd have to say that I made it fashionable. I used it so much and all the time and it had become my trademark until the [[Britney Spears]] audience decided to do it as well. So it kind of lost its meaning with that. But it was.... I was in Sabbath at the time. It was a symbol that I thought was reflective of what that band was supposed to be all about. It's NOT the devil's sign like we're here with the devil. It's an Italian thing I got from my Grandmother called the "Malocchio". It's to ward off the Evil Eye or to give the Evil Eye, depending on which way you do it. It's just a symbol but it had magical incantations and attitudes to it and I felt it worked very well with Sabbath. So I became very noted for it and then everybody else started to pick up on it and away it went. But I would never say I take credit for being the first to do it. I say because I did it so much that it became the symbol of rock and roll of some kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=666 |title=Dio - Interviewed By EvilG |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=March 9, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Gene Simmons]] of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] attempted to claim the similar-looking but unrelated variation, the [[ILY sign]] (thumb extended rather than thumb toward the palm) hand gesture for his own.  According to CBS News, "Simmons filed an application on Friday, June 16, 2017 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a trademark on the hand gesture he regularly uses during concerts and public appearances - thumb, index and pinky fingers extended, with the middle and ring fingers folded down. According to Simmons, this hand gesture was first used in commerce — by him — on Nov. 14, 1974. He is claiming the hand gesture should be trademarked for "entertainment, namely live performances by a musical artist [and] personal appearances by a musical artist." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gene-simmons-trademark-devil-horns-hand-gesture/|title=Gene Simmons wants to trademark "devil horns" hand gesture|publisher=CBS News|date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neopaganism===
In [[Wicca]], the sign of the horns is used to represent the Horned God.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Electronic communication===

In text-based electronic communication, the sign of the horns is represented with the &lt;code&gt;\../&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\m/&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;lml&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;|m|&lt;/code&gt; emoticon and sometimes with &lt;code&gt;/../&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[Unicode]] character U+1F918 🤘 SIGN OF THE HORNS was introduced in Unicode 8.0 as an [[emoji]], on June 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/|title=Unicode 8.0.0|website=unicode.org|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/burrito-sign-of-the-horns-and-35-other-emoji-approved-in-unicode-8-0/|title="Burrito," "Sign Of The Horns," and 35 other emoji approved in Unicode 8.0|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports culture===
[[File:hookemhorns.jpg|thumbnail|A fan displays the Hook 'em Horns during a Texas football game versus Arkansas.]]

[[Hook 'em Horns]] is the slogan and hand signal of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Students and alumni of the university employ a greeting consisting of the phrase "Hook 'em" or "Hook 'em Horns" and also use the phrase as a parting good-bye or as the closing line in a letter or story.  The [[gesture]] is meant to approximate the shape of the head and horns of the [[University of Texas at Austin|UT]] mascot, the [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] [[Bevo (mascot)|Bevo]].

Fans of the [[University of South Florida]] Bulls use the same hand sign at their athletic events, except that the hand is turned around and facing the other way.  With the middle and ring finger extending towards the person presenting the "Go Bulls" sign.

Fans of [[North Dakota State University]] Bison athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as "Go Bison!"  The pinky and index fingers are usually slightly bent, however, to mimic the shape of a [[bison]]'s horns.

Fans of [[North Carolina State University]] Wolfpack athletics use a similar gesture with the middle and ring fingers moving up and down over the thumb to mimic a wolf's jaw.

Fans of  [[University of California, Irvine]] Anteaters use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the head of the mighty anteater.

Fans of [[University of Nevada, Reno]] [[Nevada Wolf Pack|Wolf Pack]] athletics use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the wolf's snout.

Fans of [[University of Utah]] athletics, particularly football and gymnastics, use a gesture where the index and pinky finger are straight and parallel to each other, forming a block "U."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.utah.edu/muss/membership/ |title=MUSS - Student Cheer Section for the U of U Utes - University of Utah Alumni Association &amp;#124; MUSS |publisher=Alumni.utah.edu |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of [[Northwestern State University]] Demon athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as "Fork 'em!"  The pinky and index fingers are extended but a little more parallel to each other resembling the horns on a demon.

[[Arizona State University]] [[Arizona State Sun Devils|Sun Devils]] fans make a pitchfork sign by extending the index and middle fingers, as well as the pinky. The thumb holds down the ring finger to complete the gesture. The same gesture is used by fans of the [[Wichita State University|Wichita State]] [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]], which in this context represents a stylized "W".

Fans of the [[Grand Canyon University]] Antelopes use this hand gesture with a slight variation by touching the tips of the ring and middle finger with the thumb to form the shape of an antelope and its horns. Often followed by the phrase "Lopes up".

Fans of the [[Universidad de Chile]] soccer team use this gesture to represent their support for the team by forming a U-shaped hand gesture, often followed by the phrase "Grande la U".

Retired professional wrestler [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] often used the Corna gesture during the later phase of his career, wherein he would raise both his hands in the very same gesture, which would result in his [[Pyrotechnics|pyro]] going off.

'''Slaven Tolj''' (born in 1964), a [[multimedia artist]] from [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]. He achieved international recognition for his [[installation art|installations]], [[body art]], and [[performances]] presenting distinct [[political]] and social-cultural [[criticism]]. 

The beginning of Slaven Tolj’s work, as an artist, was determined by his experiences of the [[Yugoslav War]], the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]] by the Yugoslavian army in the years 1991-1992, as well as the disintegration of [[former Yugoslavia]].
In the course of the late 1990s Slaven Tolj gradually extended the scope of his art, incorporating themes and issues related to political transformation and the emergence of [[multiculturalism]] and [[globalization]].

Slaven Tolj has also been involved in organisational and curatorial activities. He is one of the founders of [[Art Workshop Lazareti]] in Dubrovnik – a key institution for contemporary art scene in Dubrovnik and Croatia.   

In 2005 he was the commissioner of the Croatian pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artnews.org/news.php?i=3595&amp;t=news artnews.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemistry]] is often called '''the central science''' because of its role in connecting the [[physical science]]s,&lt;ref&gt;John M. Malin “International Year of Chemistry - 2011 Chemistry – our life, our future” {{cite web |url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/CNBP_022050/pdf/CNBP_022050.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323220047/http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/CNBP_022050/pdf/CNBP_022050.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; which include chemistry, with the [[biology|life sciences]] and [[applied science]]s such as [[medicine]] and [[engineering]].  The nature of this relationship is one of the main topics in the [[philosophy of chemistry]] and in [[scientometrics]]. The phrase was popularized by its use in a textbook by [[Theodore L. Brown]] and H. Eugene LeMay, titled ''Chemistry: The Central Science'', which was first published in 1977, with a thirteenth edition published in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore L. Brown and H. Eugene LeMay ''Chemistry: The Central Science''. Prentice Hall, 1977. {{ISBN|0-13-128769-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central role of chemistry can be seen in the systematic and hierarchical classification of the sciences by [[Auguste Comte]] in which each discipline provides a more general framework for the area it precedes (mathematics → astronomy → physics → chemistry → physiology and medicine → social sciences).&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Reinhardt. ''Chemical Sciences in the 20th Century: Bridging Boundaries''. Wiley-VCH, 2001. {{ISBN|3-527-30271-9}}. Pages 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Balaban and Klein have more recently proposed a diagram showing partial ordering of sciences in which chemistry may be argued is “the central science” since it provides a significant degree of branching.&lt;ref&gt;”Is chemistry ‘The Central Science’? How are different sciences related? Co-citations, reductionism, emergence, and posets” Alexandru T. Balaban, Douglas J. Klein ''Scientometrics'' '''2006''', ''69'', 615-637. {{doi|10.1007/s11192-006-0173-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In forming these connections the lower field [[Irreducible (philosophy)|cannot be fully reduced]] to the higher ones.  It is recognized that the lower fields possess [[Emergence|emergent]] ideas and concepts that do not exist in the higher fields of science.

Thus chemistry is built on an understanding of laws of physics that govern particles such as [[atoms]], [[protons]], [[neutrons]], [[electrons]], [[thermodynamics]], etc. although it has been shown that it has not been “fully 'reduced' to [[quantum mechanics]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Scerri “Philosophy of Chemistry” Chemistry International, Vol. 25 No. 3 [http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2003/2503/2_philosophy.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Scerri ''The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance''. Oxford University Press, '''2006'''. {{ISBN|0-19-530573-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts such as the [[Periodic table|periodicity]] of the elements and [[chemical bond]]s in chemistry are emergent in that they are more than the underlying forces that are defined by [[physics]].

In the same way, biology cannot be fully reduced to chemistry despite the fact that the machinery that is responsible for life is composed of [[molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R Livesay “At the crossroads of biomacromolecular research: highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the field” Chemistry Central Journal 2007, 1:4 {{DOI|10.1186/1752-153X-1-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the machinery of [[evolution]] may be described in terms of chemistry by the understanding that it is a [[mutation]] in the order of [[genetics|genetic]] [[base pair]]s in the [[DNA]] of an organism.  However, chemistry cannot fully describe the process since it does not contain concepts such as [[natural selection]] that are responsible for driving evolution.  Chemistry is fundamental to biology since it provides a methodology for studying and understanding the molecules that compose cells.

Connections made by chemistry are formed through various sub-disciplines that utilize concepts from multiple scientific disciplines.  Chemistry and physics are both needed in the areas of [[physical chemistry]], [[nuclear chemistry]], and [[theoretical chemistry]].  Chemistry and biology intersect in the areas of [[biochemistry]], [[medicinal chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[chemical biology]], [[molecular genetics]], and [[immunochemistry]]. Chemistry and the earth sciences intersect in areas like [[geochemistry]] and [[hydrology]].

In [[set theory]], a '''universal set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] which contains all objects, including itself.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 1995 p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[set theory]] as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a [[paradox]] ([[Russell's paradox]]) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.

== Notation ==
There is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include '''V''', '''U''' and '''[[xi (letter)|ξ]]'''.

==Reasons for nonexistence==
[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the [[cumulative hierarchy]], do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the [[axiom of regularity]], and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.

===Russell's paradox===
{{Main|Russell's paradox}}
Russell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and other set theories that include [[Zermelo]]'s [[axiom of comprehension]].
This axiom states that, for any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and any set {{mvar|A}}, there exists another set 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in A \mid \varphi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
that contains exactly those elements {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|A}} that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  If a universal set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then
there would also exist another set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in V\mid x\not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as [[Bertrand Russell]] observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.

===Cantor's theorem===
{{Main|Cantor's theorem}}
A second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the [[power set]] of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist.  However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself.

==Theories of universality==
The difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.

===Restricted comprehension===
There are set theories known to be [[consistent]] (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set {{mvar|V}} does exist (and &lt;math&gt;V \in V&lt;/math&gt; is true). In these theories, Zermelo's [[axiom of comprehension]] does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of [[naive set theory]] is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a [[non-well-founded set theory]].
The most widely studied set theory with a universal set is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s [[New Foundations]]. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[:de:Arnold Oberschelp|Arnold Oberschelp]] also published work on such set theories.  Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,&lt;ref&gt;Church 1974 p. 308. See also Forster 1995 p. 136 or 2001 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flash Sheridan |date=2016 |title=A Variant of Church’s Set Theory with a Universal Set in which the Singleton Function is a Set |url=http://www.logic-center.be/Publications/Bibliotheque/SheridanVariantChurch.pdf |journal=Logique et Analyse |volume=59 |issue=233 |at=§0.2 |doi=10.2143/LEA.233.0.3149532|lay-url=http://www-logic.stanford.edu/seminar/1314/Sheridan_Fixing_Freges_Set_Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not possible for Oberschelp's, since in it the singleton function is provably a set,&lt;ref&gt;Oberschelp 1973 p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; which leads immediately to paradox in New Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1998 p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent advances in this area have been made by [[Randall Holmes]] who published an online draft version of the book ''[[Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/ |title=Overview of Randall Holmes's Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[positive set theory]], where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the [[positive formula]]s (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.

===Universal objects that are not sets===
{{main|Universe (mathematics)}}
The idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see [[universal quantifier]]).  One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe {{mvar|V}} and similar large collections as [[Class (set theory)|proper classes]] rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a [[universal class (set theory)|universal class]] is that the universal class does not contain itself, because [[proper class]]es cannot be elements of other classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.

The [[category of sets]] can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. 
Again, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.

'''Verity''' (''alias'' Veretie, Verety, Verita, Veritie, etc.) is a female first name and a surname. As a first name it derives from the Latin feminine noun ''veritas'', meaning "[[truth]]". It is thus an equivalent of [[Alethea]], a female first name first used in England ''circa'' 1585, derived from the ancient and modern Greek feminine noun ''αλήθεια'' (pronounced "al-'''ee'''-thia"), meaning "truth". It was adopted in England as a [[Puritan]] [[virtue name]], truthfulness being considered as a desirable attribute especially in a female. Verity was one of the most popular first names given to girls in Australia.{{when|date=October 2014}} It is especially associated with parts of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Northern England]]. Verity is also a surname, which may have more ancient unrelated origins, possibly being a corruption of a similar word.&lt;ref&gt;Surnames had been adopted by families in England centuries before the Puritan era&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people with the name include:
