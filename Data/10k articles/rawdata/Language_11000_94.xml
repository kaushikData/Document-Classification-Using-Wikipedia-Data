[[File:NoaN 5332816097 e366203f38 o.jpg|thumb|[[Rómulo Sebastián Naón|Rómulo S. Naón]] of Argentina and [[Robert F. Rose]] in [[Niagara Falls]] in 1914]]
[[File:ABC countries.svg|thumb|Argentina, Brazil and Chile in green colours.]]
'''ABC countries''', or '''ABC powers''', refers to the [[South America]]n countries of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]], which are seen as the three most powerful, most influential and wealthiest countries in South America. The term was mostly used in the first half of the 20th century, when they worked together to develop common interests and a coordinated approach to issues in the region with relatively little influence from outside powers, in contrast with the [[Cold War]] governments.

==History==
During the early 20th century Argentina, Brazil, and Chile engaged in [[South American dreadnought race|naval arms race]], beginning with Brazil purchasing three [[dreadnought]]s in response to the recently-concluded [[Argentine-Chilean naval arms race]].

The [[Niagara Falls peace conference]] is the first well-known use of the term "ABC". On May 20, 1914, the three countries met in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], to mediate between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] after increasing tensions over the  [[Tampico Affair]], the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]], and developing issues that led to the [[Mexican Revolution]]. At the conference, the United States was represented by [[Frederick William Lehmann]], a former [[United States Solicitor General]], and [[Joseph Rucker Lamar]], an [[Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Small, Michael, ''The Forgotten Peace: Mediation at Niagara Falls'', University of Ottawa Press 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7766-0712-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 1915, the ABC countries met again to sign a more formal treaty, designed to develop  [[cooperation]], [[nonaggression pact|nonaggression]] and the [[arbitration]] of disputes.  It was formulated to resist [[Monroe Doctrine|United States' influence in the region]] and to establish mechanisms for consultation among the three signatory countries, such as setting up a permanent mediation commission. The official name was the Consultation, Non-Aggression and Arbitration Pact.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Although the treaty was not official until it was ratified by Brazil, much of the foreign policy of the three signatories between 1915 and 1930 followed the basis of consultations and mutual initiative which the ABC Pact envisaged.  To this end, the press used the name "ABC Pact" when the signatory countries co-operated to pursue integration initiatives in South America, concluded official agreements or actions regarding [[foreign policy]], or promoted ideologically and politically similar organizations within the region.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1942 the ABC countries, with the [[United States]], mediated in the peace terms of the [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War]]. This led to the loss of all disputed territory in the [[Amazon Basin]] that was claimed by Ecuador before the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/748507_751319972_783194524.pdf informaworld.com] PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ache 阿车''' is a [[Loloish languages|Loloish]] language spoken by the [[Yi people]] of south-central [[Yunnan]], China. ''Ethnologue'' lists ''Azhe'' as an alternate name.

==Demographics==
Ache is spoken in [[Shuangbai County]] (pop. 23,000), [[Yimen County]] (pop. 11,100),&lt;ref name="AsiaHarvest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiaharvest.org/index.php/people-group-profiles/china/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801062653/http://asiaharvest.org/index.php/people-group-profiles/china/ |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eshan County]], and [[Lufeng County]]. Yunnan (1955) reports that their autonym in [[Xinping County]] is ''nei33 su33 pʰɯ21''.&lt;ref name="Yunnan1955"&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-97281176367.html 云南民族识别参考资料] (1955), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
''Ethnologue'' classifies Ache as a [[Southeastern Loloish languages|Southeastern Loloish]] language, and lists 35,000 speakers as of 2003. Ache has not been analyzed in classifications of Southeastern Loloish by Pelkey (2011) and Lama (2012), and hence remains unclassified within the Southeastern Loloish branch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">'''Aulus Cremutius Cordus''' (died 25 AD) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[history|historian]]. There are very few remaining fragments of his work, principally covering the [[Roman civil wars|civil war]] and the reign of [[Augustus Caesar]].  In 25 AD he was forced by [[Sejanus]], who was [[praetorian prefect]] under [[Tiberius]], to take his life after being accused of ''[[Law of majestas|maiestas (treason)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bellemore, Jane. "The Dating of Seneca's Ad Marciam De Consolatione". ''The Classical Quarterly'' 42, no.1 (1992): 219-234.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been accused by [[Satrius Secundus]] of having eulogized [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and spoken of [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] as the [[last of the Romans]], which was considered an offence under the ''[[law of majestas|lex majestatis]],'' and the [[Roman Senate|senate]] ordered the burning of his writings. [[Seneca the Younger]], however, tells us that he most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him, because Sejanus had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source—a letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia—that he starved himself to death. She was also instrumental in saving his work, so that it could be published again under [[Caligula]]. Apart from Seneca, he is mentioned by [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], [[Quintilian]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] and [[Dio Cassius]]. Even though Cordus committed suicide, his work survived, prompting [[Tacitus]] to deride "the stupidity of people who believe that today's authority can destroy tomorrow's memories."&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus. ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', translated by Michael Grant, p. 170. London: Harmondsworth, 1964; cited in Hessayon, Ariel. "Incendiary texts: book burning in England, c.1640 – c.1660". ''Cromohs'', 12 (2007): 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial of the historian Cremutius Cordus took place under the reign of Tiberius in 25 AD. The charge was, according to Tacitus, "a new charge for the first time heard" (''novo ac tunc primum audito crimine''). According to Mary R. McHugh, no one had been charged with ''maiestas'' (treason) for writing a history (''editis annalibus'').&lt;ref&gt;McHugh, Mary R. "Historiography and Freedom of Speech: The Case of Cremutius Cordus". In ''Free Speech in Classical Antiquity'', edited by Ineke Sluiter and Ralph M.Rosen, 391-408. Leiden: Brill, 2004. {{ISBN|90-04-13925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A few years after Cordus's death, [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote ''Ad Marciam'' in order to console Marcia, Cordus's daughter, on the occasion of her son Metilius's death. Even though ''Ad Marciam'' is not primarily about Cordus, Seneca indicates that the works of Cordus have been re-published. Suetonius unequivocally asserts that the works of Cremutius Cordus were put back into circulation during the reign of Gaius [Caligula].&lt;ref&gt;Bellemore, Jane. "The Dating of Seneca's Ad Marciam De Consolatione". ''The Classical Quarterly'' 42, no.1 (1992): 219-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcia seems to have been actively involved in the re-publication of her father's works. When Seneca wrote ''Ad Marciam'' he mentioned that Metilius had died three years previously and Marcia is unable to seek solace even from her "beloved literature". Therefore, her contribution to the publication of her father's work pre-dates the death of her son.&lt;ref&gt;Bellemore, Jane. "The Dating of Seneca's Ad Marciam De Consolatione". ''The Classical Quarterly'' 42, no.1 (1992): 219-234.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vasily Rudich believes that "...the extent to which Seneca goes in his glorification of Cremutius Cordus is unbelievable." He also brings to attention the fact that "Seneca avoids any direct allusion to Cordus's alleged Republican sympathies, whatever their true character may have been."&lt;ref&gt;Rudich, Vasily. ''Dissidence and Literature under Nero: The Price of Rhetoricization''. New York: Routledge, 1997. {{ISBN|0-415-09501-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Rebecca Langlands]], Cordus's story "...is a tale which vividly demonstrates the possibility that a text might be received in a way which the author had not intended or anticipated, and be received in a way which might have dire consequences for author and text."&lt;ref&gt;Langlands, Rebecca. "A Woman's Influence on a Roman Text". In ''Women's Influence on Classical Civilization'', edited by Fiona McHardy and Eireann Marshall, 115-127. New York: Routledge, 2004. {{ISBN|0-415-30957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Langlands seems to suggest, Cordus was thus a man deeply misunderstood as a writer intending to vilify the royal family of the time, by his seemingly seditious work.

In his essay "Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome", Frederick H. Cramer talks about the "...spineless schoolmaster Quintilian [who] grudgingly admitted that 'the bold utterances of Cremutius also have their admirers and deserve their fame, but he went on to assure readers that 'the passages that brought him to his ruin have been expurgated.'"&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Frederick H. "Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 6, no.2 (April, 1945): 157-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer also suggests that it was not unlikely for one of Quintilian's students to have been Tacitus, who later said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Fathers ordered his books to be burned...but some copies survived, hidden at the time, but afterwards published. Laughable, indeed, are the delusions of those who fancy that by their exercise of their ephemeral power, posterity can be defrauded of information. On the contrary, through persecution the reputation of the persecuted talents grows stronger. Foreign despots and all those who have used the same barbarous methods have only succeeded in bringing disgrace upon themselves and glory to their victims.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus. ''The Annals of Imperial Rome'', translated by Michael Grant, p. 34. London: Harmondsworth, 1964; cited in Cramer, Frederick H. "Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 6, no.2 (April, 1945): 157-196.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cordus also appears in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Sejanus: His Fall''. According to Martin Butler, "Jonson gives Cordus an eloquent defence of the historian's objectivity, but we never learn what his ultimate fate is. History might redeem the past by preserving truth about it, but it is more likely that truth will be an early casualty of politics."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Martin. "Introduction". In ''Sejanus: His Fall'', by Ben Jonson, xv-xx. London: Royal Shakespeare Company, 2005. {{ISBN|1-85459-862-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1111">The '''Babel Proclamation''' was issued by [[Iowa]]'s [[List of Governors of Iowa|Governor]] [[William L. Harding]] on May 14, 1918. Harding took the [[Anti-German sentiment]] in the wake of [[World War I]] further than any other state. 

According to this proclamation, "only [[English language|English]] was legal in public or private schools, in public conversations, on trains, over the telephone, at all meetings, and in all religious services."&lt;ref&gt;Derr, Nancy.

The '''Bolgo language''' is a member of the [[Bua languages]] spoken in south-central [[Chad]], in the villages of Koya, Boli, Gagne, and Bedi southeast of [[Melfi, Chad|Melfi]], by about 1,800 people (SIL 1993.) According to de Rendinger, it has two principal dialects, Bolgo Werel around [[Daguela]] and Bolgo Mengo around [[Aloa-Niagara]], as well as a dialect called Bolgo Bormo; according to the [[Ethnologue]], its principal dialects are called Bolgo Dugag and Bolgo Kubar ("small" and "great" Bolgo.)  Great Bolgo is spoken to the north, bordering [[Mogum language|Mogum]] and [[Saba language|Saba]]; Little Bolgo is spoken to the south, bordering the closely related language [[Koke language|Koke]] as well as [[Chadian Arabic]].

Its typical word order is [[subject–verb–object]], noun–adjective, aspect–verb, possessor–possessed.  There is no true plural, but ''-gi'' serves as a collective marker.  The verb is negated with ''ta'', placed at the end of the sentence.

Example sentences:

* ''in-nāṇ rīm nāṇ n'ini'' (give-me water I drink), "give me water to drink"
* ''ibéri koko ao léti'' (man marry woman two), "the man married two women".

'''CableCARD''' is a special-use [[PC Card]] device that allows consumers in the United States to view and record [[digital cable]] television channels on [[digital video recorders]], [[personal computers]] and [[television set]]s on equipment such as a [[set-top box]] not provided by a [[cable television]] company. The card is usually provided by the local cable operator, typically for a nominal monthly fee.

In a broader context, CableCARD refers to a set of technologies created by the [[cable television in the United States|United States cable television]] industry to allow devices from non-cable companies to access content on the cable networks. Some technologies not only refer to the physical card, but also to a device ("Host") that uses the card. Some CableCARD technologies can be used with devices that have no physical CableCARD.

The CableCARD was the outcome of a U.S. federal government objective, directed in the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], to provide a robust competitive retail market for set-top boxes so consumers did not have to use proprietary equipment from the cable operators. It was believed that this would provide consumers with more choices and lower costs. Up to 2016, less than 2% of set-top boxes were purchased by consumers in the retail market since CableCARD was rolled out, indicating that CableCARD failed in its objective. Telecom lobbyists argued that the CableCARD initiative actually cost Americans billions of dollars in additional fees, increased energy consumption, and stifled innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pai|first1=Ajit|title=DISSENTING STATEMENT on Expanding Consumers’ Video Navigation Choices|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-16-18A5.pdf|website=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=27 January 2017|date=Feb 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The portion of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] which resulted in the creation of CableCARDs is known as Section 629, instructing the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to:
{{quote|...assure the commercial availability to consumers of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel video programming distributor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Multichannel video programming refers to cable or satellite television. A driving motivation of this passage was to foster the kind of consumer choices that resulted after the Federal government landmark [[Carterfone#Landmark_regulatory_decision|Carterfone ruling]] requiring telephone companies to allow consumers to purchase third-party telephones for attachment to the phone company network. The thought was that consumers would benefit from wider choices due to competition between [[consumer electronics]] (CE) manufacturers unaffiliated with cable companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2006-08-18 |url= http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/News_Releases/1998/nrcb8013.html  |title=FCC News Report No. CS 98-11 |format=PDF |publisher=FCC |accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC was charged with working with the industry to carry out the directives of the 1996 law. On June 11, 1998, after securing proposals and recommendations from interested parties, the FCC ordered that cable companies would provide a separable security access device by July 1, 2000 which could be used by third-party devices to access digital cable networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=1998-06-24 |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1998/fcc98116.pdf |title=First FCC Report and Order:Commercial Availability of Navigation Devices |format=PDF |publisher=FCC |accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The separable security device was referred to in FCC regulations as a "Point of Deployment" (POD) module. After many requests for delay from the cable industry, the first CableCARD devices became available from third party manufacturers in August 2004.

As of November 1, 2011, all US cable operators were required to allow self-installation of CableCARDs by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FCC|title=CableCARD: Know Your Rights|url=https://www.fcc.gov/guides/cablecard-know-your-rights|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration ban===
A major concern was that cable operators were not motivated to provide efficient security access mechanisms to equipment competitors. To address this, the FCC directed that by January 1, 2005, that cable operators must use the same separable access device available to third-parties and they were banned from providing equipment with an integrated security access mechanism. This rule is usually referred to as the "integration ban", and was unsuccessfully challenged in the courts and petitions to the FCC by the cable operators. The deadline was shifted forward twice until it went into effect on July 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2007-07-01 |url=http://news.cnet.com/Set-top+shakeup+is+in+the+cards/2100-1033_3-6194323.html |title=Set-top shakeup is in the cards |publisher=CNET News.com |accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on integrated security ended in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fold ‘Em: CableCARD Mandate Ends This Week|url=http://www.cablefax.com/regulation/fold-em-cablecard-mandate-ends-week|website=Cablefax|accessdate=27 January 2017|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical overview==
''CableCARD'' is a term [[trademark]]ed by [[CableLabs]] for the Point of Deployment (POD) module defined by standards including [[SCTE]] 28, SCTE 41, [[Consumer Electronics Association|CEA]]-679 and others. The physical CableCARD is inserted into a slot in the host (typically a [[digital television]] set or a set-top box) in order to identify and authorize the customer, and to provide proprietary decoding of the [[encryption|encrypted]] [[digital cable]] signal without the need for a proprietary [[set-top box]]. The cable tuner, [[Quadrature Amplitude Modulation|QAM]] [[modulation|demodulator]], and [[MPEG]] decoder are part of the host equipment. The card performs any conditional access and decryption functions, and provides a MPEG-2 transport stream to the host. The card also receives messages sent over the out-of-band signaling channel by the cable company's [[Cable television headend|headend]] servers and forwards them to the host.

CableCARDs may be used to access both [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] and [[High-definition television|high definition]] channels as long as they are not part of a [[switched video]] system. (This applies to one-way devices only; two-way devices are capable of receiving and viewing switched video. The ability for one-way devices to receive and view switched video has changed with the addition of the Tuning Resolver Interface Specification. Tuning adaptors and tuning adaptor interfaces have been added to provide communication back to the headend needed for switched video.) CableCARDs are not necessary for viewing unscrambled digital cable channels if the user has a [[QAM tuner]]—a feature in some televisions and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s. CableCARD support is most common on higher end televisions that include a special slot for the CableCARD and a built-in cable tuner. The card acts like a unique "key" to unlock the channels and services to which the cable customer has subscribed, and the television's remote-control will also control the cable channels. Televisions that support CableCARD should be labeled by the manufacturer as "[[digital cable ready]]" (DCR).

Interactive features such as [[video on demand]] rely on the CableCARD Host device being an OpenCable Host Device and have nothing to do with the physical card. This makes the common use of the phrase "CableCARD 2.0" as a requirement for video on demand misleading, since two way services have been provided with the actual cards from the very beginning.&lt;ref name="opencable1" /&gt;

===Physical CableCARDs===

The physical CableCARD inserted into the host device is a [[PC Card]] type II that handles [[decryption]] of video and ensures that only authorized subscribers may view it. This is also known as a "[[conditional-access module]]" function.

There are two kinds of physical CableCARDs:
* A "single-stream" CableCARD (S-CARD) can decode a single channel at a time. The S-CARD specification was initially specified in the Host-POD Interface (SCTE 28) and POD Copy Protection System (SCTE 41) standards (often referred to as CableCARD 1.0) set of specifications.
* A "multi-Stream" CableCARD (M-Card) can decode up to six channels simultaneously. Multi-stream cards were specified in a separate document in 2003.

No actual M-Cards were released before the introduction of CableCARD 2.0, which combined and enhanced the CableCARD 1.0 and Multi-Stream standards.&lt;ref name="opencable1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencable.com/primer/cablecard_primer.html |title=CableCARD Primer |publisher=OpenCable |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  M-Cards are [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with current CableCARD devices. To older CableCARD devices that do not support multiple streams, the card appears to be a single stream card. CE companies have long wanted M-Cards for their CableCARD 1.0 host devices in order to compete with devices that use multiple tuners. This is important for products such as [[Moxi]] and [[TiVo]] CableCARD [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, televisions with [[picture-in-picture]] and CableCARD-equipped [[personal computers]], which need to record one show while a user is watching another. To enable this without an M-Card, these products would be required to use multiple S-CARDs.

===CableCARDs with personal computers===
Existing integrated cable set-top boxes perform four basic functions:
* Enable receiving and selecting digital and analog cable channels
* Uniquely identify the customer and authorize the features to which they have subscribed
* Decode scrambled digital channels and premium programming such as movie channels
* Provide interactive two-way communications for [[electronic program guide]]s, [[pay-per-view]], video on demand, or [[switched video]] streams

New [[digital television]]s and other devices that are labeled ''DCR'' ([[Digital cable ready]]) contain:
* Built-in support for receiving digital cable channels (via an internal [[QAM tuner]])
* A slot for the current version of CableCARD, which allows decryption of encrypted digital channels

The CableCARD 2.0 specification includes support for #1-4, interactive two-way communications; however it is unknown exactly when CableCARD 2.0 hosts and compatible servers will become available. Future devices which support CableCARD 2.0 are expected to be labeled '''iDCR''' "[[Interactive digital cable ready]]". Among other requirements, CableCARD 2.0 hosts will be required to provide the [[OpenCable Application Platform]] (OCAP), also known as [[Tru2Way]], to run programs downloaded from the cable company.

Because the conditional access system is in software, it can be sent with the video as a form of [[digital rights management]]. The CableCARD Host Licensing Agreement and the DCAS agreement restrict the technologies that CE companies may use for distributing video from host devices. CE companies object to this expanding the notion of CableCARD network security issues to also include content protection issues. They prefer to deal with content owners directly with their standards and regard cable company protocols and formats as a transport only. CE companies wish to communicate video inside the home network using their own protected protocols and formats.

The OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) is a [Java (programming language)|Java]]-based platform intended for use either with any security access scheme—whether it is CableCARD 2.0 devices or future downloadable security schemes. OCAP was tied to CableCARDs because, as it was imagined by CableLabs, the additional processing necessary for managing the communication with the cable company server would be performed, not on the cable company provided equipment (the CableCARD), but on the consumer electronics device—known as the CableCARD "Host". CE companies objected that OCAP is unnecessary for the simple task of managing two-way communications on the cable networks. The CEA perspective is that [[Java (programming language)|Java]] is not efficient for CE devices, and that cable companies are passing to CE manufacturers the costs of a software platform which they didn't need, and which won't run on their existing hardware architectures.

The consumer electronics industry proposed in November 2006 that the CableCARD 2.0 specification be upgraded to include the provision for modified MCards that would support the communications necessary for VOD, PPV, and Switched Video. This card would be backward compatible with older cards, and support would be required for them on cable company servers by January 2008. These modified MCards would not allow two-way communication using current OCURs, which, by definition, are unidirectional. This so-called "OCAP-less" proposal was rejected by the [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association|NCTA]] for a variety of reasons elaborated on in the issues segment of this article. The technical advantage is that much less is assumed about the computing capability of the host, allowing the manufacturing cost to be significantly reduced. The disadvantage is that the MCard will be slightly more expensive, but the host will not necessarily be able to support the envisioned ecommerce and banking applications. CE companies argue that such a card fulfills the 1996 law's requirement that cable companies allow two-way communication on their networks, and that OCAP fulfills technical goals far in excess of those necessary for such two-way communications.

==Existing standard and certification procedures==
Cable providers in the United States are required by the FCC to support the CableCARD 2.0 standard. The specification was developed by [[CableLabs]], a research group run by a consortium of cable companies. Devices that use CableCARDs are known as "Hosts" and must be certified as compliant with the specification by CableLabs. The certification process can be lengthy and is performed in batches on a regular cycle every three months.

The first test tool to verify compliance of OpenCable hosts with the CableCARD one-way single stream specifications, HPNX, was released by SCM and [[Digital Keystone]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/32798 |title=Testing Platform for OpenCable Specs Launched |publisher=TVtechnlogy.com |date=2003-05-22 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the HPNX Pro version, supporting two-way and M-card specifications, was released by [[Digital Keystone]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablelabs.com/news/pr/2006/06_pr_mcard_sa_040606.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011045216/http://www.cablelabs.com/news/pr/2006/06_pr_mcard_sa_040606.html |archivedate=October 11, 2013|title=CableLabs Awards Qualification to Scientific Atlanta for Multi-Stream CableCARD |publisher=Cablelabs.com |date=2006-04-06 |accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "M-UDCP Device Acceptance Test Plan" published by CableLabs defines how to use the HPNX Pro test tool to validate the OpenCable host devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablelabs.com/udcp/downloads/TP-ATP-M-UDCP-I02-070105.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807093054/http://www.cablelabs.com/opencable/udcp/downloads/TP-ATP-M-UDCP-I02-070105.pdf |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |title=M-UDCP Device Acceptance Test Plan TP-ATP-M-UDCP-I02-20070105 |publisher=Cablelabs.com |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test tool to verify compliance of the CableCARD devices with the OpenCable specifications, Host Emulator Tool, and produced by Margi Systems, was first utilized by CableLabs to validate the Scientific Atlanta (Cisco) and Motorola POD devices in 2003 (POD was later renamed to CableCard).

Cable companies in the United States are required to provide CableCARDs conforming to this specification, and must correct incompatibilities between their networks and certified CableCARD devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Kohler |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/08/71682 |title=CableCard Swipes at Set-Top Boxes |publisher=Wired.com |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current CableCARD standard was borne out of an adversarial process between two main groups: cable companies represented by the [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association]] (NCTA) and consumer electronics companies represented by the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] (CEA). The portion of the CableCARD specs that could be agreed upon describe how one-way services work, so only the portion known as UDCP (Unidirectional Digital Cable Product) was required by the FCC. As it was the only thing required, most of the early devices were one-way capable; however all the actual CableCARDs produced were two-way capable. Many enhancements to the CableCARD standard including the optional Multi-Stream support became known as CableCARD 2.0.

[[Fiber-optic communication|Optical cable]] services (e.g. [[Verizon Fios]]) are classified as cable services and must, by FCC rules, also support the CableCARD standard. In Canada, cable providers Cogeco&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cogeco.ca/web/resources/pdf/support/user_guides/tv/cogeco_tivo_service_guide_on_en.pdf|title=TiVo Service from Cogeco ® Quick Guide|last=|first=|date=2015-08-18|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shaw&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://community.shaw.ca/thread/34654|title=CableCARD Not Validated|last=|first=|date=2016-03-08|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer CableCARD-enabled DVRs. Video providers in Europe must conform to the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] standard which is a more comprehensive open standard governed by independent standards bodies.

CableCARDs can also support non-television functions and can act as a [[cable modem]] controller with the host providing modulation and demodulation functions and the card providing decoding and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]] functionality; however this feature is rarely used and depends on the cable provider.

==Adoption==
There was much resistance from cable operators to the CableCARD rollout across the United States, preferring to support their own set-top boxes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The adoption proceeded slowly with 141,000 units by February 2006. The resistance softened somewhat with the July 2007 FCC ban on integrated security in set-top boxes, which required all new set-top boxes to use CableCARDs as their decryption mechanism. By June 2009, the top 10 "incumbent" U.S. cable operators had deployed more than 14 million operator-supplied set-tops with CableCARDs and 437,800 CableCARD modules for use in retail devices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=178653|title=CableCARD - Light Reading|author=|date=|website=lightreading.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Cable Television Association]] reported in April 2016 that only 621,400 CableCARDs were deployed for use in retail devices by the nine largest incumbent cable operators, compared to 55 million operator-supplied set-top boxes with CableCARDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association|title=Re: CS Docket No. 97-80 (Commercial Availability of Navigation Devices)|url=http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=60001707436|website=FCC.gov|publisher=FCC.gov|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This indicates that the CableCARD failed to achieve the goal of a competitive retail market for set-top boxes.

== Successor initiatives ==
In 2010, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) issued a [[notice of inquiry]] for a successor system, called [[AllVid]].&lt;ref name="noi"&gt;''[https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-10-60A1.pdf AllVid Notice of Inquiry]'', 25 [[FCC Record|FCC Rcd]] [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc28495/m1/792/ 4275] (adopted April 21, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fears"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Big Cable Fears AllVid—and Why It Shouldn't|first=Michael|last=Wolf|work=[[GigaOM]]|date=11 February 2014|url=https://gigaom.com/2011/02/11/why-big-cable-fears-allvid-and-why-it-shouldnt/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike CableCARD, AllVid intended to enable two-way services such as [[interactive program guide]]s, [[pay-per-view]], and [[video on demand]].

There are still many in the cable industry who are advocating that physical CableCARDs be dropped entirely.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} These cable companies prefer to move away from physical cards, and have proposed that a downloadable security component known as [[Downloadable Conditional Access System]] (DCAS) be used instead of a physical CableCARD. In this proposal, a custom security chip must be soldered into every compliant host; if a security scheme is compromised, a new security program can be downloaded to the host device. The FCC has not yet approved it.

Consumer electronic companies advocate their proposal for more unfettered access to cable company networks, with CableLabs' role reduced to addressing only cable company interests of maintaining network stability and security.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Cameroonian Pidgin English''', or '''Cameroonian Creole''', is a language variety of [[Cameroon]]. It is also known as '''Kamtok''' (from 'Cameroon-talk'). Five varieties are currently recognised:

* Grafi Kamtok, the variety used in the grassfields and often referred to as 'Grafi Talk'.
* Liturgical Kamtok. This variety has been used by the Catholic Church for three-quarters of a century.
* Francophone Kamtok. This variety is now used mainly in towns such as [[Douala]] and [[Yaoundé]], and by francophones talking to anglophones who do not speak French.
* Limbe Kamtok. This variety is spoken mainly in the southwest coastal area around the port that used to be called Victoria and is now [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]].
* Bororo Kamtok. This variety is spoken by the [[Wodaabe|Bororo]] cattle traders, many of whom travel through [[Nigeria]] and Cameroon.

Cameroonian Pidgin English is an English-based [[creole language]]. About 5% of Cameroonians are native speakers of the language, while an estimated 50% of the population speak it in some form. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The terms "Cameroonian Pidgin", "Cameroonian Pidgin English", "Cameroonian Creole" and "Kamtok" are synonyms for what Cameroonians call Cameroon Pidgin English. Many speakers are unaware that this language is different from English proper. It is a variety of West African Pidgin Englishes spoken along the coast from Ghana to Cameroon. It is a vehicular language that has been in active use in the country for over 200 years. It came into being in the Slave Trade Years (1440 to early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade'' Picador, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;). It preceded English in Cameroon: the first Baptist missionaries who arrived in Cameroon in 1845 and introduced formal education in English, had to learn Pidgin. A few decades later during the German annexation period (1884–1914), Pidgin resisted a German ban. It took flight when it became a makeshift language used in German plantations and undertakings by forced labourers who were drawn from the [[hinterland]] and who spoke different indigenous languages. With time it passed into use in the market place, and was adopted by Baptist missionaries as the language of their evangelical crusade. For many years, it has been used on school playgrounds and campuses and in political campaigns, and today it is forcing its way into spoken media. (For a comprehensive description of its linguistic features and its place in the language ecology of Cameroon, see amongst others, Kouega 2007 and 2008).

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

Like most West African languages, Kamtok has seven [[vowel]]s, with two mid vowels: open and closed (Schneider 1966:14-17). Schneider spells the mid vowels as closed ''ey'' and ''ow'' vs. open ''e'' and ''o'' but Todd spells them as closed ''e'' and ''o'' vs. open ''eh'' and ''oh''.

===Consonants===

The palatal approximate {{IPA|/j/}} is written ''y'', the palatal affricates {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} are written ''ch'' and ''j'', and the palatal and velar nasals {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} are written ''ny'' and ''ng'' (Schneider 1966:12-14). Some of these consonants, such as {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, are not distinguished by speakers who lack such distinctions in their local [[substrate language]]s (1966:225-229).

==Word classes==

===Pronoun system===
The basic pronoun system of Kamtok distinguishes three persons and two numbers. In most cases, the shape of the pronoun does not change to show grammatical function. Two exceptions involve the first person singular, where ''a'' serves as a subject [[clitic]] on [[verb]]s, as in ''mi, a mos go'' 'I must go', and ''ma'' is the [[possessive pronoun]], as in ''ma beli'' 'my stomach'. The other major exception is ''-am'' in place of ''i'' or ''dem'' as an object [[suffix]] on verbs, except when the referent is human, as in ''a go was-am'' 'I'll wash it'. (Schneider 1966:64-68). [[Acrolect]]al speakers, however, are more likely to use ''dei'' for ''dem'' in subject position and ''ohs'' for ''wi'' in object position (Todd, n.d.).

|-
! [[Grammatical person|2nd]]
| yu
| (w)una
|-

|-
|}

===Verbs===
Verbs are not inflected to show [[grammatical tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[linguistic modality|modality]], or [[negation (linguistics)|negation]]. Instead, these notions are conveyed by a small set of preverbal auxiliaries (Schneider 1966:69-72, 95-104).

*''no'' 'not'
*''neba'' ''neva'' 'never'
*''bin'' ''bi''    [[past tense]]
*''go''           [[future tense]]
*''don'' ''dong''  [[perfective aspect]]
*''di''           [[progressive aspect]]
*''fit'' 'can, able to'
*''lak'' 'must, like'
*''mos'' 'must, ought to'
*''wan'' 'want to'
*''look'' 'look, watch'
*''Sabi'' 'to know'
Examples:
*''Tiri pipo go di kam.'' ''Tiri pipo go di kam.'' 'Three people will be coming.'
*''Ma masa bin tutu wok.'' 'My boss worked very hard.'
*''Dem neva cam?'' 'They haven't come yet?'
*''Yu no fit bi ma klak.'' 'You cannot be my clerk.'
*''The Pipo go go small time.'' 'The people will go soon.'
*''The Pastor di soso tok.'' 'The pastor was continually talking.'
*''Ah no wan look dat kain ting.'' 'I don't want to watch that kind of thing.'
*''If yu torcham, e go chuk yu.'' 'If you touch it, it will poke you.'
*''Which man don tif ma book(s) dem?'' 'Who has stolen my books?'
*''Wi get plenti de go learnam komot dem.'' 'We have much to learn from them.'


The rendition of a short passage from English to Cameroon Pidgin:

English language:
{{Quote|The boy who came yesterday was annoyed that he was not accepted. After a quarrel with me, he went off sorry for himself. We were later told that he told our boss that he was rejected because I hated him. The boss later called me to his office and questioned me about the reasons I refused to take in the boy in question and I told him. Tanga (the boy) was noted as a notorious thief and he is a mischief in the community.}}

Cameroon Pidgin:
{{Quote|The boy whe cam yesterday be vex say them no gri yi. After whe yi quarrel with me, e comot go, sorry sorry. After them be tell we say e go tell wah boss say we no take yi because i hate yi. Wa boss bin call me for yi office, and question me for know the reason why i no take the boy. I tell yi the truth. That boy Tanga na tif man and no some very bad boy for quarter.}}

===Plural markers===
In pidgin unlike in English, 'S' is not used at the end of nouns to mark their plural state. Instead, this is what is used:
* 'dem' or 'ndem' e.g.: The ''boy dem'' di cam  -  The ''boys are'' coming.

'''Data degradation''' is the gradual [[Data corruption|corruption]] of [[Data (computing)|computer data]] due to an accumulation of non-critical failures in a [[data storage device]]. The [[phenomenon]] is also known as '''data decay''', '''data rot''' or '''bit rot'''.

==Visual example==

Below are several digital images illustrating data degradation. All images consist of 326,272 bits. The original photo is displayed on the left. In the next image to the right, a single bit was changed from 0 to 1. In the next two images, two and three bits were flipped. On [[Linux]] systems, the binary difference between files can be revealed using 'cmp' command (e.g. 'cmp -b bitrot-original.jpg bitrot-1bit-changed.jpg').

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Bitrot in JPEG files, 0 bits flipped.jpg|0 bits flipped
File:Bitrot in JPEG files, 1 bit flipped.jpg|1 bit flipped
File:Bitrot in JPEG files, 2 bits flipped.jpg|2 bits flipped
File:Bitrot in JPEG files, 3 bits flipped.jpg|3 bits flipped
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==In RAM==
Data degradation in [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) can occur when the electric charge of a [[bit]] in DRAM disperses, possibly altering program code or stored data. DRAM may be altered by [[Cosmic ray|cosmic rays]] or other high-energy particles. Such data degradation is known as a [[soft error]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Gorman |first1=T. J. |last2=Ross |first2=J. M. |last3=Taber |first3=A. H. |last4=Ziegler |first4=J. F. |last5=Muhlfeld |first5=H. P. |last6=Montrose |first6=C. J. |last7=Curtis |first7=H. W. |last8=Walsh |first8=J. L. |title=Field testing for cosmic ray soft errors in semiconductor memories|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |date=January 1996 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=41–50 |doi=10.1147/rd.401.0041 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5389436&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5389436 |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ECC memory]] can be used to mitigate this type of data degradation.

==In storage==

Data degradation results from the gradual decay of [[storage media]] over the course of years or longer. Causes vary by medium:
* ''[[Solid state (electronics)|Solid-state media]]'', such as [[EPROM]]s, [[flash memory]] and other [[solid-state drive]]s, store data using electrical charges, which can slowly leak away due to imperfect insulation. The chip itself is not affected by this, so reprogramming it once per decade or so prevents decay. An undamaged copy of the master data is required for the reprogramming; by the time reprogramming is attempted, the master data may be lost.{{cn|date=April 2015}}
* ''[[Magnetic storage|Magnetic media]]'', such as [[hard disk drive]]s, [[floppy disk]]s and [[magnetic tape]]s, may experience data decay as bits lose their magnetic orientation. Periodic refreshing by rewriting the data can alleviate this problem. In warm/humid conditions these media, especially those poorly protected against ambient air, are prone to the physical [[decomposition]] of the storage medium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ''[[Optical storage|Optical media]]'', such as [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]] and [[BD-R]], may experience data decay from the breakdown of the storage medium. This can be mitigated by storing discs in a dark, cool, low humidity location. "Archival quality" discs are available with an extended lifetime, but are still not truly permanent.{{cn|date=April 2015}} 
* ''[[Paper data storage|Paper media]]'', such as [[punched cards]] and [[punched tape]], may literally [[Decomposition|rot]]. [[Mylar]] punched tape is another approach that does not rely on electromagnetic stability.

==Component and system failures==
Most disk, [[disk controller]] and higher-level systems are subject to a slight chance of unrecoverable failure. With ever-growing disk capacities, file sizes, and increases in the amount of data stored on a disk, the likelihood of the occurrence of data decay and other forms of uncorrected and undetected [[data corruption]] increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Jim |last2=van Ingen |first2=Catharine |title=Empirical Measurements of Disk Failure Rates and Error Rates |journal=Microsoft Research Technical Report MSR-TR-2005-166 |date=December 2005 |url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64599/tr-2005-166.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-level software systems may be employed to mitigate the risk of such underlying failures by increasing redundancy and implementing integrity checking and self-repairing algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salter |first=Jim |title=Bitrot and atomic COWs: Inside "next-gen" filesystems |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/bitrot-and-atomic-cows-inside-next-gen-filesystems/ |accessdate=15 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XEwjmpKg?url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/bitrot-and-atomic-cows-inside-next-gen-filesystems/ |archivedate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ZFS]] [[file system]] was designed to address many of these data corruption issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonwick |first=Jeff |title=ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems |publisher=Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) |url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files2/sdc_archives/2009_presentations/monday/JeffBonwickzfs-Basic_and_Advanced.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=4 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055345/http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files2/sdc_archives/2009_presentations/monday/JeffBonwickzfs-Basic_and_Advanced.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Btrfs]] file system also includes data protection and recovery mechanisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Duke''' (Nduke, pronounced N-''doo''-kay) is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] now spoken by about 3,000 people on [[Kolombangara]] island, [[Solomon Islands]]. Duke is an exonymic name (not used by speakers themselves). Endonymic names (used by the speakers themselves) are '''Dughore''' (Ndughore) and '''Kolei'''. Dughore is also a name for an area in southwest Kolombangara, 'Kolei' is the general bilateral address term specific to Nduke. A more recent alternative name is '''Kolombangara''' (after the name of the island).

==Social linguistics==

Oral history in Dughore recounts that the northwest, northeast and southeast of Kolombangara had their own languages, which became extinct when the people of those areas were annihilated in warfare that probably occurred in the early 19th century. The people of the southwest built a series of hill fortresses and survived. At the beginning of the colonial period (about 1900), Duke had about 250 speakers, all concentrated in the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke, Nduke in Solomon Islands|url=http://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/11635/BP|website=Joshua Project|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-island exchange with neighbouring island language areas of [[Vella Lavella]], [[Simbo]] and [[Roviana]] was strong in the latter 19th century, possibly leading to some language borrowing, although marriage remained largely [[Endogamy|endogamous]] at that time. In the early twentieth century, colonial rule instituted Roviana as a [[lingua franca]], and the Seventh-day Adventist church, which was widely adopted on Kolombangara, used bible materials written in [[Marovo language|Marovo]]. By the mid-twentieth century marriages to Marovo became numerous and many households are bilingual Duke/Marovo. Roviana, although it ceased to be a regional lingua franca in the 1960s, is still widely understood by Duke speakers. Twentieth century borrowing from Roviana and Marovo has occurred to a small extent.

From the 1960s onward many marriages have taken place across the wider Solomons, leading to mixed language communities, at the same time that [[Pijin language|Solomon Pijin]] has risen to prominence as a national language. As a result, Pijin is a widely used household language on Kolombangara, which in some families has almost fully replaced Duke. Additionally, re-orientation of the economy away from the traditional Oceanic lifestyle has led to less reliance on traditional ecological knowledge and traditional technology, so that many specialist terms have largely been forgotten. The lexical richness of the language is now markedly less among speakers under 40 years old. Ethnologue rates the language as 'vigorous'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/nke|website=Ethnologue languages of the world|publisher=SIL|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography ==

[[Orthography]] refers to the spelling system used to write words down. The Nduke alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet. The first systematic orthography was used by [[Arthur Maurice Hocart|A.M. Hocart]] in 1908 to document a Nduke wordlist and Nduke anthropological fieldnotes. These sources were never published and did not form the basis for later orthographies. Two variant orthographies arose in local use, based on that used by the Methodist mission for Roviana language, and that used by the Seventh-day Adventist mission for Marovo language. These missions arrived in Nduke in 1917 and 1919 respectively. Recent lexical work on Nduke has used a composite of these two orthographies to avoid ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scales|first1=Ian|title=The Social Forest: landowners, development conflict and the State in Solomon Islands|date=2003|publisher=PhD Thesis, Australian National University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five diphthongs: {{IPA|/ei/}}, {{IPA|/ai/}}, {{IPA|/ae/}}, {{IPA|/au/}}, and {{IPA|/oi/}}

== Pronouns and possessives ==

The pronoun series is typically Oceanic. In addition to the basic forms tabulated below, dual and trial forms exist.

'''Personal pronouns'''
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! scope="col" style="text-align: left; width="120px;" | Person
! scope="col" style="width:80px;" | Singular
! scope="col" style="width:80px;" | Plural

|-
| style="text-align: left;" | Second || ghoi || ghamu
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | Third || aia || ria
|}

Possession may be grammatically marked in two ways. Preposed possessive particles can be used. 'Inalienable' possession, as in the case of body parts, kin, or inherent characteristics, can be marked by possessive suffixes.

'''Possessives'''
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! scope="col" style="text-align: left; width:120px;" | Form
! scope="col" style="width:80px;" | 1S

|-
| style="text-align: left;" | Suffix || -qu || -mu || -na || -da || -ma || -mi || -di
|}

Modern Nduke is tending away from use of these possessive series in preference for the general possessive marker ''ta'', as in ''mata ta rai'' (my eye).

==Deixis==

[[Deixis|Deictic]] terms are 'pointing words'. In addition to the personal deixis (pronoun and possessive) series above, Nduke has classes of words for spatial and time deixis.

'''Spatial deictic terms'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3307">'''Ephesia Grammata''' ({{lang-el|Ἐφέσια Γράμματα}}, "[[Ephesus|Ephesian]] words") are [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magical formulas]] attested from the 5th or 4th century BC. According to Pausanias the Lexicographer (Eust. ad Od. 20, 247, p.&amp;nbsp;1864), their name derives from their being inscribed on the cult image of [[Artemis]] in [[Ephesus]]. [[Clement of Alexandria]] considers them an invention of the [[Dactyl (mythology)|Daktyloi]].

Similar to the [[mantra]]s of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], they were "meaningless words" (ἄσημα ὀνόματα) potent to protect those who could speak them correctly, their power residing in their sound, so that they were ineffective if mispronounced.
[[Plutarch]] (Quaest. Conv. 706D) reports that the [[Magi]] instructed victims of demonic possession to recite the Ephesia Grammata.

In the 4th century comedy ''[[Lyropoios]]'' by Anaxilas, one character carries Ephesia Grammata inscribed on his belt.&lt;ref&gt;Apud [[Athenaeus]], ''Deipnosophistes'' 12:548c.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Ephesia Grammata are a group of six words: 
:{{lang|und-Grek|ΑΣΚΙ(ΟΝ) ΚΑΤΑΣΚΙ(ΟΝ) ΛΙΞ ΤΕΤΡΑΞ ΔΑΜΝΑΜΕΝΕΥΣ ΑΙΣΙΟΝ}} (or {{lang|und-Grek|ΑΙΣΙΑ}})
:''{{lang|und|aski(on) kataski(on) lix tetrax damnameneus aision (aisia)}}''
A version of this formula seems to be attested by a damaged inscription from [[Himera]], [[Sicily]], which must date to before the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] destruction of the city in 409 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=David|year=2000|title=Ephesia Grammata at Himera|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=130|pages=104–107|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/2000/130pdf/130104.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next earliest epigraphic evidence for the formula comes from the 4th century BC, and it continues to re-appear on [[Greek magical papyri|magical papyri]] throughout the [[Hellenistic period]]. The words sometimes occur in significantly different variants, for example on the lead tablet of [[Phalasarna]], [[Crete]]:
:{{lang|und-Grek|ασκι κατασκι αασιαν ενδασιαν }}
:''{{lang|und|aski kataski aasian endasian}}''

There were various attempts by ancient authors to make sense of the words. ''{{lang|und|Damnameneus}}'' was interpreted as the name of a [[Dactyl (poetry)|Dactyl]].
[[Androcydes (Pythagorean)|Androcydes]] proposed an interpretation as philosophical symbols (Clement, ''[[Stromata]]'' 5, 8, 45, 2):
''{{lang|und|aski}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἄσκιον}} "shadowless") as "darkness", ''{{lang|und|kataski}}'' ({{lang|grc|κατάσκιον}} "shadowy") as "brightness" (brightness being necessary in order to cast shadows), ''{{lang|und|lix}}'' ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hsch.]]: {{lang|grc|"λίξ: πλάγιος, καὶ λίθος πλατύς"}}) as an ancient term for "Earth", and ''{{lang|und|tetrax}}'' ({{lang|grc|τετραξός}} "fourfold") as the year (the four seasons), ''{{lang|und|Damnameneus}}'' as "Sun" and ''{{lang|und|aisia}}'' ({{lang|grc|αἴσιος}} "right, fitting, auspicious") as [[Logos]].

A '''euphemism''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|f|ə|m|ɪ|z|əm}} is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found [[Profanity|offensive]] or suggest something unpleasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphemism |title=Euphemism |dictionary=Webster's Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some euphemisms are intended to amuse, while others use bland, inoffensive terms for concepts that the user wishes to downplay. Euphemisms may be used to refer to [[Taboo word|taboo topics]] (such as disability, sex, excretion, or death) in a polite way, or to mask [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=euphemism (n.) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euphemism |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Euphemism'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc-Latn|euphemia}} ({{lang|grc|εὐφημία}}) which refers to the use of 'words of good omen'; it is a compound of {{lang|grc-Latn|eû}} ({{lang|grc|εὖ}}), meaning 'good, well', and {{lang|grc-Latn|phḗmē}} ({{lang|grc|φήμη}}), meaning 'prophetic speech; rumour, talk'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=fh/mh φήμη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eupheme'' is a reference to the female Greek spirit of words of praise and positivity, etc. The term ''euphemism'' itself was used as a euphemism by the [[ancient Greeks]]; with the meaning "to keep a holy silence" (speaking well by not speaking at all).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euphemism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=''Euphemism" Etymology|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Reasons for using euphemisms vary by context and intent. Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing. Euphemisms are also used to downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents. For instance, one reason for the comparative scarcity of written evidence documenting the exterminations at [[Auschwitz]], relative to their sheer number, is "directives for the extermination process obscured in bureaucratic euphemisms".&lt;ref name="MyUser_Newyorker.com_December_1_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/11/15/evidence-of-evil |title=Evidence of Evil - The New Yorker |newspaper=Newyorker.com |date= November 15, 1993 |author=Timothy Ryback |accessdate= December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of labeling a term as a euphemism can in itself be controversial, as in the following  two examples:

* ''[[Affirmative action]]'', meaning a preference for minorities or the historically disadvantaged, usually in employment or academic admissions. This term is sometimes said to be a euphemism for [[reverse discrimination]], or in the UK [[positive discrimination]], which suggests an intentional bias that might be legally prohibited, or otherwise unpalatable.&lt;ref&gt;affirmative action as euphemism

* ''[[Enhanced interrogation techniques|Enhanced interrogation]]'' is sometimes said to be a euphemism for torture.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

===Phonetic modification===
Phonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities, diminishing their intensity. Modifications include:
* Shortening or "clipping" the term, such as ''Jeez'' (Jesus) and ''what the—'' ("what the hell")
* Mispronunciations, such as ''[[Frak (expletive)|frak]]'', ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]'' (both the preceding for "fuck"), ''what the fudge'', ''what the truck'' (both "what the fuck"), ''oh my gosh'' ("oh my God"), ''frickin'' ("fucking"), ''darn'' ("damn"), ''oh shoot'' ("oh shit"), ''be-yotch'' ("bitch"), etc. This is also referred to as a [[minced oath]].
* Using first letters as replacements, such as ''SOB'' ("son of a bitch"), ''what the eff'' ("what the fuck"), ''S my D'' ("suck my dick"), ''BS'' ("bullshit"). Sometimes, the word "word" is added after it, such as ''F-word'' ("fuck"), ''S-word'' ("shit"), ''B-word'' ("bitch"), etc. Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled. For example, the word ''piss'' was shortened to ''pee'' (pronounced as the letter ''P'') in this way.

===Figures of speech===
* [[Ambiguous]] statements (''it'' for excrement, ''the situation'' or ''a girl in trouble'' for pregnancy, ''passing away'' or ''passed'' or ''go'' for death, ''do it'' or ''come together'' in reference to a [[Sexual intercourse#In humans|sexual act]], ''[[tired and emotional]]'' for drunkenness)
* [[Understatement]]s (''asleep'' for dead, ''drinking'' for consuming alcohol, ''hurt'' for injured, etc.)
* [[Metaphor]]s (''beat the meat'' or ''choke the chicken'' or ''jerkin' the gherkin'' for [[masturbation]], ''take a dump'' and ''take a leak'' for defecation and urination respectively)
* Comparisons (''buns'' for buttocks, ''weed'' for cannabis)
* [[Metonymy]] (''men's room'' for "men's toilet")

===Rhetoric===
Euphemism may be used as a [[Rhetorical strategies|rhetorical strategy]], in which case its goal is to change the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of a description from positive to negative.

===Slang===
{{see also|Slang}}
The use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, ''screwed up'' is a euphemism for ''fucked up''; ''hook-up'' and ''laid'' are euphemisms for [[sexual intercourse]].

There is some disagreement over whether certain terms are or are not euphemisms. For example, sometimes the phrase ''visually impaired'' is labeled as a [[political correctness|politically correct]] euphemism for ''blind'' or a blind person. However, ''[[visual impairment]]'' can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, groups that would be excluded by the word ''blind''.

===Words from a foreign language===
Expressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as a replacement for an offensive word. For example, the French word ''enceinte'' was sometimes used instead of the English word ''pregnant''.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ENCEINTE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enceinte|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=2017-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of word substitution became so frequent that the expression "''[[pardon my French]]''" was adopted in attempts to excuse the use of profanity.

===Evolution===&lt;!-- [[Euphemism treadmill]] redirects here. --&gt;
Euphemisms may be formed in a number of ways. [[Periphrasis]], or [[circumlocution]], is one of the most common: to "speak around" a given word, [[Implicature|implying]] it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.

To alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a [[swear word]]) to form a euphemism is known as ''taboo deformation'', or a [[minced oath]]. In [[American English]], words that are unacceptable on television, such as ''[[fuck]]'', may be represented by deformations such as ''freak'', even in children's cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |work=FCC.gov |accessdate=2014-01-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Feck]] is a minced oath popularised by the [[sitcom]] [[Father Ted]].

[[Bureaucracy|Bureaucracies]] frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as [[doublespeak]] expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term "[[sunshine units]]" for contamination by [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCool |first=W.C. |publication-date=1957-02-06 |title=Return of Rongelapese to their Home Island&amp;nbsp;— Note by the Secretary |publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] |url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |accessdate=2007-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925185914/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the [[Great Purge]] often used the clause "imprisonment [[Without the right of correspondence|without right to correspondence]]": the person sentenced never had a chance to correspond with anyone because soon after imprisonment they would be shot.&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitsyn, Alexander (1974). The Gulag Archipelago I. New York, NY: Harper Perennial. p. 6. {{ISBN|0-06-092103-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1939, Nazi official [[Reinhard Heydrich]] used the term ''[[Sonderbehandlung]]'' ("special treatment") to mean [[summary execution]] (most likely by hanging) of persons viewed as "disciplinary problems" by the Nazis even before commencing the [[the Holocaust|systematic extermination of the Jews]]. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be "guided" (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml|title=Holocaust-history.org|website=www.holocaust-history.org|accessdate=20 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528142643/http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having been "evacuated" to their doom. Such was part of the formulation of ''[[Final Solution|Endlösung der Judenfrage]]'' (the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question"), which became infamous to the entire world during the Nuremberg Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477|title=Wannsee Conference and the "Final Solution"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A euphemism may itself devolve into a taboo word, through the linguistic process known as [[semantic change]] (specifically pejoration) described by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W.V. |last=Quine |title=Quiddities |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |year=1987 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently dubbed the "euphemism treadmill" by Harvard professor [[Steven Pinker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515171806/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf |title=The game of the name |newspaper=The New York Times |archivedate=2011-05-15 |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf |date=1994-04-03 |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''toilet'' is an 18th-century euphemism, replacing the older euphemism ''house-of-office'', which in turn replaced the even older euphemisms ''privy-house'' and ''bog-house''.&lt;ref name="Bell 1953"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell |first=Vicars Walker |title=On Learning the English Tongue |year=1953 |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |quote=The Honest Jakes or Privy has graduated via Offices to the final horror of Toilet. |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-8WAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=toilet#search_anchor--&gt; In the 20th century, where the words ''lavatory'' or ''[[toilet]]'' were deemed inappropriate (e.g. in the United States), they were sometimes replaced with ''bathroom'' or ''water closet'', which in turn became ''restroom'', ''W.C.'', or ''washroom''.

The word ''[[shit]]'' appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] *''sḱeyd-'', from which it was derived, meant "to cut off".&lt;ref name="ringe"&gt;{{cite book| last=Ringe |first=Don | authorlink=Donald Ringe| title=From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-955229-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euphemisms are at risk of being misunderstood and used literally by young children who are acquiring language, and by older people who are learning a foreign language; an example is the "pregnant [[Firefighter|fireman]]" type of children's [[solecism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://davesdailyquotes.com/the-pregnant-fireman/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

[[Doublespeak]] is a term sometimes used for deliberate euphemistic misuse of words to distort or reverse their meaning, as in a "Ministry of Peace" which wages war, and a "Ministry of Love" which imprisons and tortures. It is a [[portmanteau]] of the terms ''[[Newspeak]]'' and ''[[doublethink]]'', which originate from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

The word ''euphemism'' itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (see [[Dr. Seuss]]), a child asks to go to the ''euphemism'', where ''euphemism'' is being used as a euphemism for ''[[outhouse]]''. This euphemistic use of ''euphemism'' also occurred in the play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' where a character requests, "Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?"

In Wes Anderson's film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', the replacement of swear words by the word ''cuss'' became a humorous motif throughout the film.

In [[Tom Hanks]]'s web series ''[[Electric City (web series)|Electric City]]'', the use of profanity has been censored by the word ''expletive''. "[[Expletive deleted|&amp;#91;Expletive deleted&amp;#93;]]" entered public discourse after its notorious use in censoring transcripts of the [[Watergate tapes]].

In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], the curses of the scientist [[Ebling Mis]] have all been replaced with the word ''unprintable''. In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's. The same word has also been used in his short story "[[Flies (Asimov short story)|Flies]]".

[[George Carlin]] has stated in audio books and his stand-up shows that euphemisms soften everyday language and take the life out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9n8Xp8DWf8|title=George Carlin's stand up act: Euphemism|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catalan name |Calvet|Pascual}}

'''Agustí Calvet Pascual''' ({{IPA-ca|əɣusˈti kəlˈβɛt}}; [[Sant Feliu de Guíxols]]; October 7, 1887 – [[Barcelona]]; April 12, 1964), known as '''Gaziel''' ({{IPA-ca|ɡəziˈɛl|pron}}), was a [[Spain|Spanish]] journalist, writer and publisher.

==Life and works==

===Before the [[Spanish Civil War]]===
He studied [[humanities]] in Barcelona and in [[Madrid]], where he earned his doctorate. His [[doctoral thesis]] was on [[Anselm Turmeda]], and was published in 1914 as ''Fray Anselmo de Turmeda. Heterodoxo español 1352-1423-32?''.

He then went to Paris to further his studies and, at the outbreak of the [[First World War]], he acted as [[war correspondent]] for ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', the most influential newspaper in Barcelona, with such a success that very shortly most of his articles were brought together and published in four successive books: ''Diario de un estudiante en París (Diary of a student in Paris)'' (1916), ''Narraciones de tierras heroicas (Tales of heroic lands)'' (1916), ''De París a Monastir (From Paris to [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]])'' (1917) and ''En las líneas de fuego (In the fire lines)'' (1917); and he became a full-time journalist. It was then when he began to use '''''Gaziel''''' as pseudonym. He had married a French lady in 1914.

After the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in 1931, he showed himself as a firm pro-republican, but after 1934 he became increasingly disappointed and anxious over the social and political atmosphere in Spain.    

In those years preceding the Spanish civil war Gaziel was appointed editor in chief of ''La Vanguardia'', and he was widely seen as the most incisive political analyst in Spain. At the beginning of the war, in July 1936, he had to flee to France, as his life was in risk due to the [[political repression]] led by anarchist and Communist [[militias]], while his home in Barcelona, including his valuable personal library, was sacked.

===After the Spanish Civil War===
He was in [[Brussels]] when the [[German Invasion of Belgium|German invasion]] in 1940 forced him to return to Spain, where he was received with undisguised hostility by the new [[Francoist]] authorities, despite having been the [[cultural attaché]] of their Embassy in Belgium and having signed in 1937 a [[manifesto]] -promoted by [[Francesc Cambó]]- in support of the nationalist side in the Civil War; while [[Carlos Godó]], the owner of ''La Vanguardia'', prevented him from returning to his position in the newspaper. As a consequence he lived in Madrid, as general manager of the ''Editorial Plus Ultra'' publishing house. 

In the late 1940s, he wrote ''Meditaciones en el desierto (Meditations in the desert)'', a depressing view on the situation of Spain and, more generally, of Europe in the postwar years.

In the early 1950s, he travelled through [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and [[Portugal]]. As a result of these travels he wrote, and published a decade later, his so-called '''''[[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] trilogy''''': ''Portugal lejano (Portugal far away)'', ''Castilla adentro (Castile inside)'' and ''La península inacabada (The unfinished peninsula)'', where he mixed the interesting diaries of these trips with his profound reflections on the historical and political coexistence between Portugal, [[Catalonia]] and Castile (or Spain in a broader sense), an issue that worried him all along his life. 

''La peninsula inacabada'' includes also a very significant extensive [[soliloquy]]: While he spends a spring afternoon in the delightful beach of [[Estoril]], he looks sadly over his life and the three wars ([[First World War]], [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Second World War]]) he witnessed, and over the contemporary European situation, including the [[Indochina War]] where his eldest son was fighting in the ranks of the French Army. 

Two professional travels, to [[Switzerland]] and Italy, to attend [[International Publishers Association|International Publishers Congresses]] produced two respective books, ''[[Seny]], treball i llibertat'' (''Sensibleness, work and freedom'') and ''L'home és el tot'' (''The man is everything''). In the first one, perhaps his [[masterpiece]], he displayed his absolute admiration for the Swiss political and social structure, that he thought as the ideal answer to the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|regional complexities of Spain]]. In the second one he showed himself captivated by the magnificent [[renaissance]] art in [[Florence]] and took the opportunity to express his most profound aversion to the [[mass society]].

In 1959, after his retirement from Editorial Plus Ultra, Gaziel moved back to Barcelona, where he resumed on a full-time basis his writing activity. His reappearance in the Catalan literary arena, at age seventy-two, surprised the cultural [[The Establishment|Establishment]] of Barcelona. Just before his death, in 1964, he finished ''Història de La Vanguardia (1881–1936)'' (''History of La Vanguardia (1881–1936)''), a key book in the history of Spanish journalism and Gaziel's personal settling of scores with Carlos Godó.

In October 2009, a new compilation of Gaziel's articles on the First World War, including several ones not collected in the 1915–1917 books, ''En las trincheras (In the trenches)'', was published.

==Catalan vs. Spanish and general mind==
[[Image:Quina Gaziel.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Book cover of ''Quina mena de gent som'', by Gaziel]]
Gaziel wrote with equal elegance in either [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or Spanish (actually he published eight works in Spanish and fourteen in Catalan, while his almost daily writing in ''La Vanguardia'' along twelve years was in Spanish); and while he always saw himself as a genuine [[catalan people|Catalan]] he never fully backed the [[Catalan nationalism]], as he made clear in his posthumous work, ''Quina mena de gent som (What kind of people are we)''. Although strictly speaking he did not belong to the [[Noucentisme]] Catalan cultural movement, he was close to it and always admired [[Eugeni d'Ors]] and, above all, [[Enric Prat de la Riba]].

On the other hand, since his youth he was a wholehearted [[francophile]], a stance that was still increased along the rest of his life, although he always deeply regretted the general French ignorance, or disdain, of the [[Northern Catalonia|Catalonia under French administration]] history and specificity or even of its mere existence. On the contrary, in the second half of his life he developed a clear socio-cultural, not political, [[antiamericanism]]. Also he took a really negative view of the [[Latin-American]] establishments following a very frustrating experience around a publishing business he tried to undertake in [[Colombia]] in the early forties.  

All in all, Gaziel was, first and foremost, a liberal, conservative, [[eurocentric]] [[bourgeois]], and, like many cultured men of his time, he was well aware of the dramatic, and to them disappointing, changes the world had experienced along the first half of the 20th century, to the point that in ''Portugal far away'' he wrote: ''I am not any more a man of the present times, neither of the future''.

'''Gnommish''' is the "[[fairy]] language" used in the [[Artemis Fowl series|''Artemis Fowl'' series]] by [[Eoin Colfer]]. It is not actually a language at all, but the English language encoded into a [[letter-substitution cipher]] where each symbol represents a letter. Lines of translatable Gnommish run along the bottoms of books one, two, four, five and six. However, in book one of the series, it is mentioned that one of the symbols was comparable to the Egyptian [[Anubis]] symbol. It is also mentioned that Gnommish is a mix of symbolic and alphabetic letters, running in spirals (but since reading in spirals gives most fairies [[migraine]]s, most modern fairy script is arranged in horizontal lines).

== Code ==
&lt;!-- Please do not add a decipherment of the code here – this is an encyclopaedia article, not a walkthrough. --&gt;
A string of Gnommish symbols appears at the bottom of each page of ''[[Artemis Fowl (novel)|Artemis Fowl]]''. It comprises a [[substitution cipher]] which can be deciphered using sections of the book's text displayed in Gnommish, together with their English translations. A complete Gnommish cipher key can be found in ''[[The Artemis Fowl Files]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book | booknumber = files | pages = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unique words ==
There are only five Gnommish words mentioned in the ''Artemis Fowl'' series. P'shóg is the Gnommish word for sprite, used in Book 1 by [[Artemis Fowl II]] while talking to the sprite in [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. He also uses the word ka-dalun, meaning fairy. D'Arvit is a Gnommish curse word. Book 1 declares after the first appearance of the word "D'Arvit" that, "There is no point translating that word as it would have to be censored." It is often used in the series to replace real [[profanity]], likely to be in the place of a swearword. In the books it is often used by [[List of Artemis Fowl characters#Julius Root|Commander Root]], but also by other characters. " In Book 6, Holly Short and Mulch Diggums share a quick conversation, which included the Gnommish word "cowpóg" which translates as 'moron'. Commander Root tends to use these words often in the book.

In Book 7, the Gnommish name for the ship in the Atlantic Ocean is ffurforfer, pronounced 'fourfourfour'. It means 'plunderer'. Also it is revealed that in Gnommish, for a conversion from a verb (for example, plunder- ffurfor) to a noun (plunderer- ffuforfer), the suffix -fer is added. It is noted that this is similar to the English way of adding the suffix -er, hence implying that one was derived from the other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">The '''Grand dictionnaire terminologique''' (GDT) is an online [[terminology|terminological]] [[database]] containing nearly 3 million [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Latin]] technical terms in 200 industrial, scientific and commercial fields.

The GDT has existed in a number of formats over the years, including a dial-up service known as '''Banque de terminologie du Québec''' (BTQ), and a [[CD-ROM]] version. LGDT is now available only as a freely-accessible web site.

Produced by the [[Office québécois de la langue française]], the GDT is the result of thirty years of work by [[Quebec]]-based terminologists. It is the most complete translation resource for Canadian English-language technical terms.

== Quebec French ==
When translations differ between [[Quebec French]] and "[[Standard French]]", &amp;ndash; for example in the expression "cerebrovascular accident" (CVA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdt.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/resultat.aspx?terme={{urlencode:cerebrovascular accident}}|title=cerebrovascular accident|work=Grand dictionnaire terminologique|publisher=[[Office québécois de la langue française]]|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated as ''accident cérébrovasculaire'' (ACV) in Quebec French and ''accident vasculaire cérébral'' in France &amp;ndash; the two forms are both given with a paragraph describing their origins, usage and conformity.

In [[mathematics]], '''Harborth's conjecture''' states that every [[planar graph]] has a planar [[graph drawing|drawing]] in which every edge is a straight [[line segment|segment]] of [[integer]] length.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pearls in Graph Theory: A Comprehensive Introduction|series=Dover Books on Mathematics| | last1 = Hartsfield | first1 = Nora | last2 = Ringel | first2 = Gerhard | author2-link = Gerhard Ringel |publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2013|isbn=9780486315522|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMjDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247|mr=2047103}}.

==Special classes of graphs==
Although Harborth's conjecture is not known to be true for all planar graphs, it has been proven for several special kinds of planar graph.

One class of graphs that have integral Fáry embeddings are the graphs that can be reduced to the [[empty graph]] by a sequence of operations of two types:
*Removing a vertex of degree at most two.
*Replacing a vertex of degree three by an edge between two of its neighbors. (If such an edge already exists, the degree three vertex can be removed without adding another edge between its neighbors.)
For such a graph, a rational Fáry embedding can be constructed incrementally by reversing this removal process, using the facts that the set of points that are at a rational distance from two given points are dense in the plane, and that if three points have rational distance between one pair and square-root-of-rational distance between the other two pairs, then the points at rational distances from all three are again dense in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Almering|first=J. H. J.|title=Rational quadrilaterals|journal=[[Indagationes Mathematicae]]|volume=25|year=1963|pages=192–199|mr=0147447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Berry|first=T. G.|title=Points at rational distance from the vertices of a triangle|journal=[[Acta Arithmetica]]|volume=62|year=1992|issue=4|pages=391–398|mr=1199630|url=https://eudml.org/doc/206501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The distances in such an embedding can be made into integers by scaling the embedding by an appropriate factor. Based on this construction, the graphs known to have integral Fáry embeddings include the [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]] planar graphs, [[Dense graph#Sparse and tight graphs|(2,1)-sparse]] planar graphs, planar graphs of [[treewidth]] at most&amp;nbsp;3, and graphs of degree at most four that either contain a [[Diamond graph|diamond]] subgraph or are not [[k-edge-connected graph|4-edge-connected]].&lt;ref name="Sun13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Biedl|first=Therese|authorlink=Therese Biedl|contribution=Drawing some planar graphs with integer edge-lengths|title=Proc. Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG 2011)|year=2011|url=http://www.cccg.ca/proceedings/2011/papers/paper36.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sun|first=Timothy|contribution=Rigidity-Theoretic Constructions of Integral Fary Embeddings|title=Proc. Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG 2011)|year=2011|url=http://www.cccg.ca/proceedings/2011/papers/paper20.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the graphs that can be reduced to the empty graph by the removal only of vertices of degree at most two (the [[degeneracy (graph theory)|2-degenerate]] planar graphs) include both the [[outerplanar graph]]s and the [[series-parallel graph]]s. However, for the outerplanar graphs a more direct construction of integral Fáry embeddings is possible, based on the existence of infinite subsets of the [[unit circle]] in which all distances are rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Additionally, integral Fáry embeddings are known for each of the five [[Platonic solid]]s.&lt;ref name="hkms"/&gt;

==Related conjectures==
A stronger version of Harborth's conjecture, posed by {{harvtxt|Kleber|2008}}, asks whether every planar graph has a planar drawing in which the vertex coordinates as well as the edge lengths are all integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Michael|last=Kleber|title=Encounter at far point|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=1|year=2008|pages=50–53|doi=10.1007/BF02985756}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to be true for [[cubic graph|3-regular graphs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Geelen|first1=Jim|last2=Guo|first2=Anjie|last3=McKinnon|first3=David|title=Straight line embeddings of cubic planar graphs with integer edge lengths|journal=Journal of Graph Theory|volume=58|year=2008|issue=3|pages=270–274|mr=2419522|doi=10.1002/jgt.20304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for graphs that have maximum degree&amp;nbsp;4 but are not 4-regular,&lt;ref name="Benediktovich"&gt;{{citation|last=Benediktovich|first=Vladimir I.|title=On rational approximation of a geometric graph|journal=[[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Mathematics]]|volume=313|year=2013|issue=20|pages=2061–2064|mr=3084247|doi=10.1016/j.disc.2013.06.018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Apollonian network|planar 3-trees]].&lt;ref name="Benediktovich"/&gt;

Another unsolved problem in geometry, the [[Erdős–Ulam problem]], concerns the existence of [[dense set|dense subsets]] of the plane in which all distances are [[rational number]]s. If such a subset existed, it would form a [[universal point set]] that could be used to draw all planar graphs with rational edge lengths (and therefore, after scaling them appropriately, with integer edge lengths). However, Ulam conjectured that dense rational-distance sets do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]|year=2010|volume=43|issue=2|pages=393–401|title=On a question of Erdős and Ulam|first1=Jozsef|last1=Solymosi|author1-link= József Solymosi |first2=Frank|last2=de Zeeuw|arxiv=0806.3095|mr=2579704|doi=10.1007/s00454-009-9179-x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[Erdős–Anning theorem]], infinite non-collinear point sets with all distances being integers cannot exist. This does not rule out the existence of sets with all distances rational, but it does imply that in any such set the denominators of the rational distances must grow arbitrarily large.

The '''Hawaiian language''' (Hawaiian: ''{{lang|haw|{{okina}}Ōlelo Hawai{{okina}}i}}'', {{IPA-haw|ʔoːˈlɛlo həˈvɐjʔi|pron}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries|{{Okina}}ōlelo|id=D15294}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Polynesian language]] that takes its name from [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]], the largest island in the tropical North Pacific [[archipelago]] where it developed. Hawaiian, along with [[English language|English]], is an official language of the [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]]&lt;ref name="Article XV, Section 4"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article XV, Section 4 |url=https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent/Vol01_Ch0001-0042F/05-Const/CONST_0015-0004.htm |website=Constitution of the State of Hawaiʻi |publisher=Hawaiʻi State Legislature |accessdate=24 September 2018 |language=English |date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]] established the first Hawaiian-language [[constitution]] in 1839 and 1840.

For various reasons, including [[Hawaii Territory|territorial]] legislation establishing English as the official language in schools, the number of [[first language|native speakers]] of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s. Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of seven inhabited islands. In 2001, native speakers of Hawaiian amounted to less than 0.1% of the statewide population. Linguists were unsure that Hawaiian and other [[endangered language]]s would survive.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{Harvcol|Hinton|Hale|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1897 Petition Against the Annexation of Hawaii |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hawaii-petition/ |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, from around 1949 to the present day, there has been a gradual increase in attention to and promotion of the language. Public Hawaiian-language immersion preschools called [[Pūnana Leo]] were established in 1984; other immersion schools followed soon after that. The first students to start in immersion preschool have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers. The federal government has acknowledged this development. For example, the Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 changed the names of several [[national park]]s in Hawai{{Okina}}i, observing the Hawaiian spelling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/s939 Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 (S.939)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the language is still classified as critically endangered by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[creole language]] spoken in Hawai{{okina}}i is [[Hawaiian Pidgin]] (or Hawaii Creole English, HCE). It should not be mistaken for the Hawaiian language nor for a dialect of English.

The [[Hawaiian alphabet]] has 13 letters: five vowels (each with a long pronunciation and a short one) and eight consonants, one of which is the glottal stop called [[#Glottal stop |{{okina}}okina]].

==Name==
The Hawaiian language takes its name from the largest island in the Hawaiian state, [[Hawaii]] (''{{lang|haw|Hawai{{okina}}i}}'' in the Hawaiian language). The island name was first written in English in 1778 by British explorer [[James Cook]] and his crew members. They wrote it as "Owhyhee" or "Owhyee". Explorers Mortimer (1791) and [[Otto von Kotzebue]] (1821) used that spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=44, 459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial "O" in the name is a reflection of the fact that unique identity is predicated in Hawaiian by using a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] form, ''o'', immediately before a proper noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=144, 174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Hawaiian, the name of the island is expressed by saying ''{{lang|haw|O Hawai{{'okina}}i}}'', which means "[This] is Hawai{{okina}}i."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cook expedition also wrote "Otaheite" rather than "Tahiti."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling "why" in the name reflects the {{IPA|[hw]}} pronunciation of ''wh'' in 18th-century English (still [[Pronunciation of English ⟨wh⟩|used]] in parts of the [[English-speaking world]]). ''Why'' was pronounced {{IPA|[hwai]}}. The spelling "hee" or "ee" in the name represents the sounds {{IPA|[hi]}}, or {{IPA|[i]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting the parts together, ''O-why-(h)ee'' reflects {{IPA|[o-hwai-i]}}, a reasonable approximation of the native pronunciation, {{IPA|[o hɐwɐiʔi]}}.

American missionaries bound for Hawai{{okina}}i used the phrases "Owhihe Language" and "Owhyhee language" in Boston prior to their departure in October 1819 and during their five-month voyage to Hawai{{okina}}i.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=304, 475}}&lt;/ref&gt; They still used such phrases as late as March 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by July 1823, they had begun using the phrase "Hawaiian Language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hawaiian, ''{{lang|haw|{{okina}}Ōlelo Hawai{{okina}}i}}'' means "Hawaiian language", as adjectives follow nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=3 ''Figure 1''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and origin==
Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to other [[Polynesian languages]], such as [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Marquesan language|Marquesan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]] (the language of [[Easter Island]]) and [[Tongan language|Tongan]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

According to Schütz (1994), the [[Culture of the Marquesas Islands|Marquesans]] colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=334–336; 338 ''20n''}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by later waves of immigration from the [[Society Islands]] and [[Samoa]]-[[Tonga]]. Their languages, over time, became the Hawaiian language within the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimura and Wilson (1983) also state: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Linguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kimura|Wilson|1983|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Methods of proving Hawaiian's linguistic relationships===
The [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic]] history of the Hawaiian language is demonstrated primarily through the application of [[lexicostatistics]], which involves quantitative comparison of lexical [[cognates]], and the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref name="lyovin1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=322–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the number of cognates and the phonological similarity of cognates are measures of language relationship.

The following table provides a limited lexicostatistical data set for ten numbers.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] (PAN) forms are from {{Harvcoltxt|Li|2004|p=4}}.  The Tagalog forms are from {{Harvcoltxt|Ramos|1971}}, the Tongan from {{Harvcoltxt|Churchward|1959}}, and the Hawaiian from {{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The asterisk (*) is used to show that these are hypothetical, [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] forms. In the table, the year date of the modern forms is rounded off to 2000 CE to emphasize the 6000-year time lapse since the PAN era.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Note: For the number "10", the Tongan form in the table is part of the word {{IPA|/hoŋo-fulu/}} ('ten'). The Hawaiian cognate is part of the word {{IPA|/ana-hulu/}} ('ten days'); however, the more common word for "10" used in counting and quantifying is {{IPA|/ʔumi/}}, a different root.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Application of the lexicostatistical method to the data in the table will show the four languages to be related to one another, with Tagalog having 100% cognacy with PAN, while Hawaiian and Tongan have 100% cognacy with each other, but 90% with Tagalog and PAN. This is because the forms for each number are cognates, except the Hawaiian and Tongan words for the number "1", which are cognate with each other, but not with Tagalog and PAN. When the full set of 200 meanings is used, the percentages will be much lower. For example, Elbert found Hawaiian and Tongan to have 49% (98 ÷ 200) shared cognacy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points out the importance of data-set size for this method, where less data leads to cruder results, while more data leads to better results.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Application of the comparative method will show partly different genetic relationships. It will point out [[sound changes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
# the loss of all PAN word-final consonants in Tongan and Hawaiian;
# [[Raising (phonetics)#Raised and lowered vowels|lowering]] of PAN {{IPA|*u}} to Tagalog {{IPA|[o]}} in word-final syllables;
# retention of PAN {{IPA|*t}} in word-initial and word-medial position in Tagalog and Tongan, but shift to {{IPA|/k/}} in Hawaiian;
# retention of PAN {{IPA|*p}} in Tagalog, but shift to {{IPA|/f/}} in Tongan and {{IPA|/h/}} in Hawaiian.
This method will recognize sound change #1 as a [[Comparative method#Genetically related languages|shared innovation]] of Hawaiian and Tongan. It will also take the Hawaiian and Tongan cognates for "1" as another shared innovation. Due to these exclusively shared features, Hawaiian and Tongan are found to be more closely related to one another than either is to Tagalog or PAN.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The forms in the table show that the Austronesian vowels tend to be relatively stable, while the consonants are relatively volatile. It is also apparent that the Hawaiian words for "3", "5", and "8" have remained essentially unchanged for 6000 years.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
{{for|Hawaiian language history before 1778|#Family and origin}}

===First European contact===

In 1778, British explorer James Cook made Europe's initial, recorded [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] with Hawaiʻi, beginning a new phase in the development of Hawaiian. During the next forty years, the sounds of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (1789), [[Russian language|Russian]] (1804), [[French language|French]] (1816), and [[German language|German]] (1816) arrived in Hawai{{okina}}i via other explorers and businessmen. Hawaiian began to be written for the first time, largely restricted to isolated names and words, and word lists collected by explorers and travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early explorers and merchants who first brought European languages to the Hawaiian islands also took on a few native crew members who brought the Hawaiian language into new territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaiians took these nautical jobs because their traditional way of life changed due to plantations, and although there were not enough of these Hawaiian-speaking explorers to establish any viable speech communities abroad, they still had a noticeable presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vanishing Voices|last=Nettle and Romaine|first=Daniel and Suzanne|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=93–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them, a boy in his teens known as [[Henry Opukahaia|Obookiah]] ({{lang|haw|{{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia}}), had a major impact on the future of the language. He sailed to [[New England]], where he eventually became a student at the [[Foreign Mission School]] in [[Cornwall, Connecticut]]. He inspired New Englanders to support a Christian mission to Hawai{{okina}}i, and provided information on the Hawaiian language to the American missionaries there prior to their departure for Hawai{{okina}}i in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=85–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Folk tales====
Like all natural spoken languages, the Hawaiian language was originally just an oral language. The native people of the Hawaiian language relayed religion, traditions, history, and views of their world through stories that were handed down from generation to generation. One form of storytelling most commonly associated with the Hawaiian islands is [[hula]]. Nathaniel B. Emerson notes that "It kept the communal imagination in living touch with the nation's legendary past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Unwritten Literature of Hawaii: The Sacred Songs of the Hula |last=Emerson |first=Nathaniel B. |publisher=Washington Government Printing Office |year=1909 |isbn= |location= |pages=7 |quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islanders' connection with their stories is argued to be one reason why Captain James Cook received a pleasant welcome. Marshall Sahlins has observed that Hawaiian folktales began bearing similar content to those of the Western world in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Islands of History |last=Sahlins |first=Marshall |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues this was caused by the timing of Captain Cook's arrival, which was coincidentally when the indigenous Hawaiians were celebrating the Makahiki festival. The islanders' story foretold of the god Lono's return at the time of the Makahiki festival.&lt;ref&gt;Kanopy (Firm). (2016). ''Nature Gods and Tricksters of Polynesia.'' San Francisco, California, USA: Ka Streaming. http://[institution].kanopystreaming.com/node/161213&lt;/ref&gt;

===Written Hawaiian===

In 1820, [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]] from [[New England]] arrived in Hawai{{okina}}i. 

[[Adelbert von Chamisso]] might have consulted with a native speaker of Hawaiian in Berlin, [[Germany]], before publishing his grammar of Hawaiian (''{{lang|de|Über die Hawaiische Sprache}}'') in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hawaiian King [[Kalākaua|David Kalākaua]] took a trip around the world, he brought his native language with him. When his wife, [[Queen Kapiolani|Queen Kapi{{okina}}olani]], and his sister, Princess (later Queen) [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], took a trip across North America and on to the British Islands, in 1887, Lili{{okina}}uokalani's composition ''[[Aloha Oe|Aloha {{okina}}Oe]]'' was already a famous song in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=7, 169}} example 138, quoting McGuire&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ka Lama Hawaii.gif|thumb|Headline from May 16, 1834, issue of newspaper published by [[Lorrin Andrews]] and students at [[Lahainaluna]] School]]
In 1834, the first Hawaiian-language newspapers were published by missionaries working with locals. The missionaries also played a significant role in publishing a vocabulary (1836)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Andrews|1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; grammar (1854)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Elbert|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dictionary (1865)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Andrews|1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Hawaiian. Literacy in Hawaiian was widespread among the local population, especially ethnic Hawaiians. Use of the language among the general population might have peaked around 1881. Even so, some people worried, as early as 1854, that the language was "soon destined to extinction."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of Hawaiian===
The decline of the Hawaiian language dates back to a coup that overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and dethroned the existing Hawaiian queen. Thereafter, a law was instituted that banned the Hawaiian language from being taught.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The law cited as banning the Hawaiian language is identified as Act 57, sec. 30 of the 1896 Laws of the Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i:

{{quote|text=The English Language shall be the medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools, provided that where it is desired that another language shall be taught in addition to the English language, such instruction may be authorized by the Department, either by its rules, the curriculum of the school, or by direct order in any particular instance. Any schools that shall not conform to the provisions of this section shall not be recognized by the Department.|source=The Laws of Hawaii, Chapter 10, Section 123&lt;ref name="Congress 1898 p. 1-PA23"&gt;{{cite book | last=Congress | first=United States. | title=Congressional Edition | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | issue=v. 3727 | year=1898 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSxHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA23 | access-date=2017-07-20 | page=1-PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This law established English as the medium of instruction for the government-recognized schools both "public and private". While it did not ban or make illegal the Hawaiian language in other contexts, its implementation in the schools had far-reaching effects. Those who had been pushing for English-only schools took this law as licence to extinguish the native language at the early education level. While the law stopped short of making Hawaiian illegal (it was still the dominant language spoken at the time), many children who spoke Hawaiian at school, including on the playground, were disciplined. This included corporal punishment and going to the home of the offending child to strongly advise them to stop speaking it in their home. Moreover, the law specifically provided for teaching languages "in addition to the English language," reducing Hawaiian to the status of a foreign language, subject to approval by the Department. Hawaiian was not taught initially in any school, including the all-Hawaiian [[Kamehameha Schools]]. This is largely because when these schools were founded, like Kamehameha Schools founded in 1887 (nine years before this law), Hawaiian was being spoken in the home. Once this law was enacted, individuals at these institutions took it upon themselves to enforce a ban on Hawaiian. Beginning in 1900, Mary Kawena Pukui, who was later the co-author of the Hawaiian–English Dictionary, was punished for speaking Hawaiian by being rapped on the forehead, allowed to eat only bread and water for lunch, and denied home visits on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kawena Pukui, ''Nana i ke Kumu, Vol. 2'' p. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winona Beamer]] was expelled from Kamehameha Schools in 1937 for chanting Hawaiian.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Harden, ''Voices of Wisdom: Hawaiian Elders Speak,'' p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===1949 to present===
In 1949, the legislature of the Territory of Hawai{{okina}}i commissioned Mary Pukui and Samuel Elbert to write a new dictionary of Hawaiian, either revising the Andrews-Parker work or starting from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pukui and Elbert took a middle course, using what they could from the Andrews dictionary, but making certain improvements and additions that were more significant than a minor revision. The dictionary they produced, in 1957, introduced an era of gradual increase in attention to the language and culture.

Efforts to promote the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian-language "immersion" schools are now open to children whose families want to reintroduce Hawaiian language for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Warner|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pūnana Leo|{{okina}}Aha Pūnana Leo]]’s Hawaiian language preschools in [[Hilo, Hawaii]], have received international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Today, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian, which was under 0.1% of the statewide population in 1997, has risen to 2,000, out of 24,000 total who are fluent in the language, according to the US 2011 census. On six of the seven permanently inhabited islands, Hawaiian has been largely displaced by English, but on [[Niʻihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]], native speakers of Hawaiian have remained fairly isolated and have continued to use Hawaiian almost exclusively.&lt;ref name="Lyovin 1997 258"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the last native speakers of Hawaiian|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-28/last-native-speakers-hawaiian|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramones|first1=Ikaika|title=Niʻihau family makes rare public address|url=http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/niihau-family-makes-rare-public-address|website=http://hawaiiindependent.net|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niʻihau===
{{cquote|Niʻihau is the only area in the world where Hawaiian is the first language and English is a foreign language. Because of many sufficiently marked variations, Niihau people, when visiting or living in Honolulu, substitute the Oahu dialect for their own&amp;nbsp;– apparently easy to do&amp;nbsp;– saying that otherwise people in Honolulu have trouble understanding them. Niihau people speak very rapidly; many vowels and entire syllables are dropped or whispered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; | author=Samuel Elbert and Mary Pukui | source=''Hawaiian Grammar'' (1979)}}

The isolated island of [[Niʻihau]], located off the southwest coast of [[Kauai]], is the one island where Hawaiian is still spoken as the language of daily life.&lt;ref name="Lyovin 1997 258"/&gt; 
{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=23}} states that "[v]ariations in Hawaiian dialects have not been systematically studied", and that "[t]he dialect of Niʻihau is the most aberrant and the one most in need of study". They recognized that Niʻihauans can speak Hawaiian in substantially different ways. Their statements are based in part on some specific observations made by {{Harvcoltxt|Newbrand|1951}}. (See [[Hawaiian phonology#Phonological processes|Hawaiian phonological processes]])

==Orthography ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hawaii]] --&gt;
{{main article|Hawaiian alphabet}}
Hawaiians had no written language prior to Western contact, except for petroglyph symbols.
The modern Hawaiian alphabet, ''ka pī{{okina}}āpā Hawai{{okina}}i'', is based on the [[Latin script]]. Hawaiian words end ''only''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wight|2005|pp=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in vowels, and every consonant must be followed by a vowel. The Hawaiian alphabetical order has all of the vowels before the consonants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=217, 223}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the following chart.

===Origin===
This writing system was developed by American Protestant missionaries during 1820–1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=98–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first thing they ever printed in Hawai{{okina}}i, on January 7, 1822, and it originally included the consonants ''B, D, R, T,'' and ''V,'' in addition to the current ones (''H, K, L, M, N, P, W''), and it had ''F, G, S, Y'' and ''Z'' for "spelling foreign words". The initial printing also showed the five vowel letters (''A, E, I, O, U'') and seven of the short diphthongs (''AE, AI, AO, AU, EI, EU, OU'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=110}} Plate 7.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, the developers voted to eliminate some of the letters which represented functionally redundant [[allophone]]s (called "interchangeable letters"), enabling the Hawaiian alphabet to approach the ideal state of one-symbol-one-[[phoneme]], and thereby optimizing the ease with which people could teach and learn the reading and writing of Hawaiian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=122–126; 173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, instead of spelling one and the same word as ''pule, bule, pure,'' and ''bure'' (because of interchangeable ''p/b'' and ''l/r''), the word is spelled only as ''pule''.
* Interchangeable B/P. ''B'' was dropped, ''P'' was kept.
* Interchangeable L/R. ''R'' and ''D'' were dropped, ''L'' was kept.
* Interchangeable K/T. ''T'' was dropped, ''K'' was kept.
* Interchangeable V/W. ''V'' was dropped, ''W'' was kept.

However, hundreds of words were very rapidly borrowed into Hawaiian from English, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and Syriac.&lt;ref name="Lyovin 1997 259"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=27, 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these loan words were necessarily [[Hawaiianize]]d, they often retained some of their "non-Hawaiian letters" in their published forms. For example, ''Brazil'' fully [[Hawaiianize]]d is ''Palakila'', but retaining "foreign letters" it is ''Barazila''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is ''Gibraltar'', written as ''Kipalaleka'' or ''Gibaraleta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; While {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}} are not regarded as Hawaiian sounds, {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, and {{IPA|[t]}} were represented in the original alphabet, so the letters (''b'', ''r'', and ''t'') for the latter are not truly "non-Hawaiian" or "foreign", even though their post-1826 use in published matter generally marked words of foreign origin.

===Glottal stop===
{{Main article|ʻokina|l1={{okina}}okina}}
''ʻOkina'' (''{{okina}}oki'' 'cut' + ''-na'' '-ing') is the modern [[Hawaiian name]] for the symbol (a letter) that represents the [[glottal stop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=257, 281, 451}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly known as ''{{okina}}u{{okina}}ina'' ('snap'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

For examples of the {{okina}}okina, consider the Hawaiian words ''Hawai{{okina}}i'' and ''O{{okina}}ahu'' (often simply ''Hawaii'' and ''Oahu'' in English orthography). In Hawaiian, these words can be pronounced {{IPA|[hʌˈʋʌi.ʔi]}} and {{IPA|[oˈʔʌ.hu]}}, and can be written with an {{okina}}okina where the glottal stop is pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=62, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In English, the glottal stop is usually either omitted, or is replaced by a non-phonemic glide, resulting in {{IPA|[hʌˈwai.i]}} or {{IPA|[hʌˈwai.ji]}}, and {{IPA|[oˈa.hu]}} or {{IPA|[oˈwa.hu]}}. Note that the latter two are essentially identical in sound.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elbert &amp; Pukui's ''Hawaiian Grammar'' says "The glottal stop, ‘, is made by closing the glottis or space between the vocal cords, the result being something like the hiatus in English ''oh-oh''."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Hawaiian Grammar |last=Elbert |first=Samuel H. |last2=Pukui |first2=Mary Kawena |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1979 |isbn= |location=Honolulu |pages=10, 14, 58 |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
As early as 1823, the missionaries made some limited use of the apostrophe to represent the glottal stop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they did not make it a letter of the alphabet. In publishing the Hawaiian Bible, they used it to distinguish ''ko{{okina}}u'' ('my') from ''kou'' ('your').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, [[William DeWitt Alexander]] published a grammar of Hawaiian in which he made it clear that the glottal stop (calling it "guttural break") is definitely a true consonant of the Hawaiian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote it using an apostrophe. In 1922, the Andrews-Parker dictionary of Hawaiian made limited use of the opening single quote symbol, called "reversed apostrophe" or "inverse comma", to represent the glottal stop.&lt;ref name="Schütz 1994 139-141"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent dictionaries have preferred to use that symbol. Today, many native speakers of Hawaiian do not bother, in general, to write any symbol for the glottal stop. Its use is advocated mainly among students and teachers of Hawaiian as a second language, and among linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electronic encoding====
[[File:Okina-using-Linux-Libertine.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|»{{lang|haw|ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi|italic=no}}« (Hawaiian: ''Hawaiian language'') within single [[quotation mark|quotes]], font: [[Linux Libertine]]. The [[glyph]] of the two ʻokinas is clearly different from the one of the opening quote.]]
The {{okina}}okina is written in various ways for electronic uses:
* turned comma: '''&lt;span style="font-size:150%"&gt;{{okina}}&lt;/span&gt;''', [[Unicode]] hex value 02BB (decimal 699). This does not always have the correct appearance because it is not supported in some fonts.
* opening single quote, a.k.a. left single quotation mark: '''‘''' [[Unicode]] hex value 2018 (decimal 8216). In many fonts this character looks like either a left-leaning single quotation mark or a quotation mark thicker at the bottom than at the top. In more traditional serif fonts such as [[Times New Roman]] it can look like a very small "6" with the circle filled in black: &lt;span style="font-size:150%"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, Garamond;"&gt;'''‘'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

Because many people who want to write the ʻokina are not familiar with these specific characters and/or do not have access to the appropriate fonts and input and display systems, it is sometimes written with more familiar and readily available characters:
* the ASCII apostrophe '''&lt;span style="font-size:150%"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;''', [[Unicode]] hex value 27 (decimal 39),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiipropertytax.com/ |title=Hawaii County Real Property Tax Office |accessdate=2009-03-03 |quote= This site was designed to provide quick and easy access to real property tax assessment records and maps for properties located in the County of Hawaiʻi and related general information about real property tax procedures. }}&lt;/ref&gt; following the missionary tradition.
* the ASCII grave accent (often called [[grave accent#Computer-related|"backquote" or "backtick"]]) '''&lt;span style="font-size:150%"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pipwerks.com/journal/2009/02/22/hawaiian-diacriticals/ |title=Hawaiian diacriticals |accessdate=2009-03-03 |quote=Over the last decade, there has been an attempt by many well-meaning locals (Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian) to use substitute characters when true diacriticals aren't available. ...

Many of the previously-mentioned well-intentioned folks mistakenly use a backtick to represent an ʻokina, and it drives me absolutely bonkers. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302152356/http://pipwerks.com/journal/2009/02/22/hawaiian-diacriticals/ |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unicode]] hex value 60 (decimal 96)

===Macron===
A modern Hawaiian name for the [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] symbol is ''kahakō'' (''kaha'' 'mark' + ''kō'' 'long').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=109, 110, 156, 478}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly known as ''mekona'' (Hawaiianization of ''macron''). It can be written as a [[diacritic|diacritical mark]] which looks like a hyphen or dash written above a vowel, i.e., ''ā ē ī ō ū'' and ''Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū''. It is used to show that the marked vowel is a "double", or "geminate", or "long" vowel, in phonological terms.&lt;ref name="Elbert 1979 14-15"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Vowel length]])

As early as 1821, at least one of the missionaries, [[Hiram Bingham I|Hiram Bingham]], was using macrons (and [[breve]]s) in making handwritten transcriptions of Hawaiian vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=139, 399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missionaries specifically requested their sponsor in [[Boston]] to send them some type (fonts) with accented vowel characters, including vowels with macrons, but the sponsor made only one response and sent the wrong font size (pica instead of small pica).&lt;ref name="Schütz 1994 139-141"/&gt; Thus, they could not print ā, ē, ī, ō, nor ū (at the right size), even though they wanted to.

===Pronunciation===
Due to extensive [[allophony]], Hawaiian has more than 13 [[phone (phonetics)|phones]]. Although vowel length is phonemic, long vowels are not always pronounced as such,&lt;ref name="Elbert 1979 14-15"/&gt; even though under the rules for assigning stress in Hawaiian, a long vowel will always receive stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=14, 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiian is known for having very few [[consonant]] phonemes&amp;nbsp;– eight: {{IPA|/p, k ~ t, ʔ, h, m, n, l, w ~ v/}}. It is notable that Hawaiian has allophonic variation of {{IPA|[t]}} with {{IPA|[k]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elbert 1979 22-25"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kinney|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Newbrand|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|[w]}} with {{IPA|[v]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in some dialects) {{IPA|[l]}} with {{IPA|[n]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IPA|[t]}}–{{IPA|[k]}} variation is quite unusual among the world's languages, and is likely a product both of the small number of consonants in Hawaiian, and the recent shift of historical *t to modern {{IPA|[t]}}–{{IPA|[k]}}, after historical *k had shifted to {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. In some dialects, {{IPA|/ʔ/}} remains as {{IPA|[k]}} in some words. These variations are largely free, though there are conditioning factors. {{IPA|/l/}} tends to {{IPA|[n]}} especially in words with both {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, such as in the island name ''Lāna{{okina}}i'' ({{IPA|[laːˈnɐʔi]}}–{{IPA|[naːˈnɐʔi]}}), though this is not always the case: ''{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele'' or ''{{okina}}ene{{okina}}ene'' "black". The {{IPA|[k]}} allophone is almost universal at the beginnings of words, whereas {{IPA|[t]}} is most common before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. {{IPA|[v]}} is also the norm after {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas {{IPA|[w]}} is usual after {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. After {{IPA|/a/}} and initially, however, {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[v]}} are in free variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A consonant occurs only before a vowel; thus two consonants never occur in succession and a syllable always ends with a vowel".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Vowels===
Hawaiian has five [[Vowel length|short]] and five [[Vowel length|long]] [[vowel]]s, plus [[diphthong]]s.

====Monophthongs====

Hawaiian has five pure vowels.  The short vowels are {{IPA|/u, i, o, e, a/}}, and the long vowels, if they are considered separate phonemes rather than simply sequences of like vowels, are {{IPA|/uː, iː, oː, eː, aː/}}. When stressed, short {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} have been described as becoming {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, while when unstressed they are {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ə]}} {{Citation needed|reason=to back up assertion|date=September 2018}}. Parker Jones (2017), however, did not find a reduction of /a/ to {{IPA|[ə]}} in the phonetic analysis of a young speaker from [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo, Hawaiʻi]]; so there is at least some variation in how /a/ is realised.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=ʻŌiwi Parker|date=2018/04|title=Hawaiian|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-phonetic-association/article/hawaiian/9F2B300BCF6EE97EA7E4437C5FCECB57|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=103–115|doi=10.1017/S0025100316000438|issn=0025-1003}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/e/}} also tends to become {{IPA|[ɛ]}} next to {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, and another {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, as in ''Pele'' {{IPA|[pɛlɛ]}}. Some grammatical particles vary between short and long vowels. These include ''a'' and ''o'' "of", ''ma'' "at", ''na'' and ''no'' "for". Between a back vowel {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} and a following non-back vowel ({{IPA|/a e i/}}), there is an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|[w]}}, which is generally not written. Between a front vowel {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/i/}} and a following non-front vowel ({{IPA|/a o u/}}), there is an [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|[j]}} (a ''y'' sound), which is never written.

The short-vowel diphthongs are {{IPA|/iu, ou, oi, eu, ei, au, ai, ao, ae/}}. In all except perhaps {{IPA|/iu/}}, these are [[falling diphthong]]s. However, they are not as tightly bound as the diphthongs of English, and may be considered vowel sequences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (The second vowel in such sequences may receive the stress, but in such cases it is not counted as a diphthong.) In fast speech, {{IPA|/ai/}} tends to {{IPA|[ei]}} and {{IPA|/au/}} tends to {{IPA|[ou]}}, conflating these diphthongs with {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}}.

There are only a limited number of vowels which may follow long vowels, and some authors treat these sequences as diphthongs as well: {{IPA|/oːu, eːi, aːu, aːi, aːo, aːe/}}.

===Phonotactics===
[[Hawaiian phonology#Phonotactics|Hawaiian syllable structure]] is (C)V. All CV syllables occur except for ''wū'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986}} see Hawaiian headwords.&lt;/ref&gt; ''wu'' occurs only in two words borrowed from English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=29 ''4n''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown by Schütz,&lt;ref name="Lyovin 1997 259"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawaiian phonology#Stress|Hawaiian word-stress]] is predictable in words of one to four syllables, but not in words of five or more syllables. [[Hawaiian phonology#Phonological processes|Hawaiian phonological processes]] include palatalization and deletion of consonants, as well as raising, diphthongization, deletion, and compensatory lengthening of vowels.&lt;ref name="Elbert 1979 22-25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kinney|1956}})&lt;/ref&gt; Phonological reduction (or "decay") of consonant phonemes during the historical development of the language has resulted in the phonemic glottal stop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Louis Stevenson]], ''In the South Seas'', 1891 page 12, quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Schütz|1994|pp=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter 1996 373"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimate loss ([[deletion (phonology)|deletion]]) of intervocalic consonant phonemes has resulted in Hawaiian long vowels and diphthongs.&lt;ref name="Carter 1996 373"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pp=164, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=107–108}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Hawaiian grammar}}
Hawaiian is an [[analytic language]] with [[verb–subject–object]] word order. While there is no use of [[inflection]] for verbs, in Hawaiian, like other [[Austronesian personal pronouns]],  [[declension]] is found in the differentiation between a- and o-class [[genitive case]] personal pronouns in order to indicate [[inalienable possession]] in a binary possessive class system. Also like many Austronesian languages, Hawaiian pronouns employ separate words for [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive we]] (clusivity), and distinguish [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. The grammatical function of verbs is marked by adjacent [[grammatical particle|particles]] (short words) and by their relative positions, that indicate [[tense–aspect–mood]].

Some examples of verb phrase patterns:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ''ua'' {{sc|verb}} – [[perfective]]
* ''e'' {{sc|verb}} ''ana'' – [[imperfective]]
* ''ke'' {{sc|verb}} ''nei'' – [[present progressive]]
* ''e'' {{sc|verb}} – [[imperative mood|imperative]]
* ''mai'' {{sc|verb}} – negative imperative
* ''i'' {{sc|verb}} – purposive
* ''ke'' {{sc|verb}} – infinitive

Nouns can be marked with [[article (grammar)|articles]]:
* ''ka honu'' (the turtle)
* ''nā honu'' (the turtles)
* ''ka hale'' (the house)
* ''ke kanaka'' (the person)

''ka'' and ''ke'' are singular definite articles. ''ke'' is used before words beginning with a-, e-, o- and k-, and with some words beginning {{okina}}- and p-. ''ka'' is used in all other cases. ''nā'' is the plural definite article.

To show part of a group, the word ''kekahi'' is used. To show a bigger part, ''mau'' is inserted to pluralize the subject.

Examples:
* ''kekahi pipi'' (one of the cows)
* ''kekahi mau pipi'' (some of the cows)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3105">In [[pharmacology]], an '''indirect agonist''' or '''indirect-acting agonist''' is a substance that enhances the release or action of an [[endogenous]] [[neurotransmitter]] but has no specific [[agonist]] activity at the neurotransmitter [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] itself. Indirect agonists work through varying mechanisms to achieve their effects, including transporter blockade, induction of transmitter release, and inhibition of transmitter breakdown.

==Mechanisms of indirect agonism==

===Reuptake inhibition===
{{main|Reuptake inhibition}}
[[Cocaine]] is a [[monoamine transporter]] blocker and, thus, an indirect agonist of [[dopamine receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz JL, Izenwasser S, Terry P |title=Relationships among dopamine transporter affinities and cocaine-like discriminative-stimulus effects |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=90–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10663422 |doi=10.1007/s002130050029}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cocaine]] binds the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), blocking the protein's ability to uptake [[dopamine]] from the [[synaptic cleft]] and also blocking DAT from terminating [[dopamine]] signaling. Blockage of DAT increases the [[extracellular]] concentration of [[dopamine]], therefore increasing the amount of [[dopamine]] receptor binding and signaling.

[[Dipyridamole]] inhibits reuptake of [[adenosine]], resulting in greater extracellular concentrations of [[adenosine]]. [[Dipyridamole]] also inhibits the [[enzyme]] [[adenosine deaminase]], the [[enzyme]] that catalyzes the breakdown of [[adenosine]].

===Evoking transmitter release===
{{main|Transporter reversal|Releasing agent}}
[[Fenfluramine]] is an indirect agonist of [[serotonin receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang YX, Bowersox SS, Pettus M, Gao D |title=Antinociceptive properties of [[fenfluramine]], a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in a rat model of neuropathy |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. |volume=291 |issue=3 |pages=1008–16 |year=1999 |pmid=10565818 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fenfluramine]] binds to the [[serotonin transporter]], blocking [[serotonin]] reuptake. However, [[fenfluramine]] also acts to induce non-[[exocytosis|exocytotic]] [[serotonin]] release; in a mechanism similar to that of [[methamphetamine]] in [[dopamine]] neurons, [[fenfluramine]] binds to [[VMAT2]], disrupting the compartmentalization of [[serotonin]] into [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]] and increasing the concentration of [[cytoplasm]]ic [[serotonin]] available for drug-induced release.&lt;ref name="Baumann"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baumann MH, Ayestas MA, Dersch CM, Partilla JS, Rothman RB |title=Serotonin transporters, serotonin release, and the mechanism of fenfluramine neurotoxicity |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=914 |issue= 1|pages=172–86 |year=2000 |pmid=11085319 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb05194.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">'''Involution''' refers to the shrinking or return of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to a former size. At a cellular level, involution is characterized by the process of [[proteolysis]] of the [[basement membrane]] (basal lamina), leading to epithelial regression and [[apoptosis]], with accompanying [[stromal cell|stromal]] [[fibrosis]]. The consequent reduction in cell number and reorganization of stromal tissue leads to the reduction in the size of the organ.

==Examples==

===Thymus===
The [[thymus]] continues to grow between [[birth]] and [[puberty]] and then begins to [[atrophy]], a process directed by the high levels of circulating [[sex hormones]]. Proportional to thymic size, thymic activity ([[T cell]] output) is most active before [[puberty]]. Upon atrophy, the size and activity are dramatically reduced, and the organ is primarily replaced with [[fat]]. The atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of [[sex hormones]], and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=J.

===Uterus===
Involution is the process by which the [[uterus]] is transformed from pregnant to non-pregnant state. This period is characterized by the restoration of ovarian function in order to prepare the body for a new pregnancy. It is a physiological process occurring after [[parturition]]; the [[hypertrophy]] of the uterus has to be undone since it does not need to house the [[fetus]] anymore. This process is primarily due to the hormone [[oxytocin]]. The completion of this period is defined as when the diameter of the uterus returns to the size it is normally during a woman's menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4629562 | pmid=26623357 | volume=5 | issue=1 | title=Uterine involution and progesterone level during the postpartum period in Barbary ewes in north Libya | year=2015 | author=Medan MS, El-Daek T | journal=Open Vet J | pages=18–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammary gland===
During [[pregnancy]] until after birth, [[mammary glands]] grow steadily to a size required for optimal milk production. At the end of [[breastfeeding]], the number of cells in the mammary gland becomes reduced until approximately the same number is reached as before the start of pregnancy.

'''James Rodney Schlesinger''' (February 15, 1929&amp;nbsp;– March 27, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] and [[public servant]] who was best known for serving as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] from 1973 to 1975 under Presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. He became America's first [[Secretary of Energy]] under [[Jimmy Carter]].

While Secretary of Defense, he opposed amnesty for draft resisters and pressed for development of more sophisticated [[nuclear weapon]] systems. Additionally, his support for the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] and the lightweight fighter program (later the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]) helped ensure that they were carried to completion.

==Early life and career==
James Rodney Schlesinger was born in [[New York City]], the son of Jewish parents, Rhea Lillian (née Rogen) and Julius Schlesinger.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc9wBsImOIC&amp;pg=PA199 Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency - W. Thomas Smith - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] emigrant from what was then part of the [[Russian Empire]] and his father's family was from Austria. He converted to [[Lutheranism]] in his early 20s. Schlesinger was educated at the [[Horace Mann School]] and [[Harvard University]], where he earned a B.A. (1950), M.A. (1952), and Ph.D. (1956) in economics. Between 1955 and 1963 he taught economics at the [[University of Virginia]] and in 1960 published ''The Political Economy of National Security.'' In 1963, he moved to the [[RAND Corporation]], where he worked until 1969, in the later years as director of strategic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James R. Schlesinger Papers A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress|accessdate=October 26, 2016|url=http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2013/ms013143.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nixon Administration===
[[File:SchlesingerNixon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Then Chairman Schlesinger with Nixon in September 1971]]
In 1969, Schlesinger joined the Nixon administration as assistant director of the [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitre.org/about/bot/schlesinger.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030607070526/http://www.mitre.org/about/bot/schlesinger.html |archivedate=June  7, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; devoting most of his time to Defense matters. In 1971, President Nixon appointed Schlesinger a member of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) and designated him as chairman. Serving in this position for about a year and a half, Schlesinger instituted extensive organizational and management changes in an effort to improve the AEC's regulatory performance. On February 2, 1973, he became [[Director of Central Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James R. Schlesinger Papers A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress|accessdate=October 26, 2016|url=http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2013/ms013143.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretary of Defense (1973–1975)==
Schlesinger left the CIA to become Secretary of Defense on July 2, aged 44. As a university professor, researcher at Rand, and government official in three agencies, he had acquired an impressive resume in national security affairs.

===Nuclear strategy===
Shortly after assuming office, Schlesinger outlined the basic objectives that would guide his administration: maintain a "strong defense establishment";  "assure the military balance so necessary to deterrence and a more enduring peace"; obtain for members of the military "the respect, dignity and support that are their due"; assume "an . . . obligation to use our citizens' resources wisely"; and "become increasingly competitive with potential adversaries.... [W]e must not be forced out of the market on land, at sea, or in the air. [[Eli Whitney]] belongs to us, not to our competitors." In particular, Schlesinger saw a need in the post-Vietnam era to restore the morale and prestige of the military services; modernize strategic doctrine and programs; step up research and development; and shore up a DoD budget that had been declining since 1968.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/ArticleView/tabid/8347/Article/571289/james-r-schlesinger.aspx|title=James R. Schlesinger|publisher=Historical Office, Office Of The Secretary Of Defense|accessdate=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyzing strategy, Schlesinger maintained that the theory and practice of the 1950s and 1960s had been overtaken by events, particularly the rise of the [[Soviet Union]] to virtual nuclear parity with the United States and the effect this development had on the concept of deterrence. Schlesinger believed that "deterrence is not a substitute for defense; defense capabilities, representing the potential for effective counteraction, are the essential condition of deterrence." {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} He had grave doubts about the assured destruction strategy, which relied on massive nuclear attacks against an enemy's urban-industrial areas. Credible strategic nuclear deterrence, the secretary felt, depended on fulfilling several conditions: maintaining essential equivalence with the Soviet Union in force effectiveness; maintaining a highly survivable force that could be withheld or targeted against an enemy's economic base in order to deter coercive or desperation attacks against U.S. population or economic targets; establishing a fast-response force that could act to deter additional enemy attacks; and establishing a range of capabilities sufficient to convince all nations that the United States was equal to its strongest competitors.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

To meet these needs, Schlesinger built on existing ideas in developing a flexible response nuclear strategy, which, with the President's approval, he made public by early 1974. The United States, Schlesinger said, needed the ability, in the event of a nuclear attack, to respond so as to "limit the chances of uncontrolled escalation" and "hit meaningful targets" without causing widespread collateral damage. The nation's assured destruction force would be withheld in the hope that the enemy would not attack U.S. cities. In rejecting assured destruction, Schlesinger quoted President Nixon: "Should a President, in the event of a nuclear attack, be left with the single option of ordering the mass destruction of enemy civilians, in the face of the certainty that it would be followed by the mass slaughter of Americans?"&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

With this approach, Schlesinger moved to a partial [[counterforce]] policy, emphasizing Soviet military targets such as [[ICBM]] missile installations, avoiding initial attacks on population centers, and minimizing unintended collateral damage. He explicitly disavowed any intention to acquire a destabilizing first-strike capability against the USSR. But he wanted "an offensive capability of such size and composition that all will perceive it as in overall balance with the strategic forces of any potential opponent."&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

Schlesinger devoted much attention to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]], citing the need to strengthen its conventional capabilities. He rejected the old assumption that NATO did not need a direct counter to Warsaw Pact conventional forces because it could rely on tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, noting that the approximate nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviets in the 1970s made this stand inappropriate. He rejected the argument that NATO could not afford a conventional counterweight to Warsaw Pact forces. In his discussions with NATO leaders, Schlesinger promoted the concept of burden-sharing, stressing the troubles that the United States faced in the mid-1970s because of an unfavorable balance of international payments. He urged qualitative improvements in NATO forces, including equipment standardization, and an increase in defense spending by NATO governments of up to five percent of their gross national product.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

===Yom Kippur War and Cyprus crisis===
Schlesinger had an abiding interest in strategic theory, but he also had to deal with a succession of immediate crises that tested his administrative and political skills. In October 1973, three months after he took office, Arab countries launched a surprise attack on Israel and started the [[Yom Kippur War]]. A few days after the war started, with Israel not faring as well as expected militarily, the Soviets resupplying some Arab countries and the Israeli government having authorized the use and assembly of nuclear weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Farr, Warner D. [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cpc-pubs/farr.htm "The Third Temple's Holy of Holies: Israel's Nuclear Weapons"], Counterproliferation Paper No. 2, USAF Counterproliferation Center, [[Air War College]], September 1999&lt;/ref&gt; the United States began an [[Operation Nickel Grass|overt operation]] to [[airlift]] materiel to Israel. As Schlesinger explained, the initial U.S. policy to avoid direct involvement rested on the assumption that Israel would win quickly. But when it became clear that the Israelis faced more formidable military forces than anticipated, and could not meet their own resupply arrangements, the United States took up the burden. Schlesinger rejected charges that the Defense Department delayed the resupply effort to avoid irritating the Arab states and that he had had a serious disagreement over this matter with Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]. Eventually the combatants agreed to a cease-fire, but not before the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on the Arab side and the United States declared a higher level worldwide alert of its forces.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

Another crisis flared in July 1974 within the NATO alliance when Turkish forces, concerned about the long-term lack of safety for the minority Turkish community, invaded [[Cyprus]] after the Cypriot National Guard, supported by the government of [[Greece]], overthrew President [[Archbishop Makarios]]. When the fighting stopped, the Turks held the northern portion of country and about 40 percent of the island. Turkey's military action caused controversy in the United States, because of protests and lobbying by supporters of the Greek Cypriot side and, officially, because Turkish forces used some U.S.-supplied military equipment intended solely for NATO purposes.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

He felt the Turks had overstepped the bounds of legitimate NATO interests in Cyprus and suggested that the United States might have to reexamine its military aid program to [[Turkey]]. During this time, President Gerald R. Ford had succeeded Nixon after his resignation; eventually Ford and Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] made it clear with two presidential vetoes that they favored continued military assistance to Turkey as a valued NATO ally, but Congress overrode both vetoes and in December 1974 prohibited such aid, which instituted an arms embargo that lasted five years.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

===Indochina===
The last phase of the [[Indochina]] conflict occurred during Schlesinger's tenure. Although all U.S. combat forces had left [[South Vietnam]] in the spring of 1973, the United States continued to maintain a military presence in other areas of Southeast Asia. Some senators criticized Schlesinger and questioned him sharply during his confirmation hearings in June 1973 after he stated that he would recommend resumption of U.S. bombing in [[North Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam. However, when the North Vietnamese did begin an offensive early in 1975, the United States could do little to help the South Vietnamese, who collapsed completely as the North Vietnamese entered Saigon in late April. Schlesinger announced early in the morning of 29 April 1975 the evacuation from [[Saigon]] by [[helicopter]] of the last U.S. diplomatic, military, and civilian personnel.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

Only one other notable event remained in the Indochina drama. In May 1975 [[Khmer Rouge]] forces boarded and captured the crew of the ''[[Mayaguez incident|Mayaguez]]'', an unarmed U.S.-registered freighter. The United States bombarded military and fuel installations on the Cambodian mainland while Marines landed by helicopter on an offshore island to rescue the crew. The 39 captives were retrieved, but the operation cost the lives of 41 U.S. military personnel. Nevertheless, the majority of the American people seemed to approve of the administration's decisive action.&lt;ref name="schleshistory"/&gt;

===Defense budget===
Unsurprisingly, given his determination to build up U.S. strategic and conventional forces, Schlesinger devoted much time and effort to the Defense budget. Even before becoming secretary, in a speech in San Francisco in September 1972, he warned that it was time "to call a halt to the self-defeating game of cutting defense outlays, this process, that seems to have become addictive, of chopping away year after year." Shortly after he took office, he complained about "the post-war follies" of Defense budget-cutting. Later he outlined the facts about the DoD budget: In real terms it had been reduced by one-third since FY 1968; it was one-eighth below the pre-[[Vietnam War]] FY 1964 budget; purchases of equipment, consumables, and R&amp;D were down 45 percent from the wartime peak and about $10 billion in constant dollars below the prewar level; Defense now absorbed about 6 percent of the gross national product, the lowest percentage since before the Korean War; military manpower was at the lowest point since before the [[Korean War]]; and Defense spending amounted to about 17 percent of total national expenditures, the lowest since before the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. Armed with these statistics, and alarmed by continuing Soviet weapon advances, Schlesinger became a vigorous advocate of larger DoD budgets. But he had little success. For FY 1975, Congress provided TOA of $86.1 billion, compared with $81.6 billion in FY 1974; for FY 1976, the amount was $95.6 billion, an increase of 3.4 percent, but in real terms slightly less than it had been in FY 1955.

===Dismissal as Secretary of Defense===
Schlesinger's insistence on higher defense budgets, his disagreements within the administration and with Congress on this issue, and his differences with Secretary of State Kissinger all contributed to his dismissal from office by President Ford in November 1975. Schlesinger's legacy included the development of the close-air support aircraft the A-10, and the lightweight F-16 fighter. Kissinger strongly supported the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] process, while Schlesinger wanted assurances that arms control agreements would not put the United States in a strategic position inferior to the Soviet Union. The secretary's harsh criticism of some congressional leaders dismayed President Ford, who was more willing than Schlesinger to compromise on the Defense budget. On 2 November 1975, the president dismissed Schlesinger and made other important personnel changes. Kissinger lost his position as special assistant to the President for national security affairs but remained as secretary of state. Schlesinger left office on 19 November 1975, explaining his departure in terms of his budgetary differences with the White House.

The unreported, but important, main reason behind Schlesinger's dismissal, though, was his insubordination toward President Ford.  During the [[Mayaguez incident|''Mayaguez'' incident]], Ford ordered several retaliatory strikes against [[Cambodia]]. Schlesinger told Ford the first strike was carried out, but Ford later learned that Schlesinger, who disagreed with the order, had none of them carried out. According to [[Bob Woodward]]'s 1999 book, ''[[Shadow (Bob Woodward book)|Shadow]]'', Ford let the incident go, but when Schlesinger committed further insubordination on other matters, Ford finally fired him. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Woodward observes, "The United States had just lost a war for the first time. . . . That the president and the secretary of defense could not agree on who was in charge was appalling.. . . [This] unpublicized breakdown in the military chain of command was ... perhaps the most significant scandal of the Ford presidency."  Schlesinger had also disobeyed Ford when told to send as many military aircraft as possible to evacuate South Vietnam.  Schlesinger disagreed with doing so and didn't send the aircraft.  Woodward says that an elected president, which Ford was not, would never have tolerated the insubordination.

In spite of the controversy surrounding both his tenure and dismissal, Schlesinger was by most accounts an able secretary of defense. A serious and perceptive thinker on nuclear strategy, he was determined that the United States not fall seriously behind the Soviet Union in conventional and nuclear forces and devoted himself to modernization of defense policies and programs. He got along well with the military leadership because he proposed to give them more resources, consulted with them regularly, and shared many of their views. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Because he was a forthright speaker who could be blunt in his opinions and did not enjoy the personal rapport with legislators that prior Secretary of Defense [[Melvin Laird]] had, his relations with Congress were often strained. A majority of its members may have approved Schlesinger's strategic plans, but they kept a tight rein on the money for his programs. As for the Pentagon bureaucracy, Schlesinger generally left its management to Deputy Secretary of Defense [[William P. Clements]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Secretary of Energy (1977-1979)==
[[File:SchlesingerEnergySec.jpg|thumb|left|Schlesinger while serving as Energy Secretary]]
After leaving the Pentagon, Schlesinger wrote and spoke forcefully about national security issues, especially the Soviet threat and the need for the United States to maintain adequate defenses. When [[Jimmy Carter]] became President in January 1977 he appointed Schlesinger, a Republican, as his special adviser on energy&lt;ref name=Degregorio&gt;{{cite book|last=Degregorio|first=William|title=The Complete Book of U. S. Presidents|page=626|publisher=Wings Books|location=New York|year=2001|isbn= 978-0-517-18353-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently as the first [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]]&lt;ref name=Degregorio/&gt; in October 1977. According to one account, "Schlesinger impressed candidate Jimmy Carter with his brains, his high-level experience... and with secrets regarding the defense spending vacillations of his old boss, Ford, just in time for the presidential debates."&lt;ref name=Glastris&gt;[[Paul Glastris|Glastris, Paul]] [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_v19/ai_5264889/pg_2/?tag=content;col1 The powers that shouldn't be; five Washington insiders the next Democratic president shouldn't hire], ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'' (October 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Energy Secretary, Schlesinger launched the Department's [[Carbon Dioxide Effects and Assessment Program]] shortly after the creation of that department in 1977. Secretary Schlesinger also oversaw the integration of the energy powers of more than 50 agencies, such as the [[Federal Energy Administration]] and the [[Federal Power Commission]].&lt;ref name=Degregorio/&gt; In July 1979, Carter replaced him as part of a broader Cabinet shakeup.&lt;ref name=Degregorio/&gt; According to journalist [[Paul Glastris]], "Carter fired Schlesinger in 1979 in part for the same reason Gerald Ford had—he was unbearably arrogant and impatient with lesser minds who disagreed with him, and hence inept at dealing with Congress."&lt;ref name=Glastris/&gt;

==Post-government activities==
[[File:SecretarySchlesinger.jpg|thumb|right|Schlesinger at the Pentagon in 2004, as Chairman of the Independent Panel to Review Department of Defense Detention Operations]]
After leaving the Energy Department, Schlesinger resumed his writing and speaking career, including the 1994 lecture at the [[Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations]] at [[Old Dominion University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waldo Family Lecture Series Digital Collection|url=http://dc.lib.odu.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/waldoseries|website=Old Dominion University|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was employed as a senior adviser to [[Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc.]], of [[New York City]].

On February 8, 2002, he appeared at a hearing before the [[Senate Governmental Affairs Committee]] in support of the creation of a commission to investigate the [[9/11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Defense Secretary Offers Insight Into 9/11 Commission Inquiry|accessdate=October 26, 2016|url=https://cryptome.org/911-insight.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2002 he was appointed by [[United States|U.S.]] President [[George W. Bush]] to the [[Homeland Security Advisory Council]]. He also served as a consultant to the [[United States Department of Defense]], and was a member of the [[Defense Policy Board]].

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the [[White House]] of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. On January 31, 2006 he was appointed by the Secretary of State to be a member of the Arms Control and Nonproliferation Advisory Board.

On June 5, 2008, Defense Secretary Robert Gates appointed Schlesinger to head a task force to ensure the "highest levels" of control over nuclear weapons. The purpose of the review was to prevent a repeat of recent incidents where control was lost over components of nuclear weapons, and even over nuclear weapons themselves. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Schlesinger was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of [[MITRE|The MITRE Corporation]], having served on it from 1985 until his death in 2014; on the advisory board of ''[[The National Interest]]''; a Director of [[BNFL, Inc.]], [[Peabody Energy]], [[Sandia Corporation]], [[Seven Seas Petroleum Company]], Chairman of the Executive Committee of [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum|The Nixon Center]]. He was also on the Advisory Board of GeoSynFuels, LLC.  Schlesinger penned a number of opinion pieces on [[global warming]], expressing a strongly skeptical position. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Peak oil===
Schlesinger raised awareness of the [[peak oil]] issue and supports facing it. In the keynote speech at a 2007 conference hosted by the [[Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas|Association for the Study of Peak Oil]] in Cork, Schlesinger said that oil industry executives now privately concede that the world faces an imminent oil production peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/34868 Peak oil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703111257/http://www.energybulletin.net/node/34868 |date=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidstrahan.com/blog/?p=42 We are all peakists now – Schlesinger | David Strahan | Articles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2010 ASPO-USA keynote speech, Schlesinger observed that the [[Peak Oil]] debate was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/16259773|title=The Peak Oil Debate is Over|author=Dr. James Schlesinger|year=2010|publisher=ASPO-USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned of political inaction as a major hindrance, like those in [[Pompeii]] before the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].

On June 5, 2008, U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] announced that he had asked Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the US DoD following the [[2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident]]. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board.&lt;ref&gt;US DoD, "DoD News Briefing with Secretary Gates from the Pentagon", June 5, 2008, ''Military Times'', "Moseley and Wynne forced out", Shanker, "2 Leaders Ousted From Air Force in Atomic Errors".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1954, Schlesinger married Rachel Line Mellinger (February 27, 1930 – October 11, 1995); they had eight children: Cora (1955), Charles (1956), Ann (1958), William (1959), Emily (1961), Thomas (1964), Clara (1966) and James (1970).

Though raised in a Jewish household, Schlesinger converted to [[Lutheranism]] as an adult.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|title=James R. Schlesinger, Willful Aide To Three Presidents, Is Dead at 85|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/us/politics/james-r-schlesinger-cold-war-hard-liner-dies-at-85.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Schlesinger was an accomplished violinist and board member of the Arlington Symphony. In the early 1990s, she was a leader in the fundraising effort to create a premier performing arts center on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. She died from cancer before seeing the center's completion. After her death, Dr. Schlesinger donated $1 million to have the center named in his wife's memory.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  The Rachel M. Schlesinger Concert Hall and Arts Center at [[Northern Virginia Community College]], Alexandria Campus opened in September, 2001. It is an up-to-date building that features the Mary Baker Collier Theatre, the Margaret W. and Joseph L. Fisher Art Gallery, the Wachovia Forum and Seminar Room spaces. Clients of the Schlesinger Center include the Alexandria Symphony, the [[United States Marine Band]], "The President's Own", and the U.S. Marine Chamber Orchestra, the [[United States Army Band]], "Pershing's Own", and the U.S. Army Strings, the [[United States Navy Band]], the New Dominion Chorale, the American Balalaika Symphony, Festivals of Music, various ethnic groups and many others.

{{redirect|Koiné||Koine (disambiguation)}}
[[File:William Faden. Composite Mediterranean. 1785.I.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Despite their different dialects, koineization in [[Ancient Greece]] enabled the various [[Ancient Greece#Politics and society|Greek political]] entities to maintain commercial and diplomatic relations.]]
In [[linguistics]], a '''koiné language''', '''koiné dialect''', or simply '''koiné''' ([[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:κοινή|κοινή]], "common [language]") is a [[standard language]] or [[dialect]] that has arisen as a result of contact between two or more mutually intelligible varieties ([[dialects]]) of the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Weinreich (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singler (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since speakers already understood one another from before the advent of the koiné, the ''koineization'' process is not as drastic as [[pidgin]]ization and [[creole language|creolization]]. Unlike pidginization and creolization, there is no "target" within Koine formation. It involves continuity in that speakers do not need to abandon their own linguistic varieties.

Normal [[social influence|influence]] between neighbouring dialects is not regarded as koineization. A koiné variety emerges as a new spoken variety in addition to the originating dialects; it does not change any existing dialect. That separates koineization from normal evolution of dialects.&lt;ref&gt;

The term ''koine'' (meaning "common" in Greek) was first used to refer to the form of [[Greek language|Greek]] used as a [[lingua franca]] during the [[Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, 1985, p.358;  Bubenik, 1993, Dialect contact and koineization: the case of Hellenistic Greek.&lt;/ref&gt; It arose as a mixed vernacular among ordinary people in the [[Peiraieus]], the seaport of [[Athens]], which was inhabited by [[Greek people|Greeks]] from different parts of the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1960, p.34, quoted in Siegel, 1985, p.358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1960, The Greek language. Cambridge: W. Heffer &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through koineization, new dialect varieties are brought about as a result of contact between speakers of [[mutually intelligible]] varieties of that [[language]]. Koineization is a particular case of dialect contact and how it typically occurs in new [[human settlement|settlements]] to which people have [[Human migration|migrated]] from different parts of a single language area. Koineization typically takes two or three generations to complete, though it can be achievable within the first generation.&lt;ref&gt;Labov (1972), Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: Pennsylvania University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language variation is systematic, in that it can be related to [[social division]]s within a community, such as class and [[gender]]. Change can be shown to originate with particular social groups based on these divisions. However, a number of linguists have recently argued that language change lies with the individual.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milroy, 1992, Linguistic variation and change. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Croft, 2000, Explaining language change: An evolutionary approach. Harlow: 
Longman. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
[[Linguist]] Paul Kerswill identifies two types of koinés: regional and immigrant:&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

*A ''regional koiné'' is formed when a strong regional dialect comes into contact with dialects of speakers who move into the region. Often the use of the koiné spreads beyond the region where it was formed. The original koiné was of the regional variety. It was based on the [[Attic dialect|Attic]] Greek dialect that underwent a koineization process when it came into contact with other Greek dialects spoken in the Athenian seaport [[Piraeus]] and ultimately became the [[lingua franca]] of the Hellenistic world.
*An ''immigrant koiné'' is a new dialect that forms in a community settled by immigrants speaking two or more mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. In the late 19th and early 20th century, speakers of a variety of [[Hindi]] dialects were conscripted to serve as [[Indentured servant|indentured laborers]] throughout the [[colonialism|colonial]] world. Speakers of these dialects came together in varying proportions under different conditions and developed distinctive Hindi koinés. These Hindi/[[Bhojpuri]] dialects are found in [[Fiji]], [[Guyana]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Suriname]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

== Koineization ==
Kerswill also examines the [[Norwegian dialects]] that emerged in two towns which were located around smelters built at the head of the [[Sørfjorden, Hardanger|Sørfjord]] branch of the [[Hardangerfjord]] in the mid-twentieth century. The towns, [[Odda (town)|Odda]] and [[Tyssedal]], both drew migrants from different parts of Norway. The workers in Odda came predominantly (86%) from [[western Norway]]. In Tyssedal only about one-third came from western Norway; a third came from [[eastern Norway]]; and the rest from other parts of the country. The dialects that evolved in these two towns were thus very different from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Arends, Muysken &amp; Smith (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Trudgill]] sees three processes in operation during what Mesthrie calls the accommodation period: mixing, [[dialect levelling|levelling]] and simplification. The processes of leveling and simplification are both dependent on a wide range of factors, including the differential prestige related of the contributing dialects, [[socio-political]] contexts in which the new dialect develops, and individual networks of adults involved in the accommodation process. Additionally, both Trudgill and Mesthrie also comment on the process of reallocation, in which features that have been retained from contributing dialects take on new meanings or functions within the new dialect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_APiCS/files/abstracts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Trudgill posits a multi-generational model of the development of a koiné. During the first (i.e., immigrant) [[generation]], the speakers of the contributing dialects mix, and there is some leveling. The first native-born generation of speakers continues the leveling process. However, in the instances Trudgill was able to document (e.g., first generation speakers of Tyssedal and Odda dialects of Norwegian), the speech of this generation still reflected considerable variability in use of marked forms, both between speakers and in the repertoire of individual speakers.

It is the third generation that focuses the variations and stabilizes the dialect. Trudgill admits that there are cases where the focusing can take place in the first generation of native-born speakers and also instances where it might be in the fourth or even later generations. The dialect in its emerging state, a state marked by heterogeneity of forms, Trudgill calls ''interdialect'', often called an [[interlanguage]] in other dialect studies.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh (2002:56–57)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koine languages and dialects===

Dialects:

* '''[[Australian English]]''', a dialect which initially emerged as a mixture of eighteenth century [[Cockney English]] and [[Irish English]], and was subsequently influenced to some degree by [[Received Pronunciation]] in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Kerswill, P. (2002). Koineization and accommodation. In J. K. Chambers, P. Trudgill &amp; N. Schilling-Estes (Eds.), The handbook of language variation and change (pp. 669–702). Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Central Asian Korean]]''' ('''[[Koryo-mar]]'''), based on [[Yukjin dialect]] and multiple other varieties of [[Northeastern Korean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} {{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Chung-gu|year=2007|title=Data and Ressarches for Korean dialect in Central Asia|url=http://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/29722/1/Inmun_v58_231.pdf|journal=Journal of Humanities|volume=85|pages=231-272|via=[http://ioh.snu.ac.kr/ Institute of Humanities]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic#Iraqi Koine|Iraqi Koiné]]''', a variety of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] based on the various mountain dialects in [[Turkey]] and [[Northern Iraq]] (i.e. [[Tyari]], [[Jilu]], [[Nochiya tribe|Nochiya]], etc.) under the influence of the standard [[Urmia|Urmežnaya]] variety (in [[Iran]]). In layman's terms, this dialect is a compromise between the thicker "low-class" accents of the mountains (i.e. Tyari) and the prestigious "[[Upper class|posh]]" dialect of Urmia. ''Iraqi Koine'' was developed in the [[Urban area|urban]] areas of [[Iraq]] (i.e. [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]], [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] and [[Kirkuk]]), where the Assyrians immigrated to.&lt;ref&gt;Odisho, Edward: The Sound System of Modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic) - Weisbaden, Harrassowitz, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[English in southern England#South East England and the Home Counties|London accent]]''', a dialect primarily based on [[RP English]] whilst having some influences of the southern England dialects (i.e., [[Cockney accent|Cockney]], [[Kentish dialect|Kentish]], [[Estuary English|Estuary]]). The dialect would slightly vary, depending on the speaker, where some would tend to sound more "RP" whilst others would be on the "[[working class]]" side. Essentially, this dialect is modernised RP with a touch of the aforementioned urban dialects in [[Southern England]]. Notable people who have this accent include [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Keira Knightley]], [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Jude Law]], [[Emma Watson]] and [[Gary Oldman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/przed.pdf A handout] by [[John C.

* '''[[Maghrebi Arabic]]''' ('''[[Darija]]''')
* ''' Poetic Koiné of [[Old Arabic]] and [[Classical Arabic]].
* '''[[Quebec French]]'''
* '''[[Shanghainese]]''', a dialect of [[Wu Chinese]]. It is essentially based on the [[Suzhou dialect]], while influenced by [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[English language|English]] and other [[Wu Chinese]] dialects, especially the [[Ningbo dialect]]. It has been understood as a lingua franca throughout the late 19th century and into the early 20th century [[Jiangnan]], replacing the [[Suzhou dialect]] as the lingua franca. It was then replaced by Mandarin.  Other Wu Chinese dialects, particularly the other [[Taihu Wu dialects]], are now being further koineized into a common Wu Chinese language, at the expense of dialectal diversity, as their newer pronunciations and phonology resembles that of Shanghainese with each generation.

Languages:

* '''[[Bhojpuri]]''' 
* '''[[Dano-Norwegian]]''', the basis of Norway's most widely used [[Orthography|written standard]], [[Bokmål]].
* '''[[Fiji Hindi]]'''
* '''[[Koine Greek|Koiné Greek]]''', the language that has given name to the general phenomenon.
* '''[[Modern Hebrew]]'''
* '''[[N'Ko language|N'Ko]]''', which is both a script and an emerging literary version of [[Manding languages]].
* Standard '''[[Friulian language|Friulian]]''' (''furlan standard''), based on Central variants with some differences, used in official acts
* [[Standard Italian]]
* '''[[Rumantsch Grischun]]'''

'''Kuhane''', or '''Subiya''' (also known as ''Kwahane, Chikuahane, Chikwahane, Ciikuhane'' or ''Mbalang'we''), is a [[Bantu language]] spoken by 35,000 people along the [[Zambezi River]] in [[Namibia]], [[Zambia]] and [[Botswana]]. In [[Tswana language|Tswana]] it is known as Subiya (''Supia, Sesubea, Echisubia''). It is one of several Bantu languages of the Zambezi which have [[click consonant]]s.

A '''constitutional referendum''' on the "Amendments to the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution of the Republic of Latvia]]"  was held on 18 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/valodas-referendums-notiks-18februari.d?id=42026900|title=Valodas referendums notiks 18.februārī|publisher=Delfi.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed amendments included Articles 4, 18, 21, 101 and 104 of the Constitution of Latvia by adding the condition about [[Russian language|Russian]] as the second official language, as well as prescribing two working languages&amp;nbsp;— Latvian and Russian&amp;nbsp;— for self-government institutions.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, Kristine. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", ''Juridica International''. Vol. 20, 2013.  p. 152], {{ISSN|1406-5509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum's question was "Do you support the adoption of the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" that provides for the Russian language the status of the second official language?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html |title=Referendum on the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" |publisher=Web.cvk.lv |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2000 census, Russian was the [[native language]] of 37.5% and the [[second language]] of 43.7% of the residents. Since 2000, Russian has been regarded as a foreign language according to the Official Language Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=134&amp;id=164 |title=Valsts valodas likums |publisher=Vvk.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2010, the [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance]] started to collect signatures to force a referendum on whether all publicly financed schools would have to use [[Latvian language|Latvian]] exclusively. By 9 June 2011, they had gathered 120,433 signatures of the minimum 153,232 signatures required, failing to force a referendum.

Protesting against the National Alliance initiative, on 15 February 2011, the youth movement "[[United Latvia]]" ({{lang-ru|Единая Латвия}}), led by Eduard Svatkov, announced the idea of making [[Russian language|Russian]] an official language, alongside Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/153.html |title=Vienota Latvija: Krievu valodai ir jābūt oficiālai valsts valodai |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/02/16/44711142.html |title=Activitists want Russian to be Latvia"s 2nd state language: Voice of Russia |publisher=: |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2011, "United Latvia", together with the newly created organisation "Mother Tongue" ({{lang-ru|Родной Язык}}), led by activist [[Vladimir Linderman]] (former leader of the Latvian branch of the Russian [[National Bolshevik Party]]), [[Yevgeny Osipov (politician)|Yevgeny Osipov]] (leader of "Osipov Party"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/70511 |title="Партия Осипова" официально зарегистрирована|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleksandr Gaponenko]] (director of the Institute of European Studies, economist), started to collect signatures for a [[initiative|referendum petition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/155.html |title="Vienota Latvija" sāk parakstu vākšanu par krievu valodas nostiprināšanu Satversmē |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/ru/home/155.html |title="Единая Латвия" начинает сбор подписей для закрепления русского языка в Сатверсме |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gathered 187,378 signatures, forcing a referendum.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/30608/ |title=The voice of the people |publisher=[[The Baltic Times]] |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/presseschau/archiv/article/ARTICLE100367-Don-t-panic-at-Russian-referendum-in-Latvia |title=Don't panic at Russian referendum in Latvia |publisher=eurotopics.net, [[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]] |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kp.ru/daily/25824.4/2800855/ |script-title=ru:Владимир Линдерман, инициатор референдума в Латвии: "Не врите, что русский язык был ввезен в Прибалтику на танках"|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum initiators mentioned possible [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of minority children as the main reason to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.subbota.com/2011/03/09/tn001.html |title=Может ли русский язык быть вторым государственным? |publisher=Old.subbota.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noravank.am/eng/articles/detail.php?ELEMENT_ID=5081 |title=Peculiarities of bilingual education from the point of view of the national identity |publisher=Noravank.am |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of this protest action was to slow down the ongoing process of National Alliance signature collecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.lv/story/17578.html |title=За русский язык |publisher=Gazeta.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those initiating the referendum to make Russian co-official argued: "In such case there is no other defense method than attack. The initiator of hysteria should be shaken strongly to stop hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.za-rodnoj-jazik.lv/arhiv/manifest/manifest.html |title=За родной язык |publisher=Za-rodnoj-jazik.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was held after the [[Saeima]] rejected the draft law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" supported by more than one-tenth of the voters during the Collection of signatures. At least half of the entire electorate has to vote Yes in the referendum in order for it to be valid (771,893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/407778-referendums_notiks_18februari_visi_dodamies_balsot |title=Referendums notiks; 18.februārī visi dodamies balsot|publisher=Tvnet.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholars stated that beside statehood elements, the initiative would have influenced multiple basic human rights and general principles of law protected by the Constitution of Latvia, such as the right to preserve and develop the Latvian language and Latvian ethnic and cultural identity, to participate in the work of the state and of local government, and to hold a position in the civil service; the right to choose one’s employment and workplace freely; the right to education; the rights of a child; and the right to equality and non-discrimination, principles of proportionality, legal certainty, and legitimate expectations.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"/&gt;

The referendum organisers did not deny that the main achievement would be to show a large number of Russian language supporters and the final goal would be to change the status of Russian from foreign to some legal (i.e. regional) in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/197269 |title=Линдерман: получение русским официального статуса и в интересах латышей тоже|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official status for Russian was requested due to the fact that the Constitution and Official Language Law do not have any other definitions for language status other than making a language official. Amendments for granting any other status for Russian (i.e. regional) would have had a higher risk of rejection by the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia|Constitutional Court]], thus cancelling the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasha.lv/rus/novosti/news/Interwie/46990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf Ethnopolitical tension in Latvia: looking for solving the conflict&amp;nbsp;— see p. 39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509041733/http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf |date=2007-05-09 }} {{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 51% of respondents supported or rather supported official status for Russian, 44% opposed or rather opposed it. The focus group for this research was all the inhabitants of Latvia, including [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|Latvian non-citizens]].

According to a poll performed by [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS Latvia]] in January 2012, 59% of citizens would vote 'no', 25% 'yes', 10% would abstain, and 6% had no opinion on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bnn-news.com/59-citizens-vote-russian-official-language-46936 |title=59% of citizens to vote against Russian as the second official language |publisher=Baltic News Network |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around three-quarters of voters voted against Russian as a second national language, with only the eastern region of [[Latgale]] seeing a majority of citizens voting for the change. The referendum had considerably higher voter participation than in previous elections and referendums, with more than 71.1% of registered voters casting ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/report-results.html Provisional results of the referendum] Retrieved 2012-02-19. (in Latvian)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
A large part of the Russian speaking community in Latvia (290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia's entire population) could not vote in this referendum because, since 1991, they have held [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizen]] status and thus have no right to vote. However, the above numbers also show that non-citizens could not have changed the result of the referendum if they had been allowed to vote. If all 290,660 members of the Russian community had participated and voted in favor of the motion, the proposal would still have been rejected with 59.15% against and 40.60% in favor, with turnout increasing to 75.68% from 71.11%.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Analysis==
Analysts say the turnout, at nearly 70 percent, indicates the strength of feeling among many ordinary Latvians, who are keen to distance themselves culturally from their former Soviet rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2012/02/19/latvians-say-no-in-russian-language-vote Latvians say “no” in Russian language vote] www.euronews.net. Retrieved 2012-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum can widen the schism in society and the government will have to undertake serious efforts to consolidate the country's two groups. Though the Russians who spearheaded the referendum admitted they had no chance at winning the plebiscite, they at least hope the approximate 25 percent of support will force Latvia's center-right government to begin a dialogue with national minorities. Many fear the disgruntled minority will keep up the pressure by calling for more referendums to change Latvia's constitution for minorities' benefit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/18/latvia-russian-language_n_1286544.html?ref=world Latvia Russian Language Referendum Has High Turnout] The Huffington Post.

{{IPA|/n t d t͡s d͡z s z/}} are denti-alveolar, while {{IPA|/l r/}} are alveolar. The consonant sounds {{IPA|/f x/}} are only found in loanwords. {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is only an allophone of nasals before velars {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}. Latvian plosives are not aspirated (unlike in English).

Voiced and unvoiced consonants [[Consonant voicing and devoicing#Voicing assimilation|assimilate to the next-standing consonant]], e.g. {{lang|lv|a'''p'''gabals}} {{IPA|[ˈa'''b'''ɡabals]}} or {{lang|lv|la'''b'''s}} {{IPA|[ˈla'''p'''s]}}. At the same time single voiced consonants ({{lang|lv|d}}, {{lang|lv|z}}, {{lang|lv|g}}, {{lang|lv|dz}} etc.) are not [[Final-obstruent devoicing|devoiced word-finally]]: {{lang|lv|dzied}} {{IPA|[ˈdzie̯d]}}, {{lang|lv|dedz}} {{IPA|[dæd͡z]}}.

Doubled consonants are pronounced longer: {{lang|lv|mamma}} {{IPA|[ˈmamːa]}}. The same occurs with plosives and fricatives located between two short vowels, as in {{lang|lv|upe}} {{IPA|[ˈupːe]}}, and with {{lang|lv|zs}} that is pronounced as {{IPA|/sː/}}, and {{lang|lv|šs}} and {{lang|lv|žs}} as {{IPA|/ʃː/}}.

A palatalized dental trill {{IPA|/rʲ/}} is still used in some dialects (mainly outside Latvia) but quite rarely, and hence the corresponding letter {{angbr|Ŗ ŗ}} was removed from the alphabet.

==Vowels ==
Latvian has six vowels, with [[Vowel length|length]] as distinctive feature:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Latvian vowels
! rowspan="2" |
! colspan="2" | [[Front vowel|Front]]
! colspan="2" | [[Central vowel|Central]]

|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| {{IPA|æ}} || {{IPA|æː}}
| {{IPA|a}} || {{IPA|aː}}
| colspan="2" |
|}
{{IPA|/ɔ ɔː/}}, and the diphthongs involving it other than {{IPA|/uɔ/}}, are confined to loanwords.

The vowel length ratio is about 1:2.5. Vowel length is phonemic and plays an important role in the language. For example, {{lang|lv|koka}} {{IPA|[ˈkuɔka]}} means 'made of wood', {{lang|lv|kokā}} {{IPA|[ˈkuɔkaː]}} means 'on the tree'; {{lang|lv|pile}} {{IPA|[ˈpile]}} means 'a drop', and {{lang|lv|pīle}} {{IPA|[ˈpiːle]}} means 'a duck'.

Latvian also has 10 [[diphthong]]s ({{IPA|/ai ui ɛi au iɛ uɔ iu (ɔi) ɛu (ɔu)/}}), although some diphthongs are mostly limited to proper names and interjections.

=== Pitch accent ===
Standard Latvian and, with a few minor exceptions, all of the Latvian dialects, have fixed initial stress.&lt;ref&gt;On the possible origins of fixed initial stress in Latvian, in contrast to Lithuanian, see Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman, ''Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics,'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Long vowels and diphthongs have a tone, regardless of their position in the word. This includes the so-called "mixed diphthongs", composed of a short vowel followed by a [[sonorant]]. There are three types of tones:
; level (also drawling, sustained) tone ({{lang|lv|stieptā intonācija}})
: high throughout the syllable
: e.g., {{lang|lv|loks}} {{IPA|[lūɔ̯ks]}} ('spring onion')
; falling tone ({{lang|lv|krītošā intonācija}})
: brief rise followed by a long fall
: e.g., {{lang|lv|loks}} {{IPA|[lùɔ̯ks]}} ('arch') (pronounced ''lùoks'')
; broken tone (''lauztā intonācija'')
: rising tone followed by falling tone with interruption in the middle or some creakiness in the voice
: e.g., {{lang|lv|logs}} {{IPA|[lûɔ̯ks]}} ('window')

Besides the three-tone system of the standard variety, there are also Latvian dialects with only two tones: in western parts of [[Latvia]], the falling tone has merged with the broken tone, while in eastern parts of Latvia the level tone has merged with the falling tone. Hence, the Central Latvian {{lang|lv|traũks}}, {{lang|lv|dràugs}}, {{lang|lv|raûgs}} correspond to Western Latvian {{lang|lv|traũks}}, {{lang|lv|draûgs}}, {{lang|lv|raûgs}}, and to Eastern Latvian {{lang|lv|tràuks}}, {{lang|lv|dràugs}}, {{lang|lv|raûgs}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Derksen|1996|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system is phonetically more or less similar to the ones found in [[Lithuanian phonology|Lithuanian]], [[Swedish phonology|Swedish]], [[Norwegian phonology|Norwegian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian phonology|Serbo-Croatian]]. The broken tone has some similarity to the [[Danish phonology|Danish]] [[stød]].

Overall, Latvian phonology is not too dissimilar from [[Italian language|Italian]], in contrast to the more [[Greek language|Greek]]-like sound of [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].

== Alternations ==
Latvian roots may alternate between {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} depending on whether the following segment is a vowel or a consonant. For example, the root {{lang|lv|Dauga'''v'''-}} ('[[Daugava (river)|Daugava River]]') in the nominative case is {{IPA|[dauɡa'''v'''ə]}}, but is pronounced {{IPA|[dauɡa'''u'''pils]}} in the city name {{lang|lv|Daugavpils}}. In this example, the vocalic alternant {{IPA|[u]}} is realized as the off-glide of the diphthong {{IPA|/au/}}. However, when following a vowel that does not form an attested Latvian diphthong (for example, {{IPA|[iu]}}), {{IPA|[u]}} is pronounced as a monophthong, as in {{IPA|[zi'''u'''s]}} ('fish-&lt;small&gt;NOM.SG.&lt;/small&gt;'; cf. {{IPA|[zi'''v'''is]}} 'fish-&lt;small&gt;NOM.PL.&lt;/small&gt;').

==Life==

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:DrawingHands.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Drawing Hands]]", a drawing by [[M. C. Escher]]]] --&gt;In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], '''mutual recursion''' is a form of [[recursion]] where two mathematical or computational objects, such as functions or data types, are defined in terms of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Rubio-Sánchez, Jaime Urquiza-Fuentes,Cristóbal Pareja-Flores (2002), 'A Gentle Introduction to Mutual Recursion', Proceedings of the 13th annual conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education, June 30–July 2, 2008, Madrid, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual recursion is very common in [[functional programming]] and in some problem domains, such as [[recursive descent parser]]s, where the data types are naturally mutually recursive.

==Examples==

===Data types===
{{further|Recursive data type}}
The most important basic example of a data type that can be defined by mutual recursion is a [[tree (data structure)|tree]], which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically:
 f: &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 t: v f
A forest ''f'' consists of a list of trees, while a tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a forest ''f'' (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, and another thing with the children.

This mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest:
 t: v &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
A tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list of another, which require disentangling to prove results about.

In [[Standard ML]], the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees:{{sfn|Harper|2000|loc="[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/introsml/core/datatypes.htm Date Types]"}}
&lt;source lang=ocaml&gt;
datatype 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a forest
and      'a forest = Nil | Cons of 'a tree * 'a forest
&lt;/source&gt;

===Computer functions===
Just as algorithms on recursive data types can naturally be given by recursive functions, algorithms on mutually recursive data structures can be naturally given by mutually recursive functions. Common examples include algorithms on trees, and [[recursive descent parser]]s. As with direct recursion, [[tail call optimization]] is necessary if the recursion depth is large or unbounded, such as using mutual recursion for multitasking. Note that tail call optimization in general (when the function called is not the same as the original function, as in tail-recursive calls) may be more difficult to implement than the special case of tail-recursive call optimization, and thus efficient implementation of mutual tail recursion may be absent from languages that only optimize tail-recursive calls. In languages such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] that require declaration before use, mutually recursive functions require [[forward declaration]], as a forward reference cannot be avoided when defining them.

As with directly recursive functions, a [[Recursion (computer science)#Wrapper function|wrapper function]] may be useful, with the mutually recursive functions defined as [[nested function]]s within its scope if this is supported. This is particularly useful for sharing state across a set of functions without having to pass parameters between them.

====Basic examples====
A standard example of mutual recursion, which is admittedly artificial, determines whether a non-negative number is even or odd by defining two separate functions that call each other, decrementing each time.{{sfn|Hutton|2007|loc=6.5 Mutual recursion, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=olp7lAtpRX0C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22mutual+recursion%22 53–55]}} In C:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
bool is_even(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return true;
    else
        return is_odd(n - 1);
}

bool is_odd(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return false;
    else
        return is_even(n - 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

These functions are based on the observation that the question ''is 4 even?'' is equivalent to ''is 3 odd?'', which is in turn equivalent to ''is 2 even?'', and so on down to 0. This example is mutual [[single recursion]], and could easily be replaced by iteration. In this example, the mutually recursive calls are [[tail call]]s, and tail call optimization would be necessary to execute in constant stack space. In C, this would take ''O''(''n'') stack space, unless rewritten to use jumps instead of calls.
&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/DOCUMENT/TUTORIALATS/HTML/c244.html Mutual Tail-Recursion]" and "[http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/TUTORIAL/contents/tail-recursive-functions.html Tail-Recursive Functions]", ''[http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/ATS/DOCUMENT/TUTORIALATS/HTML/book1.html A Tutorial on Programming Features in ATS],'' Hongwei Xi, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This could be reduced to a single recursive function &lt;code&gt;is_even&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, &lt;code&gt;is_odd&lt;/code&gt;, which could be inlined, would call &lt;code&gt;is_even&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;is_even&lt;/code&gt; would only call itself.

As a more general class of examples, an algorithm on a tree can be decomposed into its behavior on a value and its behavior on children, and can be split up into two mutually recursive functions, one specifying the behavior on a tree, calling the forest function for the forest of children, and one specifying the behavior on a forest, calling the tree function for the tree in the forest.  In Python:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
 def f_tree(tree):
     f_value(tree.value)
     f_forest(tree.children)

 def f_forest(forest):
     for tree in forest:
         f_tree(tree)
&lt;/source&gt;
In this case the tree function calls the forest function by single recursion, but the forest function calls the tree function by [[multiple recursion]].

Using the [[Standard ML]] data type above, the size of a tree (number of nodes) can be computed via the following mutually recursive functions:{{sfn|Harper|2000|loc="[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/introsml/core/datatypes.htm Datatypes]"}}
&lt;source lang=ocaml&gt;
fun size_tree Empty = 0
  | size_tree (Node (_, f)) = 1 + size_forest f
and size_forest Nil = 0
  | size_forest (Cons (t, f')) = size_tree t + size_forest f'
&lt;/source&gt;

A more detailed example in Scheme, counting the leaves of a tree:{{sfn|Harvey|Wright|1999|loc=V. Abstraction: 18. Trees: Mutual Recursion, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=igJRhp0KGn8C&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22mutual%20recursion%22 310–313]}}
&lt;source lang=scheme&gt;
(define (count-leaves tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      1
      (count-leaves-in-forest (children tree))))

(define (count-leaves-in-forest forest)
  (if (null? forest)
      0
      (+ (count-leaves (car forest))
         (count-leaves-in-forest (cdr forest)))))
&lt;/source&gt;

These examples reduce easily to a single recursive function by inlining the forest function in the tree function, which is commonly done in practice: directly recursive functions that operate on trees sequentially process the value of the node and recurse on the children within one function, rather than dividing these into two separate functions.

====Advanced examples====
A more complicated example is given by [[recursive descent parser]]s, which can be naturally implemented by having one function for each [[Production (computer science)|production rule]] of a grammar, which then mutually recurse; this will in general be multiple recursion, as production rules generally combine multiple parts. This can also be done without mutual recursion, for example by still having separate functions for each production rule, but having them called by a single controller function, or by putting all the grammar in a single function.

Mutual recursion can also implement a [[finite-state machine]], with one function for each state, and single recursion in changing state; this requires tail call optimization if the number of state changes is large or unbounded. This can be used as a simple form of [[cooperative multitasking]]. A similar approach to multitasking is to instead use [[coroutine]]s which call each other, where rather than terminating by calling another routine, one coroutine yields to another but does not terminate, and then resumes execution when it is yielded back to. This allows individual coroutines to hold state, without it needing to be passed by parameters or stored in shared variables.

There are also some algorithms which naturally have two phases, such as [[minimax]] (min and max), and these can be implemented by having each phase in a separate function with mutual recursion, though they can also be combined into a single function with direct recursion.

===Mathematical functions===
In mathematics, the [[Hofstadter Female and Male sequences]] are an example of a pair of integer sequences defined in a mutually recursive manner.

Fractals can be computed (up to a given resolution) by recursive functions. This can sometimes be done more elegantly via mutually recursive functions; the [[Sierpiński curve]] is a good example.

==Prevalence==
Mutual recursion is very common in the [[functional programming]] style, and is often used for programs written in [[Lisp programming language|LISP]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[ML programming language|ML]], and similar [[programming language|languages]]. In languages such as [[Prolog programming language|Prolog]], mutual recursion is almost unavoidable.

Some programming styles discourage mutual recursion, claiming that it can be confusing to distinguish the conditions which will return an answer from the conditions that would allow the code to run forever without producing an answer. [[Peter Norvig]] points to a [[design pattern]] which discourages the use entirely, stating:&lt;ref&gt;[http://norvig.com/sudoku.html Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=If you have two mutually-recursive functions that both alter the state of an object, try to move almost all the functionality into just one of the functions. Otherwise you will probably end up duplicating code.}}

==Terminology==
Mutual recursion is also known as [[indirect recursion]], by contrast with [[direct recursion]], where a single function calls itself directly. This is simply a difference of emphasis, not a different notion: "indirect recursion" emphasises an individual function, while "mutual recursion" emphasises the set of functions, and does not single out an individual function. For example, if ''f'' calls itself, that is direct recursion. If instead ''f'' calls ''g'' and then ''g'' calls ''f,'' which in turn calls ''g'' again, from the point of view of ''f'' alone, ''f'' is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of ''g'' alone, ''g'' is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of both, ''f'' and ''g'' are mutually recursing on each other. Similarly a set of three or more functions that call each other can be called a set of mutually recursive functions.

== Conversion to direct recursion ==

Mathematically, a set of mutually recursive functions are [[primitive recursive]], which can be proven by [[course-of-values recursion]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://planetmath.org/mutualrecursion mutual recursion]", ''PlanetMath''&lt;/ref&gt; building a single function ''F'' that lists the values of the individual recursive function in order: &lt;math&gt;F = f_1(0), f_2(0), f_1(1), f_2(1), \dots,&lt;/math&gt; and rewriting the mutual recursion as a primitive recursion.

Any mutual recursion between two procedures can be converted to direct recursion by inlining the code of one procedure into the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/180000/176510/p151-kaser.pdf?key1=176510&amp;key2=1857140721&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=82873082&amp;CFTOKEN=54657523 On the Conversion of Indirect to Direct Recursion] by Owen Kaser, C. R. Ramakrishnan, and Shaunak Pawagi at [[State University of New York, Stony Brook]] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; If there is only one site where one procedure calls the other, this is straightforward, though if there are several it can involve code duplication. In terms of the call stack, two mutually recursive procedures yield a stack ABABAB..., and inlining B into A yields the direct recursion (AB)(AB)(AB)...

Alternately, any number of procedures can be merged into a single procedure that takes as argument a [[variant record]] (or [[algebraic data type]]) representing the selection of a procedure and its arguments; the merged procedure then dispatches on its argument to execute the corresponding code and uses direct recursion to call self as appropriate.  This can be seen as a limited application of [[defunctionalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This translation may be useful when any of the mutually recursive procedures can be called by outside code, so there is no obvious case for inlining one procedure into the other. Such code then needs to be modified so that procedure calls are performed by bundling arguments into a variant record as described; alternately, wrapper procedures may be used for this task.

He lived at the end of the fourteenth century and at the beginning of the fifteenth. He was a disciple of [[Frat Maimon]], under whose direction he composed in 1424 his first work, a commentary on the ''[[Cuzari]]'' of [[Judah ha-Levi]]. This commentary, still extant in manuscript (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, MS. No. 677, and elsewhere), is based upon the Hebrew translation of the ''Cuzari'' made by [[Judah ben Isaac Cardinal]].

Caspi was also the author of the following works: 
# A commentary on the ''Ruach Chen'', which treats of the terminology of [[Maimonides]] (''ibid''. No. 678, 3; Parma, No. 395); 
# A commentary on Maimonides' ''Shemoneh Peraqim'' (Paris, No. 678; Parma, No. 395); and 
# ''Liqqutot'', a collection of glosses on the [[Pentateuch]] (Munich MS. No. 252). These glosses are based upon those of [[Joseph ben Nathan Official]]. Many rabbis of eastern France are cited in these glosses, and many French words and sentences may be found in them.

[[File:Oirat-map-ru.png|thumb|right|A map showing the distribution of Oirat outside of Kalmykia. Varieties in dispute have not been included&lt;ref&gt;cp. the distribution given by Svantesson et al. 2005: 141&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Oirat''' ([[Clear script]]: {{MongolUnicode|lang=xal|ᡆᡕᡅᠷᠠᡑ ᡘᡄᠯᡄᠨ|style=height:1.5em;word-wrap:normal}} ''Oirad kelen''; [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]]: Өөрд, ''Őrd''; [[Mongolian language|Khalkha-Mongolian]]: {{lang|mn|Ойрад}}, ''Oirad'') belongs to the group of [[Mongolic languages]]. Scholars differ as to whether they regard Oirat as a distinct [[language]]&lt;ref&gt;Birtalan 2003. Note that she is not altogether clear about that matter as she writes: "For the present purpose, Spoken Oirat, from which Kalmuck is excluded, may therefore be treated as a more or less uniform language." (212). See also Sanžeev 1953&lt;/ref&gt; or a major [[dialect]] of the [[Mongolian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Oirat speaking areas are scattered across the far west of the [[Mongolia|Mongolian state]],&lt;ref name="Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 396-398" /&gt; the northwest of [[People's Republic of China]] (mainly in [[Xinjiang]], but even ''Deed Mongol'' in [[Qinghai]] and, with a tiny population, in [[Gansu]]),&lt;ref name="Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 396-398"&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 396-398&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russia]]'s Caspian coast, where its major variety is [[Kalmyk Oirat|Kalmyk]].&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005, Bläsing 2003: 229&lt;/ref&gt; In all three countries, Oirat has become variously endangered or even obsolescent as a direct result of government actions or as a consequence of social and economic policies. Its most widespread tribal dialect, which is spoken in all of these nations, is [[Torgut Oirat|Torgut]].&lt;ref name="Svantesson et al. 2005: 148"&gt;Svantesson et al. 2005: 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 396-398" /&gt; The term ''Oirat'' or, more precisely, '''Written Oirat''' is sometimes also used to refer to the language of historical documents written in the [[Clear script]].&lt;ref&gt;Birtalan 2003: 210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mongolia, there are seven historical Oirat dialects, each corresponding to a different tribe:&lt;ref&gt;Coloo 1988: 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Dörbet (Choros clan)|'''Dörbet''']] is spoken in half of the ''[[Districts of Mongolia|sums]]'' of [[Uvs Province]] and in [[Dörgön, Khovd|Dörgön]] sum, [[Khovd Province]]
#'''Bayat''' in the ''sums'' of [[Malchin, Uvs|Malchin]], [[Khyargas, Uvs|Khyargas]], [[Tes, Uvs|Tes]] and [[Züüngovi, Uvs|Züüngovi]], Uvs
#[[Torgut Oirat|'''Torgut''']] in [[Bulgan, Khovd|Bulgan]] ''sum'', Khovd
#'''[[Altai Uriankhai]]''' in the ''sums'' of [[Duut, Khovd|Duut]] and [[Mönkhkhairkhan, Khovd|Mönkhkhairkhan]], Khovd and in the ''sums'' of [[Altai, Bayan-Ölgii|Altai]], [[Buyant, Bayan-Ölgii|Buyant]] and [[Bulgan, Bayan-Ölgii|Bulgan]], [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]]
#'''[[Ööld]]''' in [[Erdenebüren, Khovd|Erdenebüren]], Khovd
#'''[[Zakhchin]]''' in the ''sums'' of [[Mankhan, Khovd|Mankhan]], [[Altai, Khovd|Altai]], [[Üyench, Khovd|Üyench]], [[Zereg, Khovd|Zereg]] and [[Möst, Khovd|Möst]], Khovd
#Khoton in [[Tarialan, Uvs|Tarialan]], Uvs.

There are some varieties that are difficult to classify. The [[Alasha dialect]] in [[Alxa League]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] originally belonged to Oirat&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 265-266&lt;/ref&gt; and has been classified as such by some because of its [[phonology]].&lt;ref name="Svantesson et al. 2005: 148"/&gt; But it has been classified by others as Mongolian proper because of its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Darkhad dialect]] in Mongolia's [[Khövsgöl Province]] has variously been classified as Oirat, Mongolian proper, or (less often) [[Buryat language|Buryat]].&lt;ref&gt;See literature given in Sanžaa and Tujaa 2001: 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Oirat is [[endangered language|endangered]] in all areas where it is spoken. In Russia, the killing of a large fraction of the Kalmyk population and the destruction of their society as consequences of the [[Kalmyk deportations of 1943]], along with the subsequent imposition among them of [[Russian language|Russian]] as the sole [[official language]] have rendered the language obsolescent: it is almost exclusively the elderly who have a [[Fluency#Language fluency|fluent command]] of Kalmyk.&lt;ref&gt;Bitkeeva 2007; for details see Bitkeeva 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In China, while Oirat is still quite widely used in its traditional ranges and there are many [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] speakers,&lt;ref&gt;Bitkeeva 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of government policies and social realities has created an environment deleterious to the use of this language: the Chinese authorities' adoption of [[Southern Mongolian]] as the [[Standard language|normative]] Mongolian language,&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 179&lt;/ref&gt; new educational policies which have led to the virtual elimination of Mongolian schools in Xinjiang (there were just two left as of 2009), policies aiming to curtail [[nomadism]], and the limited occupational prospects in Chinese society for graduates of Mongolian schools.&lt;ref&gt;Indjieva 2009: 59-65&lt;/ref&gt; As for Mongolia, the predominance of [[Khalkha Mongolian]] is bringing about the Khalkhaization of all other varieties of Mongolian.&lt;ref&gt;Coloo 1988: III-IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Script systems==
[[File:Clear-script-19th-ctry.png|thumb|right|300px| An oirat manuscript in "clear script" (todo bichig)&lt;ref&gt;Chuluunbaatar 2008: 41&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Oirat has been written in two script systems: historically, the [[Clear script]], which originated from the [[Mongolian script]], was used. It uses modified letters shapes e.g. to differentiate between different rounded vowels, and it uses a small stroke on the right to indicate vowel length. It was retained longest in China where it can still be found in an occasional journal article. In Kalmykia, a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic-based]] script system has been implemented. It is strictly phonemic, not representing epenthetic vowels, and thus doesn’t show syllabification. In Mongolia, Central Mongolian minority varieties have no status, thus Oirats are supposed to use [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Mongolian Cyrillic]] which de facto only represents [[Khalkha Mongolian]]. In China, [[Buryat language|Buryat]] and Oirat are considered non-standard as compared to [[Southern Mongolian]] and are therefore supposed to use the [[Mongolian script]] and Southern Mongolian grammar (if not, as in current practice, rather [[Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Chinese characters|hànzì]]) for writing.

An "'''old salt'''" is an old sailor who is often a raconteur, or teller of [[nautical fiction|sea stories]]. Much of the [[history]] and traditions of mariners are passed from generation to generation by these sea stories as told and retold by old salts. Sea stories may be [[truth]]ful, half-truths, or falsehoods. However, they always enhance the reputations of sailors.

In the [[United States Navy]], the "Old Salt" is a title passed to the longest-serving [[Surface Warfare Officer]] on active duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rafael|first1=Martie|title=Navy Passes "Old Salt" Award|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=64457|accessdate=16 April 2018|agency=U.S. Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award, currently held by Admiral [[Kurt W. Tidd]], Commander, [[U.S. Southern Command]], honors the officer with the earliest standing SWO qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Tyrell|title=Vice Adm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6609">'''Paolo Alberto Brera''' (born 16 September 1949) is an Italian novelist and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odg.mi.it/albo/albo.php ''Ordine dei Giornalisti della Lombardia, Albo degli Iscritti'']; odg.mi.it; accessed 27 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Brera was born in [[Milan]], the third son of journalist and writer [[Gianni Brera]] and teacher Rina Gramegna. In 1976, he married Clelia Bertello and later on Rosetta Griglié. With Griglié, he has two daughters, Jalée (born 1985) and Lavinia Lys (born 1987). Since 2008, Brera has been living with his third wife, Ritta Davletova, dividing their time in [[Nice, France]] and [[Milan]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Brera earned his degree in Political Economy from Milan's [[Bocconi University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alumnibocconi.it Bocconi University alumni site]&lt;/ref&gt; where later on he was Assistant Professor of Economic History (1974–78). In 1977 he spent a few months at the [[Poznań University of Economics]] in [[Poland]] as a visiting scholar. From 1978–81 he worked at the Italian subsidiary of the French oil company Total, pursuing his research programme as a side occupation. Until 1985 he was a member of the Italian Socialist Party's (PSI) Economic Commission. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Brera researched the [[planned economies]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and Eastern Europe,&lt;ref&gt;See biographical introduction to Paolo BRERA, "Selbstverwaltung und ökonomische Entwicklung. Das jugoslawische Wachstumsmodell in den 70er Jahren und seine Krise in den 80er Jahren", ''Die Neue Gesellschaft'', N. 3, March 1983, 30. Jahrgang, Bonn.&lt;/ref&gt; publishing some fifty works in specialized journals.&lt;ref&gt;See Philip JOSEPH, OBE, [http://www.nato.int/docu/colloq/1999/pdf/332-371.pdf ''The Contribution Of the Economics Colloquium To NATO's Economic Agenda. An Evolution Over 30 Years''], page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Brera was also a member of the Association Internationale des Économistes de Langue Française (International Association of French-Language Economists), and submitted papers on Eastern Europe at the NATO Headquarters in Bruxelles and in Rome.

He later became a journalist at ''[[Critica Sociale]]'', ''[[Italia Oggi]]'' and ''[[Il Secolo XIX]]'', and has contributed articles to ''[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Weekly]]'', ''[[Exormissi]]'', ''[[Die Neue Gesellschaft]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bpb.de/themen/9IZ7N5,0,Fakten%3A_SPD.html | title=Themen &amp;#124; bpb}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Corriere della Sera]],'' ''[[L'Avanti]]'', ''[[Tages Anzeiger]]'', ''[[Corriere del Ticino]]'', ''[[Panorama (magazine)|Panorama]]'', ''[[Mondo economico]]'', and others. In 1989–90, he was named vice-editor-in-chief of the Italian edition of ''[[Moskovskie Novosti]]''. From 1998–2002 he edited and published ''Brera'',&lt;ref&gt;Lina Sotis, ''Corriere della Sera'', 6 November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; a magazine devoted to the [[Brera (district of Milan)|Brera district of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brera.net Official Brera (magazine) website], brera.net; accessed 27 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, he has published science fiction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.tiscalinet.it/fantascienzaitaliana/narrativa/romanzi.html#Dagmar%20la%20terrestre | title=Romanzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; novels and stories,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alacranedizioni.it/?p=773&lt;/ref&gt; as well as translations into Italian from English, French,&lt;ref&gt;''Don Giovanni.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6439">'''Postponement of affect''' is a [[defence mechanism]] which may be used against a variety of feelings or [[emotion]]s. Such a 'temporal displacement, resulting simply in a later appearance of the [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] reaction and in thus preventing the recognition of the motivating connection, is most frequently used against the affects of rage (or annoyance) and grief'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative postponement: repression==
===Grief===

In the affect of [[grief]], postponement seems to be an essential component. What happens in mourning is nothing other than a gradual "working-through" of an affect which, if released in its full strength, would overwhelm the ego'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bowlby]] considered the first of the "four phases of mourning" to be a 'Phase of numbness that...may be interrupted by outbursts of extremely intense distress and/or anger'.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds'' (London 1979) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one can speak of 'a rather typical postponement of grief':&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hanren, ''Responding to Loss'' (2004) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; '"I feel hurt about something and then automatically this kind of shields things up and then I feel like I can't really touch or feel anything very much"...''postponement''...[of] the weepiness'.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (19610 p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Eric Lindemann]], describing 'the symptomatology and management of acute grief following the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|Coconut Grove]] night-club fire...showed that people who do not "break down" and express feelings appropriate to a bereavement may suffer from delayed or distorted grief'.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Parkes, "Bereavement", in Richard L. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fright===

Investigation of 'the reaction of the ego to acute mortal danger...repeatedly found an absence of fear during the period of acute danger, but a subsequent appearance of acute fear when the danger was past'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel162"&gt;Fenichel, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a contributing factor in [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], where the sufferer may be 'the victim...of a blocked fear tension...he hadn't had the time to feel the fear'.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

'The postponement of fright is so well known to movie writers that it is not only frequently used but also designated by a special term: [[Double-take (comedy)|double-take]]'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel162"/&gt;

===Guilt===

Defence against guilt feelings may involve people using postponement by way of 'an ''isolation'' of guilt feeling...they do things without any guilt feeling, and experience an exaggerated feeling of guilt on some other occasion without being aware of the connection'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Such postponement can be linked to [[Nietzsche]]'s concept of the "pale criminal" or 'neurotic immoralist...the "pale felon" who does not live up to his acts'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; – retrospective guilt: 'he was equal to his deed when he did it; but he could not bear its image after it was done...now the lead of his guilt lies upon him'.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufman trans., ''The Portable Nietzsche'' (London 1987) p. 150-1&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar postponement of guilt may be seen in everyday life, as when 'a woman may decide that her Superego will permit her to cheat on her spouse...[but] may begin to feel guilty many years afterwards..&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In pathological form something similar would seem to occur 'during a melancholic attack', or so Freud surmised: the 'super-ego becomes over-severe, abuses the poor ego...reproaches it for actions in the remotest past which had been taken lightly at the time – as though it had spent the whole interval in collecting accusations and had only been waiting for its current access of strength in order to bring them up'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures'' (PFL 2) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, 'people who can muster the courage to face up to their guilt...will not suffer as long from the agony of the cognitive rehearsal of the guilt situation as people who postpone facing up to their guilt'.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll Ellis Izard, ''Human Emotions'' (1977) p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive postponement: suppression==

Freud saw the development of the [[reality principle]] as a process which 'demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction...and the temporary toleration of unpleasure as a step on the long indirect road to pleasure'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Such impulse control has been seen as a key component in [[emotional intelligence]]. 'The ability to [[Deferred gratification|delay gratification]] contributes powerfully to intellectual potential quite apart from IQ itself', while what has been called '"goal-directed self-imposed delay of gratification" is perhaps the essence of emotional self-regulation: the ability to deny impulse in the service of a goal'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Goleman]], ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 82-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, among the [[defence mechanisms]], as part of 'the ''mature'' ways of dealing with real stress...there's ''suppression'' – instead of repressing a frightening feeling and pushing it right out of awareness, you hold it in check and bear the discomfort of ''feeling'' it. That means you are more likely to be able to work out how to handle it, given a bit of time'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''[[Life and How to Survive It]]'' (London 1994 p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, 'delaying, as opposed to avoidance, is a fine mechanism, another form of the method of learning I call step-by-step'.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine N. Aron, ''The Highly Sensitive Person'' (London 1999) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schwa deletion''', or '''schwa syncope''', is a phenomenon that sometimes occurs in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and several other [[Indo-Aryan languages]] with [[mid central vowel|schwas]] that are implicit in their written scripts. Languages like [[Marathi language|Marathi]] with increased influence of other languages through coming into contact with them also shows similar phenomenon. Some schwas are obligatorily deleted in pronunciation even if the script suggests otherwise.&lt;ref name="hyman1988"&gt;{{Citation | title=Language, speech, and mind (Volume 1988, Part 2) |author1=Larry M.

Schwa deletion is important for intelligibility and unaccented speech. It also presents a challenge to non-native speakers and [[speech synthesis]] software because the scripts, including [[Devanagari]], do not tell when schwas should be deleted.&lt;ref name="bhatia1987"&gt;{{Citation | title=A history of the Hindi grammatical tradition: Hindi-Hindustani grammar, grammarians, history and problems | author=Tej K. Bhatia | year=1987 | isbn=90-04-07924-6 | publisher=BRILL | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJOXzRXsSK0C | quote=''...Hindi literature fails as a reliable indicator of the actual pronunciation because it is written in the Devanagari script... the schwa syncope rule which operates in Hindi....''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Sanskrit]] word "[[Rāma]]" ({{IPA-sa|rɑːmə|IPA}}, राम) is pronounced "Rām" ({{IPA-hns|rɑːm|IPA}}, राम्) in Hindi. The schwa ([[mid central vowel|ə]]) sound at the end of the word is deleted in Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYz6AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78 |title=A Linguistics Workbook: Companion to Linguistics |edition=Sixth |authors=Ann K. Farmer and Richard A. Demers |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780262514828 |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in both cases, the word is written राम.

The schwa is not deleted in ancient languages such as Sanskrit or [[Pali language|Pali]].

==Hindi==
Although the Devanagari script is used as a standard to write Modern Hindi, the schwa ('ə') implicit in each consonant of the script is "obligatorily deleted" at the end of words and in certain other contexts, unlike in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="hyman1988"/&gt; That phenomenon has been termed the "''schwa syncope rule''" or the "''schwa deletion rule''" of Hindi.&lt;ref name="hyman1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bhatia1987"/&gt; One formalisation of this rule has been summarised as ''ə → ∅ /VC_CV''. In other words, when a schwa-succeeded consonant is followed by a vowel-succeeded consonant, the schwa inherent in the first consonant is deleted.&lt;ref name="bhatia1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="choudhury2004"&gt;{{Citation | title=A Diachronic Approach for Schwa Deletion in Indo Aryan Languages |author1=Monojit Choudhury, Anupam Basu  |author2=Sudeshna Sarkar  |lastauthoramp=yes |date = July 2004| journal=Proceedings of the Workshop of the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Phonology (SIGPHON) | isbn= | publisher=Association for Computations Linguistics | url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W04/W04-0103.pdf | quote=''...schwa deletion is an important issue for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion of IAL, which in turn is required for a good Text-to-Speech synthesizer.... Sanskrit rəcəna, Hindi rəcna, Bengali rɔcona....''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that rules sometimes deletes a schwa that should remain and sometimes fails to delete a schwa when it should be deleted. The rule is reported to result in correct predictions on schwa deletion 89% of the time.&lt;ref name="choudhury2004"/&gt;

Schwa deletion is computationally important because it is essential to building [[speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] software for Hindi.&lt;ref name="choudhury2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tyson2009"&gt;{{Citation | title=Prosodic rules for schwa-deletion in Hindi text-to-speech synthesis |author1=Naim R. Tyson |author2=Ila Nagar | date=2009 | volume=12 | pages=15–25 | journal=International Journal of Speech Technology | isbn= | publisher= | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/131xm66677g74418/fulltext.pdf | quote=''...Without the appropriate deletion of schwas, any speech output would sound unnatural. Since the orthographical representation of Devanagari gives little indication of deletion sites, modern TTS systems for Hindi implemented schwa deletion rules based on the segmental context where schwa appears....''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of schwa syncope, the Hindi pronunciation of many words differs from that expected from a literal Sanskrit-style reading of Devanagari. For instance, राम is pronounced ''Rām'' (not ''Rāma'', as in Sanskrit), रचना is pronounced ''Rachnā'' (not ''Rachanā''), वेद is pronounced ''Véd'' (not ''Véda'') and नमकीन is pronounced ''Namkeen'' (not ''Namakeena'').&lt;ref name="choudhury2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tyson2009" /&gt; The name of the script itself is pronounced ''Devnāgrī'', not ''Devanāgarī''.&lt;ref name="ref91gufod"&gt;{{Citation | title=The rāgs of North Indian music: their structure and evolution | author=Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy | publisher=Popular Prakashan, 1995 | isbn=978-81-7154-395-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGLRqLscf78C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=difference | page=xi | quote=''...The Devnāgrī (Devanāgarī) script is syllabic and all consonants carry the inherent vowel a unless otherwise indicated. The principal difference between modern Hindi and the classical Sanskrit forms is the omission in Hindi of this inherent ''a'' when in final position (e.g. ''rāga'' in Sanskrit and ''rāg'' in Hindi) and frequently in medial position (e.g. ''Māravā'' in Sanskrit and ''Mārvā'' in Hindi).''| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Correct schwa deletion is also critical because the same letter sequence is pronounced two different ways in Hindi depending on the context. Failure to delete the appropriate schwas can then change the meaning.&lt;ref name="choudhury2002"&gt;{{Citation | title=A Rule Based Schwa Deletion Algorithm for Hindi |author1=Monojit Choudhury  |author2=Anupam Basu  |lastauthoramp=yes |date = July 2004| isbn=  | journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Knowledge-Based Computer Systems | url=http://www.mla.iitkgp.ernet.in/papers/schwadeletionhindi.pdf | quote=''...Without any schwa deletion, not only the two words will sound very unnatural, but it will also be extremely difficult for the listener to distinguish between the two, the only difference being nasalization of the e at the end of the former. However, a native speaker would pronounce the former as dha.D-kan-eM and the later as dha.Dak-ne, which are clearly distinguishable....''}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the letter sequence 'रक' is pronounced differently in हरकत (''har.kat'', meaning ''movement'' or ''activity'') and सरकना (''sarak.na'', meaning ''to slide''). Similarly, the sequence धड़कने in दिल धड़कने लगा (''the heart started beating'') and in दिल की धड़कनें (''beats of the heart'') is identical prior to the nasalisation in the second usage. However, it is pronounced ''dhaṛak.ne'' in the first and ''dhaṛ.kaneṁ'' in the second.&lt;ref name="choudhury2002"/&gt;

While native speakers pronounce the sequences differently in different contexts, non-native speakers and voice-synthesis software can make them "sound very unnatural", making it "extremely difficult for the listener" to grasp the intended meaning.&lt;ref name="choudhury2002"/&gt;

==Other Indo-Aryan languages==
Different Indo-Aryan languages can differ in how they apply schwa deletion. For instance, medial schwas from Sanskrit-origin words are often retained in Bengali even if they are deleted in Hindi.&lt;ref name="ref88guruf"&gt;{{Citation | title=Proceedings of the Second Symposium on Indian Morphology, Phonology &amp; Language Engineering: Simple'05, February 5th-7th, 2005, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur |author1=Anupam Basu |author2=Udaya Narayana Singh | publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages, 2005 | isbn=978-81-7342-137-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRxiAAAAMAAJ | quote=''...The compound words derived from native words of Bengali show greater tendency towards {a} deletion than those derived from Sanskrit....''|date=2005-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is रचना/রচনা which is pronounced ''racanā'' (/rətʃənaː/) in Sanskrit, ''racnā'' (/rətʃnaː/) in Hindi and ''rôcona'' (/rɔtʃona/) in Bengali. While the medial schwa is deleted in Hindi (because of the ə → ∅ / VC_CV rule), it is retained in Bengali.&lt;ref name="choudhury2004"/&gt;

On the other hand, the final schwa in वेद /বেদ is deleted in both Hindi and Bengali (Sanskrit: /veːd̪ə/, Hindi: /veːd̪/, Bengali: /bed̪/).&lt;ref name="choudhury2004"/&gt;

===Bengali===
Bengali deleted schwas at the end but retained the medial schwas. In some cases the ending schwas are pronounced as in 'বঙ্গ' pronounced as 'Bongo' with 'o' standing for the vowel 'অ'. Another example is 'অরবিন্দ' pronounced as 'Aurobindo' is the name of the Bengali philosopher [[Sri Aurobindo]].

===Gujarati===
Gujarati has a strong schwa deletion phenomenon, affecting both medial and final schwas. From an evolutionary perspective, the final schwas appear to have been lost prior to the medial ones.&lt;ref name="ref28cuzum"/&gt;

===Kashmiri===
In the [[Dardic languages|Dardic subbranch]] of Indo-Aryan, [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] similarly demonstrates schwa deletion. For instance, ''drākṣa'' (द्राक्ष) is the Sanskrit word for grape, but the final schwa is dropped in the Kashmiri version, which is ''dach'' (दछ् or دَچھ).

===Maithili===
Maithili's schwa deletion is similar to Hindustani, and ə → ∅ / VC_CV also selectively applies to the language. For instance, हमरो is ''həməro'' (''even ours'') with schwas but is pronounced ''həmro''.&lt;ref name="ref06pehej"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Indo-Aryan languages | author=George Cardona | publisher=Psychology Press, 2003 | isbn=978-0-7007-1130-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPR2OlbTbdkC | quote=''...The two morphophonemic alternations that are very productive and regular in Maithili are schwa deletion and replacement of a by schwa. (a) Schwa deletion:... VCəCV → VC0CV.... Schwa deletion in Maithili occurs....''| date=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is akin to the neighbouring [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] in which हमरा (meaning ''mine'') is pronounced ''həmrā'' rather than ''həmərā'' from the deletion of a medial schwa.&lt;ref name="ref71cobic"&gt;{{Citation | title=Experiencer subjects in South Asian languages |author1=Manindra K. Verma |author2=Karavannur Puthanvettil Mohanan | publisher=Center for the Study of Language (CSLI), 1990 | isbn=978-0-937073-60-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCarNNGmOMYC | quote=''...The paradigm in Bhojpuri... hamaar in isolation is genitive and has an oblique form in -aa, which according to the general principle of vowel attenuation (schwa deletion) in this language yields the form hamraa before postpositions....''|year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marathi===
In Marathi, the schwa at the end of the Sanskrit stems is retained in such cases as a few [[tatsama]] words.&lt;ref name="Rajeshwari1997"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rajeshwari Pandharipande | title=Marathi | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JntxV7MO7cIC&amp;pg=PA571 | accessdate=26 December 2012 | year=1997 | publisher=Psychology Press | isbn=978-0-415-00319-3 | page=571 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The medial schwa is retained in most of the words. [[Marathi language|Marathi]] with increased influence of other languages through coming into contact with them has been showing the phenomenon of schwa deletion sometimes with words that traditionally pronounce schwas like रंग (ranga/colour), बंद (banda/close), गुण (guna/quality), गोड (goda/sweet), मार्ग (mārga/way or street), etc.

===Nepali===
Its Sanskrit tradition makes schwas be rarely deleted in Nepali except for in Hindi or Urdu [[loanword]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Thus, conjunctions and ligatures are used more extensively than in many other Indo-Aryan languages. For example, the word लाग्छ (Lagchha) contains a ligature between ग and छ and is pronounced with the schwa at the end. 

Due to retention of longer forms (-ng; ङ्) from [[Sanskrit]], Nepali words like Ranga (रङ्ग), Anga (अङ्ग), Bhanga (भङ्ग), etc. have schwa pronounced at the end. Similarly, medial schwas are pronounced more in Nepali. For e.g; the surname ''[[Panta (surname)|Panta]] (पन्त)'' is pronounced with schwa in Nepali as compared to Hindi ''Pant (पंत)'' having [[Chandrabindu]]. Lesser usage of [[Chandrabindu]] has protected the schwa pronunciation in Nepali.

===Odia===
[[Odia language|Odia]], declared the sixth classical language of India, retains the schwa in its pronunciation. Both medial and final schwas are retained, unlike [[Bengali language|Bengali]], where only the medial schwas are retained.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Punjabi===
Punjabi has broad schwa deletion rules: several base word forms (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼, کاغز, ''kāghəz''/''paper'') drop schwas in the plural form (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼ਾਂ, کاغزاں, ''kāghzāṅ''/''papers'') as well as with instrumental (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼ੋਂ, کاغزوں, ''kāghzōṅ''/''from the paper'') and locative (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼ੇ, کاغزے, ''kāghzé''/''on the paper'') suffixes.&lt;ref name="ref59yilom"&gt;{{Citation | title=Punjabi: a cognitive-descriptive grammar | author=Tej K. Bhatia | publisher=Psychology Press, 1993 | isbn=978-0-415-00320-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDbiwuTBjjAC | quote=''...nazar 'glance' - nazar të - nazrë. Postposition incorporation is quite productive. The stem-final schwa undergoes deletion before the vocalic postpositional elements....''| year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common transcription and diction issues==
Since Devanagari does not provide indications of where schwas should be deleted, it is common for non-native learners/speakers of Hindi, who are otherwise familiar with Devanagari and Sanskrit, to make incorrect pronunciations of words in Hindustani and other modern Indo-Aryan languages.&lt;ref name="ref08pezuq"&gt;{{Citation | title=The writing systems of the world | author=Florian Coulmas | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell, 1991 | isbn=978-0-631-18028-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOywmavmZ3UC | quote=''...in the Devanagari script, the schwa vowel is not indicated in consonant-initial syllables. This is a well-known problem for those learning to read Hindi....''| date=1991-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, systems that automate [[transliteration]] from Devanagari to [[Latin script]] by hardcoding implicit schwas in every consonant often indicate the written form rather than the pronunciation. That becomes evident when [[English language|English]] words are transliterated into Devanagari by Hindi-speakers and then transliterated back into English by manual or automated processes that do not account for Hindi's schwa deletion rules. For instance, the word ''English'' may be written by Hindi speakers as इंगलिश (rather than इंग्लिश्) which may be transliterated back to ''Ingalisha'' by automated systems, but schwa deletion would result in इंगलिश being correctly pronounced as ''Inglish'' by native Hindi-speakers.&lt;ref name="ref02foril"&gt;

An example is Google's automated transliteration of {{Citation | title=Jepī Raipiḍa korasa ṭu sapokana Iṅgalisha: including Ingalisha pronouncing dikashanarī |author1=J. P. Singh Ahluwalia |author2=Mohan Singh | publisher=Jaypee Publications, 2008 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBetPgAACAAJ | quote=''... sapokana Iṅgalisha ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowel nasalisation==
With some words that contain /n/ or /m/ consonants separated from succeeding consonants by schwas, the schwa deletion process has the effect of nasalising any preceding vowels.&lt;ref name="narang1971lsa"&gt;{{Citation | title=Aspiration and nasalization in the generative phonology of Hindustani |author1=G.C. Narang |author2=Donald A. Becker | journal=Language |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=646–667 |date=September 1971 | publisher=Linguistic Society of America | isbn= | jstor=412381 | quote=''... nasalized vowels are derived from underlying sequences of vowel plus nasal consonant ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples in Hindustani:
* ''sən.kī'' ({{lang|hi|सनकी}}, {{lang|ur|{{nq|سنکی}}}}, ''whimsical'') in which a deleted schwa that is pronounced in the root word ''sənək'' ({{lang|hi|सनक}}, {{lang|ur|{{nq|سنک}}}}, ''whimsy'') converts the first medial schwa into a nasalised vowel.
* ''chəm.kīlā'' ({{lang|hi|चमकीला}}, {{lang|ur|{{nq|چمکیلا}}}}, ''shiny'') in which a deleted schwa that is pronounced in the root word ''chəmək'' ({{lang|hi|चमक}}, {{lang|ur|{{nq|چمک}}}}, ''shine'') converts the first medial schwa into a nasalised vowel.

It is spoken by a small native population inhabiting the coastal towns and the mountains and wilderness areas upland from [[Salalah]], located in the [[Dhofar Governorate]] in southwestern [[Oman]].

==Overview==
Shehri (Jibbali, Geblet, Sheret, Šehri, Šhauri, Shahari, Jibali, Ehkili, Qarawi, and Garawi) is spoken along a dialect continuum that includes Western Jibbali, Central Jibbali, and Eastern Jibbali. The dialect used by the few inhabitants of [[Al-Hallaniyah]] in the [[Khuriya Muriya Islands]] is sometimes known as 'Baby' Jibbali. Speakers generally live a semi-nomadic culture, rearing cows and [[camel]]s in the mountains. The dialects themselves contain only minor variances and are highly intelligible.

Like most Modern South Arabian dialect speakers in [[Oman]] and [[Yemen]], many Shehri speakers are bilingual in local dialects of Arabic especially the Dhofari dialect.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In addition, it is primarily a spoken language, and there is no tradition of writing or publishing in the language.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Pressure from Arabic has forced many changes in the language, so much so that young speakers use noticeably different grammar.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Grammar==
The vowel system is made up of an 8-member set, containing the normal [[Semitic Languages|Semitic]] ''i-u-a'', along with tense and lax vowels, and a central vowel.  The vowel set is: ''i, e, Ó, Í, a, Ã, o, u.''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The difference between the long and short vowels is not always just phonological.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Noun markers are a combination of Arabic, Ethiopian, and unique [[Modern South Arabian languages|Modern South Arabian]] grammar markers. Nouns have an either masculine or feminine gender. Feminine markers use the endings of ''–(V)t'' or ''–h'', as in Arabic. Unlike Arabic, the dual number marker is not used in nouns, and is instead replaced by a suffix of the numeral 2 itself. Dual pronouns are no longer used by the youth, replaced by plural pronouns.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Simple verb conjugations have two separate classes, with differing conjugations for perfect, imperfect, and subjunctive cases. Verbal clauses always take the order of VSO ([[Verb–subject–object]]) or SVO ([[Subject–verb–object]]). If the subject is an independent pronoun, it is placed before the verb. [[Guttural]] verbs have their own pattern. Verb classifications are intensive-conative, causative, reflexive (with infixed ''-t-''), and causative-reflexive. In future verbs, a preverb ''ha-/h-'' precedes the subjunctive.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The numbers 1 and 2 act as adjectives. Between 3 and 10, masculine numbers enumerate feminine nouns, and feminine numbers enumerate masculine nouns. There is gender agreement between the number and nouns from 11 to 19. Beyond that, the structure is tens, “and”, and the unit. This is similar to Arabic counting. Livestock counting presents a special case that deviates from Arabic, instead using an ancient [[Bedouin]] system. Beyond 13, the noun used is either plural or singular.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">'''Silent speech interface''' is a device that allows [[speech communication]] without using the sound made when people vocalize their [[speech sound]]s. As such it is a type of electronic [[lip reading]]. It works by the computer identifying the [[phoneme]]s that an individual pronounces from nonauditory sources of information about their [[speech production|speech movement]]s. These are then used to recreate the [[speech]] using [[speech synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Denby B, Schultz T, Honda K, Hueber T,  Gilbert J.M., Brumberg J.S. (2010). Silent speech interfaces. Speech Communication 52: 270–287. {{doi|10.1016/j.specom.2009.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information sources==

Silent speech interface systems have been created using [[ultrasound]] and optical camera input of [[tongue]] and [[lip]] movements.&lt;ref name="Hueber"/&gt; Electromagnetic devices are another technique for tracking tongue and lip movements.&lt;ref&gt; Wang, J., Samal, A., &amp; Green, J. R. (2014). Preliminary test of a real-time, interactive silent speech interface based on electromagnetic articulograph, the 5th ACL/ISCA Workshop on Speech and Language Processing for Assistive Technologies, Baltimore, MD, 38-45. &lt;/ref&gt; The detection of speech movements by [[electromyography]] of speech articulator
muscles and the [[larynx]] is another technique.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen C, Dusan S. (2010). Speech interfaces based upon surface electromyography. Speech Communication, 52: 354–366. {{doi|10.1016/j.specom.2009.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schultz T, Wand M. (2010). Modeling Coarticulation in EMG-based Continuous Speech Recognition. Speech Communication, 52: 341-353. {{doi|10.1016/j.specom.2009.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of information is the [[vocal tract]] resonance signals that get transmitted through [[bone conduction]] called non-audible murmurs.&lt;ref&gt;Hirahara T, Otani M, Shimizu S, Toda T, Nakamura K,
Nakajima Y, Shikano K. (2010). Silent-speech enhancement using body-conducted vocal-tract
resonance signals. Speech Communication, 52:301–313. {{doi|10.1016/j.specom.2009.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They have also been created as a [[brain–computer interface]] using brain activity in the [[motor cortex]]  obtained from [[Chronic electrode implants|intracortical microelectrode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg J.S., Nieto-Castanon A,  Kennedy P.R., Guenther F.H. (2010). Brain–computer interfaces for speech communication. Speech Communication 52:367–379. 2010 {{doi|10.1016/j.specom.2010.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Such devices are created as aids to  those unable to create the sound [[phonation]] needed for audible speech such as after [[laryngectomy|laryngectomies]].&lt;ref name="Deng"&gt;Deng Y., Patel R., Heaton J. T., Colby G., Gilmore L. D., Cabrera J., Roy S. H., De Luca C.J., Meltzner G. S.(2009). Disordered speech recognition using acoustic and sEMG signals.  In INTERSPEECH-2009, 644-647.&lt;/ref&gt; Another use is for communication when speech is masked by [[background noise]] or distorted by [[self-contained breathing apparatus]]. A further practical use is where a need exists for silent communication, such as when privacy is required in a public place, or hands-free data silent transmission is needed during a [[military operation|military]] or security operation.&lt;ref name="Hueber"&gt;Hueber T, Benaroya E-L, Chollet G, Denby B, Dreyfus G, Stone M. (2010). Development of a silent speech interface driven by ultrasound and optical images of the tongue and lips. Speech Communication, 52  288–300. {{doi|10.1016/j.specom.2009.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deng2"&gt;Deng Y., Colby G., Heaton J. T., and Meltzner HG. S. (2012). Signal Processing Advances for the MUTE
sEMG-Based Silent Speech Recognition System. Military Communication Conference, MILCOM 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Japanese company [[NTT DoCoMo]] announced it had created a silent [[mobile phone]] using [[electromyography]] and imaging of lip movement. "The spur to developing such a phone," the company said, "was ridding public places of noise," adding that, "the technology is also expected to help people who have permanently lost their voice."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick M. (2002). [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2122-lipreading-cellphone-silences-loudmouths.html Lip-reading cellphone silences loudmouths]. New Scientist.&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility of using silent speech interfaces for practical communication has since then been shown.&lt;ref&gt;Wand M, Schultz T. (2011). Session-independent EMG-based Speech Recognition. Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Bio-inspired Systems and Signal Processing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

The decoding of silent speech using a computer played an important role in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s story and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s associated film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)| A Space Odyssey]]''. In this, [[HAL 9000]], a computer controlling spaceship [[Discovery One]], bound for Jupiter, discovers a plot to deactivate it by the mission astronauts [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|Dave Bowman]] and [[Frank Poole]] through [[lip reading]] their conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Arthur C. (1972). The Lost Worlds of 2001. London: Sidgwick and Jackson. {{ISBN|0-283-97903-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Orson Scott Card]]’s series (including ''[[Ender's Game|Ender’s Game]]''), the artificial intelligence can be spoken to while the protagonist wears a movement sensor in his jaw, enabling him to converse with the AI without making noise. He also wears an ear implant.

'''Silesian Wikipedia''' ({{lang-szl|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Silesian language|Silesian]] edition of [[Wikipedia]]. It was started on 26 May 2008.

== History ==
[[File:Silesian Wikipedia screenshot - 2008-05-26.png|thumb|left|250px|Screen of first day of action Silesian Wikipedia]]
The first attempt to launch the Silesian Wikipedia project took place in March 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Gazeta Wyborcza]]: [http://gospodarka.gazeta.pl/gospodarka/1,68367,3098544.html "''Będzie Wikipedia po śląsku?''"], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but because of negative comments in the discussion section, the proposal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_new_languages/Wikipedia_Upper_Silesian&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2007 Wikipedia officially registered the Silesian language in its list of languages.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} The International Linguistic Organization [[SIL International]] followed this step on 18 July 2007 and [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) assigned it the ISO code "szl".&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=szl www.sil.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003061821/http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=szl |date=2012-10-03 }} - ISO documentation of Silesian language&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp?order=639_3&amp;letter=s www.sil.org] - list of languages with codes ISO (letter "S")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.ethnologue.org/codes/LanguageCodes.tab www.ethnologue.org] - list of languages with codes ISO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.lingvoj.org/lingvo/szl www.lingvoj.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second application for a Wikipedia project in the Silesian language was submitted on 19 March 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_new_languages/Wikipedia_Silesian&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of discussions on the removal of articles written in Silesian language, which remained in the Polish edition of Wikipedia (in Silesia Wikiproject).&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SDU/Kategoria:%C5%9Al%C4%85ska_Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Gazeta Wyborcza]]: [http://miasta.gazeta.pl/katowice/1,35019,4042539.html?skad=rss "''Narodziła się śląska Wikipedia''"], 05.04.2007&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial acceptance of the proposal (100% positive, 0% negative votes) 31 March 2008, a test project was created in the Incubator Wikimedia projects. The following month it contained 100 articles in Silesian, including more than 1,800 separate pages. After two months all eight requirements necessary to create a new Wikipedia were implemented and finally Silesian Wikipedia was founded on 26 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Gazeta Wyborcza]]: [http://miasta.gazeta.pl/katowice/1,35019,5251398.html "''Jest już Wikipedia po śląsku''"], 27.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Gazeta Wyborcza]]: [http://gospodarka.gazeta.pl/IT/1,88732,5248211,Slaska_Wikipedia_juz_dziala.html "''Śląska Wikipedia już działa''"], 27.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Dziennik Zachodni]]: "''Świat po naszymu, ślonsko godka w wikipedii''", 31.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Radio Plus (Poland)|Radio Plus]]: [http://www.plus.gliwice.pl/news.php?type=news&amp;id=3950 "''Śląska Wikipedia''"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 29.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[TV Silesia]]: [http://www.tvs.pl/informacje/1524/ "''Śląska Wikipedia''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529143935/http://www.tvs.pl/informacje/1524/ |date=2008-05-29 }}, 28.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Radio [[TOK FM]]: [http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/4/5254/m5254794.mp3 "''"Wikipedia po śląsku"''"], 28.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Radio eM]]: [http://www.radioem.pl/?page=news&amp;cat=region&amp;mode=single&amp;id=13451 "''Wikipedia po śląsku''"], 29.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [[TVP1]] - [[Teleexpress]]: mention about create Silesian Wikipedia, 29.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt; The 1,000th article was included on 15 November 2008.

In October 2010 the Silesian Wikipedia was mentioned as one of the arguments for Silesian to become one of the regional languages in Poland. The project of the law implementing Silesian as a regional language was introduced to Sejm by parliament member [[Marek Plura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://wyborcza.pl/1,91446,8593341,Projekt_ustawy_wprowadzajacej_slaski_jako_jezyk_regionalny.html Projekt ustawy wprowadzającej śląski jako język regionalny - w Sejmie]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sranan Tongo''' (also '''Sranantongo''' "Surinamese tongue", '''Sranan''', '''Surinaams''', '''Surinamese''', '''Surinamese Creole''', '''Taki Taki''') is an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole language]] that is spoken as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' by approximately 500,000&lt;!--80% of the population, the figure of 400,000 being an older population estimate of the country.--&gt; people in [[Suriname]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

Because the language is shared by communities speaking [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous languages]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Caribbean Hindustani#Sarnami Hindustani|Hindustani]], [[Saramaccan language|Saramaccan]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], most Surinamese speak it as a ''lingua franca'' among both the Surinamese in Suriname, a former Dutch [[colony]], and the immigrants of Surinamese origin in the [[Netherlands]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Origins==
[[File:Surinamscina Dezela kozolcev.jpg|thumb|Message written in Sranan Tongo in the guestbook in the [[Land of Hayracks]], an open-air museum in [[Slovenia]] (April 2016)]]
The Sranan Tongo words for "to know" and "small children" are ''sabi'' and ''pikin'' (respectively from Portuguese ''saber'' and ''pequeno''), because the Portuguese were the first explorers of the West African coast, where they developed a pidgin language from which a few words became common in interactions with Africans by later explorers, including the English. However, research has established from its [[lexicon]] that Sranan Tongo is mostly an English-based creole language, with a substantial overlay of words from Dutch because of the Dutch takeover of Suriname in 1667.

Sranan Tongo's lexicon is thus a fusion of mostly English and Dutch (+/-85%) and some Portuguese, and [[West African languages]]. It began as a pidgin spoken primarily by African slaves in Suriname who often did not have a common African language. Sranan Tongo also became the language of communication between the slaves and the slaveowners, as the slaves were not permitted to learn or speak Dutch. As other ethnic groups were brought to Suriname as contract workers, Sranan Tongo became a ''lingua franca''.

==Modern use==
[[File:Sranan Tongo (Wikitongues).ogg|thumb|Spoken Sranan Tongo]]
Although the formal Dutch-based educational system repressed Sranan Tongo, it gradually became more accepted by the establishment, especially during the 1980s when it was popularized by the dictator [[Dési Bouterse]], who often delivered national speeches in Sranan Tongo.

Sranan Tongo remains widely used in Suriname and in large Dutch urban areas populated by immigrants from Suriname, especially in casual conversation, which often freely mixes it with Dutch. Written [[code-switching]] between Sranan Tongo and Dutch is also common in [[computer-mediated communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radke|first=Henning|date=2017-09-01|title=Die lexikalische Interaktion zwischen Niederländisch und Sranantongo in surinamischer Onlinekommunikation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/aup/tet/2017/00000069/00000001/art00006#|journal=Taal en Tongval|volume=69|issue=1|pages=113–136|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
People often greet each other in Sranan Tongo by saying, for example, ''fa waka'' (how are you), instead of the more formal Dutch ''hoe gaat het'' (how are you).

==Literature==
As a written language, Sranan Tongo has existed since the late 19th century. An official orthography was adopted by the government of Suriname on July 15, 1986 in Resolution 4501. A few writers have used Sranan in their work, most notably the poet [[Henri Frans de Ziel]] ("Trefossa"), who also wrote ''[[God zij met ons Suriname]]'', Suriname's [[national anthem]], whose second verse is sung in Sranan Tongo.

A '''Sunday Christian''' or '''Sunday morning Christian''' (also '''Once-a-weeker''') is a derisive term used to refer to someone who typically attends [[Christian church]] services on Sundays, but is presumed or witnessed not to adhere to the doctrines or rules of the [[religion]] (either actively or passively), or refuses to register as a church member. These members are sometimes considered to be hypocritical in how or what they practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altemeyer|first=Bob|date=2004|title=PERSPECTIVES: The Decline of Organized Religion in Western Civilization|url=|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=77–89|doi=10.1207/s15327582ijpr1402_1|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due in part to their confusion or cherry-picking how they live their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/947953930|title=Religion and atheism: Beyond the divide|last=Baggini|first=Juian|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=2016|isbn=9781138891890|editor-last=Carroll|editor-first=Anthony|edition=1 [edition]|location=London|pages=38-49|chapter=The myth of mythos|oclc=947953930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''team sport''' includes any [[sport]] which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing [[sports team|teams]] which compete to win. Examples are [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[water polo]], [[handball]], [[lacrosse]], [[cricket]], [[baseball]], and the various forms of [[football]] and [[hockey]].

==Overview==
Team sports are practiced between opposing teams, where the players interact directly and simultaneously between them to achieve an objective. The objective generally involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points.

The meaning of a "team sport" has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different objectives or rules than "traditional" team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar item in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. For example, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]], [[dragon boat racing]], and [[track and field]] among others can also be considered team sports.{{Sfn|Baofu|2014|p=202}}
In other types of team sports, there may not be an opposing team or point scoring, for example, [[mountaineering]]. Instead of points scored against an opposing team, the relative difficulty of the climb or walk is the measure of the achievement. In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams but also against each other for points towards championship standings. For example, [[motorsport]], particularly [[Formula One]]. In [[Cycling team|cycling]] however, team members whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one, usually a specialist, member of the team to the highest possible finishing position. This process is known as [[team orders]] and although previously accepted was banned in Formula One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/07images/f1/fia/033007_2008_F1_SPORTING_REGULATIONS.pdf|title=2008 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving [[team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix]] however, the regulation was removed as of the {{f1|2011}} season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/9A195FD4A47DA4E1C12577F8004AA63E/$FILE/1-2011%20SPORTING%20REGULATIONS%2010-12-2010.pdf|title=2010 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years, the popularity of team sport has continued to grow, positively influencing not just athletes, but also fans, local and national economies. All over the world, the impact of team sport can be seen as professional athletes live out their dreams while serving as role models, youth athletes develop life skills and follow in the footsteps of their role models, fans bond over the love of their teams while supporting their economies with their support.

==History==
{{Main|History of sport}}

Traces of [[sprint (running)|sprint]]ing as a team sport extend back several thousand years - as evidenced in images in the cave in [[Lascaux]] in France which depict people running after animals or ''vice versa''; this was an issue of survival of the fittest.{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p= 25}}
[[File:Pankratiasten in fight copy of greek statue 3 century bC.jpg|right|thumb|Ancient Greek wrestlers]]
[[File:WadiSuraHumans.jpg|right|thumb|Rock paintings of humans in the cave of swimmers]]
Organized athletics in Greece traditionally date back to 776 BC, with ongoing activity recorded up to 393 BC. These [[ancient Olympic Games]] tested warrior skills and consisted of [[running]], [[jumping]] or leaping, [[wrestling]] (combat sport), and [[javelin throw]].{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=26}} In the [[Bayankhongor Province]] of [[Mongolia]], Neolithic-era cave paintings dating to 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20110317/PC20/303179904 |last= Hartsell|first= Jeff|title= Wrestling 'in our blood|publisher= Bulldogs' Luvsandor |accessdate= 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prehistoric]] cave-paintings in [[Japan]] show a sport similar to [[sumo]] wrestling.&lt;ref name="Crego2003"&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert Crego|title= Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th Centuries|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XCl1c2yy5ooC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate= 25 October 2015|year= 2003|publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn= 978-0-313-31610-4|pages= 34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wadi Sura]], near [[Gilf Kebir]] in [[Libya]], a [[Neolithic]] rock painting in the [[cave of swimmers]] shows evidence of [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[archery]] being practiced around 6000 BC.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author= Győző Vörös|title= Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907– 2007|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate= 25 October 2015|year= 2007|publisher= [[American Univ in Cairo Press]]|isbn= 978-963-662-084-4|pages= 39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "athlete", according to mythology, derives from the name of [[Aethlius]],{{cn|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;
Compare:
{{OEtymD|athlete|accessdate=2018-05-30}} "athlete (n.) early 15c., from Latin ''athleta'' 'a wrestler, athlete, combatant in public games,' from Greek ''athletes'' 'prizefighter, contestant in the games,' agent noun from ''athlein'' 'to contest for a prize,' related to ''athlos'' 'a contest' and ''athlon'' 'a prize,' which is of unknown origin."
&lt;/ref&gt;
the mythological first King of [[Elis]] (the location of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]) in Greece. The practice of young athletes carrying flaming torches is also traced{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} to the King of Elis, under whose supervision the games took place; some historians{{which?|date=May 2018}} regard this as the first record of Olympic sprint racing. Before the start of the races gods were invoked{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} by offerings of mostly fruits and vegetables. The winner of the race was crowned with a wreath of olive or [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] and [[celery]] sticks were offered{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} as a trophy. In subsequent years monetary attractions were introduced as prize money. However, the practice of offering [[celery sticks]] is still in vogue in the 100&amp;nbsp;m sprint in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;

The present-day pattern of [[Olympic Games]] resembles the practice followed in ancient times. Sprint was the coveted event. The 200&amp;nbsp;m sprint is known in [[Greek language|Greek]] as "short foot race". The 400&amp;nbsp;m race is equivalent to two ''stades'' and called ''diaulos'' in Greek.{{Sfn|Barber|2006|p=26}}

==Olympic team sports==
Seven team sports are currently on the program of the [[Summer Olympics]].  [[Cricket]]'s inclusion in the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] depends on the decision of the [[International Cricket Council]] and its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joc4rmEsPr3msn6leaEdvZ1-SnKA |title=Cricket edges closer to Olympic roster |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815194518/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joc4rmEsPr3msn6leaEdvZ1-SnKA |archivedate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics|cricket tournament]] formed part of the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], although only one match was played, between teams representing Great Britain and France. However, the British team was effectively a club touring side and the French players were drawn partly from expatriates living in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cricket at the 1900 Paris Summer Games|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/CRI/|website=sports-reference.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ice hockey]] and [[curling]] are team sports at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] together with the [[Bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics|bobsleigh]] competition where the men's event has classes for both two-man and four-man sleds, but the women's class is restricted to two persons only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BOBSLEIGH|url=http://www.olympic.org/bobsleigh|publisher=International Olympic Committee|year=2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Olympic team sports include competitions for both men and women.

'''Teanu''' (or ''Puma'', ''Buma'') is the main language spoken on the island of [[Vanikoro]], in the easternmost province of the [[Solomon Islands]].

Some information on Teanu, as well as on the two other languages of the island, can be found in {{Harvcoltxt|François|2009}}.

==Name==
The language receives its name from [[Teanu island|Teanu]], the island located northeast of the Vanikoro island group. The same language has also been known in the literature as ''Puma'' (or wrongly ''Buma''), after the [[Puma village|main village]] of Teanu island.&lt;ref name="F2009"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Whereas Teanu used to be confined to the northeast part of the island group, during the 20th century it has become the main language of the whole island group of Vanikoro, at the expense of the two other indigenous languages [[Lovono]] and [[Tanema]].&lt;ref name="F2009"/&gt;

While the Melanesian population of [[Vanikoro]] now speaks Teanu, the southern coast of the island also has been colonised for a few centuries by a [[Polynesia]]n population, who still keep strong ties with their homeland, the nearby island of [[Tikopia]]. Their main language is [[Tikopia language|Tikopia]], even though some speak Teanu as a second language.

==Phonology==
Teanu has 5 [[phoneme|phonemic]] vowels, /i e a o u/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2009|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Final Reflection''''' is a 1984 ''[[Star Trek]]'' tie-in novel by [[John M. Ford]] which emphasizes developments of [[Klingon]] language and culture. The novel provided the foundation for the [[Star Trek: The Role Playing Game|FASA ''Star Trek'' role-playing game]] sourcebooks dealing with the Klingon elements of the game. Although not considered [[Star Trek canon|canon]] because of later developments in the ''Star Trek'' movies and TV series, the presentation of Klingon culture in this novel and Ford's 1987 follow-on, ''[[How Much for Just the Planet?]]'' is highly popular in [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] alternate depictions of Klingon society and culture.  In particular, the fictional Klingon language ''[[klingonaase]]'' is introduced here, in advance of the creation of the canon version of the Klingon language, ''&lt;tt&gt;[[tlhIngan Hol]]&lt;/tt&gt;''.

==Plot==
Particular aspects of Klingon society depicted include:

* A strong Klingon emphasis on battle-related games.  The title refers to a move in ''klin zha'', a Klingon game with similarities to [[chess]]; in this particular variation, the "reflective" game, both players take turns playing one set of pieces.
* Games played with living players.
* Military strategy is the particular province of a military class known as "thought admirals," who hone their skills in "the game with living pieces."  They also seek to learn how other societies think militarily by studying the games of those people.
* The distinction between empire-building races—such as the Klingons, the Humans and Vulcans with their Federation, and the Romulans—and less driven races, whom the Klingons use as servants (''kuve'').

The novel concerns an intergenerational conflict within the Klingon government, between a faction wanting war with the Federation and a faction desiring accommodation for fear of Klingon defeat.  The Klingon ambassador and his associates play a surprising role in this conflict, one which remains secret until the publication of a "tell-all" book forty years later, one which is read by Captain [[James T. Kirk]] in the "framing" story.

==Influence==
In "Requiescat in Pace, John M. Ford", [[Eric Burns (blogger)|Eric Burns]] suggests that the popularity of Ford's inside look at Klingon culture, and his positive portrayal of Klingons as an honorable people by their own lights (not simply stock villains), also influenced the canonical depiction in later incarnations of ''Star Trek'', paving the way for honor-driven Klingons like [[Worf]], and episodes that would likewise explore Klingon culture in more depth than the original series had done.

In the ''Next Generation'' novel ''[[A Singular Destiny]]'', [[Keith R. A. DeCandido]] includes ''The Final Reflection'' in a list of Klingon literature.

The 2017 TV series ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' officially canonized at least one element introduced in the novel, the "Black Fleet" (as part of the Klingon spiritual belief in the afterlife) in its premiere episode, "The Vulcan Hello."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2618">A '''tryout''' is the staging of performances of a [[theatrical production]] (i.e., a play or musical) at an off-site venue for evaluation and possible revision before the production premieres on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or the [[West End theatre|West End]].  A tryout is similar to a [[workshop production]] in that the point is to identify and eliminate embarrassing flaws before the production is put on before highly demanding New York or London audiences, but unlike a workshop, it is usually more developed, less rough, and closer to the intended final product.  If a tryout goes well and irons out the last few bugs, then that assures the project's investors that when it does debut on Broadway or the West End, it will already be fully polished and more likely to receive favorable reviews and play to sold-out houses for several years, so they can recoup their investment. Conversely, tryouts enable theatrical audiences in less prestigious markets to preview potential future hits and get bragging rights that they saw those works first.

The [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Schubert Theatre]] is an example of a theatre specializing in such tryouts for Broadway.

'''Zubaida Yazdani''' (27 April 1916 – 11 June 1996) was an [[India]]n historian specializing in the history of the Deccan in India. She was a professional historian, a subject which she read at [[Oxford]] and in which she lectured for some 30 years in [[India]]. She was one of the first Asian women to enter Oxford University.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=St Hilda's College|title=Report and Chronicle|date=1987–1988|location=Memoir deposited in the library with the ASM archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; She authored two books and numerous scholarly articles about the history of India.

== Biography ==

Zubaida Yazdani was one of the first Asian women to enter Oxford University.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She authored two books and numerous scholarly articles about the history of India. Her book titled "Hyderabad during the residency of Henry Russell 1811-1820"&lt;ref name="Auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yazdani|first1=Zubaida|title=Hyderabad During the Residency of Henry Russell 1811-1820. A Case Study of the Subsidiary Alliance System|date=1976|publisher=Printed at University Press, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a scholarly exposition of the Indian Subsidiary Alliance system. Her other book titled "The Seventh Nizam: The Fallen Empire"&lt;ref name="Auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yazdani|first1=Zubaida (with Mary Chrystal)|title=The Seventh Nizam: The Fallen Empire|date=1985|publisher=Printed at Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a memoir of the last Nizam of Hyderabad and also a study of the constitutional and political complexities which surrounded the relations of the Indian states with the British raj.  Her books broke new ground and were based on painstaking use of original documents, many of which had been overlooked by previous investigators.&lt;ref name=Auto2/&gt; They enforced the revision of some hitherto accepted judgements. She also supervised the translation of a novel,  Taubat al Nusuh,from Urdu into English. This is an important and groundbreaking work in Urdu by [[Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi]] who was the first novel writer in Urdu and also an eminent scholar whose publications promoted the education of Muslim men and women. Zubaida Yazdani was also involved in social and educational work. She was one of the main founders of a college in Hyderabad for underprivileged women.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; She also started the Hyderabad School for Languages and Science in London, teaching primary, junior and secondary pupils in Urdu as well as the curriculum subjects of English, Mathematics, Computer Studies, French, and  Arabic to students from primary to O and A Levels.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leach|first1=Joy|title=Interview with Mrs Ali Khan (married name)|publisher=Rectory Neighborhood Warden|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Zubaida Yazdani was the oldest daughter of [[Ghulam Yazdani]], D.Litt. who was himself an eminent historian and archeologist. He is considered an authority on the history of the Deccan and had numerous publications about the history of south India. He was the Director of Archeology in the Nizam’s government in Hyderabad and was instrumental in the preservation of the caves at Ajanta and Ellora which are masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu religious art. He was awarded an OBE by the British government and a Padma Bhushan (one of India’s highest civil honors) by the Indian government[7]. Zubaida Yazdani was married to Mir Yaseen Ali Khan, who was an accomplished Urdu poet and published in the leading literary magazines of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weekly Ravi Bradford|title=Nawab Mir Yaseen Ali Khan|publisher=Ravi|date=11 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zubaida Yazdani passed her Senior Cambridge exams with high marks from Mahboobia School. Her father recognized her talents and came with her to Britain at his own expense so she could sit for the Oxford university entrance examination. Zubaida Yazdani travelled to Oxford in 1935 and sat for the entrance exam for St. Hilda’s college and after interviews was accepted. She writes in her own words  that the students "came mostly from the British middle classes and aristocracy… not only academically the cream of English society but in their manners … very humble and living… paid great respect to their tutors".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Zubaida Yazdani was one of the first Asian women to enter [[Oxford University]] and was a contemporary of [[Indira Gandhi]] (late Prime Minister of India). Her own example gave an incentive for other Hyderabadi students to come to Oxford for higher studies.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; When asked many years later during an interview about her memories of Indira Gandhi, Zubaida Yazdani commented that "She was a very shy student. She spoke little in lectures and discussions."&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

Zubaida Yazdani got her degree at Oxford in June 1940. After the outbreak of World War ll, she was determined to stay on and do post graduate studies at Oxford. In her own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;students pursued normal courses, contented themselves with lunches of cheese sandwiches and apples, and used the shelters only when the sirens sounded.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She was asked by her family to come back because of the dangers the war presented.

The Suez Canal had closed by that time and it would have been exceedingly dangerous to go back via that route as the war raged on in Europe and the Middle East. So she had to go to India via USA. She had to travel to USA from Britain across the Atlantic in a ship which dodged German U Boats which patrolled the Atlantic and sank 175 allied warships and 3500 merchant ships. She arrived back on the east coast of India in Calcutta after a perilous journey of nearly three months via New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong. Her overjoyed parents went from [[Hyderabad]] to Calcutta to receive her.

On her return home to Hyderabad she was appointed Lecturer (1942) and then Reader (1947) in History at the Women’s College, Osmania university.&lt;ref name=auto1/&gt; She started M.A. classes there. She taught there for many years and also conducted and published research while teaching there.

Zubaida Yazdani however had a great desire to pursue postgraduate education. Indian teaching staff with more than 10 years of service were allowed two years leave with full pay. She left for Britain in March 1963 and started attending post graduate classes at London university School of Oriental and African Studies and later transferred to Oxford university where she completed her postgraduate studies at St. Hilda’s college.

From 1967 to 1969 she was Senior Reader at the Women’s college, Osmania university and was also its acting principal. Then she became Reader in History at the Arts college, Osmania university and finally head of its History department.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt;

Zubaida Yazdani retired in 1976 and came to Britain with her husband, Mir Yaseen Ali Khan because two of her sons Hussain and Hassan were already residents in Britain. She then wrote (with Mary Crystal) her second book, "The Seventh Nizam: The Fallen Empire"

Zubaida Yazdani passed away in London on 11 June 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ravi Weekly Bradford|title=Urdu and English Writer Zubaida Yazdani Passed Away|date=22 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly and literary work ==

Zubaida Yazdani published her first book "Hyderabad during the Residency of Henry Russell 1811 – 1820".&lt;ref name=Auto2/&gt; The book was based on her B.Litt. thesis at Oxford university. It was a scholarly work based on original sources which were available at the Bodleian library at Oxford which housed the Russell and Palmer papers. She was the first to make a detailed study of these voluminous papers. [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams|Rushbrook Williams]] (CBE, FRSA), who was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford wrote in the preface to the book that the study breaks new ground and enforces the revision of hitherto accepted judgments and is an unbiased and thorough investigation of the subject.

Zubaida Yazdani published her second book titled "The Seventh Nizam: The Fallen Empire"&lt;ref name=Auto3/&gt; in 1985. The book is a study of Hyderabad under the Seventh Nizam (1911–48), the greatest of the Asaf Jahi rulers of Hyderabad. It also embraces a study of the British government’s policies towards the Indian states. It also shows the effects of the two world wars on British policy up to the time when India and Pakistan became independent. The book was a scholarly work based on original papers that were obtained from the India Office library in London as well as original papers of the Nizam that were made available to her by the Nizam’s family. Many of these papers have never been studied before this book was published. The book painstakingly document’s the source of all materials and provides voluminous references.

The preface for the book was written by [[Gordon Johnson (historian)|Gordon Johnson]] (Director of the Cambridge university center for South Asian studies and President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (2015–18)) who wrote that not only does the study chronicle the live of the last Nizam but also the complexities of the relationship of the Indian States with the British raj which is an often ignored aspect of Indian history. Dr. Gordon wrote that the study thus contributes to our understanding of modern political developments in the sub-continent.&lt;ref name=Auto3/&gt;

Zubaida Yazdani also supervised the translation from Urdu into English, of a novel titled Taubat al Nusuh written by [[Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi]] who was the first Urdu novelist. Nazir Ahmed was a contemporary of [[Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir Syed Ahmad Khan]] and was concerned with the reform and education of Muslims particularly Muslim women. Taubat al Nusuh is considered by many to be the first novel written in Urdu.

Zubaida Yazdani also wrote numerous papers and articles which were presented at scholarly conferences.

== Social and educational work ==

Zubaida Yazdani was always involved in social and educational work in particular for the benefit of the underprivileged. However her work in the establishment of a women’s college stands out.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; While Zubaida Yazdani was working as a Reader in history at the Women's college, Osmania university she noticed that because of the increased number of women seeking admission, the underprivileged women were finding it difficult to get admission to the existing women’s colleges. A branch of the Federation of University Women was established at Hyderabad, under the name of the University Women’s Cultural Association and she was appointed its Secretary. Zubaida Yazdani presented her proposal for the establishment of a new women's college to the Association and the proposal was accepted by Sri Devi the principal of the Women's College who highly encouraged the project. However the association was concerned about the lack of resources for such an undertaking because not a rupee was available for this proposal. Zubaida Yazdani went door to door to raise funds from wealthy individuals and businesses.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siasat Publications Hyderabad|title=Professor Zubaida Yazdani|publisher=Siasat|date=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also able to get teachers to agree to teach in the college with the condition that for the first year they would only receive Rupees 20 to Rupees 25 per month. This was an extremely low salary for teachers in those days. There was also no building for the proposed college. So she approached Sultan Bazar library because their buildings were empty all day and the administration of the library agreed to let the college use their buildings temporarily. Then the college was started with an initial enrollment of about 35 students[10]. An incident that occurred during this time speaks to the unshakable determination and dedication of Zubaida Yazdani.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The Sultan Bazaar library eventually wanted their rooms back and decided to make the college leave by locking the doors to the building. They would not listen to any requests from the college. Zubaida Yazdani faced this crisis in her usual determined way. She told the students to go home and that it was a college holiday for them and to come back to the same place the next day and they would be informed of the college’s new location. She also told the teachers to come back the next day at their usual time and they would then go to the new premises. The teachers were astonished because there weren’t any new buildings to move to.  She then went home and took her teenaged son with her and took him with her and went to meet the President and Secretary of the Sir Nizamat Jung Trust library. She requested that the halls and rooms of the library be rented out to the college. The President and Secretary of the library said that we will form a committee and then we will let you know their decision. Zubaida Yazdani told them that by the time the committee is formed the college will be finished. The President and Secretary then asked her more questions about the college. They were so impressed by her determination and dedication and also that she was not about to take no for an answer that they gave her the keys to the halls and rooms the same day. The next day when the students and teachers came back to the college, they were met by a smiling Zubaida Yazdani who gave them directions to the new college building. Eventually the college moved to a more permanent location.  Under her leadership the college started arts classes in history, economics and sociology for underprivileged girls. Then science classes were started and a library and laboratory were set up, with very satisfactory results. Zubaida Yazdani wanted that the college should be affiliated with Osmania university. One lakh rupees (Rs.100,000) were needed for the proposal.  The Osmania university graduates association office bearer Rai Shankar Ji took the fully functional  college under the sponsorship of the Association. And In 1961, despite opposition, the U.W.C.A. college was affiliated to Osmania University. It is now, under its Hindi name, Sarojini Naidu Vanitha Maha Vidyalaya, one of the largest women’s colleges in Telangana state. It is located in Nampally area of Hyderabad.

Zubaida Yazdani’s son Hussain Ali Khan who as a child was often her companion on fund raising trips wrote the following about her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hussain Ali Khan|title=Zubaida Yazdani|date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "About the founding of the college for women; she felt the need for such an Institution as there were not adequate places and opportunities for women whom she believed strongly in. When she made up her mind about something she felt strongly about, there was no stopping her and there was no word like NO in her dictionary of life. In the days of old it was not the IN thing for women to go to rich or powerful men’s houses or see them personally on their own so I being a very young teenaged son used to accompany her on these missions of gathering funds for the cause from powerful bankers, heads of companies, directors etc. As the occasion demanded her charisma and powers of persuasion at convincing the great and the good were like magic and they were like putty in her hands and it was extraordinary to watch".

Zubaida Yazdani also established the Hyderabad School for Languages and Sciences in Hackney in London. The school was started in February 1981 because she had been approached by parents of children from Hyderabad and Pakistan to teach Urdu.&lt;ref name=auto5/&gt; She and her husband, Mir Yaseen Ali Khan, initially taught the classes, but after a few months the Inner London Education Authority visited the school and awarded a grant. After that the school was able to employ more teachers. The school  taught primary, junior and secondary pupils in Urdu up the O and A level. The school also taught English, Arabic, and Science subjects. The school closed some years after Zubaida Yazdanis death.

Zubaida Yazdani was also an office bearer in various Urdu and History associations and published research in academic journals&lt;ref name=auto1/&gt;
