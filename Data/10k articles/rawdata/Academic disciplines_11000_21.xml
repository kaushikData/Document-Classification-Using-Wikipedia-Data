      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27357">In '''3D user interaction (3DUI)''' the human interacts with a computer or other device with an aspect of three-dimensional space. This interaction is created thanks to the interfaces, which will be the intermediaries between human and machine.

The 3D space used for interaction can be the real [[physical space]], a [[virtual space]] representation simulated in the computer, or a combination of both. When the real physical space is used for data input, the human interacts with the machine performing actions using an [[input device]] that should know the relative position and distance of the user action, among other things. When it is used for data output, the simulated 3D virtual scene is projected onto the real environment through one [[output device]].

The principles of [[3D interaction]] are applied in a variety of domains such as [[tourism]], [[Digital art|art]], [[Video game|gaming]], [[simulation]], [[education]], [[information visualization]], or [[scientific visualization]].&lt;ref name="BowmanBook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bowman |first= Doug A. |date=2004 |title= 3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice |url= |location=Redwood City, CA, USA |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc. |isbn= 0201758679|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Research in 3D interaction and 3D display began in the 1960s, pioneered by researchers like Ivan Sutherland, Fred Brooks, Bob Sproull, Andrew Ortony and Richard Feldman.  But it was not until 1962 when [[Morton Heilig]] invented the [[Sensorama]] simulator.&lt;ref name="US3050870A"&gt;{{citation |inventor-last=Heilig |inventor-first=Morton L |inventorlink=Morton Heilig |publication-date=1961-01-10 |title=Sensorama simulator |issue-date=1962-08-28 |country-code=US |patent-number=US3050870A |url = https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/90/34/2f/24615bb97ad68e/US3050870.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided 3D video feedback, as well motion, audio, and feedbacks to produce a virtual environment.
The next stage of development was Dr. [[Ivan Sutherland]]’s completion of his pioneering work in 1968, the Sword of Damocles.&lt;ref name="HMD"&gt;[[Ivan Sutherland|Sutherland, I. E.]] (1968). "[http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/p757-sutherland.pdf A head-mounted three dimensional display]". ''Proceedings of AFIPS 68'', pp. 757-764&lt;/ref&gt;
He created a head-mounted display that produced 3D virtual environment by presenting a left and right still image of that environment.

Availability of technology as well as impractical costs held back the development and application of virtual environments until the 1980s. Since then, further research and technological advancements have allowed new doors to be opened to application in various other areas such as education, entertainment, and manufacturing.

== 3D user interfaces ==
[[File:3D_User_Interaction.jpg|thumb|528x528px|Scheme of 3D User Interaction phases]]3D user interfaces, are user interfaces where 3D interaction takes place, this means that the user’s tasks occur directly within a three-dimensional space. The user must communicate with commands, requests, questions, intent, and goals to the system, and in turn this one has to provide feedback, requests for input, information about their status, and so on.

Both the user and the system do not have the same type of language, therefore to make possible the communication process, the interfaces must serve as intermediaries or translators between them.

The way the user transforms perceptions into actions is called Human transfer function, and the way the system transforms signals into display information is called System transfer function. 3D user interfaces are actually physical devices that communicate the user and the system with the minimum delay, in this case there are two types: 3D User Interface Output Hardware and 3D User Interface Input Hardware.

=== 3D user interface output hardware ===

These hardware devices are usually called display devices or output devices and their aim is to present information to one or more users through the human perceptual system. Most of them are focused on stimulating the visual, auditory, or haptic senses. However, in some unusual cases they also can stimulate the user’s olfactory system.

==== 3D visual displays ====

This type of devices are the most popular and its goal is to present the information produced by the system through the human visual system in a three-dimensional way. The main features that distinguish these devices are: field of regard and [[field of view]], [[spatial resolution]], screen geometry, light transfer mechanism, [[refresh rate]] and [[ergonomics]].

Another way to characterize these devices is according to the different categories of [[depth perception]] cues used to achieve that the user can understand the three-dimensional information. The main types of displays used in 3D UIs are: monitors, surround-screen displays, workbenches, hemispherical displays, head-mounted displays, arm-mounted displays and autostereoscopic displays.

==== 3D audio displays ====

3D Audio displays are devices that present information (in this case sound) through the human auditory system, its objective is to generate and display a spatialized 3D sound so the user can use its psychoacoustic skills and be able to determine the location and direction of the sound. There are different localizations cues: binaural cues, spectral and dynamic cues, [[head-related transfer function]]s, [[reverberation]], [[sound intensity]] and vision and environment familiarity.

==== 3D haptic displays ====

These devices use the sense of touch to simulate the physical interaction between the user and a virtual object. There are three different types of 3D Haptic displays: those that provide the user a sense of force, the ones that simulate the sense of touch and those that use both. The main features that distinguish these devices are: haptic presentation capability, resolution and [[ergonomics]]. The human haptic system has 2 fundamental kinds of cues, tactile and kinesthetic. Tactile cues are a type of human touch cues that have a wide variety of skin receptors located below the surface of the skin that provide information about the texture, temperature, pressure and damage. Kinesthetic cues are a type of human touch cues that have many receptors in the muscles, joints and tendons that provide information about the angle of joints and stress and length of muscles.

=== 3D user interface input hardware ===

These hardware devices are called input devices and their aim is to capture and interpret the actions performed by the user. The [[degrees of freedom]] (DOF) are one of the main features of these systems. Classical interface components (such as mouse and keyboards and arguably touchscreen) are often inappropriate for non 2D interaction needs.&lt;ref name ="BowmanBook" /&gt; These systems are also differentiated according to how much physical interaction is needed to use the device, purely active need to be manipulated to produce information, purely passive do not need to.
The main categories of these devices are desktop input devices, tracking devices, [[Mouse (computing)|3D mice]], [[brain-computer interface]].

==== Desktop Input devices ====

This type of devices are designed for an interaction 3D on a desktop, many of them have an initial design thought in a traditional interaction in two dimensions, but with an appropriate mapping between the system and the device, this can work perfectly in a three-dimensional way. There are different types of them: [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboards]], [[Mouse (computing)|2D mice]] and trackballs, pen-based tablets and [[joystick]]s. Nonetheless, many studies have questioned the appropriateness of desktop interface components for 3D interaction &lt;ref name ="BowmanBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Chen | first=Michael | last2=Mountford | first2=S.

==== Tracking devices ====

3D user interaction systems are based primarily on [[motion capture|motion tracking]] technologies, to obtain all the necessary information from the user through the [[gesture recognition|analysis of their movements or gestures]], these technologies are called, tracking technologies.

For the full development of a 3D User Interaction system, is required to have access to a few basic parameters, all this technology-based system should know, or at least partially, as the relative position of the user, the absolute position, angular velocity, rotation data, orientation or height.

The collection of these data is achieved through systems of space tracking and sensors in multiple forms, as well as the use of different techniques to obtain.
The ideal system for this type of interaction is a system based on the tracking of the position, using six [[degrees of freedom]] (6-DOF), these systems are characterized by the ability to obtain absolute 3D position of the user, in this way will get information on all possible three-dimensional field angles.

The implementation of these systems can be achieved by using various technologies, such as electromagnetic fields, optical, or ultrasonically tracking, but all share the main limitation, they should have a fixed external reference, either a base, an array of cameras, or a set of visible markers, so this single system can be carried out in prepared areas.

Inertial tracking systems do not require external reference such as those based on movement, are based on the collection of data using [[accelerometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s, or video cameras, without a fixed reference mandatory, in the majority of cases, the main problem of this system, is based on not obtaining the absolute position, since not part of any pre-set external reference point so it always gets the relative position of the user, aspect that causes cumulative errors in the process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] data.

The goal to achieve in a 3D tracking system would be based on obtaining a system of 6-DOF able to get absolute positioning and precision of movement and orientation, with a precision and an uncut space very high, a good example of a rough situation would be a mobile phone, since it has all the motion capture sensors and also [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] of latitude, but currently these systems are not so accurate to capture data with a precision of centimeters and therefore would be invalid.

However, there are several systems that are closely adapted to the objectives pursued, the determining factor for them is that systems are auto content, i.e., all-in-one and does not require a fixed prior reference, these systems are as follows:

===== Nintendo WII Remote ("Wiimote") =====
[[File:Wiimote-Safety-First.jpg|thumb|Wiimote device]]

The [[Wii Remote]] device does not offer a technology based on 6-DOF since again, cannot provide absolute position, in contrast, is equipped with a multitude of sensors, which convert a 2D device in a great tool of interaction in 3D environments.

This device has gyroscopes to detect rotation of the user, accelerometers ADXL3000, for obtaining speed and movement of the hands, optical sensors for determining orientation and electronic compasses and infra-red devices to capture the position.

Should be noted that this type of device can be affected by external references of [[infra-red]] light bulbs or candles, causing errors in the accuracy of the position.

===== Google Tango Devices =====
[[File:Google ATAP's Project Tango tablet (15387052663).jpg|thumb|Google's Project Tango tablet, 2014]] The [[Tango (platform)|Tango Platform]] is an augmented reality computing platform, developed and authored by the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP), a skunkworks division of Google. It uses computer vision and internal sensors (like gyroscopes) to enable mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to detect their position relative to the world around them without using GPS or other external signals. It can therefore be used to provide 6-DOF input which can also be combined with its multi-touch screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Besancon | first=Lonni | last2=Issartel | first2=Paul | last3=Ammi | first3=Mehdi | last4=Isenberg | first4=Tobias | title=Hybrid Tactile/Tangible Interaction for 3D Data Exploration | journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=23 | issue=1 | year=2017 | issn=1077-2626 | doi=10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599217 | pages=881–890 | url = https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01372922/document | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Google Tango devices can be seen as more integrated solutions than the early prototypes combining spatially-tracked devices with touch-enabled-screens for 3D environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Fitzmaurice | first=George W. | last2=Buxton | first2=William | title=An empirical evaluation of graspable user interfaces | publisher=ACM Press | publication-place=New York, New York, USA | year=1997 | isbn=0-89791-802-9 | doi=10.1145/258549.258578 | url = http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~gf/papers/PhD%20-%20Graspable%20UIs/Thesis.gf.html | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Angus | first=Ian G. | last2=Sowizral | first2=Henry A. | editor-last=Fisher | editor-first=Scott S. | editor-last2=Merritt | editor-first2=John O. | editor-last3=Bolas | editor-first3=Mark T. | title=Embedding the 2D interaction metaphor in a real 3D virtual environment | publisher=SPIE | date=1995-03-30 | doi=10.1117/12.205875 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Poupyrev | first=I. | last2=Tomokazu | first2=N. | last3=Weghorst | first3=S. | title=Virtual Notepad: handwriting in immersive VR | publisher=IEEE Comput.

===== Microsoft KINECT =====
[[File:KinectSensor.png|thumb|Kinect Sensor]]

The [[Microsoft Kinect]] device offers us a different motion capture technology for tracking.

Instead of basing its operation on sensors, this is based on a [[Structured-light 3D scanner|structured light scanner]], located in a bar, which allows tracking of the entire body through the detection of about 20 spatial points, of which 3 different degrees of freedom are measured to obtain position, velocity and rotation of each point.

Its main advantage is ease of use, and the no requirement of an external device attached by the user, and its main disadvantage lies in the inability to detect the orientation of the user, thus limiting certain space and guidance functions.

===== Leap Motion =====
[[File:Leap Motion Controller.JPG|thumb|Leap Motion Controller]]The [[Leap Motion]] is a new system of tracking of hands, designed for small spaces, allowing a new interaction in 3D environments for desktop applications, so it offers a great fluidity when browsing through three-dimensional environments in a realistic way.
It is a small device that connects via USB to a computer, and used two cameras with infra-red light LED, allowing the analysis of a hemispheric area about 1 meter on its surface, thus recording responses from 300 frames per second, information is sent to the computer to be processed by the specific software company.

== 3D Interaction Techniques ==
3D Interaction Techniques are the different ways that the user can interact with the 3D [[virtual environment]] to execute different kind of tasks. The quality of these techniques has a profound effect on the quality of the entire 3D User Interfaces. They can be classified into three different groups: Navigation, Selection and manipulation and System control.

=== Navigation ===
Navigation is the most used by the user in big 3D environments and presents different challenges as supporting spatial awareness, giving efficient movements between distant places and making navigation bearable so the user can focus on more important tasks. These techniques can be divided into two components: travel and wayfinding.

==== Travel ====
Travel is a conceptual technique that consists in the movement of the viewpoint from one location to another. This orientation is usually handled in immersive virtual environments by [[head tracking]].
Exists five types of travel interaction techniques:
* '''Physical movement''': uses the user's body motion to move through the virtual environment. Is an appropriate technique when is required an augmented perception of the feeling of being present or when is required physical effort form the user.
*	'''Manual viewpoint manipulation''': the user's hands movements determine the displacement on the virtual environment. One example could be when the user moves their hands in a way that seems like is grabbing a virtual rope and pulls his self up. This technique could be easy to learn and efficient, but can cause fatigue.
*	'''Steering''': the user has to constantly indicate where to move. Is a common and efficient technique. One example of this are the gaze-directed steering, where the head orientation determines the direction of travel.
*	'''Target-based travel''': user specifies a destination point and the system effectuates the displacement. This travel can be executed by teleport, where the user is instantly moved to the destination point or the system can execute some transition movement to the destiny. These techniques are very simple from the user’s point of view because he only has to indicate the destination.
*	'''Route planning''': the user specifies the path that should be taken through the environment and the system executes the movement. The user may draw a path on a map of the virtual environment to plan a route. This technique allows users to control travel while they have the ability to do other tasks during motion.

==== Wayfinding ====
Is the cognitive process of defining a route for the virtual environment, using and acquiring spatial knowledge to construct a cognitive map of the virtual environment.

In order for a good wayfinding, users should receive wayfinding supports during the virtual environment travel to facilitate it because of the constraints from the virtual world.

These supports can be user-centered supports such as a large field-of-view or even non-visual support such as audio, or environment-centered support, artificial cues and structural organization to define clearly different parts of the environment. Some of the most used artificial cues are maps, compasses and grids, or even architectural cues like lighting, color and texture.

=== Selection and Manipulation ===
Selection and Manipulation techniques for 3D environments must accomplish at least one of three basic tasks: object selection, object positioning and object rotation.

==== Selection ====

The task of selecting objects or 3D volumes in a 3D environments requires first being able to find the desired target and then being able to select it. Most 3D datasets/environments are severed by occlusion problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Shneiderman | first=B. | title=The eyes have it: a task by data type taxonomy for information visualizations | publisher=IEEE Comput. Soc. Press | isbn=0-8186-7508-X | doi=10.1109/vl.1996.545307 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the first step  of finding the target relies on manipulation of the viewpoint or of the 3D data itself in order to properly identify the object or volume of interest. This initial step is then of course tightly coupled with manipulations in 3D. Once the target is visually identified, users have access to a variety of techniques to select it.

Usually, the system provides the user a 3D cursor represented as a human hand whose movements correspond to the motion of the hand tracker. This virtual hand technique &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Poupyrev | first=I. | last2=Ichikawa | first2=T. | last3=Weghorst | first3=S. | last4=Billinghurst | first4=M. | title=Egocentric Object Manipulation in Virtual Environments: Empirical Evaluation of Interaction Techniques | journal=Computer Graphics Forum | publisher=Wiley | volume=17 | issue=3 | year=1998 | issn=0167-7055 | doi=10.1111/1467-8659.00252 | pages=41–52 | ref=harv |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.95.4933&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is rather intuitive because simulates a real-world interaction with objects but with the limit of objects that we can reach inside a reach-area.

To avoid this limit, there are many techniques that have been suggested, like the Go-Go technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Poupyrev | first=Ivan | last2=Billinghurst | first2=Mark | last3=Weghorst | first3=Suzanne | last4=Ichikawa | first4=Tadao | title=The go-go interaction technique: non-linear mapping for direct manipulation in VR | website=ACM Digital Library | doi=10.1145/237091.237102 | url=http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/e-library/1998_1996/uist96.pdf | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows the user to extend the reach-area using a non-linear mapping of the hand: when the user extends the hand beyond a fixed threshold distance, the mapping becomes non-linear and the hand grows.

An other technique to select and manipulate objects in 3D virtual spaces consists in pointing at objects using a virtual-ray emanating from the virtual hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first=Mark R.|last=Mine |title=Virtual Environment Interaction Techniques |institution=Department of Computer Science University of North Carolina |date= 1995 | url=http://www.cs.unc.edu/techreports/95-018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ray intersects with the objects, it can be manipulated. Several variations of this technique has been made, like the aperture technique, which uses a conic pointer addressed for the user's eyes, estimated from the head location, to select distant objects. This technique also uses a hand sensor to adjust the conic pointer size.

Many other techniques, relying on different input strategies, have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Argelaguet | first=Ferran | last2=Andujar | first2=Carlos | title=A survey of 3D object selection techniques for virtual environments | journal=Computers &amp; Graphics | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=37 | issue=3 | year=2013 | issn=0097-8493 | doi=10.1016/j.cag.2012.12.003 | pages=121–136 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7ede/187b7b788fd65b0005c0500d9d5795a33487.pdf | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manipulation ====

3D Manipulations occurs before a selection task (in order to visually identify a 3D selection target) and after a selection has occurred, to manipulate the selected object. 3D Manipulations require 3 DOF for rotations (1 DOF per axis, namely x, y, z) and 3 DOF for translations (1 DOF per axis) and at least 1 additional DOF for uniform zoom (or alternatively 3 additional DOF for non-uniform zoom operations).

3D Manipulations, like navigation, is one of the essential tasks with 3D data, objects or environments. It is the basis of many 3D softwares (such as Blender, Autodesk, VTK) which are widely used. These software, available mostly on computers, are thus almost always combined with a mouse and keyboard. To provide enough DOFs (the mouse only offers 2), these software rely on modding with a key in order to separately control all the DOFs involved in 3D manipulations.With the recent avent of multi-touch enabled smartphones and tablets, the interaction mappings of these softwares have been adapted to multi-touch (which offers more simultaneous DOF manipulations than a mouse and keyboard). A survey conducted in 2017 of 36 commercial and academic mobile applications on Android and iOS however suggested that most applications did not provide a way to control the minimum 6 DOFs required,&lt;ref name="ComparisonArticle" /&gt; but that among those which did, most made use of a 3D version of the RST (Rotation Scale Translation) mapping: 1 finger is used for rotation around x and y, while two-finger interaction controls rotation around z, and translation along x, y, and z.

=== System Control ===
System control techniques allows the user to send commands to an application, change the interaction mode or modify a parameter. The command sender always includes the selection of an element from a set. 
System control techniques can be categorized into four groups: 
*	'''Graphical menus''': visual representations of commands. 
*	'''Voice commands''': menus accessed via voice. 
*	'''Gestural interaction''': command accessed via body gesture. 
*	'''Tools''': virtual objects with an implicit function or mode. 
Also exists different hybrid techniques that combine some of the types.

'''Charles Adrian Hobbs''' (born January 1946, in [[Ilkley, West Yorkshire|Ilkley]], West Yorkshire, UK) is a safety expert in vehicle [[crashworthiness]] with a background in accident and injury investigation, and analysis.

As an engineer and later as Honorary Chief Research Scientist, Hobbs has been involved in the UK Government’s programme of Crash Injury Research for nearly 30 years. A pioneer in his field, key highlights of his career include undertaking the research that helped lead to the mandatory wearing of the seat belt in the UK, the development of the Offset Deformable Frontal Barrier Crash Test and the establishment of the safety organisation [[Euro NCAP]].  Hobbs was awarded a [[C.B.E.]] in 2008.

Hobbs has provided advice to the World Bank (1), the [[World Health Organization]], the European Commission and Central European and North African countries on transport safety and the provision of emergency services (2-4).

==Safety career==
Hobbs joined the [[Transport Research Laboratory]] (TRL) in 1972 as a Scientific Officer. For two years he was involved in investigating accident causation – when the police were called to an accident, so was Hobbs. He spent time investigating the contributing factors to an accident. Was it the road user, vehicle, road or the surrounding environment? (5,6) In 1976 he reported on his analysis of brake defects and their contribution to accidents (7).

In 1974, his research attention turned to the study of car occupant injuries. He analysed and reported on the direct connection between the accident, resulting injuries, their causes and the effectiveness of safety features. He gathered medical data, inspected cars and sent questionnaires. His conclusions were clear: intrusion into the passenger compartment of the vehicle during a frontal impact accident played a very major role in causing injuries. (8-10)

As a result of this research, he realised how effective wearing a seat belt was in preventing serious injury to a vehicle’s occupant. In 1978, Adrian published a comprehensive study of the life-saving potential of seat belt wearing.(11-14) This study helped lead to the passing of the mandatory seat belt wearing legislation in the UK, which came into force on 31 January 1983. (15)

Hobbs then switched his research focus to vehicle safety and, in 1985, he designed a demonstration Pedestrian Safety Car (based on a Mini Metro). (16-21) He later modified this Pedestrian Safety Car to incorporate current thinking in Frontal and Side impact protection. (22,23) For side impact, conventional wisdom held that protection came from strengthening the side of the car and providing padding protection on the inside of the door. Hobbs expressed his concern that many manufacturers were simply fitting door beams, located where they could increase the risk of injury. (24-31) Hobbs's modifications did improve the car, but the car still did not provide good protection or meet the proposed side impact test requirements. Elsewhere in France, Germany, and the UK another vehicle was tested. Although much weaker than the modified Metro, this car performed better. Amazed, Hobbs set out to find out why and to truly understand the side impact injury process. He discovered that a lighter door rather than a heavier door bounces off the impacting car and starts moving the occupant earlier, increasing the time the body has to absorb the impact, so reducing the severity of injuries. He also discovered that when the door is controlled to move in vertically, it spreads the load over the chest, abdomen and pelvis consequently avoiding its concentration on the vulnerable chest area, reducing the possibility of a fatal injury. The provision of padding, Hobbs also concluded, had to be very soft to help spread the load and cushion the impact. (32-35) These conclusions and research directly contributed to the development of the European Side Impact Directive.

In the early 1990s, Hobbs  identified the inadequacies in the current frontal crash test procedure and his research led to the development of the Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) Frontal Impact Crash Test. (36-52). Hobbs's frontal ODB test was adopted, in Europe and elsewhere, for both legislation and consumer test programmes.

With this research under his belt, Hobbs took on the study of Compatibility, the science of how cars could work together to minimise injuries to the occupants of both vehicles. (53-57) Although the research identified what needed to be changed and an assessment procedure was developed, research funding dried up and government interest in further improving car crash safety was absent.

==Europe==
During the 1990s, Hobbs was an active member of the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) in particular of the Frontal Impact and the Compatibility Working Groups, which he initiated. He also collaborated with other working groups to develop test procedures for side impact and pedestrian protection.

Hobbs  was asked by the [[European Transport Safety Council]] (ETSC) to present the case for the adoption of the EEVC Frontal and Side Impact test procedures for European Type Approval at to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The EEVC was proposing an initial crash test speed of 56&amp;nbsp;km/h (approx. 30&amp;nbsp;mph) rather than the 60&amp;nbsp;km/h already used in research crash tests. The intention was that the test speed would later be increased to 60&amp;nbsp;km/h. This was at a European Parliament Inter-group meeting, with [[Max Mosley]] of the [[Federation Internationale de L’Automobile]] (FIA) as chairman. Industry was there to oppose – their concern was that cars could not be built to withstand the speeds proposed. Yet Max Mosley, profoundly moved by the recent death of [[Ayrton Senna]] on the race track, developed an increased interest in reducing the road accident injury toll. The death of a racing driver had spurred on the cause to improve car safety for the public and to prevent millions of deaths on European roads.

==A new consumer information programme==
Meanwhile, back in the UK Hobbs had been working on a proposal for an independent crash test programme called UK NCAP. His proposal, presented in 1994, outlined to the UK department of Transport the concept of a consumer information programme based on the EEVC proposed frontal impact, side impact and pedestrian protection crash test procedures. His reason for a consumer-based information car-testing programme was clear. He cited the New Car Assessment Programme in the US that had had a more significant effect on changing car design than any US legislative test. He also cited the magazine Auto Motor und Sport and the ADAC, in Germany, whose published car crash tests results were already influencing how manufacturers designed their cars, as they endeavoured to obtain good ratings in the published tests.

The Department of Transport agreed to go ahead with the proposal and initiated the first phase of tests and assessments. (58-60) Following further discussions with the European Commission, in Brussels, (61,62) Hobbs mentioned the proposal to Max Mosley. Mosley was inspired to help and make Hobbs’s wish for a Europe wide consumer test programme a reality. Called initially the UK NCAP programme it later came to be branded, with the support of the FIA and other European players, as Euro NCAP.

:"No politician would put in legislative standards that a manufacturer couldn’t meet. It was necessary to create a competitive market place for safety, which ensured that carmakers exceeded basic standards. It was imperative to empower the safety engineer in the heart of carmakers so that their managements made safety a priority"

==EURO NCAP==
Euro NCAP (the European New Car Assessment Programme) is now an established consumer-testing programme that assesses and publishes the safety of new cars and provides valuable safety information to consumers. Thousands of crash-tested cars later and the award of thousands of stars to industry, Euro NCAP has led to the establishment of other similar consumer programmes across the world and has contributed greatly to the safety of cars available on the European market.

Yet it all began with Hobbs’s persistence and a group of dedicated safety pioneers. The inaugural meeting of Euro NCAP was held in December 1996 with only a few members: the UK Department of Transport, the FIA, the Swedish National Road Association (SNRA) and International Testing.  The very first results of 7 crash-tested super-minis were released publicly to the media in early 1997, much to the consternation of industry. (63-67)

Hobbs was the first Chairman of the Technical Working Group and he later became Secretary General until his retirement in 2007.

Euro NCAP’s team of engineers and labs now carry out a frontal, side impact and pedestrian protection test as well as assessments on child protection and on the range of technologies existing within the car. Tests are carried out on all vehicles from super-minis to SUVs to the latest hybrids and petrol engines, resulting in a star rating with a maximum award of 5 stars. Special awards are also given to car makers with innovative technologies.

Safety achievements and developments in the industry, as a direct result of the work of Euro NCAP, have included the following:

For frontal impact protection: improved car structures limiting passenger compartment intrusion, so providing space for the restraints to operate without the occupants impacting the car’s interior, improved seat belts with pre-tensioners and load limiters, improved multi stage frontal airbags, removal of hazards in the knee impact area and knee protecting air bags.

For side impact protection: improved car side structures with airbags to protect the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis, and pole impact protection.

Additional achievements have been: car fronts with improved pedestrian protection, improved child occupant protection, provision of effective reminders to wear seat belts, promotion and greater introduction of technologies such as electronic stability controls, autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warnings.

==Personal life ==
Hobbs continues to provide consultancy on road and vehicle safety issues and provides advice to the media. He is a motor sport enthusiast having been a rally driver in his youth. Since retirement, he has become involved in supporting a number of local and national organisations. Since 1974, he has been married to Jacqueline, a retired teacher with a keen focus on special needs. Their adopted son Philip died in 2002, aged 28. Adrian and Jackie live together in Berkshire.

'''Anti-monumentalism''' (or '''Counter-monumentalism''') is a philosophy in art that denies the presence of any imposing, authoritative social force in public spaces. It developed as an opposition to monumentalism whereby authorities (usually the state or dictator) establish monuments in public spaces to symbolize themselves or their ideology, and influence the historical narrative of the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=counter-monuments |url=http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |publisher=Facing History and Ourselves |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415170228/http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to artist [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]],  anti-monument "refers to an action, a performance, which clearly rejects the notion of a monument developed from an elitist point of view as an emblem of power."&lt;ref name="ISBN 90-5662-236-6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano-Hemmer|first=Rafael|title=Alien Relationships with Public Space|journal=TransUrbanism|year=2002|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]]'s ''Bunker Hill Monument Projections''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh Mahan |first=Nicole |title=Krzysztof Wodiczko;s "If You See Something...": counter-memory and the role of the artist in Post-9/11 America |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414231038/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Do-Ho Suh]]'s ''Public Figures'' can be considered examples of anti-monumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shu|first=Do-Ho|title=The Anti-Monument|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2004.10-detail-korean-artist/|publisher=The Walrus|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Archigram''' was an [[avant-garde]] architectural group formed in the 1960s - based at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]], [[London]] - that was [[neofuturistic]], anti-heroic and  pro-consumerist, drawing inspiration from technology in order to create a new reality that was solely expressed through hypothetical projects. The main members of the group were [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]], [[Warren Chalk]], [[Ron Herron]], [[Dennis Crompton]], [[Michael Webb (architect)|Michael Webb]] and [[David Greene (architect)|David Greene]]. Designer [[Theo Crosby]] was the "hidden hand" behind the group.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sadler, ''Archigram: architecture without architecture'', MIT Press, 2005, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; He gave them coverage in ''Architectural Design'' magazine (where he was an editor from 1953–62), brought them to the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, where, in 1963, they mounted an exhibition called ''Living Cities'',&lt;ref&gt;Crosby raised the money for this from the Gulbenkian Foundation, and subsequently edited its publication in the ICA's ''Living Arts'' magazine: Sadler, ''op cit'', p.207&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1964 brought them into the Taylor Woodrow Design Group, which he headed, to take on experimental projects.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cook, ''Archigram'', Princeton Architectural Press, 1999, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet ''Archigram I'' was printed in 1961 to proclaim their ideas. Committed to a 'high tech', light weight, infra-structural approach that was focused towards survival technology, the group experimented with modular technology, mobility through the environment, space capsules and mass-consumer imagery. Their works offered a seductive vision of a glamorous future machine age; however, social and environmental issues were left unaddressed. 

Archigram agitated to prevent modernism from becoming a sterile and safe orthodoxy by its adherents. Unlike ephemeralisation from [[Buckminster Fuller]] which assumes more must be done with less material (because material is finite), Archigram relies on a future of interminable resources.

The works of Archigram had a [[neofuturistic]] slant being influenced by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]'s works. [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[Yona Friedman]] were also important sources of inspiration. The works of Archigram served as a source of inspiration for later works such as the [[High-tech architecture|High tech]] '[[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou centre]]' 1971 by  [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Renzo Piano]], early Norman Foster works, [[Gianfranco Franchini]] and [[Future Systems]]. By the early 1970s the strategy of the group had changed. In 1973 Theo Crosby wrote&lt;ref&gt;in ''How to play the environment game'', Penguin, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; that its members had "found their original impulses towards megastructures blunted by the changing intellectual climate in England, where the brash dreams of modern architects are received with ever-increasing horror. They are now more concerned with the infiltration of technology into the environment at a much less obvious level".

{{Cquote|If we consider for a moment [[Christo]]'s seminal work – the 'wrapped cliff' – we might see it in one of two ways: as a wrapped cliff or; preferably, as the point at which all other cliffs are unwrapped. An Archigram project attempts to achieve this same altered reading of the familiar (in the tradition of Buckminster Fuller's question, 'How much does your building weigh?'). It provides a new agenda where nomadism is the dominant social force; where time, exchange and metamorphosis replace stasis; where consumption, lifestyle and transience become the programme; and where the public realm is an electronic surface enclosing the globe —David Greene&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, Dennis (ed.) (1999). ''Concerning Archigram...'' London: Archigram Archives; prologue&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The group was financially supported by mainstream architects, such as [[David Rock (architect)|David Rock]] of [[Building Design Partnership|BDP]]. Rock later nominated Archigram for the [[RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] which they received in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/architecture/people/showcase/01-02/archigram.htm ''ARCHIGRAM - RIBA Royal Gold Medalists 2002''] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOX8Oikq?url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/architecture/people/showcase/01-02/archigram.htm |date=31 December 2010 }} Citation by '''David Rock''' retrieved 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sixpack France]] dedicated their Summer Spring 2009 Collection to this movement.

==Projects==
===Plug-in-City, Peter Cook, 1964===

Plug-in-City is a mega-structure with no buildings, just a massive framework into which dwellings in the form of cells or standardised components could be slotted. The machine had taken over and people were the raw material being processed, the difference being that people are meant to enjoy the experience.

===The Walking City, Ron Herron, 1964===

The [[Walking city|Walking City]] is constituted by intelligent buildings or robots that are in the form of giant, self-contained living pods that could roam the cities. The form derived from a combination of insect and machine and was a literal interpretation of le-Corbusier's aphorism of a house as a machine for living in. The pods were independent, yet parasitic as they could 'plug into' way stations to exchange occupants or replenish resources. The citizen is therefore a serviced nomad not totally dissimilar from today's executive cars. The context was perceived as a future ruined world in the aftermath of a nuclear war.

===Instant City ===

Instant City is a mobile technological event that drifts into underdeveloped, drab towns via air (balloons) with provisional structures (performance spaces) in tow. The effect is a deliberate overstimulation to produce mass culture, with an embrace of advertising aesthetics. The whole endeavor is intended to eventually move on leaving behind advanced technology hook-ups.

===Other projects===

Tuned City, in which Archigram's infrastructural and spatial additions attach themselves to an existing town at a percentage that leaves evidence of the previous development, rather than subsuming the whole.

The '''Association for Contextual Behavioral Science''' ('''ACBS''') is a worldwide nonprofit professional membership organization associated with [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), and [[relational frame theory]] (RFT) among other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JlqqlVJ1iTUC&amp;pg=PA256#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy  |author1=James D.

Chapters exist in the United States and Canada as well, including the mid-Atlantic, New England, Colorado, Washington, Ontario (CA) and several other areas. There are also 28 Special Interest Groups covering a wide range of basic and applied areas such as children and adolescents, developing nations, veteran's affairs, ACT for the Public, social work, stigma, and many other areas.

==Activities==
* ACBS sponsors an annual conference, the ''World Conference on Contextual Behavioral Science''. The 2017 (15th annual) meeting was held June 20–25, 2017, in Seville, Spain. The 2018 meeting will be held July 24-29, 2018, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The 2019 meeting will be held 25-30 June, 2019, in Dublin, Ireland.
* In 2012 [[Elsevier]] began publishing the flagship journal of ACBS, the ''Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contextualscience.org/JCBS|title=The Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science (JCBS) - Association for Contextual Behavioral Science|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/727090/description#description|title=Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science - 2212-1447 - Elsevier|first=|last=Elsevier|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of mid-2016, its impact factor according to SCImago, using the Thompson-Reuters formula, is 2.54.
* Other activities:
** A scholarship program that sponsors participants from the developing world to attend the World Conferences.
** Listservs for professionals and the public, as well as several list serves for specific language communities. Most chapters and SIGs maintain list serves as well. The largest listserv is on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and is for professionals who are ACBS members (see link below) with the second largest listserv focusing on Relational Frame Theory. (The ACT listserv for professionals spawned its own reference books of popular questions/topics called ''Talking ACT'' published by New Harbinger Publications and Context Press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130129185537/http://www.newharbinger.com/bookstore/productdetails.cfm?PC=523 Talking ACT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) There is also a free listserv for members of the public who are reading ACT self-help books (see link below).
** A small grant program for projects in contextual behavioral science.
** The ACBS site also hosts a podcast series available from [[iTunes]] called ''ACT in Context''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/act-in-context/id428173950 https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/act-in-context/id428173950]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association's website contains resources such as therapist tools, workshops, and assessment materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WCyFy08VilIC&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Social workers' desk reference  |author1=Albert R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15497">'''Attribute substitution''', also known as '''Substitution bias''', is a psychological process thought to underlie a number of [[cognitive bias]]es and [[optical illusion|perceptual illusions]]. It occurs when an individual has to make a judgment (of a ''target attribute'') that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] attribute''.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Benjamin R. |first2=David A. |last2=Lagnado |first3=David R. |last3=Shanks  |title=Straight choices: the psychology of decision making |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=71–74 |isbn=978-1-84169-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic ''intuitive'' judgment system, rather than the more self-aware ''reflective'' system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Associative processes in intuitive judgment|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S1364661310001713/abstract|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2010-01-10|issn = 1364-6613|pmid = 20696611|pages = 435–440|volume = 14|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.004|language = English|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Kahneman|pmc = 5378157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

The theory of attribute substitution unifies a number of separate explanations of reasoning errors in terms of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|cognitive heuristics]].&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt; In turn, the theory is subsumed by an ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K. Shah and [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]], which states that people use a variety of techniques to reduce the effort of making decisions.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In a 1974 paper, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] argued that a broad family of biases (systematic errors in judgment and decision) were explainable in terms of a few heuristics (information-processing shortcuts), including [[availability heuristic|availability]] and [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]]. In a 2002 revision of the theory, Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed attribute substitution as a process underlying these and other effects.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Shane |last2=Frederick  |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g., the brightness of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded neurally in a way that is independent of [[stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be unrelated.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

== Conditions ==
{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450 |width=30% |align=right}}
Kahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;
# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible. Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory ("What is your birthday?") or about current experience ("Do you feel thirsty now?).
# An associated attribute is highly accessible. This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life who is then asked about their happiness might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than answer the question as asked.
# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system. For example, when asked "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |date=December 2003 |title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics |journal= American Economic Review |publisher=American Economic Association |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1449–1475 |doi=10.1257/000282803322655392 |issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.

==Examples==
[[File:Opt taeuschung groesse.jpg|thumb|225px|right|This illusion works because 3D (perspective) size is substituted for 2D size (all pairs are equal in size)]]

===Optical illusions===
Attribute substitution explains the persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion. The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size on the page. Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt;

===Valuing insurance===
Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. The former group were willing to pay more even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.

===Stereotypes===
[[Stereotypes]] can be a source of heuristic attributes.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt; In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a [[stereotype]] about the relative [[intelligence]] of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.

===Morality and fairness===
[[Cass Sunstein|Sunstein]] argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]], or [[legal]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral Heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531–542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a "prototypical case") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of [[Authority bias|trusted]] political or religious [[Argument from authority|authorities]] can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405–434 |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |accessdate=2009-09-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021623/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics demanded more evidence from Sunstein.&lt;ref name="shah2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author-link2=Daniel M.

===The beautiful-is-familiar effect===
Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monin |first=Benoît |first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer |year=2005 |title=Correlated Averages vs. Averaged Correlations: Demonstrating the Warm Glow Heuristic Beyond Aggregation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–278 |issn=0278-016X |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Opp%20Demonstrating%20the%20Warm%20Glow%20Heuristic.pdf |doi=10.1521/soco.2005.23.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monin interprets this result in terms of attribute substitution. The heuristic attribute in this case is a "warm glow"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in the familiarity data is accounted for by attractiveness.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==Evidence==
The most direct evidence, according to Kahneman,&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt; is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of Tom&amp;nbsp;W., a fictional graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–51 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of subjects had to rate Tom's ''similarity'' to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate ''how likely'' it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by [[probability]], then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom is more likely to be a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.

In [[computer engineering]] and in [[programming language implementation]]s, a '''belt machine''' is a real or emulated computer that uses a ''first in, first out'' ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]) queue rather than individual machine [[processor register]]s to evaluate each sub-expression in the program.  A belt computer is programmed with an [[instruction set]] that specifies arguments explicitly but results implicitly.&lt;ref&gt;http://millcomputing.com/docs/belt/&lt;/ref&gt;

The common alternative to belt machines are [[register machine]]s, in which each instruction explicitly names the specific registers to use for locations of operand arguments and results. Belt machines are related to [[stack machine]]s, which specify both arguments and results implicitly using a pushdown [[Stack (data structure)|stack]]. Other alternatives are [[accumulator machine]]s, which have only one visible general-purpose temp register, and memory-to-memory machines, which have no visible temp registers.

A belt machine implements temporary storage with a fixed-length FIFO queue, or ''belt'' by analogy to a ''[[conveyor belt]]''. The operands of the [[arithmetic logic unit]]s (ALUs) and other functional units may be taken from any position on the belt, and the result from the computation is ''dropped'' (stored) in the front position of the belt, advancing the belt to make room. As the belt is fixed length, drops in the front are matched by older operands falling off the back; pushed-off operands become inaccessible and must be explicitly saved if still needed for later work. Most operations of the [[instruction set]] work only with data on the belt, not on data registers or main memory cells.

For a typical instruction like &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;, both argument operands come from explicitly named positions on the belt, and the result is dropped on the front, ready for the next instruction. Operations with multiple results simply drop more values at the belt front.  Most belt instructions are encoded as just an ''operation code'' ([[opcode]]) and two belt positions, with no added fields to specify a result register, memory address, or literal constant.  This encoding is easily extended to richer operations with more than two inputs or more than one result.  Constant operands are dropped by separate &lt;code&gt;load immediate&lt;/code&gt; instructions.  All access of program variables in main ''[[random-access memory]]'' (RAM) is segregated into separate &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; instructions containing one memory address, or some way to calculate that address from belt operands.

All belt machines have variants of the [[instruction set|load/store]] opcodes to access [[local variable]]s and the heap.  This can be by offsets, from a pointer on the belt, or from various special-purpose base registers. Similarly, there will be instructions to branch to an address taken from the belt, along with branches relative to the program counter.

== Temporal addressing ==
Because each drop of a result moves the prior belt content along to later positions in the queue, a given operand continually changes its position (and hence address) as a result of later execution. In effect, an access to the operand at position zero is a request for the most recent value dropped to the belt, while (for example) a reference to position five is to the sixth most recent drop. Thus the addresses of belt operands reflect the belt history over time. This is ''temporal addressing''. It is hard for human programmers to keep track of belt contents, and hence operand addresses, when writing assembly code for a belt machine. However, it is easy for a compiler to track the changing contents and emit the correct position addresses in generated code.

== Spill and fill ==
The belt is fixed length and may be too short to hold all live transient operands before they are pushed off the end. If an operand is needed for longer than its belt lifetime, it must be saved while still on the belt (spill) and later restored to the belt when needed again (fill). This situation is equivalent to the need to spill registers to memory when a program runs out of registers in a general-register machine. Spilled operands may be written to memory using normal store instructions, and restored using normal load instructions, or spill and fill may use special-purpose storage and associated operations that are faster or offer other advantages over load and store.

== Freedom from hazard ==
The operands on the belt are read-only. New results do not overwrite prior values. The belt is thus a [[Assignment (computer science)#Single assignment|single-assignment]] structure, and is immune to the [[Hazard (computer architecture)#Data hazards|data hazards]] that must be dealt with by modern out-of-order general-register machines.

== Compact object code ==
[[Instruction set#Code density|Dense machine code]] was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very costly and limited, even on [[mainframe computer]]s. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of [[minicomputer]]s, and then [[microprocessor]]s. Density remains important today, for applications for [[smartphone]], or downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ''[[read-only memory]]'' (ROM) for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch.

Belt machines have smaller instructions than register-based machines, due to not needing a destination address for results. This saving can make a significant difference for fixed-length instruction formats, which normally use power-of-two instruction widths. If there are thirty-two addressable elements (registers on a general-register machine, belt positions on a belt machine), then each element address occupies five bits in the instruction, needing 15 bits for the three-address format of a general-register machine, but only 10 bits using the two-address format of a belt machine. Because bits are also needed for opcode and other information in the instruction, the (power-of-two constrained) instruction width often determines the maximum number of addressable elements possible in a design. Typically a belt machine instruction can support the encoding of double the number of addressable elements compared to a general-register machine of the same instruction width. There are similar gains in variable-length instruction encodings.

Overall, belt machine code is less compact than for stack machines, which use no operand addresses, but often must introduce stack-manipulation instructions unneeded on a belt machine. The instructions for accumulator machines are not padded out with multiple register fields, instead, they use the return stack and need no extra memory reference instructions.

== Implementation ==
While a belt machine presents an operand queue as the program model, there is not necessarily a physical queue ([[shift register]]) in the implemented hardware. Instead, a belt design may use an implementation analogous to the [[register renaming]] common in modern general-register machines. Live data values are kept in conveniently addressable physical resources (individual registers, register files, [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM), or [[operand forwarding]] from functional units) and generally not moved for the duration of their belt lifetime. [[Instruction decoder]] maps logical belt positions to physical locations. The mapping is updated to reflect the changes of logical position arising from newly dropped results.

The belt-machine architecture was created by startup Mill Computing, Inc., for use in their [[Mill architecture]] family of general-purpose CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benchoff|first1=Brian|title=The Mill CPU Architecture|url=http://hackaday.com/2013/08/02/the-mill-cpu-architecture/|website=Hackaday|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blight''' refers to a specific [[sign]] affecting [[plant]]s in response to infection by a [[pathogenic]] [[organism]].

==Description==
Blight is a rapid and complete [[chlorosis]], browning, then death of plant [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s such as leaves, branches, twigs, or floral organs.&lt;ref&gt;Agrios, George N. 2005. ''Plant Pathology''. 5th ed, Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, many diseases that primarily exhibit this symptom are called blights. Several notable examples are:
* [[Phytophthora infestans|Late blight of potato]], caused by the [[water mold]] ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' (Mont.) de Bary, the disease which led to the [[Great Irish Famine]]
* Southern corn leaf blight, caused by the [[fungus]] ''[[Cochliobolus heterostrophus]]'' (Drechs.) Drechs, [[anamorph]] ''[[Bipolaris maydis]]'' (Nisikado &amp; Miyake) Shoemaker, incited a severe loss of corn in the United States in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, J.E. "Southern Corn Leaf Blight." 2003. 8 August 2006. {{cite web|url=http://nu-distance.unl.edu/homer/disease/agron/corn/CoSCLB.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723184952/http://nu-distance.unl.edu/homer/disease/agron/corn/CoSCLB.html |archivedate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chestnut blight]], caused by the fungus ''Cryphonectria parasitica'' (Murrill) Barr, has nearly completely eradicated mature [[American chestnut]]s in North America.
* [[Fireblight|Fire blight of pome fruits]], caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Erwinia amylovora]]'' (Burrill) Winslow et al., is the most severe disease of [[pear]] and also is found in [[apple]] and [[raspberry]], among others.
* Bacterial leaf blight of [[rice]], caused by the bacterium ''[[Xanthomonas oryzae]]'' (Uyeda &amp; Ishiyama) Dowson.&lt;ref&gt;Oda, M., Sekizawa, Y., and Watanabe, T. 1966. "[[Phenazine]]s as Disinfectants Against Bacterial Leaf Blight of the Rice Plant." ''Applied Microbiology'' 14(3):365-367.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early blight of potato and tomato, caused by species of the ubiquitous fungal genus ''[[Alternaria]]''
*Leaf blight of the grasses 
*[[Bur oak blight]], caused by the fungal pathogen ''Tubakia iowensis''.

On leaf tissue, symptoms of blight are the initial appearance of lesions which rapidly engulf surrounding tissue. However, [[leaf spot]]s may, in advanced stages, expand to kill entire areas of leaf tissue and thus exhibit blight symptoms.

Blights are often named after their causative agent, for example ''Colletotrichum'' blight is named after the fungi ''[[Colletotrichum capsici]]'', and ''Phytophthora'' blight is named after the water mold ''[[Phytophthora parasitica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Chase, A.

The '''Bowden development''' is an urban development in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] on a site formerly owned by the [[Clipsal]] corporation in the suburb of [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]], within the [[City of Charles Sturt]], in the [[Adelaide|Adelaide metropolitan area]] 2.5 kilometres from the city centre. 

The site covers an area of {{convert|10.25|ha}} and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the [[Outer Harbor railway line]] to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east. The Government also acquired the adjoining 5.9-hectare site which had been owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site). Currently the overall Bowden development site is 16.3 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/about/progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The development is expected to be completed by 2020 to 2025. The development is expected to increase the population of Bowden, which was 648 in the 2006 census, to 3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC41161|name=Bowden (State Suburb)|accessdate=2008-06-07| quick=on}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainability initiatives==

The Bowden development is leading the way with many groundbreaking initiatives including energy reduction through passive and active measures for buildings. [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] is a world's best practice rating tool from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]] covering a broad range of well-tested sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Developer-Green-Star-Fact-Sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every building delivered in the development must achieve a minimum 5 Star Green Star rating&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/bowden-development/&lt;/ref&gt; including commercial buildings such as '''Plant 4 Bowden'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/plant-4-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Bowden development raised the bar and achieved its 6 Star Green Star - Communities accreditation; and with the highest concentration of Green Star homes in Australia, it is one of the most environmentally sustainable communities in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, the Prince's Terraces Adelaide in Bowden became the first residential project to receive 6 Star Green Star design rating from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/princes-terrace-adelaide/&lt;/ref&gt;, encapsulating innovation and world leadership in sustainable design.

==History==
[[File:Bowden clipsal.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The Clipsal factory in Bowden in the foreground]] 
The Bowden site was occupied by Clipsal, a company manufacturing conduit and electrical accessories, in 1936. The opportunity for an urban development on the site grew out of the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]]'s plans for eleven [[transport-oriented development]]s in the Adelaide metropolitan area, combined with Clipsal's decision that the Bowden site is surplus to company requirements and plan to vacate. The site was originally offered for sale in early 2008 with offers to be received by July 2008. Offers in the realm of 75 to 80 million Australian dollars were expected however evidently not attained; as the [[2008 economic crisis]] accelerated and falling property prices diminished the likelihood of a sale at expected prices, the South Australian government intervened and announced in October 2008 that it would purchase the site. It was revealed in November 2008 the government had agreed to pay A$52.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id%3D3956%26print%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075532/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3956 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===2008–2010===

In late 2008, the State Government acquired a 10.25ha parcel of land owned by Gerard Industries (known as the Clipsal site). In early 2010, the government acquired the adjoining 5.9ha site owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site).

Both sites are located within the [[City of Charles Sturt]] and are directly adjacent to the Adelaide parklands. The aim is to transform the combined sites into an inner-city, higher intensity, mixed use urban village. The final vision developed collaboratively with the community and stakeholders states: “Bowden Urban Village is a creative and diverse community, living and working in a high density sustainable urban environment. Its character, parklands connections and  integrated urban design will offer a new and distinctive place in Adelaide for residents and visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Australian Government anticipates that the site will be used to develop more than 2,400 residential apartments and terrace homes, in addition to retail outlets and commercial offices around a town centre.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian Government is promoting the plan as an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/housing-for-clipsal-site/1342897.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden is served by [[Bowden railway station]], [[North Adelaide railway station]], buses on Hawker Street and Port Road, and the tram from the nearby [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] on Port Road, Hindmarsh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-34.9043904,138.5777874,17z?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Charles visits Bowden SA.jpg|left|thumb|190x190px|Prince Charles launched the Prince's Terraces in Bowden]]

===2011–2015===

In April 2011, the plans for the development were approved &lt;ref name="approval"&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bowden-tod-gets-the-nod/story-e6frea83-1226043678620 Adelaide Now].&lt;/ref&gt; and an information and sales centre opened in March 2012.

Following demolition, site cleanup, surveying, planning and approval, remediation and development are underway. Bowden’s first pedestrian and bicycle-friendly streets — Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and part of Gibson Streets — opened to the public in May 2013.

In 2014, the restaurant '''Jarmer's Kitchen''' opened&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/jarmers-kitchen-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Bowden development's first residents moved in&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/first-residents-now-call-bowden-home/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2015, His Royal Highness Prince [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] officially launched the construction of Australia's first 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] residential project, the '''Prince's Terraces Adelaide''' which is predicted to use 50% less energy and 50% less potable water than a typical urban townhouse, with a carbon footprint also reduced by more than 40% when compared to a standard house.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/princes-terrace-adelaide-breaking-ground/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bowden Town Square opening in 2016.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Bowden Town Square opening community celebration]]

===2016-2017===

The community celebrated the completion of a major upgrade to the [[Adelaide Park Lands]] across the road from Bowden in February 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/time-celebrate-bowdens-new-front-yard/&lt;/ref&gt; where the '''Park Terrace Community Garden''' currently resides.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/bowden-life/community-garden/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowden development achieved its sustainability milestone with a 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] - Communities rating in October 2016, and hosted its biggest celebration ever to mark the opening of Bowden Town Square consisting '''Bowden Park''', the '''Plant 4 Bowden''' retail hub and '''Plant 3''' community hub.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, 500 new homes were sold.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/bowden-moving-forward-500-homes-sold-new-developers-block/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Card sorting''' is a technique in [[user experience design]] in which a person tests a group of subject experts or users to generate a [[dendrogram]] (category tree) or [[folksonomy]]. It is a useful approach for designing [[information architecture]], workflows, menu structure, or web site navigation paths.

Card sorting uses a relatively low-tech approach. The person conducting the test (usability analyst, user experience designer, etc.) first identifies key concepts and writes them on  [[index card]]s or [[Post-it note]]s. Test subjects, individually or sometimes as a group, then arrange the cards to represent how they see the structure and relationships of the information.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 1995" &gt;{{cite web

Groups can be organized as collaborative groups ([[focus groups]]) or as repeated individual sorts. The literature discusses appropriate numbers of users needed to produce trustworthy results.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2004" &gt;{{cite web

A card sort is commonly undertaken when designing a navigation structure for an environment that offers a variety of content and functions, such as a web site.&lt;ref name="Boxes and Arrows"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, the items to organize are those significant in the environment. The way the items are organized should make sense to the target audience and cannot be determined from [[first principles]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The field of [[information architecture]] is founded on the study of the structure of information. If an accepted and standardized [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] exists for a subject, it would be natural to apply that taxonomy to organize both the information in the environment, and any navigation to particular subjects or functions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Card sorting is useful when:
* The variety of items to organize is so great that no existing taxonomy is accepted as organizing the items.
* Similarities among the items make them difficult to divide clearly into categories.
* Members of the audience that uses the environment differ significantly in how they view the similarities among items and the appropriate groupings of items.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Basic method==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
To perform a card sort:
# A person representative of the audience receives a set of index cards with terms written on them.
# This person groups the terms in whatever way they think is logical, and gives each group a category name, either from an existing card or by writing a name on a blank card.
# Testers repeat this process across a group of test subjects.
# The testers later analyze the results to discover patterns.

==Variants==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
===Open card sorting===
In an '''open card sort''', participants create their own names for the categories. This helps reveal not only how they mentally classify the cards, but also what terms they use for the categories. Open sorting is '''generative'''; it is typically used to discover patterns in how participants classify, which in turn helps generate ideas for organizing information.

===Closed card sorting===
In a '''closed card sort''', participants are provided with a predetermined set of category names. They then assign the index cards to these fixed categories. This helps reveal the degree to which the participants agree on which cards belong under each category. Closed sorting is '''evaluative'''; it is typically used to judge whether a given set of category names provides an effective way to organize a given collection of content.

===Reverse card sorting===
In a '''reverse card sort''' (more popularly called [[tree testing]]), an existing structure of categories and sub-categories is tested. Users are given tasks and are asked to complete them navigating a collection of cards. Each card contains the names of subcategories related to a category, and the user should find the card most relevant to the given task starting from the main card with the top-level categories. This ensures that the structure is evaluated in isolation, nullifying the effects of navigational aids, visual design, and other factors. Reverse card sorting is '''evaluative'''—it judges whether a predetermined hierarchy provides a good way to find information.

==Analysis==
Various methods can be used to analyze the data. The purpose of the analysis is to extract patterns from the population of test subjects, so that a common set of categories and relationships emerges. This common set is then incorporated into the design of the environment, either for navigation or for other purposes. Card sorting is also evaluated through [[dendrogram]]s. There is some indication that different evaluation methods for card sorting provide different results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Card sorting is an established technique with an emerging literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Donna |date=2009 |title=Card Sorting: Designing Usable Categories |url=http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/card-sorting/ |publisher=Rosenfeld Media |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=978-1-933820-02-6 |oclc=761032171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}

==Online (remote) card sorting==
A number of web-based tools are available to perform card sorting. The perceived advantage of web-based card sorting is that it reaches a larger group of participants at a lower cost. The software can also help analyze the sort results. A perceived disadvantage of a remote card sort is the lack of personal interaction between card sort participants and the card sort administrator, which may produce valuable insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tullis|first1=Tom|title=Card-sorting Tools|url=http://measuringuserexperience.com/cardsorting/index.htm|website=Measuring User Experience|page=1|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability''' ('''CIRS''') is located at the [[University of British Columbia|University of British Columbia's]] (UBC) Point Grey Campus in Vancouver.  The building is dedicated to research collaboration and outreach on urban sustainability.  It was officially opened in November 2011.

The CIRS vision is to be the most innovative high performance building in North America and an internationally recognized leader in accelerating the adopt of sustainable building and urban practices.&lt;ref name="mvg"&gt;http://cirs.ubc.ca/about/mission-vision-goals&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some key features:
* 600 tons of carbon dioxide sequestered in the structure &lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzNZO7WXBw4&lt;/ref&gt;
* Campus energy consumption reduced by 275 megawatt-hours per year &lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;
* Water 100% supplied by rainwater &lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;
* Campus carbon dioxide emissions reduced by 150 tons each year&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;
It has been certified [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum by the [[Canada Green Building Council]].&lt;ref name="CaGBC page"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED Scorecard, Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability|url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/sites/cirs.ubc.ca/files/pageUploads/Scorecard-CIRS-LEED_Canada-NC-Scorecard-130912.pdf|publisher=[[Canada Green Building Council]]|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
* Develop applied technical solutions in building materials and design for commercialization by partners.&lt;ref name="mvg" /&gt;
* Combine expert knowledge and public values and preferences in exploring pathways to a sustainable society.&lt;ref name="mvg" /&gt;
* Collaborate with private, public and non-governmental organization sector partners to create superior policy and business decisions for sustainable urban development.&lt;ref name="mvg" /&gt;
* Educate, train and demonstrate sustainable technologies and services and the practices of sustainable urban development.&lt;ref name="mvg" /&gt;

==Goals==
* Be a world leader in three critical areas of sustainability research: technology, communication, participation and behaviour change, and policy and investment.&lt;ref name="mvg" /&gt;
* Make real progress on sustainability in the region and transform the UBC campus into a testing ground for alternative energy sources, and technologies.&lt;ref name="mvg" /&gt;
* Be an incubator for sustainability technologies and capitalize on the enormous export potential to enter the trillion-dollar global urban infrastructure market.&lt;ref name="mvg" /&gt;

==History==
The CIRC was conceived in 2000 by Professor John Robinson and designed by Peter Busby who excelled in green building designs.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221063617/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/history |archivedate=2012-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they organized and talked to potential partners which led to Alberto Cayuela, formally an employee of Stantec and now associate director responsible for CIRS, joining the team as program manager.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Once funding and concept was decided, the location was chosen.  Originally, it was to be built on the UBC Point Grey campus, but, because CIRS was an inter-instituational project (UBC leads the project in conjunction with Simon Fraser University, BC Institute of Technology, and Emily Carr University of Art + Design) it was felt that the Great Northern Way campus would be a better position.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  In line with the idea of an inter-institutional project, the new position would expand its scope and breadth.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 2008, the decision to move CIRS back to UBC Point Grey campus was made due to delays to the project timeline brought on by the complexity of building on the Great Northern Campus.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Although, now only one institution (UBC) owned CIRS, other institutions continued to participate through other means.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Construction began in 2009 with excavation and foundation work for the first six months with the building being complete in August 2011.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Building Benefits==

===Structural Systems===
The CIRS is constructed of wood and allows for various benefits such as reducing ecological impact, sequestering carbon, helping the mitigation of an ecological problem, bringing warmth to the building interiors, and also maximizing daylight and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/structural-systems# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132359/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/structural-systems# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building Materials===
The primary exterior material is white brick, clear glazing, wood, and neutral colored concrete.  The benefits are the reduction of 'red list' materials, improvement of indoor air quality, reduction of material waste, and reduction of carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/building-materials# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216140017/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/building-materials# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Systems===
The CIRS achieves a net-positive energy performance and reduces UBC's overall energy consumption by over 1 million kilowatt hours per year. The energy system benefits the project by providing a comparison between energy modelling processes, allows for more opportunities for research and system testing, inspire a new approach to energy supply/consumption, reduce heat demand and carbon emissions of neighboring buildings, and provide opportunities for continued learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/energy-systems# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216140005/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/energy-systems# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rainwater System===
CIRS is entirely water self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and stored in a 100-cubic-meter cistern underneath the building.  Around 1,226,000 litres of rainwater is harvested throughout the year, and average demand is 2000 litres per day.  The benefits of a rainwater potable water system is that it creates awareness, educates the public on water supply/consumption, reduces potable water demand, promotes stormwater management, and provides an onsite water source for fire suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/rainwater-system# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135941/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/rainwater-system# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reclaimed Water===
All the reclaimed water originates either from the CIRS building or sewer system which is treated onsite using a Solar Aquatics wastewater treatment system and reused in the building for toilet flushing and to irrigate the living roof, landscaped areas and the living wall.  The main benefit of this treatment system is awareness and engaging the public in viewing sustainability as a possibility.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/reclaimed-water# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135953/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/reclaimed-water# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lighting===
Narrow floor plates allowed for daylight penetration and light to enter the building from both sides.  The benefits is that it improves the inhabitant health and comfort, creates a friendly space, reduces energy consumption and cost, and provides a surface for photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/lighting# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132349/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/lighting# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventilation===
The CIRS uses a mixed mode system utilizing mostly passive natural ventilation.  There are two mechanical air handling units that supply fresh filtered air: one to the large auditorium and the other to the rest of the building.  In addition, there are manual operable windows that allows for airflow and temperature control.  This system reduces energy consumption, connects the inhabitants with nature, and improve their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/ventilation# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132404/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/ventilation# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Recognition==
The CIRS has been publicly recognized by many as "North America's Greenest Building" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.thomasnet.com/green_clean/2011/12/05/university-of-british-columbia-claims-credit-for-north-americas-greenest-building/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317110349/http://news.thomasnet.com/green_clean/2011/12/05/university-of-british-columbia-claims-credit-for-north-americas-greenest-building/ |archivedate=2013-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greenest buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awaken.com/2012/09/five-of-the-greenest-buildings-in-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently in 2013, the CIRS won the Green Building Award awarded by the Wood WORKS! BC Wood Design Awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/2013-bc-wood-design-awards-announced/1002120145/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clinical biologist''' is a [[health professional]] such as, a [[Physician|doctor]] in [[medicine]], [[pharmacist]], [[biologist]] that is specialized in [[clinical biology]], a medical specialty derived from [[clinical pathology]]. The concept includes [[interventional biology]] which is like [[assisted reproductive technology]].

These professionals follow a [[medical residency]] whose duration varies between countries (from 3 to 5 years).

This term is frequently used in France, Belgium and other countries in Western Europe, Africa or Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3620">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], [[covariance]] is a measure of how much two variables change together, and the '''covariance function''', or '''kernel''', describes the spatial or temporal covariance of a random variable process or field. For a [[random field]] or [[stochastic process]] ''Z''(''x'') on a domain ''D'', a covariance function ''C''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') gives the covariance of the values of the random field at the two locations ''x'' and ''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;C(x,y):=\operatorname{cov}(Z(x),Z(y)).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The same ''C''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is called the [[autocovariance]] function in two instances: in [[time series]] (to denote exactly the same concept except that ''x'' and ''y'' refer to locations in time rather than in space), and in multivariate random fields (to refer to the covariance of a variable with itself, as opposed to the [[cross covariance]] between two different variables at different locations, ''Cov''(''Z''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;''Y''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Multivariate Geostatistics|first=Hans|last=Wackernagel|year=2003|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissibility ==
For locations ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''D'' the variance of every linear combination

:&lt;math&gt;X=\sum_{i=1}^N w_i Z(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(X)=\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N w_i C(x_i,x_j) w_j.&lt;/math&gt;

A function is a valid covariance function if and only if&lt;ref name="Cressie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics for Spatial Data|first=Noel A.C.|last=Cressie|year=1993|publisher=Wiley-Interscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; this variance is non-negative for all possible choices of ''N'' and weights ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;. A function with this property is called [[Positive-definite kernel|positive definite]].

== Simplifications with stationarity ==
In case of a weakly [[Stationary process|stationary]] [[random field]], where

:&lt;math&gt;C(x_i,x_j)=C(x_i+h,x_j+h)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for any lag ''h'', the covariance function can be represented by a one-parameter function

:&lt;math&gt;C_s(h)=C(0,h)=C(x,x+h)\,&lt;/math&gt;

which is called a ''covariogram'' and also a ''covariance function''. Implicitly the ''C''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) can be computed from ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''h'') by:

:&lt;math&gt;C(x,y)=C_s(y-x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Positive-definite function|positive definiteness]] of this single-argument version of the covariance function can be checked by [[Bochner's theorem]].&lt;ref name="Cressie"/&gt;

== Parametric families of covariance functions ==

A simple stationary parametric covariance function is the "exponential covariance function"

:&lt;math&gt;
C(d) = \exp(-d/V)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is a scaling parameter, and ''d''=''d''(''x'',''y'') is the distance between two points.  Sample paths of a [[Gaussian process]] with the exponential covariance function are not smooth.  The "squared exponential covariance function"

:&lt;math&gt;
C(d) = \exp(-(d/V)^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

is a stationary covariance function with smooth sample paths.

The [[Matérn covariance function]] and [[rational quadratic covariance function]] are two parametric families of stationary covariance functions.  The Matérn family includes the exponential and squared exponential covariance functions as special cases.

'''Einstellung''' is the development of a mechanized state of mind. Often called a [[problem solving]] set, Einstellung refers to a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist. The Einstellung effect is the negative effect of previous experience when solving new problems. The Einstellung effect has been tested experimentally in many different contexts. The most famous example (which led to Luchins and Luchins' coining of the term){{cn|date=May 2016}} is the Luchins' water jar experiment, in which subjects were asked to solve a series of water jar problems. After solving many problems which had the same solution, subjects applied the same solution to later problems even though a simpler solution existed (Luchins, 1942).&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"&gt;{{harvnb|Luchins|1942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments on the Einstellung effect can be found in ''The Effect of Einstellung on Compositional Processes''{{sfn|Dronek|Blessing|2006}} and ''Rigidity of Behavior, A Variational Approach to the Effect of Einstellung''.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959}}

==Background==
Einstellung literally means "setting" or "installation" as well as a person's "attitude" in German.  Related to Einstellung is what is referred to as an Aufgabe (literally, "task" in German).  The Aufgabe is the situation which could potentially invoke the Einstellung effect.  It is a task which creates a tendency to execute a previously applicable behavior.  In the Luchins and Luchins experiment a water jar problem served as the Aufgabe, or task.

Another phenomenon similar to Einstellung is [[functional fixedness]] (Duncker 1945).{{sfn|Duncker|1945}} Functional fixedness is an impaired ability to discover a new use for an object, owing to the subject's previous use of the object in a functionally dissimilar context. It can also be deemed a cognitive bias that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used. Duncker also pointed out that the phenomenon occurs not only with physical objects, but also with mental objects or concepts (a point which lends itself nicely to the phenomenon of Einstellung effect).

The Einstellung effect occurs when a person is presented with a problem or situation that is similar to problems they have worked through in the past.  If the solution (or appropriate behavior) to the problem/situation has been the same in each past experience, the person will likely provide that same response, without giving the problem too much thought, even though a more appropriate response might be available.  Essentially, the Einstellung effect is one of the human brain's ways of finding an appropriate solution/behavior as efficiently as possible. Note, however, that although finding the solution is efficient, the solution found might not necessarily be the ''most'' appropriate solution.

==Luchins and Luchins water jar experiment==
The water jar test, first described in Abraham Luchins 1942 classic experiment,&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt; is a commonly cited example of an Einstellung situation. The experiment's participants were given the following problem: you have 3 water jars, each with the capacity to hold a different, fixed amount of water; figure out how to measure a certain amount of water using these jars. It was found that subjects used methods that they had used previously to find the solution even though there were quicker and more efficient methods available. The experiment shines light on how mental sets can hinder the solving of novel problems. 

In Luchins experiment, subjects were divided into two groups. The experimental group was given five practice problems, followed by 4 critical test problems. The control group did not have the five practice problems. All of the practice problems and some of the critical problems had only one solution, which was "B minus A minus 2&amp;middot;C.” For example, one is given Jar A capable of holding 21 units of water, B capable of holding 127, and C capable of holding 3. If an amount of 100 units must be measured out, the solution is to fill up Jar B and pour out enough water to fill A once and C twice. 

One of the critical problems was called the extinction problem.  The extinction problem was a problem that could not be solved using the previous solution B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C.  In order to answer the extinction problem correctly, one had to solve the problem directly and generate a novel solution.  An incorrect solution to the extinction problem indicated the presence of the Einstellung effect.  The problems after the extinction problem again had two possible solutions.  These post-extinction problems helped determine the recovery of the subjects from the Einstellung effect.  

The critical problems could be solved using this solution (B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C) or a shorter solution (A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;C or A&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;C).  For example, subjects were instructed to get 18 units of water from jars with capacities 15, 39, and 3. Despite the presence of a simpler solution (A&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;C), subjects in the experimental group tended to give the lengthier solution in lieu of the shorter one.  Instead of simply filling up Jars A and C, most subjects from the experimental group preferred the previous method of B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C, whereas virtually all of the control group used the simpler solution. When Luchins and Luchins gave experimental group subjects the warning, "Don't be blind," over half of them used the simplest solution to the remaining problems.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|p=368}} Thus, this warning helped reduce the prevalence of the Einstellung effect among the experimental group.  

The results of the water jars experiment illustrates the concept of Einstellung.  The majority of the experimental subjects adopted a mechanized state of mind and relied on mental sets formed through previous experience. However, the experimental subjects would have been more efficient if they had employed the direct method of solving the problem rather than applying the same solution from previous examples.

==Explanations and interpretations==
The Einstellung effect can be supported by theories of [[inductive reasoning]].  In a nutshell, inductive reasoning is the act of inferring a rule based on a finite number of instances.  Most experiments on human inductive reasoning involve showing subjects a card with an object (or multiple objects, or letters, etc.) on it.  The objects can vary in number, shape, size, color, etc., and the subject's job is to answer (initially by guessing) "yes" or "no" whether (or not) the card is a positive instance of the rule (which must be inferred by the subject).  Over time, the subjects do tend to learn the rule, but the question is ''how''?  Kendler and Kendler (1962){{sfn|Kendler|Kendler|1962}} proposed that older children and adults tend to exhibit ''noncontinuity theory''; that is, the subjects tend to pick a reasonable rule and assume it to be true until it proves false.  Regarding Einstellung effect, one can view noncontinuity theory as a way of explaining the tendency to maintain a specific behavior until it fails to work.  In the water-jar problem, subjects generated a specific rule because it seemed to work in all situations; when they were given problems for which the same solution worked, but a better solution was possible, they still gave their ''tried and true'' response.  Where theories of inductive reasoning tend to diverge from the idea of Einstellung effect is when analyzing the fact that, even after an instance where the Einstellung rule failed to work, many subjects reverted to the old solution when later presented with a problem for which it did work (again, this problem also had a better solution).  One way to explain this observation is that in actuality subjects know (consciously) that the same solution might not always work, yet since they were presented with so many instances where it did work, they still tend to test that solution before any other (and so if it works, it will be the first solution found).

Neurologically, the idea of [[synaptic plasticity]], which is an important neurochemical explanation of memory, can help to understand the Einstellung effect.  Specifically, [[Hebbian theory]] (which in many regards is the neuroscience equivalent of original [[associationism|associationist]] theories) is one explanation of synaptic plasticity (Hebb, 1949).{{sfn|Hebb|1949}} It states that when two associated neurons frequently fire together – while infrequently firing apart from one another – the strength of their association tends to become stronger (making future stimulation of one neuron even more likely to stimulate the other).  Since the frontal lobe is most often attributed with the roles of planning and problem solving, if there is a neurological pathway which is fundamental to the understanding of Einstellung effect, the majority of it most likely falls within the frontal lobe. Essentially, a Hebbian explanation of Einstellung could be as follows: [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] are presented in such a way that the subject recognizes him or herself as being in a situation which he or she has been in before.  That is, the subject sees, hears, smells, etc., an environment which is akin to an environment which he or she has been in before.  The subject then must process the stimuli which are presented in such a way that he or she exhibits a behavior which is appropriate for the situation (be it run, throw, eat, etc.).  Because neural growth is, at least in part, due to the associations between two events/ideas, it follows that the more a given stimulus is followed by a specific response, the more likely that in the future that stimulus will invoke the same response.  Regarding the Luchins’ experiment,&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt; the stimulus presented was a water-jar problem (or to be more technical, the stimulus was a piece of paper which had words and numbers on it which, when interpreted correctly, portray a water-jar problem) and the invoked response was B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C.  While it is a bit of a stretch to assume that there is a direct connection between a ''water-jar problem'' and ''B''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''C'' within the brain, it is not unreasonable to assume that the specific neural connections which are active during a water-jar problem-state and those that are active when one thinks “take the second term, subtract the first term, then subtract two of the third term” tend to increase in the amount of overlap as more and more instances where B&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2C works are presented.

==Other Einstellung research==

===Psychological stress===
The following experiments were designed to gauge the effect of different [[Stress (medicine)|stressful]] situations on the Einstellung effect.  Overall, these experiments show that stressful situations increase the prevalence of the Einstellung effect.

====The speed test====
Luchins gave an elementary-school class a set of water jar problems.  In order to create a stressful situation, experimenters told the students that the test would be timed, that the speed and accuracy of the test would be reviewed by their principal and teachers, and that the test would affect their grades.  To further agitate the students during the test, experimenters were instructed to comment on how much slower the children were compared to children in lower grades.  The experimenters observed anxious, stressed, and sometimes tearful faces during the experiment.

The results of the experiment indicated that the stressful speed test situation increased rigidity.  Luchins found that only three of the ninety-eight students tested were able to solve the extinction problem, and only two students used the direct method for the critical problems.  The same experiment conducted under non-stress conditions showed 70% rigidity during the test problems and 58% failure of the extinction problem, while the anxiety-inducing situation showed 98% and 97% respectively.

The speed test was performed with college students as well, which yielded similar results.  Even when college students were told ahead of time to use the direct method in order to avoid mistakes made by children, the college students continued to exhibit rigidity under time pressure.  The results of these studies showed that the emphasis on speed increased the Einstellung effect on the water jar problems.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=120–122}}

====Maze tracing====
Luchins also instructed subjects to draw a solution through a maze without crossing any of the maze’s lines. The maze was either traced normally or traced using the mirror reflection of the maze.  If the subject drew over the lines of the figure, they had to start at the beginning, which was disadvantageous since the subject was told that their score depended on the time and smoothness of the solution. The mirror-tracing situation was the stressful situation, and the normal tracing was the non-stressful, control situation.  Experimenters observed that the mirror-tracing task caused more drawing outside the boundaries, increased overt signs of stress and anxiety, and required more time to accurately complete.  The mirror-tracing situation produced 89% Einstellung solution on the first two criticals instead of the 71% observed for normal tracing.  In addition, 55% of the subjects failed with the mirror while only 18% failed without the mirror.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=123–124}}

====Hidden-word test for stutterers====
In 1951, Solomon{{sfn|Solomon|1951}} gave both [[Stuttering|stutterers]] and fluent-speakers a hidden-word test, an arithmetical test, and a mirror-maze test.   Experimenters called the hidden-word test a “speech test” to increase stutterer anxiety.  There were no marked differences between the stutterers and the fluent-speakers for the arithmetical and mirror-maze tests.  However, the results reveal a [[Statistical significance|significant difference]] between the performance of the stutterers and the fluent-speakers on the "speech test."  On the first two critical problems, 58 percent of the stutterers gave Einstellung solutions whereas only 4 percent of the fluent speakers showed Einstellung effects.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|p=126}}

===Age===
The original Luchins and Luchins experiment tested nine-, ten-, eleven-, and twelve-year-olds for the Einstellung effect.&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt; The older groups showed more Einstellung effects than the younger groups in general.  However, this initial study did not control for differences in educational level and intelligence.  

To remedy this problem, Ross (1952){{sfn|Ross|1952}} conducted a study on middle-aged (mean 37.3 years) and older adults (mean 60.8 years).  The adults were grouped according to the I.Q., years of schooling, and occupation.  Ross administered five Einstellung tests including the arithmetical (water jar) test, the maze test, the hidden-word test, and two other tests.  For every test, the middle-aged group performed better than the older group.  For example, 65% of the older adults failed the extinction task of the arithmetical test, whereas only 29% of the middle-aged adults failed the extinction problem.  

Luchins devised another experiment to determine the difference between Einstellung effects in children and in adults.  In this study, 140 fifth-graders (mean 10.5 years) were compared to 79 college students (mean 21 years) and 21 adults (mean 43 years).  Einstellung effects prior to the extinction task increased with age: the observed Einstellung effects for the extinction task were 56, 68, and 69 percent for young adults, children, and older adults respectively.  This implies that there exists a curvilinear relationship between age and the recovery from the Einstellung Effect.  A similar experiment conducted by Heglin in 1955, also found this relationship when the three age groups were equated for I.Q.

Therefore, the initial manifestation of the Einstellung effect on the arithmetic test increases with age.  However, the recovery from the Einstellung effect is greatest for young adults (average age 21 years) and decreases as you move away from this age.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=237–242}}

In Luchins and Luchins original experiment with 483 children, they found that boys demonstrated less Einstellung effects than girls.&lt;ref name="Luchins1942"/&gt;  The experimental difference was only significant for the group that was instructed to write “Don’t be blind” on their papers after the sixth problem (the DBB group).  “Don’t be blind” was meant as a reminder to pay attention and guard against rigidity for the sixth problem.  However, this message was interpreted in many different ways including thinking of the message as just some more words to remember.  The alternative interpretations occurred more frequently in girls and increased with IQ score within the female group.  This difference in interpretation of DBB may account for the fact that the male DBB group showed more direct solutions than their female counterparts.

To determine sex differences in adults, Luchins gave college students the maze Einstellung test.  The female group showed slightly more (although not statistically significant) Einstellung effects than the male group.  Other studies have provided conflicting data about the sex differences in the Einstellung effect.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|pp=246–247}}

===Intelligence===
Luchins and Luchins looked at the relationship between the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) and the Einstellung effects for the children in their original experiment.  They found that there was a statistically insignificant negative relationship between the Einstellung Effect and Intelligence.{{sfn|Luchins|Luchins|1959|p=151}}  In general, large Einstellung effects were observed for all subject groups regardless of IQ score.  When Luchins and Luchins looked at the IQ range for children who did and did not demonstrate Einstellung effects, they spanned from 51 to 160 and from 75 to 155 respectively.  These ranges show a slight negative correlation between intelligence and Einstellung effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13109">In [[forensic entomology]], '''entomotoxicology''' is the analysis of toxins in [[arthropod]]s (mainly [[flies]] and [[beetles]]) that feed on [[carrion]].  Using arthropods in a corpse or at a crime scene, investigators can determine whether toxins were present in a body at the time of death. This technique is a major advance in forensics; previously, such determinations were impossible in the case of severely decomposed bodies devoid of intoxicated tissue and bodily fluids. Ongoing research into the effects of toxins on arthropod development has also allowed better estimations of [[postmortem intervals]].

==Effects of toxins on arthropods==

Drugs can have a variety of effects on development rates of arthropods. [[Morphine]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] are commonly involved in cases where forensic entomology is used. The stages of growth for insects provides a basis for determining a cause in altered cycles in a specific species. An altered stage in development can often indicate toxins in the [[carrion]] on which the insects are feeding. Beetles (Order: [[Coleoptera]]) and beetle feces are often used in entomotoxicology, but the presence of toxins is often the result of the beetles’ feeding on fly larvae that have been feeding on the carrion containing toxic substances. Flies (Order: [[Diptera]]) are the most commonly used insect in entomotoxicology.&lt;ref name=gagliano&gt; Gagliano-Candela, R. and Aventaggiato, L. “The detection of toxic substances in entomological specimens.” ''International Journal of Legal Medicine'' 114 (2001): 197-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the study of ''Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis'' larvae, [[barbiturates]] were found to increase the length of the larval stage of the fly, which will ultimately cause an increase in the time it takes to reach the stage of [[pupation]].&lt;ref name=musvasva&gt;Musvasva, E. and others. “Preliminary observations of the effects of hydrocortisone and sodium methohexital on development of Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis Macquart (Diptera: [[Sarcophagidae]]), and implications for estimating post mortem interval.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphine and heroin were both believed to slow down the rate of fly development.&lt;ref name=introna&gt;Introna, Francesco and others. ”Entomotoxicology.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 42-47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho, Lucila M.L.; Linhares, Arício X.; and Trigo, José Roberto. “Determination of drug levels and effect of diazepam on the growth of necrophagous flies of forensic importance in southeastern Brazil.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 140-144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, closer examination of the effects of heroin on fly development has shown that it actually speeds up larval growth and then decreases the development rate of the pupal stage. This actually increases the overall timing of development from egg to adult. Research of ''[[Lucilia sericata]]'' (Diptera: [[Calliphoridae]]), reared on various concentrations of morphine injected meat, found higher concentrations of morphine in shed pupal casings than in adults.&lt;ref&gt; Bourel, Benoit and others. “Morphine extraction in necrophagous insects remains for determining ante-mortem opiate intoxication.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 127-131.&lt;/ref&gt; Cocaine and methamphetamine also accelerate the rate of fly development.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

Some effects depend on the concentration of the toxin while others simply depend on its presence. For example, cocaine (at the lethal dose) causes larvae to “develop more rapidly 36 (to 76) hours after hatching”.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt; The amount of growth depends on the concentration of cocaine in the area being fed upon.  The amount of methamphetamine, on the other hand, affects the rate of pupal development. A lethal dose of methamphetamine increases larval development through approximately the first two days and afterwards the rate drops if exposure remains at the median lethal dosage. The presence of methamphetamine was also found to cause a decrease in the maximum length of the larvae.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

Along with changes in development rates, extended periods of insect feeding refrain and variation in the size of the insect during any stage of development, can also indicate the presence of toxic substances in the insect’s food source.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

==Examples of use==

Since J.C. Beyer and his partners first demonstrated the ability of toxins to be recovered from [[maggots]] feeding on human remains in 1980, the use of entomotoxicology in investigations has made an emergence into the field of forensic entomology.&lt;ref name=pounder&gt;Pounder, Derrick J. “Forensic entomo-toxicology.” ''Journal of the Forensic Science Society'' 31 (1991): 469-472.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of one such case involved the discovery of a 22-year-old female with a history of suicide attempts found 14 days after her death.  Due to the body’s advanced stage of [[decomposition]], no organ or tissue samples were viable to screen for toxins. Through [[gas chromatography]] (GC) and [[thin-layer chromatography]] (TLC) analysis of ''Cochliomyia macellaria'' (Diptera: Calliphoridae) larvae found feeding on the woman’s body, [[phenobarbital]] was detected and perceived to have been in the woman’s system upon death.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

===Drug abuse detected===
In France, Pascal Kintz and his colleagues were able to demonstrate the use of entomotoxicology to detect toxins that were not discovered during the analysis of body tissues and fluids of a body found roughly two months after death.  A liquid chromatography analysis on organ tissue and Calliphoridae larvae found at the scene revealed the existence of five prescription medications.  [[Triazolam]], however, was only detected in the analysis of maggots and not in organ tissue samples.  Comparative research showed increased sensitivity of toxicological analysis of Diptera samples over decomposed body tissues.  A similar case involved the discovery of the remains of a 29-year-old known to abuse drugs, last seen alive five months prior.  Through the use of GC and GC-MS techniques, Nolte and his partners discovered the presence of cocaine in decomposed muscle tissue and in maggots found on the body.  However, due to the severity of decomposition of the muscle tissue, more suitable drug samples (devoid of decomposition byproducts) were reared from the maggots.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

===Aid determination of origin===
Pekka Nuorteva presented the case of a young woman found severely decomposed in Inkoo, Finland.  Diptera larvae recovered from the body were reared to adulthood and found to contain low levels of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], indicating that the woman came from an area of comparatively low mercury pollution.  This assumption was proven correct once the woman was identified and found to have been a student in Turku, Finland.  This case demonstrated the ability of toxicological analysis to help determine origin.&lt;ref name=goff-lord&gt; Goff, M. Lee and Lord, Wayne D. “Entomotoxicology- A New Area for Forensic Investigation.” ''The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology'' 15 (1994): 51-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case applied Nuorteva’s research involving mercury and its effect on maggots.  Through experimentation, it was determined that maggots (fed on [[fish]] containing mercury) possessed levels of mercury in their tissue of even greater concentration than in the tissue of the fish.  Nuorteva also discovered that the presence of mercury in the maggots systems hindered their ability to enter into the pupal stage.&lt;ref name=goff&gt;Goff, M. Lee. A Fly for the Prosecution. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxin confounding of postmortem interval estimate===
Through the analysis of specific cases, it was revealed that toxins present in a person’s body upon death can confound [[postmortem interval]] estimations.  An example of such a case, reported by Gunatilake and Goff, concerned the discovery of a 58-year-old male with a history of attempted suicides found dead in a crawl space in Honolulu, Hawaii last seen eight days prior.  Two species of Diptera (Calliphoridae), ''Chrysomya megacephala'' and ''[[Chrysomya rufifacies]]'', found on the corpse and tissue samples from the body revealed [[malathion]].  Investigators found it abnormal that, given the conditions, there were only two fly species found on the body and that these species revealed a postmortem interval of five days.  Thus it was determined that the presence of the [[organophosphate]] malathion in the man’s system delayed oviposition for a few days.&lt;ref name=goff-lord/&gt;

Paul Catts analyzed a case in Spokane, Washington where maggots rendered differing postmortem estimations.  A 20-year-old female victim was found stabbed to death and laying in an open environment surrounded by trees.  Most of the oldest maggots found on the body were approximately 6–7 mm long which suggested that they were roughly seven days old.  There was, however, a very strange exception which was the retrieval of a 17.7 mm maggot which suggested an age of 3 weeks.  After ruling out the possibility that the maggot had traveled onto the corpse from carrion nearby, it was assumed that there was no conceivable way a 3 week old maggot could have been present on the corpse.  Later investigations revealed that the woman had snorted cocaine shortly before her death and that the 17.7 mm maggot must have feed in the woman’s nasal cavity.  Research revealed that maggot development can be sped up by the ingestion of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt; Catts, E. Paul, and Neal H. Haskell. Entomology and Death: A Procedural Guide. Clemson: Joyce’s Print Shop, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Use of shed casings and insect feces===
Not only are tissues from maggots used to detect toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and identify toxins present in corpses upon death.  An instance of this finding was demonstrated by Edward McDonough, a [[medical examiner]] in Connecticut.  A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home.  Prescription medicine bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: [[ampicillin]], [[Ceclor]], doxycyline, [[erythromycin]], [[Elavil]], [[Lomotil]], [[pentazocine]], and [[Tylenol 3]].   McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of [[amitriptyline]] and [[nortriptyline]].  Insect feces, shed pupal cases of ''[[Megaselia scalaris]]'' (Diptera: [[Phoridae]]), and shed larval skins of ''Dermestes maculates'' (Coleoptera: [[Dermestidae]]) were gathered from the corpse at the scene.  McDonough sent these to an [[FBI]] lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis.  The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline.  Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues.  The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies.  The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after [[death]].&lt;ref name=goff/&gt;

==Limitations==

Further research should be conducted in order to fill the gaps in entomotoxicology. Such areas as [[bioaccumulation]], insect [[metabolism]] of drugs, and quantitative analyses of insect evidence have only begun to be researched. Because it is a relatively new branch of forensic entomology, entomotoxicology has its limitations. According to Pounder’s research, there is no correlation between the drug concentration in tissue and the larvae feeding on that tissue.&lt;ref name=pounder/&gt; Entomological specimens make for excellent qualitative toxicological specimens. There is, however, a lack of research in the way of developing an assessment that can quantify the concentration of a drug in tissue using entomological evidence. One reason for this is that a drug can only be detected in larvae when the rate of absorption exceeds the rate of elimination.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Z.; Hubbard, S.; Pounder, D.J. “Drug analysis in fly larvae.” ''The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology'' 14 (1993): 118-120.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated this theory using ''[[Calliphora vicina]]'' larvae reared on human skeletal muscle obtained from cases of [[co-proxamol]] and [[amitriptyline]] overdose. Samples of pupae and third [[instar]] larvae no longer contained concentrations of the drugs, suggesting that drugs do not bioaccumulate over the entire life-cycle of larvae. This leads entomologists to theorize that toxins are eliminated from the larvae’s system over time if they are not receiving a constant supply of the toxin.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

In [[ecology]], the term '''foundation species''' is used to refer to a species that has a strong role in structuring a community. A foundation species can occupy any trophic level in a food web (i.e., they can be primary producers, herbivores or predators). The term was coined by [[Paul K. Dayton]] in 1972,&lt;ref name=Dayton&gt;Dayton, P. K. 1972. Toward an understanding of community resilience and the potential effects of enrichments to the benthos at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. pp. 81–96 in Proceedings of the Colloquium on Conservation Problems Allen Press, Lawrence, Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt; who applied it to certain members of marine [[invertebrate]] and [[algae]] communities. It was clear from studies in several locations that there were a small handful of species whose activities had a disproportionate effect on the rest of the marine community and they were therefore key to the resilience of the community. Dayton’s view was that focusing on foundation species would allow for a simplified approach to more rapidly understand how a community as a whole would react to disturbances, such as pollution, instead of attempting the extremely difficult task of tracking the responses of all community members simultaneously. The term has since been applied to range of organisms in ecosystems around the world, in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. [[Aaron M.

A study conducted at the McKenzie Flats at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, a semi-arid biome transition zone, observed the result of loss of a variety of different dominant and codominant foundation species of plants on the growth of other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Debra P. C.|last2=Yao|first2=J|date=2012-03-01|title=Long-term experimental loss of foundation species: consequences for dynamics at ecotones across heterogeneous landscapes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES11-00273.1/abstract|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1–23|doi=10.1890/ES11-00273.1|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transition zone consists of two Chihuahuan Desert species, black grama (''[[Bouteloua eriopoda]])'' and creosote bush (''[[Larrea tridentata]])'', and a Shortgrass Steppe species, blue grama (''[[Bouteloua gracilis|Bouteloua gracillis]])''. Each species dominates an area with a specific soil environment. Black grama dominates sandy soils, while blue grama dominates in soils with high clay content, and creosote bush dominates fine-textured soil with surface gravel. This study noted that responses to the loss of foundation species is dependent on a variety of different factors from the ability of a species to recover to the climate conditions of the ecosystem to the patterns in dominance and explored the possible reasons for the outcomes of the study. The results indicated that in areas with just one dominant foundation species, its loss caused a shift in dominance to a mixed dominant community. For example, the creosote bush dominated shrubland saw a shift in dominance to 32% by other shrubs, 26% by perennial grasses, and 22% by perennial forbs following the removal of creosote bush. Another finding was that regardless of the community type and the species removed, the loss of foundation species resulted in an overall increase in black grama supporting the notion that the outcome is greatly affected by recovery ability of species removed or loss.

Another study observed the effects of loss of foundation Eastern hemlocks (''[[Tsuga canadensis]]'') in a forest ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sackett|first=Tara E.|last2=Record|first2=Sydne|last3=Bewick|first3=Sharon|last4=Baiser|first4=Benjamin|last5=Sanders|first5=Nathan J.|last6=Ellison|first6=Aaron M.|date=2011-07-01|title=Response of macroarthropod assemblages to the loss of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation species|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES11-00155.1/abstract|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=2|issue=7|pages=1–16|doi=10.1890/ES11-00155.1|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern hemlocks are a foundation species in eastern North American forests, but have been threatened by the accidental introduction of [[Hemlock woolly adelgid|woolly adelgid]]. This study observed the effects that a loss in Eastern Hemlocks would have on the populations of [[arthropod]]s, such as ants, beetles, and spiders, since these species are known indicators of environmental change. The results found that in areas of hemlock removal, there was an overall increase and influx of arthropod species. Researchers suggested that this was due to an increase in open habitats from the loss of the hemlocks. The results of this hemlock study corroborated with those from the previous McKenzie Flats study discussed in that the loss of foundation species led to a proliferation of species diversity in the affected area. These results seem to contradict a long-standing belief that foundation species play a vital role in communities and ecosystems by creating habitats for organisms, suggesting that in some circumstances they bottleneck species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angelini|first=Christine|last2=Altieri|first2=Andrew H.|last3=Silliman|first3=Brian R.|last4=Bertness|first4=Mark D.|date=2011-10-01|title=Interactions among Foundation Species and Their Consequences for Community Organization, Biodiversity, and Conservation|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/10/782|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=61|issue=10|pages=782–789|doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.10.8|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foundation species play a vital role in structuring a community; however, this can be in a variety of different ways. The presence of a foundation species has the ability to either reduce or increase species diversity depending on its particular role in a specific ecosystem. The studies discussed highlighted examples in which foundation species limited species diversity in a similar and differing taxa (McKenzie Flats study and Eastern hemlock study, respectively); however, there are many other examples in which removal of foundation species could decrease species diversity within the same or differing taxa.

The '''Fumio Koizumi Prize''' ({{lang-ja|小泉文夫音楽賞}}) is an [[international]] [[award]] for achievements in [[ethnomusicology]], presented annually in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The prize is awarded by the Fumio Koizumi (小泉文夫) Trust each April 4, the date of Fumio's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/chosakue/index.html  List of publications of Koizumi Fumio]&lt;/ref&gt; The recipient receives an award certificate in addition to prize money. The winners must be present at the ceremony, deliver a prize lecture, and deliver another lecture at another Japanese university of his/her choice.

==Entry and prize consideration==
Nominations for the Fumio Koizumi Prize can be made only by the members of the Fumio Koizumi Prize [[Committee]]. The prize Committee consists of seven members, outstanding [[Japan]]ese scholars in [[musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]]. Committee designates independent [[expert]]s to evaluate each entry and discusses all the entries at the meeting, held in [[Tokyo]] in December. The winner can be a single scholar, of a group of scholars. The prize awarding ceremony is held in Tokyo, in April–May.

==History==
The '''Fumio Koizumi Trust''' was established by '''Koizumi Mieko''', widow of Professor '''Koizumi Fumio''' (1927–83), on October 11, 1989, to commemorate her husband's lifelong devotion to [[ethnomusicology]] and to honour individuals and organizations who have made significant contributions to this field. The first Fumio Koizumi Prize was awarded in 1989 to a British ethnomusicologist [[John Blacking]], and to Ethnomusicology Research Group of [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]. Up to now, 27 individuals and 2 groups have been awarded this prize. List of the winners of the prize together with the reasons for the award can be seen at the Fumio Koizumi Prize in Ethnomusicology Website &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/awarde/index.html  List of winners of Fumio Koizumi Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 year onwards presented prize lecture texts are also placed on the prize website.

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information theory''' studies the [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], [[Computer data storage|storage]], and [[Telecommunication|communication]] of [[information]].  It was originally proposed by [[Claude E. Shannon]] in 1948 to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] and communication operations such as [[data compression]], in a landmark paper entitled "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]". Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include [[lossless data compression]] (e.g. [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP files]]), [[lossy data compression]] (e.g. [[MP3]]s and [[JPEG]]s), and [[channel capacity|channel coding]] (e.g. for [[DSL|digital subscriber line (DSL)]]). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions to deep space, the invention of the [[compact disc]], the feasibility of [[mobile phone]]s, the development of the [[Internet]], the study of [[linguistics]] and of human perception, the understanding of [[black hole]]s, and numerous other fields.

A key measure in information theory is "[[information entropy|entropy]]". Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a [[random variable]] or the outcome of a [[random process]]. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair [[coin flip]] (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a {{dice}} (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are [[mutual information]], [[channel capacity]], [[error exponent]]s, and [[relative entropy]].

The field is at the intersection of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[neurobiology]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]]. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including [[statistical inference]], [[natural language processing]], [[cryptography]], [[neurobiology]],&lt;ref name="Spikes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Spikes: Exploring the Neural Code|publisher=The MIT press|year=1997|isbn=978-0262681087|author1=F.

&lt;/ref&gt; Important sub-fields of information theory include [[source coding]], [[channel coding]], [[algorithmic complexity theory]], [[algorithmic information theory]], [[information-theoretic security]], and measures of information.

==Overview==

Information theory studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was made concrete in 1948 by [[Claude Shannon]] in his paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]", in which "information" is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]] showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the [[channel capacity]], a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.&lt;ref name="Spikes" /&gt;

Information theory is closely associated with a collection of pure and applied disciplines that have been investigated and reduced to engineering practice under a variety of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] throughout the world over the past half century or more: [[adaptive system]]s, [[anticipatory system]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[complex system]]s, [[complexity science]], [[cybernetics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[machine learning]], along with [[systems science]]s of many descriptions. Information theory is a broad and deep mathematical theory, with equally broad and deep applications, amongst which is the vital field of [[coding theory]].

Coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called ''codes'', for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the [[channel capacity]]. These codes can be roughly subdivided into [[data compression]] (source coding) and [[error-correction]] (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both [[code (cryptography)|code]]s and [[cipher]]s). Concepts, methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]]. ''See the article [[ban (unit)]] for a historical application.''

Information theory is also used in [[information retrieval]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]], [[gambling]], [[statistics]], and even in [[musical composition]].

==Historical background==
{{Main|History of information theory}}

The landmark event that ''established'' the discipline of information theory and brought it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of [[Claude E. Shannon]]'s classic paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]" in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948.

Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.  [[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation {{math|1=''W'' = ''K'' log ''m''}} (recalling [[Boltzmann's constant]]), where ''W'' is the speed of transmission of intelligence, ''m'' is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and ''K'' is a constant.  [[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information'', uses the word ''information'' as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one [[sequence of symbols]] from any other, thus quantifying information as {{math|1=''H'' = log ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' log ''S''}}, where ''S'' was the number of possible symbols, and ''n'' the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the [[decimal digit]], which has since sometimes been called the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. [[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

Much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of [[thermodynamics]] by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]].  Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by [[Rolf Landauer]] in the 1960s, are explored in ''[[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory]]''.

In Shannon's revolutionary and groundbreaking paper, the work for which had been substantially completed at Bell Labs by the end of 1944, Shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory, opening with the assertion that
:"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point."

With it came the ideas of
* the [[information entropy]] and [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of a source, and its relevance through the [[source coding theorem]];
* the [[mutual information]], and the [[channel capacity]] of a noisy channel, including the promise of perfect loss-free communication given by the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]];
* the practical result of the [[Shannon–Hartley law]] for the channel capacity of a [[Gaussian channel]]; as well as
* the [[bit]]—a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information.

==Quantities of information==
{{Main|Quantities of information}}

Information theory is based on [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]].  Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. Important quantities of information are [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], a measure of information in a single [[random variable]], and [[mutual information]], a measure of information in common between two random variables.  The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on the rate at which data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably [[data compression|compressed]]. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy [[Communication channel|channel]] in the limit of long block lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.

The choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[information entropy]] that is used.  A common unit of information is the [[bit]], based on the [[binary logarithm]]. Other units include the [[nat (unit)|nat]], which is based on the [[natural logarithm]], and the [[deciban|decimal digit]], which is based on the [[common logarithm]].

In what follows, an expression of the form {{math|''p'' log ''p''}} is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever {{math|1=''p'' = 0}}.  This is justified because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{p \rightarrow 0+} p \log p = 0&lt;/math&gt; for any logarithmic base.

===Entropy of an information source===
Based on the [[probability mass function]] of each source symbol to be communicated, the Shannon [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] {{math|''H''}}, in units of bits (per symbol), is given by
:&lt;math&gt;H = - \sum_{i} p_i \log_2 (p_i)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the probability of occurrence of the {{math|''i''}}-th possible value of the source symbol. This equation gives the entropy in the units of "bits" (per symbol) because it uses a logarithm of base 2, and this base-2 measure of entropy has sometimes been called the "[[Shannon (unit)|shannon]]" in his honor. Entropy is also commonly computed using the [[natural logarithm]] (base [[E (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]], where {{mvar|e}} is [[Euler's number]]), which produces a measurement of entropy in "[[nat (unit)|nats]]" per symbol and sometimes simplifies the analysis by avoiding the need to include extra constants in the formulas. Other bases are also possible, but less commonly used. For example, a logarithm of base {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256}} will produce a measurement in [[byte]]s per symbol, and a logarithm of base 10 will produce a measurement in decimal digits (or hartleys) per symbol.

Intuitively, the entropy {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of a discrete random variable {{math|''X''}} is a measure of the amount of ''uncertainty'' associated with the value of {{math|''X''}} when only its distribution is known.

The entropy of a source that emits a sequence of {{math|''N''}} symbols that are [[independent and identically distributed]] (iid) is {{math|''N&amp;middot;H''}} bits (per message of {{math|''N''}} symbols). If the source data symbols are identically distributed but not independent, the entropy of a message of length {{math|''N''}} will be less than {{math|''N''·''H''}}.

[[File:Binary entropy plot.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|The entropy of a [[Bernoulli trial]] as a function of success probability, often called the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}}.  The entropy is maximized at 1 bit per trial when the two possible outcomes are equally probable, as in an unbiased coin toss.]]

If one transmits 1000 bits (0s and 1s), and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver (has a specific value with certainty) ahead of transmission, it is clear that no information is transmitted.  If, however, each bit is independently equally likely to be 0 or 1, 1000 shannons of information (more often called bits) have been transmitted.  Between these two extremes, information can be quantified as follows. If  	𝕏 is the set of all messages {{math|{{mset|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} that {{math|''X''}} could be, and {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is the probability of some &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb X&lt;/math&gt;, then the entropy, {{math|''H''}}, of {{math|''X''}} is defined:&lt;ref name = Reza&gt;{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Information Theory | author = Fazlollah M. Reza | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc., New York | origyear = 1961| year = 1994 | isbn = 0-486-68210-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RtzpRAiX6OgC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=intitle:%22An+Introduction+to+Information+Theory%22++%22entropy+of+a+simple+source%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(X) = \mathbb{E}_{X} [I(x)] = -\sum_{x \in \mathbb{X}} p(x) \log p(x).&lt;/math&gt;

(Here, {{math|''I''(''x'')}} is the [[self-information]], which is the entropy contribution of an individual message, and {{math|𝔼&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[expected value]].) A property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable {{math|1=''p''(''x'') = 1/''n''}}; i.e., most unpredictable, in which case {{math|1=''H''(''X'') = log ''n''}}.

The special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', usually taken to the logarithmic base 2, thus having the shannon (Sh) as unit:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{b}}(p) = - p \log_2 p - (1-p)\log_2 (1-p).&lt;/math&gt;

===Joint entropy===
The ''[[joint entropy]]'' of two discrete random variables {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} is merely the entropy of their pairing: {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}}.  This implies that if {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are [[statistical independence|independent]], then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies.

For example, if {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}} represents the position of a [[chess]] piece — {{math|''X''}} the row and {{math|''Y''}} the column, then the joint entropy of the row of the piece and the column of the piece will be the entropy of the position of the piece.

:&lt;math&gt;H(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [-\log p(x,y)] = - \sum_{x, y} p(x, y) \log p(x, y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Despite similar notation, joint entropy should not be confused with ''[[cross entropy]]''.

===Conditional entropy (equivocation)===
The ''[[conditional entropy]]'' or ''conditional uncertainty'' of {{math|''X''}} given random variable {{math|''Y''}} (also called the ''equivocation'' of {{math|''X''}} about {{math|''Y''}}) is the average conditional entropy over {{math|''Y''}}:&lt;ref name=Ash&gt;{{cite book | title = Information Theory | author = Robert B. Ash | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | origyear = 1965| year = 1990 | isbn = 0-486-66521-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ngZhvUfF0UIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=intitle:information+intitle:theory+inauthor:ash+conditional+uncertainty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(X|Y) = \mathbb E_Y [H(X|y)] = -\sum_{y \in Y} p(y) \sum_{x \in X} p(x|y) \log p(x|y) = -\sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log p(x|y).&lt;/math&gt;

Because entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value, care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy, the former of which is in more common use.  A basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that:

: &lt;math&gt; H(X|Y) = H(X,Y) - H(Y) .\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Mutual information (transinformation)===
''[[Mutual information]]'' measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another.  It is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals.  The mutual information of {{math|''X''}} relative to {{math|''Y''}} is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [SI(x,y)] = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\, p(y)}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|SI}} (''S''pecific mutual ''I''nformation) is the [[pointwise mutual information]].

A basic property of the mutual information is that
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;
That is, knowing ''Y'', we can save an average of {{math|''I''(''X''; ''Y'')}} bits in encoding ''X'' compared to not knowing ''Y''.

Mutual information is [[symmetric function|symmetric]]:
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = I(Y;X) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Mutual information can be expressed as the average [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] (information gain) between the [[posterior probability|posterior probability distribution]] of ''X'' given the value of ''Y'' and the [[prior probability|prior distribution]] on ''X'':
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p(y)} [D_{\mathrm{KL}}( p(X|Y=y) \| p(X) )].&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, this is a measure of how much, on the average, the probability distribution on ''X'' will change if we are given the value of ''Y''.  This is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution:
: &lt;math&gt;I(X; Y) = D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p(X,Y) \| p(X)p(Y)).&lt;/math&gt;

Mutual information is closely related to the [[likelihood-ratio test|log-likelihood ratio test]] in the context of contingency tables and the [[multinomial distribution]] and to [[Pearson's chi-squared test|Pearson's χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test]]: mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables, and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution.

===Kullback–Leibler divergence (information gain)===
The ''[[Kullback–Leibler divergence]]'' (or ''information divergence'', ''information gain'', or ''relative entropy'') is a way of comparing two distributions: a "true" [[probability distribution]] ''p(X)'', and an arbitrary probability distribution ''q(X)''. If we compress data in a manner that assumes ''q(X)'' is the distribution underlying some data, when, in reality, ''p(X)'' is the correct distribution, the Kullback–Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression.  It is thus defined

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p(X) \| q(X)) = \sum_{x \in X} -p(x) \log {q(x)} \, - \, \sum_{x \in X} -p(x) \log {p(x)} = \sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Although it is sometimes used as a 'distance metric', KL divergence is not a true [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] (making it a semi-quasimetric).

Another interpretation of the KL divergence is the "unnecessary surprise" introduced by a prior from the truth: suppose a number ''X'' is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution ''p(x)''.  If Alice knows the true distribution ''p(x)'', while Bob believes (has a [[prior probability|prior]]) that the distribution is ''q(x)'', then Bob will be more [[Self-information|surprised]] than Alice, on average, upon seeing the value of ''X''.  The KL divergence is the (objective) expected value of Bob's (subjective) [[surprisal]] minus Alice's surprisal, measured in bits if the ''log'' is in base 2.  In this way, the extent to which Bob's prior is "wrong" can be quantified in terms of how "unnecessarily surprised" it is expected to make him.

===Other quantities===
Other important information theoretic quantities include [[Rényi entropy]] (a generalization of entropy), [[differential entropy]] (a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions), and the [[conditional mutual information]].

==Coding theory==
{{Main|Coding theory}}

[[File:CDSCRATCHES.jpg|thumb|right|A picture showing scratches on the readable surface of a CD-R.  Music and data CDs are coded using error correcting codes and thus can still be read even if they have minor scratches using [[error detection and correction]].]]

[[Coding theory]] is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory. It can be subdivided into [[data compression|source coding]] theory and [[error correction|channel coding]] theory. Using a statistical description for data, information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data, which is the information entropy of the source.

* Data compression (source coding): There are two formulations for the compression problem:
*[[lossless data compression]]: the data must be reconstructed exactly;
*[[lossy data compression]]: allocates bits needed to reconstruct the data, within a specified fidelity level measured by a distortion function. This subset of information theory is called ''[[rate–distortion theory]]''.
* Error-correcting codes (channel coding): While data compression removes as much [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] as possible, an error correcting code adds just the right kind of redundancy (i.e., [[error correction]]) needed to transmit the data efficiently and faithfully across a noisy channel.

This division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems, or source–channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts. However, these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user. In scenarios with more than one transmitter (the multiple-access channel), more than one receiver (the [[broadcast channel]]) or intermediary "helpers" (the [[relay channel]]), or more general [[computer network|networks]], compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal. [[Network information theory]] refers to these multi-agent communication models.

===Source theory===
Any process that generates successive messages can be considered a ''[[Communication source|source]]'' of information.  A memoryless source is one in which each message is an [[Independent identically distributed random variables|independent identically distributed random variable]], whereas the properties of [[ergodic theory|ergodicity]] and [[stationary process|stationarity]] impose less restrictive constraints.  All such sources are [[stochastic process|stochastic]].  These terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory.

====Rate====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Channel capacity]] --&gt;
Information ''[[Entropy rate|rate]]'' is the average entropy per symbol.  For memoryless sources, this is merely the entropy of each symbol, while, in the case of a stationary stochastic process, it is

:&lt;math&gt;r = \lim_{n \to \infty} H(X_n|X_{n-1},X_{n-2},X_{n-3}, \ldots);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated.  For the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary, the ''average rate'' is

:&lt;math&gt;r = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} H(X_1, X_2, \dots X_n);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the limit of the joint entropy per symbol.  For stationary sources, these two expressions give the same result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Compression for Multimedia: Principles and Standards | author = Jerry D. Gibson | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqQ2Ry6spu0C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=entropy-rate+conditional#PPA57,M1 | isbn = 1-55860-369-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common in information theory to speak of the "rate" or "entropy" of a language.  This is appropriate, for example, when the source of information is English prose.  The rate of a source of information is related to its [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] and how well it can be [[data compression|compressed]], the subject of ''source coding''.

===Channel capacity===
{{Main|Channel capacity}}

Communications over a channel—such as an [[ethernet]] [[Electrical cable|cable]]—is the primary motivation of information theory.  As anyone who's ever used a telephone (mobile or landline) knows, however, such channels often fail to produce exact reconstruction of a signal; noise, periods of silence, and other forms of signal corruption often degrade quality.

Consider the communications process over a discrete channel. A simple model of the process is shown below:


[[File:Channel model.svg|center|800px|Channel model]]


Here ''X'' represents the space of messages transmitted, and ''Y'' the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel. Let {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} be the [[conditional probability]] distribution function of ''Y'' given ''X''. We will consider {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel (representing the nature of the ''[[Signal noise|noise]]'' of our channel). Then the joint distribution of ''X'' and ''Y'' is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel. Under these constraints, we would like to maximize the rate of information, or the ''[[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]'', we can communicate over the channel. The appropriate measure for this is the [[mutual information]], and this maximum mutual information is called the ''[[channel capacity]]'' and is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; C = \max_{f} I(X;Y).\! &lt;/math&gt;
This capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate ''R'' (where ''R'' is usually bits per symbol).  For any information rate ''R &lt; C'' and coding error ε &gt; 0, for large enough ''N'', there exists a code of length ''N'' and rate ≥ R and a decoding algorithm, such that the maximal probability of block error is ≤ ε; that is, it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.  In addition, for any rate ''R &amp;gt; C'', it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.

''[[Channel code|Channel coding]]'' is concerned with finding such nearly optimal [[error detection and correction|codes]] that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity.

====Capacity of particular channel models====
* A continuous-time analog communications channel subject to [[Gaussian noise]] — see [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].
* A [[binary symmetric channel]] (BSC) with crossover probability ''p'' is a binary input, binary output channel that flips the input bit with probability ''p''. The BSC has a capacity of {{math|1 &amp;minus; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}} bits per channel use, where {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[binary entropy function]] to the base-2 logarithm:

::[[File:Binary symmetric channel.svg]]

* A [[binary erasure channel]] (BEC) with erasure probability ''p'' is a binary input, ternary output channel. The possible channel outputs are 0, 1, and a third symbol 'e' called an erasure. The erasure represents complete loss of information about an input bit. The capacity of the BEC is {{nowrap|1 &amp;minus; ''p''}} bits per channel use.

==Applications to other fields==

===Intelligence uses and secrecy applications===
Information theoretic concepts apply to [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]].  [[Turing]]'s information unit, the [[Ban (unit)|ban]], was used in the [[Ultra]] project, breaking the German [[Enigma machine]] code and hastening the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of World War II in Europe]].  Shannon himself defined an important concept now called the [[unicity distance]]. Based on the [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of the [[plaintext]], it attempts to give a minimum amount of [[ciphertext]] necessary to ensure unique decipherability.

Information theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear.  A [[brute force attack]] can break systems based on [[public-key cryptography|asymmetric key algorithms]] or on most commonly used methods of [[symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key algorithms]] (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as [[block cipher]]s.  The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.

[[Information theoretic security]] refers to methods such as the [[one-time pad]] that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks.  In such cases, the positive conditional [[mutual information]] between the [[plaintext]] and [[ciphertext]] (conditioned on the [[key (cryptography)|key]]) can ensure proper transmission, while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero, resulting in absolutely secure communications.  In other words, an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key. However, as in any other cryptographic system, care must be used to correctly apply even information-theoretically secure methods; the [[Venona project]] was able to crack the one-time pads of the Soviet Union due to their improper reuse of key material.

===Pseudorandom number generation===
[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s are widely available in computer language libraries and application programs. They are, almost universally, unsuited to cryptographic use as they do not evade the deterministic nature of modern computer equipment and software. A class of improved random number generators is termed [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s, but even they require [[random seed]]s external to the software to work as intended. These can be obtained via [[Extractor (mathematics)|extractors]], if done carefully. The measure of  sufficient randomness in extractors is [[min-entropy]], a value related to Shannon entropy through [[Rényi entropy]]; Rényi entropy is also used in evaluating randomness in cryptographic systems.  Although related, the distinctions among these measures mean that a [[random variable]] with high Shannon entropy is not necessarily satisfactory for use in an extractor and so for cryptography uses.

===Seismic exploration===
One early commercial application of information theory was in the field of seismic oil exploration. Work in this field made it possible to strip off and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal. Information theory and [[digital signal processing]] offer a major improvement of resolution and image clarity over previous analog methods.&lt;ref&gt;The Corporation and Innovation, Haggerty, Patrick, Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 2, 97-118 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiotics===
[[Semiotics|Semioticians]] [[:nl:Doede Nauta|Doede Nauta]] and [[Winfried Nöth]] both considered [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] as having created a theory of information in his works on semiotics.&lt;ref name="Nauta 1972"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Nauta |first1=Doede |title=The Meaning of Information |date=1972 |publisher=Mouton |location=The Hague |isbn=9789027919960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}}&lt;ref name="Nöth 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |title=Charles S.

Concepts from information theory such as redundancy and code control have been used by semioticians such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[:it:Ferruccio Rossi-Landi|Ferruccio Rossi-Landi]] to explain ideology as a form of message transmission whereby a dominant social class emits its message by using signs that exhibit a high degree of redundancy such that only one message is decoded among a selection of competing ones.&lt;ref&gt;Nöth, Winfried (1981). "Semiotics of ideology". ''Semiotica'', Issue 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, the '''Jevons paradox''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|v|ə|n|z}}; sometimes '''Jevons effect''') occurs when [[technological change|technological progress]] or government policy increases the [[efficiency]] with which a [[resource (economics)|resource]] is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that resource rises due to increasing [[demand (economics)|demand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer |first1=Diana |last2=Papp |first2=Kathryn |title=Book Review Perspectives: The Jevons Paradox and the Myth of Resource Efficiency Improvements |journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy |date=March 18, 2009 |volume=5 |issue=1 |url=http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |accessdate=29 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529111127/http://sspp.proquest.com/static_content/vol5iss1/book.polimeni-print.html |archivedate=29 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite journal|last=York |first=Richard |title=Ecological paradoxes: William Stanley Jevons and the paperless office |journal=Human Ecology Review |year=2006 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=143–147 |url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her132/york.pdf |accessdate=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, governments and [[environmentalist]]s generally assume that efficiency gains will lower [[resource consumption]], ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.&lt;ref name=Alcott1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.03.020|last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=Jevons' paradox |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=July 2005 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=9–21 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905001084 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, the English economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.&lt;ref name="Coal Question"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=The Coal Question |publisher=[[Macmillan and Company]] |location=London |year=1866 |edition=2nd |chapter=VII |oclc=464772008 |url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=gAAKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions:AAotKDT6KKcC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR3&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcott2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcott |first=Blake |title=The Jevons Paradox and the Myth of Resource Efficiency Improvements |year=2008 |publisher=Earthscan |pages=7–78 | editor=JM Polimeni |editor2=K Mayumi |editor3=M Giampietro |chapter=Historical Overview of the Jevons paradox in the Literature |isbn=1-84407-462-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effects]] from improved [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use, improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource, which increases the quantity demanded. This counteracts (to some extent) the reduction in use from improved efficiency. Additionally, improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates [[economic growth]], further increasing the demand for resources.  The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates, and improved efficiency increases the speed at which resources are used.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]]. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue [[sustainability]] by increasing energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt; Some environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wackernagel |first=Mathis |first2=William |last2=Rees |year=1997 |title=Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: Economics from an ecological footprint perspective |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=3–24 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation policies that increase cost of use (such as [[cap and trade]] or [[green taxes]]) can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freire-González|first1=Jaume|last2=Puig-Ventosa|first2=Ignasi|title=Energy Efficiency Policies and the Jevons Paradox |journal=International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy |date=2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=69–79 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eco/journ2/2015-01-06.html |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|alt=Engraving of William Stanley Jevons|[[William Stanley Jevons]], after whom the paradox is named]]

The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]''. Jevons observed that [[England]]'s consumption of [[coal]] soared after [[James Watt]] introduced the [[Watt steam engine]], which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired [[steam engine]] from [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s earlier design. Watt's innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source, leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries. This in turn increased total coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell. Jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase (rather than decrease) fuel use, writing: "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;

At that time, many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling, but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.&lt;ref name="Coal Question"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

Although Jevons originally focused on the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, [[water use|water usage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dumont|first1=A.|last2=Mayor|first2=B.|last3=López-Gunn|first3=E.|title=Is the Rebound Effect or Jevons Paradox a Useful Concept for Better Management of Water Resources?

It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref name="York"/&gt;

Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for fuel.&lt;ref name="Small"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small |first= Kenneth A. |author2=Kurt Van Dender |title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966–2001 |journal=Policy and Economics | publisher=University of California Energy Institute, UC Berkeley | date = 2005-09-21 |volume= |series= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1h6141nj |accessdate=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a decrease in the [[cost]] of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a [[Goods and services|good or service]] will increase the quantity demanded (the [[law of demand]]). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]], and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

The size of the direct rebound effect is dependent on the [[price elasticity of demand]] for the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Nathan W.|last2=Gillingham|first2=Kenneth|title=The Microeconomic Theory of the Rebound Effect and Its Welfare Implications|journal=Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists|date=1 March 2015|volume=2|issue=1|pages=133–159|doi=10.1086/680256|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680256|accessdate=4 February 2018|issn=2333-5955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is [[price elastic]]), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Alcott2"/&gt;

==Khazzoom–Brookes postulate==
{{Main|Khazzoom–Brookes postulate}}

In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of society's [[World energy consumption|energy use]]. Brookes, then chief economist at the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority|UK Atomic Energy Authority]], argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the [[California Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D.|title=The Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth|journal=The Energy Journal|date=October 1992|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–148|jstor=41322471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|date=19 July 1999|title=Does energy efficiency save energy? The debate and its consequences|journal=Applied Energy|volume=63|issue=3|pages=209–226|issn=0306-2619|doi=10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the ''Khazzoom–Brookes postulate'', and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical [[Economic growth|growth theory]] (the mainstream economic theory of [[capital accumulation]], [[Technological change|technological progress]] and [[long-run]] economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the [[neoclassical growth model]] under a wide range of assumptions.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrell|first1=Steve|title=Jevons’ Paradox revisited: The evidence for backfire from improved energy efficiency|journal=Energy Policy|date=April 2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1456–1469|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.12.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508007428|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Saunders, increased [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]] tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency increases real incomes and leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5 | surname=Greening| first=Lorna | title=Energy efficiency and consumption—the rebound effect—a survey |author2=David L. Greene |author3=Carmen Difiglio| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=389–401 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | issue=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

==Energy conservation policy==
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
{{Sustainable energy}}

There is considerable debate about whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to [[energy conservation]] policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that these policies will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many [[environmental economists]], doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards [[sustainability]], and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.&lt;ref name=Alcott1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_owen|title=Annals of Environmentalism: The Efficiency Dilemma|last=Owen|first=David|date=December 20, 2010|work=[[The New Yorker]]|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other environmental economists point out that, while the Jevons Paradox may occur in some situations, the empirical evidence for its widespread applicability is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillingham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Kotchen |first2=Matthew J. |last3=Rapson |first3=David S. |last4=Wagner |first4=Gernot |title=Energy policy: The rebound effect is overplayed |journal=Nature |date=23 January 2013 |volume=493 |issue=7433 |pages=475–476 |doi=10.1038/493475a |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/493475a |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=En |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use. However, this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless if the Jevons paradox occurs; higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lisa|last2=Campbell|first2=Nina|title=Spreading the net: the multiple benefits of energy efficiency improvements|journal=IEA Energy Papers|doi=10.1787/20792581|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/spreading-the-net-the-multiple-benefits-of-energy-efficiency-improvements_5k9crzjbpkkc-en|accessdate=5 June 2015|series=IEA Energy Papers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nonetheless, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that [[energy conservation]] efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of [[peak oil]]. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving).&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Potter | first=Andrew | title=Planet-friendly design?

First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant.&lt;ref name="Small"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that [[sustainable energy]] policy must rely on other types of government interventions.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amado|first1=Nilton Bispo|last2=Sauer|first2=Ildo L.|title=An ecological economic interpretation of the Jevons effect|journal=Ecological Complexity|date=February 2012|volume=9|pages=2–9|doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2011.10.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X11000717|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase cost of use do not display the Jevon paradox, they can be used to control the rebound effect.&lt;ref name="Energy Efficiency Policies"/&gt; To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. [[ecotax|green taxes]], [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]], or higher [[emissions standard]]s).

ANU E Press. {{ISBN|9781921666803}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although monodominance is studied across different regions, most research focuses on the many prominent species in tropical forests. Connel and Lowman, originally called it single-dominance.&lt;ref name="low dive"&gt;Connel, Joseph H.; Lowman, Margaret D. (1989). "Low diversity tropical rainforests: Some possible mechanisms for their existence.". The American Naturalist 134: 88–119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Conventional explanations of [[biodiversity]] in [[tropical forest]]s in the decades prior to Connel and Lowman's work either ignored monodominance entirely or predicted that it would not exist.&lt;ref name="causes"&gt;Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D.; Kursar, Thomas A. (February 2001). "Causes and Consequences of Monodominance in Tropical Lowland Forests". The American Naturalist 157 (2): 141–153. doi:10.1086/318629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connel and Lowman hypothesized two contrasting mechanisms by which [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]] can be attained.&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; The first is by fast regrowth in unstable habitats with high disturbance rates. The second is through competitive exclusion in stable habitats that have low disturbance rates.&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; Explanations of persistent monodominace include the monodominant species being more resistant than others to seasonal flooding, or that the monodominance is simply a sere.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; With persistent monodominance, the monodominant species successfully remains so from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt;

== Examples ==
A minimum of 22 species from eight different [[Family (biology)|families]] are known to create monodominant forests.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Examples of persistent monodominance are seen in [[Africa]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="pretest"&gt;Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D. (June 1999). "Tropical Monodominance: A Preliminary Test of the Ectomycorrhizal Hypothesis". Biotropica (The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation) 31 (2): 220–228.doi:10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00134.x.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dipterocarpaceae'' is one example of a plant family that is recognized as persistently [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] in Asia.&lt;ref name="pretest"/&gt; The [[Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal tree]] ''Dicymbe corymbosa'', found in central Guyana, creates wide ranges of monodominant forests containing more than 80% of the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] tree species.&lt;ref name="ecto"&gt;McGuire, Krista L.

Dominant plants in the [[Neotropics]] and Africa are usually in the [[Leguminosae]] family.&lt;ref name="pretest"/&gt; The species ''Gilbertiodendron dewevrei'', ''Cynometra alexandri'', and ''Julbernardia seretii'' are pronounced as exclusive dominants in their individual forests in equatorial Africa.&lt;ref name="humid"&gt;Hart, T.

[[File:View from the top, Falealupo Rainforest canopy walkway, Savaii, Samoa 2009.JPG|thumb|View from the top, Falealupo Rainforest canopy walkway, Savaii, Samoa 2009]]

== Causes ==
Connel and Lowman originally hypothesized [[ectomycorrhiza]]l association causing the replacement of other species as one of two mechanisms by which a species becomes persistently monodominant; the other is the simple colonization of large gaps.&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; However, subsequent research over the years has shown that there is not a single, simple mechanism by which monodominance occurs.&lt;ref name="terese"&gt;Hart, Terese (January 1990). "Monospecific dominance in tropical rain forests.". Trends in Ecology and Evolution (Elsevier Ltd) 5 (1): 6–11.doi:10.1016/0169-5347(90)90005-X.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anomaly"&gt;Read, Jennifer; Hallam, Patricia; Cherrier, Jean-François (1995).

Journal of Tropical Ecology (Cambridge University Press) 11(03): 359–389. doi:10.1017/s026646740000883x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, K. L. (2007). "Recruitment dynamics and ectomycorrhizal colonization of Dicymbe corymbosa, a monodominant tree in the Guiana Shield". Journal of Tropical Ecology 23 (3): 297–307.doi:10.1017/s0266467406003968.&lt;/ref&gt; Monodominant species have been recorded forming at various times after [[forest]] clearance, though this has not been shown to be a predictor of monodominant species persistence. Reliance upon ectomycorrhizae and poor [[soil]]s have not been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt; Instead, multiple traits of adult monodominant species hinder the ability of other species to grow, including a dense canopy, a uniform canopy, deep leaf litter, slow nutrient processing, [[Fruiting|mast fruiting]], and poor [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]].

Several causal mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of monodominant forest in [[Tropics|tropical]] [[ecosystem]]s,&lt;ref name="terese"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; including features of the environment such as low [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] rates, and intrinsic characteristics of the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] species: escape from [[herbivore]]s, high seedling shade-tolerance, and the formation of [[mycorrhizal network]]s between individuals of the same species.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, K. L. 2007. Common ectomycorrhizal networks may maintain monodominance in a tropical rain forest" Ecology 88(3) 567–574.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canopy ===
The dense [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of the adult trees prevents light from getting into the [[understory]].  In the [[Ituri Rainforest|Ituri]] Forest of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] a monodominant ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forest understory only receives 0.57% full sunlight while a mixed-forest understory received 1.15% full sunlight. This difference may prohibit many plant species from living in that environment due to the low light conditions and their resulting inability to sufficiently and effectively [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Even some species that are more shade tolerant cannot survive the severe low light conditions.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Leaf-litter ===
[[File:Leaf litter.jpg|thumb|Leaf litter]]
A monodominant forest has generally very deep [[leaf litter]] because the leaves are not [[Decomposition|decomposing]] as quickly as in other [[forest]]s. In some monodominant forests the decomposition rates can be two to three times slower than [[mixed forest]]s.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Low [[ammonium]] and [[nitrate]] could be the result of this slow decomposition which in turn, means less nutrients in the soil for other plant species to use.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Nutrient processing ===
[[Nutrient cycle|Nutrient processing]] is somewhat different from one [[forest]] to another. In the ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forests there is low availability of [[nitrogen]] due to the low levels in the leaves that fall to the ground and the slow [[decomposition]]. This could prevent other plant species from [[Colonisation (biology)|colonizing]] because the soil lacks necessary nutrients.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; In ''[[Parashorea chinensis]]'' forests, trees are known to require more [[Soil fertility|fertile soils]] than in other areas. There is a large amount of [[manganese]] though that prevents other plants from taking root. Manganese can poison other trees if the levels are too high and possibly cause leaf [[chlorosis]] and [[necrosis]] and prevent the nutrient uptake of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Velden, N., Ferry Slik, J. W., Hu, Y. H., Lan, G., Lin, L., Deng, X., &amp; Poorter, L. (2014). "Monodominance of ''Parashorea chinensis'' on fertile soils in a Chinese tropical rain forest". ''Journal of Tropical Ecology'', 30(04), 311-322.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mast fruiting ===
Mast [[fruiting]] is a mass fruiting event that overwhelms the animals that consume fruit and helps the seeds' [[survival rate]]. Well-defended leaves also assist in the prevention of [[predation]]. In the ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forests this mast fruiting does not assist in lesser predation, but in [[Asia]] and the [[Neotropics]] this does induce fitness benefits &lt;ref name="VisserJongejans2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Jongejans|first2=Eelke|last3=van Breugel|first3=Michiel|last4=Zuidema|first4=Pieter A.|last5=Chen|first5=Yu-Yun|last6=Rahman Kassim|first6=Abdul|last7=de Kroon|first7=Hans|title=Strict mast fruiting for a tropical dipterocarp tree: a demographic cost-benefit analysis of delayed reproduction and seed predation|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=99|issue=4|year=2011|pages=1033–1044|issn=00220477|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01825.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is actually important to monodominant maintenance.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Poor dispersal ===
A monodominant [[forest]] has poor [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]] because of the lack of animal dispersers, so many of the [[seed]]s are just dropped from the parent tree and fall to the ground where they [[Germination|germinate]]. This can create a regular and [[wikt:radial|radial]] path around the parent tree that results in a "tree-by-tree replacement" in a [[mixed forest]].&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; In a monodominant forest the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] species do not need all of the described traits to overwhelm the area. Though many have a combination, all monodominant forests have at least one of these traits to create the monodominant habitat.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Ectomycorrhizal association ===
Many of the [[Tropics|tropical]] monodominant trees are associated with [[Ectomycorrhizal fungus|ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi]] networks. [[Mycorrhizal fungi]] are known to effect plant [[Biodiversity|diversity]] trends in a variety of [[ecosystem]]s around the world.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt; [[Ectomycorrhiza]]l relations with trees can increase [[Nutrient|nutrient supplies]] through a more effectual use of larger capacities of [[soil]]s or through the direct [[decomposition]] of [[leaf litter]]. This has been suggested to provide a competitive advantage to such tree species.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt;

Examples of ectomycorrhizal trees in [[tropical rainforest]]s can be found in Asia, Africa, and the Neotropics. There is a strong correlation between the ECM association in tropical trees and the occurrence of monodominance.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

[[Fungi]] like mycorrihizae appear not to harm the leaves and even display a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, A. E., and F. Lutzoni. 2007. Diversity and host range of folier fungal endophytes: Are tropical leaves biodiversity hotspots? Ecology 88: 541-549.&lt;/ref&gt; ECM fungi are derived from saprotrophs and retain some ability to decompose organic material. Because tropical soils are often nutrient-poor, ECM trees are predicted to have a competitive advantage over neighboring trees because of their ability to attain more nutrients. With time this could lead to dominance in a tropical rainforest.

==== Ectomycorrhizal mediated mechanisms ====
A study of ''Dicymbe corymbosa'' individuals show that (in terms of total [[basal area]]) the adult trees dominate resources and space. Additionally, they form [[Coppicing|coppices]], also known as [[epicormic shoot]]s, which allow their perseverance over time. Hence, if one stem of the tree dies, it is replaced by another living stem in the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]. This creates same-species regrowth at stem level. All of this requires high levels of [[carbohydrate]]s and nutrients that are accumulated from the ECM association.
There is evidence that [[masting]] tree species rely on ECM associations to accumulate these requisite nutrients for reproduction during inter-mast years. Associations between resource levels stowed in plant tissue, timing of masting, and ECM patterns propose that [[Ectomycorrhizal fungus|ECM fungi]] are essential in the procurement of nutrients required for large masting trees.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

Seeds of monodominant trees typically have higher rates of [[germination]] and seedling survival when planted in monodominant forests rather than [[mixed forest]]s. Monodominant seedlings planted in mixed forests have significantly lower levels of ECM colonization of [[root]]s. The lower percent of ECM colonization can cause the low [[survival rate]]s of these seedlings in mixed forest.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt; Another mechanism that can be important for seedling and growth survival is a connection to a common [[Ectomycorrhiza|ECM]] network. By connecting their small root systems to ECM networks that emanate from larger adults, more benefits can be received.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

Slower [[decomposition]] rates in monodominant forests have been hypothesized to be a result of competition between [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] bacteria and [[Fungus|fungi]]. ECM fungi may be suppressing saprotrophs in the monodominant forest to slow decomposition and return organically bound nutrients back to the tree. This is also called the "Gadgil" hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

== Ecological impacts ==
All of the traits that contribute to creating a monodominant forest over time hinder the growth of other plant species and force them to move to a more [[mixed forest]]. Even though this is inconvenient for the plant species that were there, there has not been any evidence that suggests that this is a negative effect of monodominance.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; Monodominant forests are also found to have significantly less [[nitrogen]] in their [[soil]] than mixed forests. In these monodominant forests there are a lot of [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] tree species from the [[Legume family|legume]] family that have [[nitrogen fixation]]. Nitrogen fixation creates compounds that help a plant to grow in otherwise low nutrient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Brookshire, E. J., &amp; Thomas, S. A. (2013). Ecosystem Consequences of Tree Monodominance for Nitrogen Cycling in Lowland Tropical Forest. PLoS ONE,8(7), e70491.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moss''' is a [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite]] that [[Meteorite fall|fell]] over the communities of [[Rygge]] and [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] in [[Østfold]] county, southeast southern Norway in the morning of midsummer day, July 14, 2006.

The last time a type CO3 meteorite fell from the sky was in 1937 with [[Kainsaz meteorite|Kainsaz]], Russia. There are 6 known falls of a CO3 meteorite. Being of the rare [[Carbonaceous chondrite|carbonaceous]] subtype, 'meteorite man' [[Robert A. Haag|Robert Haag]] stated to the media that this was the most important meteorite fall since the Canadian [[Tagish Lake meteorite|Tagish Lake]] fall in January 2000.

==History==

===Prelude===
The summer of 2006 was the meteorite summer in Norway. The summer was very warm and dry. It was perfect weather to protect the valuable droppings that the skies let fall over Norway.
It started in the beginning of June when on the 7th a very large meteor explosion was seen and heard over large areas in northernmost Norway. Although no meteorites was found from that event, its size stirred a whole world of meteorite aficionados and a stunned scientific community in Norway and abroad.

Then on the 10th of July it was announced on [[NRK]]1, Norway's number one TV channel, that a meteorite had been found in a man's driveway south of [[Stavanger]]. The story was soon denounced by the experts as being a [[plutonic]] rock from a nearby source.

But then, incredible as it was, just four days later the skies opened for a true meteorite fall event. This turned out to be the 13th find of a meteorite in Norway. At the same time its 9th fall.

As if this was not enough, at the end of August a very large fireball was seen north from [[Troms]] county to south of [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], almost along the whole coast of the country, but no meteorites were found.

===Fall===
At about 10:20 a.m. on the 14th of July a large meteor was seen in broad daylight by a large number of people heading north-northwest over [[Østfold]] county, Norway. It split into 4 or 5 smaller objects. It was seen from a large area extending outwards in all directions from the [[Oslofjord]] area, in north limited to roughly [[Lake Mjøsa]], in east from [[Årjäng]], Sweden, and in the southwest to the coast area of [[Sørlandet]]. Over Rygge and Moss a loud explosion and a rumbling sound was heard.
A man near his summer cabin in Rygge saw and heard a small piece of stone hit an aluminium sheet about 2 meter away. This was the only directly observed impacting stone from the fall.

===Finds===
In all there were five separate finds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moss-avis.no/nyheter/det-regner-steiner-1.4268853 Moss-Avis (newspaper): About first stone, 36.7g]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moss-avis.no/nyheter/himmel-for-et-funn-1.4291642 Moss-Avis (newspaper): About second stone, 752g]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moss-avis.no/nyheter/meteoritt-gjennom-tak-1.4269829 Moss-Avis (newspaper): About fifth stone, 676g]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Moss CO3.6 meteorite. They distributed over a [[Strewn field|strewnfield]] about {{convert|6|km}} long from southeast in [[Rygge]] to northwest in parts of north [[Moss, Norway|Moss]].

The largest find, the [[main mass]], was in several tens of pieces, part of it being smashed while hitting a fence. It was almost {{convert|2|kg}} in weight.
The total weight of all the finds was over {{convert|4|kg}}.&lt;ref name=metbull /&gt;

==Classification and scientific studies==
[[File:Moss meteorite, slice2.jpg|thumb|Moss slice]]
Several scientific papers have come out on the closer study of the meteorite.
The first preliminary study of August 2006 showed that it contains numerous small [[chondrules]], most &lt;0.2mm and small &lt;1mm amoeboid [[olivine]] aggregates (AOAs) and small [[Ca-Al-rich inclusion|CAIs]] (calcium aluminium inclusions). It also contains isolated grains of [[olivine]], [[troilite]] and [[kamacite]] in a gray [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]].

It has been classified as [[carbonaceous chondrite]] of type CO3 - [[Ornans meteorite|Ornans]] type. Its accepted designation is CO3.6. Its petrologic type 3.6 means that it is only slightly [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] by heating from its original state, but more so than most of the 5 other CO3 falls. Its closest kin of these falls is Ornans, the group type specimen. It contains only about 0.25 percent [[carbon]], some present as [[organic compound]]s. Typically [[benzene]], [[toluene]], C2-alkyl benzene and traces of biphenyl, benzonitrile and aliphatic hydrocarbones.

The [[shock stage]] is S2.

In [[computer science]], '''overhead''' is any combination of excess or indirect computation time, memory, bandwidth, or other resources that are required to perform a specific [[task (computing)|task]]. It is a special case of [[engineering overhead]]. Overhead can be a deciding factor in software design, with regard to structure, error correction, and feature inclusion.  Examples of computing overhead may be found in functional programming{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, data transfer, and data structures.

==Software design==

===Choice of implementation===
A programmer/software engineer may have a choice of several [[algorithm]]s, [[encoding]]s, [[data type]]s or [[data structure]]s, each of which have known characteristics. When choosing among them, their respective overhead should also be considered.

===Tradeoffs===
In [[software engineering]], overhead can influence the decision whether or not to include features in new products, or indeed whether to fix bugs. A feature that has a high overhead may not be included&amp;nbsp;– or needs a big financial incentive to do so. Often, even though software providers are well aware of bugs in their products, the payoff of fixing them is not worth the reward, because of the overhead.

For example, an [[implicit data structure]] or [[succinct data structure]] may provide low space overhead, but at the cost of slow performance (space/time tradeoff).

===Run-time complexity of software===
Algorithmic complexity is generally specified using [[Big O Notation]]. This makes no comment on how long something takes to run or how much memory it uses, but how its increase depends on the size of the input. Overhead is ''deliberately'' not part of this calculation, since it varies from one machine to another, whereas the fundamental running time of an algorithm does not.

This should be contrasted with [[algorithmic efficiency]], which takes into account all kinds of resources&amp;nbsp;– a combination (though not a trivial one) of complexity and overhead.

==Examples==

===Computer Programming (run-time and computational overhead)===
Invoking a [[Function (computer science)|function]] introduces a small run-time overhead. Sometimes the compiler can minimize this overhead by [[inlining]] some of these [[function call]]s.

===Communications (data transfer overhead)===
Reliably sending a [[Payload (computing)|payload]] of data over a communications network requires sending more than just payload itself. It also involves sending various control and signalling data ([[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]) required to reach the destination. This creates a so-called '''protocol overhead''' as the additional data does not contribute to the intrinsic meaning of the message.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997599.aspx Common Performance Issues in Network Applications Part 1: Interactive Applications], Windows XP Technical Articles, Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonic.net/support/docs/ip-atm.overhead.pdf Protocol Overhead in IP/ATM Networks], Minnesota Supercomputer Center&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telephony]], number dialing and [[call set-up time]] are overheads.  In 2-way (but [[half-duplex]]) radios, the use of "over" and other signalling needed to avoid [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collisions]] is an overhead.

Protocol overhead can be expressed as a percentage of non-application [[byte]]s (protocol and [[frame synchronization]]) divided by the total number of bytes in the message.

===Encodings and data structures (size overhead)===
The [[encoding]] of information and data introduces overhead too. The date and time ''"2011-07-12 07:18:47"'' can be expressed as [[Unix time]] with the 32-bit [[Signedness|signed]] [[integer]] &lt;code&gt;1310447927&lt;/code&gt;, consuming only 4 [[byte]]s. Represented as [[ISO 8601]] formatted [[UTF-8]] encoded [[String literal|string]] &lt;code&gt;2011-07-12 07:18:47&lt;/code&gt; the date would consume 19 byte, a size overhead of 375% over the binary integer representation. As [[XML]] this date can be written as follows with an overhead of 218 characters, while adding the semantic context that it is a CHANGEDATE with index 1.
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
      &lt;DATETIME qualifier="CHANGEDATE" index="1"&gt;
      &lt;YEAR&gt;2011&lt;/YEAR&gt;
      &lt;MONTH&gt;07&lt;/MONTH&gt;
      &lt;DAY&gt;12&lt;/DAY&gt;
      &lt;HOUR&gt;07&lt;/HOUR&gt;
      &lt;MINUTE&gt;18&lt;/MINUTE&gt;
      &lt;SECOND&gt;47&lt;/SECOND&gt;
   &lt;/DATETIME&gt;
The 349 byte, resulting from the UTF-8 encoded XML, correlates to a size overhead of 8625% over the original integer representation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7688">The '''patriarchal age''' is the era of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], according to the narratives of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12–50. (These chapters also contain the history of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], although Joseph is not one of the patriarchs.) It is preceded in the Bible by the [[primeval history]] and followed by [[The Exodus]].

==Jewish tradition==
The Bible contains an intricate pattern of chronologies from the creation of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the first man, to the reigns of the later kings of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Based on this chronology and the Rabbinic tradition, ancient Jewish sources such as [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] date the birth of [[Abraham]] to 1948 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] (c. 1813 BCE)&lt;ref name="abraham_jvl"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/abraham.html Jewish Virtual Library: Abraham]&lt;/ref&gt; and place the death of [[Jacob]] in 2255 AM (c. 1506 BCE).

==Biblical criticism==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
History known and dateable independently from the Bible first makes contact with the Scriptures during the era of the first Jewish kings. As such, the events before this period came to be disputed with the advent of [[biblical criticism]] in the 19th century. Little interest in questioning the [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]] existed before then, but with the development of the [[documentary hypothesis]] – the theory that the [[Pentateuch]], including the [[Book of Genesis]], was composed not by [[Moses]] but by unknown authors living at various times between 950 and 450 BC.

==Early biblical archaeology==
Out of this heated debate between the various theories of [[biblical criticism]] and traditional, religious interpretations was born [[biblical archaeology]], a form of archaeology different from others in that it sought not to discover and interpret mute evidence, but to validate or invalidate the historicity of the patriarchs and the events surrounding their lives, as described within the Bible.

The most eminent of early biblical archaeologists was [[William F. Albright]], who believed that he had identified the patriarchal age in the period 2100–1800 BC, the Intermediate [[Bronze Age]], the interval between two periods of highly developed urban culture in ancient [[Canaan]]. Albright argued that he had found evidence of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|sudden collapse]] of the previous Early Bronze Age culture, and ascribed this to the invasion of migratory [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomads]] from the northeast whom he identified with the [[Amorites]] mentioned in Mesopotamian texts. According to Albright, Abraham was a wandering Amorite who migrated from the north into the central highlands of Canaan and the Negev with his flocks and followers as the Canaanite city-states collapsed. Albright, [[E. A. Speiser]] and [[Cyrus Gordon]] argued that although the texts described by the documentary hypothesis were written centuries after the patriarchal age, archaeology had shown that they were nevertheless an accurate reflection of the conditions of the 2nd millennium BC: "We can assert with full confidence that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were actual historical individuals."&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, "History of Israel", 1972, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern biblical archaeology==
Albright's interpretation came under fierce criticism as archaeology unearthed apparent [[anachronism]]s in the biblical accounts of the patriarchal age, in some cases suggesting that some of the texts were written later than the traditional dates. For example, in Genesis 21:32, Abraham apparently encounters [[Philistines]], who (according to archaeology{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}) actually did not settle in the Middle East until the 12th century BCE. However, usage of future place names had been a known Scriptural phenomenon to Jewish scholars for centuries prior to the biblical criticism movement.&lt;ref name="rashi_ber2"&gt;For instance, the classic tenth-century commentator [[Rashi]] notes that the Bible sometimes refers to places according to the names that later peoples created for them, as in his comment on Gen. 2:14: "Cush and Assyria: As yet they did not exist and Scripture wrote [using] their future names." Similarly in chapter 21, the Bible never actually calls Abimelech and his subjects "Philistines," but only says that they returned to "the land [that would become that] of the Philistines."&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] from 2014 discovered what may be the earliest domesticated [[camel]] bones found in Israel or even anywhere outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This has been described as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news| last=Hasson |first=Nir |title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference |url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091 |accessdate=30 January 2014 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sapir-Hen |first=Lidar |author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley |journal=Tel Aviv |year=2013 |volume=40 |pages=277–285 |url= http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf |accessdate=16 February 2014 |doi= 10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albright himself saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;Heide, Martin. 2011 "The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible." Ugarit-Forschungen 42: 368.&lt;/ref&gt; However, earlier excavations from elsewhere in the Middle East have uncovered domesticated camel bones in a house dating from ca. 2400 BCE, and that there exist written records and pictorial depictions of camels as pack animals much before 930 BCE, even from prior to ca. 1700 BCE, and again on a cylinder seal dating stylistically from ca. 1400 BCE or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bromiley |first=ed.

'''Practising Law Institute''' ('''PLI''') is a non-profit [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) organization chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York. Founded in 1933, the company organizes and provides CLE programs around the world. Its programs are held in multiple locations including New York, California, Illinois, Washington D.C., Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, London, and Hong Kong.

Programs are also offered in various formats, including live webcasts, MP3s, and on-demand videos. PLI's headquarters are located in New York City, New York; it also maintains an office in San Francisco, California.

==History==
Founded in 1933, PLI was established to offer courses in the practice of law for lawyers recently admitted to the bar and/or those seeking to learn the elements of practicing in the field. As the country was seeing a transition from apprenticeship to formal law school education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706002749/http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York City lawyer by the name of Harold Seligson recognized the need for practical training in law and originated a series of lectures called “Practising Law Courses.” These lectures would be the germination of the full-fledged Institute that exists today under the banner of the Practising Law Institute (PLI).

By 1939, the Institute had been formally chartered by the Regents of the State of New York. It was able to take advantage of certain historical forces, including the [[New Deal]] and the federal regulation of business activity it inspired. The [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], for example, initiated a new specialization in the law. This new specialization in turn created a need for a new kind of [[continuing legal education]], which we see in practice today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a not-for-profit educational organization, PLI continues to offer pro bono programs and scholarships to lawyers and student in need of assistance. In 2012, PLI awarded over 26,000 scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pli.edu/emktg/Annual_Report2012/AnnualReport2012.html|title=AnnualReport2012|work=pli.edu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27th, 2015 the PLI Board of Trustees formally installed Anita Carr Shapiro as its fifth president. She succeeded Victor J. Rubino who was unanimously approved as President Emeritus after serving as PLI's President since 1983. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/practising-law-institute-appoints-anita-carr-shapiro-as-president-and-victor-j-rubino-as-president-emeritus-300071956.html|title=Practising Law Institute Appoints Anita Carr Shapiro as President and Victor J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18409">A '''reception statute''' is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent by which the new nation adopts, or receives, the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] before its independence to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, as well as the [[precedent]]s originating from it, as the default law because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state.

All [[US states]] have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the [[common law]] by judicial opinion, but there is [[Reception statute#United States|a special case of partial reception for Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reception of English common law into new colonies and adoption of common law on decolonization==
In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the process by which [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] followed English colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force.... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if an "uninhabited" or "infidel" territory is colonised by Britain, the English law automatically applies in the territory from the moment of colonisation, but if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively, a form of [[indirect rule]]) until it is formally superseded by the English law by [[Royal Prerogative]], subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

As colonies gained independence from Britain, the newly-independent countries usually adopted [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] [[precedent]] as of the date of independence as the default law to carry forward into the new nation, to the extent that was not explicitly rejected by the founding documents or government.

In some cases, the carry-forward was simply understood, with no express provision in either the new independence constitution or legislation. In other cases, the new legislature preferred to state redundantly but safely that [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] had been received during the colonial period. Examples of both patterns are described below.

== United States ==
After the 1776 [[American Revolution]], one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly-independent states was to adopt a "reception statute" that gave legal effect to the existing body of [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] to the extent that the legislation or the [[constitution]] had not explicitly rejected English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws | last1 = Lammi | first1 = Glenn G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = James | date = December 17, 2004 | journal = Legal Backgrounder | publisher = [[Washington Legal Foundation]] | volume = 19 | issue = 46 | issn=1056-3059|url = http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, but other states received the English common law by provisions of their constitution or by court decision. British traditions such as the [[monarchy]] were rejected by the [[US Constitution]], but many English common law traditions such as [[habeas corpus]], [[jury trials]], and various other [[civil liberties]] were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History''. By Jethro Koller Lieberman. Published by West, 1976. Original from the University of California. Digitized Jun 11, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-519881-2}}, p. 16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i_2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the New York Constitution of 1777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm New York Constitution of 1777] via Avalon Project at [[Yale]] Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that:
{{quote|[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.}}

[[Alexander Hamilton]] emphasized in the [[Federalist Papers]] that the New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject "to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm Federalist 84] (1788).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]], which was approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, guaranteed "judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law." [[Nathan Dane]], the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed that provision as a default mechanism if federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter. Hr wrote that if "a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Dane, 6 ''General Abridgment and Digest of American Law'' §182, art. 5, 230 (Cummings, Hilliard &amp; Co. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories in which no states had yet been established.

Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, the territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington states, "The common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/9th/case/9835154&amp;exact=1 271 F.3d 835] (9th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state (except for the [[law of Louisiana]] for which some areas of law were received as [[common law]] and others were adopted from French and Spanish sources).

Certain anomalies exist within certain US states because of the effective branching of the law in different directions. For example, the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adopted the [[English common law]] upon becoming independent but before [[England]] abolished [[trial by combat]]. Thus, it has been argued that the right to request trial by combat theoretically still exists in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/trial-by-combat-in-the-united-states-2013-11&lt;/ref&gt; at least as far as a [[form of action]] under which the common law had authorized trial by combat would be available in Virginia.

==Canada==
The Canadian colonies received the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] and English statutes under Blackstone's principles for the establishment of the legal system of a new colony. In five of the ten Canadian provinces, English law was received automatically, under the principle of a settled colony inheriting English law. In the other provinces and in the three territories, reception was governed by reception statutes. The reception of English law occurred long before Canada became fully independent and so reception statutes in Canada were not part of the decolonisation process.

When Canada achieved formal independence with the passage of the [[Canada Act 1982]], no reception statutes were necessary for the decolonialisation process.  English law had already been received in all the various Canadian provinces and territories by legislation and judicial decisions over the previous two centuries.

=== Atlantic provinces ===
In the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador), the reception of English law was automatic, under the principle set out by Blackstone relating to settled colonies. British colonists were considered to have brought English common law and the applicable English statutes with them and so no reception statute was necessary.

The reception date for New Brunswick is 1660, for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 1758, and for Newfoundland and Labrador 1825.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec was settled as a French colony and originally operated under the French civil law system by using the ''Coûtume de Paris''. Upon the transfer of the colony to British control, the British government issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which imposed English common law on the colony under the principle set out in Blackstone relating to captured colonies. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]], which restored the French civil law for matters of private law (matters such as contracts, property, and successions (wills)) but kept the English common law as the basis for public law in the colony, notably the criminal law.

With the passage of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] in 1866, Quebec's civil law became entirely statute-based and used the civil law system for matters within provincial jurisdiction.

Public law in Quebec continues to have its origin in the common law, but even then, civil law plays a strong role. If federal legislation requires interpretation, judges must look to the Civil Code of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific (1976), [1977] 2 S.C.R 1054; St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 63, [2001] 4 FC 289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
The territory now forming Ontario was originally part of Quebec and so was under the civil law. When Quebec was divided into the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the first Act passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada was to adopt the law of England for all purposes, replacing the civil law.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to repeal certain parts of an Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled an Act for making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America;  and to introduce the English Law, as the Rule of Decision in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights'', S.U.C. 1792 (32 Geo. III), c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That statute adopted both the English common law and English statute law. The foundation for the operation of the common law in Ontario traces back to that reception statute.

=== North-West Territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta ===
The new Dominion of Canada acquired the territories of  [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1870. Those territories were considered to have been settled by British colonists and so the reception of English law was automatic. However, the long history of control by the Hudson's Bay Company caused some uncertainty as to the date of reception. To resolve the uncertainty, various statutes were passed to set the date of reception to July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of those two territories to Canada. The Province of Manitoba set that date for the reception of English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an ordinance, adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction.

The federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting that date for all matters in the North-West Territories.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/NWT.pdf The North-West Territories Act]'', R.S.C.1885, c. 50, s. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; That provision was carried forward in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created by the [[Alberta Act]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html Alberta Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saskatchewan Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/SK%20Act.pdf Saskatchewan Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same provision is the basis for the reception date of English law in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia was considered to be a settled colony and so received English law automatically, under the principle set out by Blackstone.

==Hong Kong==

Hong Kong was ceded (in case of the [[New Territories]], leased) to the United Kingdom by [[Qing dynasty]] of China by a series of treaties, starting with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the late 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of [[murder]] would be executed by [[decapitation]], but an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades after the fall of the Qing dynasty, that the of the Qing Code was completely abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap. 178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice [[polygamy]] by virtue of the Qing Code. The courts still refer to the Qing Code on the inheritance rights of surviving [[concubinage|concubines]] married before 1971 and that of their children.

When Hong Kong was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, Hong Kong retained the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] in a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8, of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html |title=Chapter I, Section 8 of Hong Kong Basic Law |publisher=Basiclaw.gov.hk |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.}}

==Republic of Ireland==

The 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] stated that pre-existing laws would remain in force except if repugnant to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 73 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] does likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article50_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 50.1 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither explicitly stated whether that meant only the statute law or, more broadly, the common law and [[equity (law)|equity]] as well. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] has generally taken the broader view.&lt;ref name="Keane2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Ronan|title=Equity and the Law of Trusts in the Republic of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=16 July 2016|year=2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667021|pages=22–23, sec.2.39|chapter=The Historical Background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other British colonies==
The pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Belize]] and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law by reception statutes although they do not inevitably continue to copy English common law; later cases can often draw on decisions in other common law jurisdictions. The colony of [[New South Wales]] formally received the English common law in 1828, and each of the other Australian colonies received the common law of New South Wales upon its founding.

== History ==
The school was founded in 1918. Originally, it was located in the Lobanov-Rostovsky house, also known as "house with lions" at the corner of [[Saint Isaac's Square]] and [[Admiralteysky Prospect]]. It was one of only handful of schools to remain open during [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In 1961 the school was granted status of city's school with specialization in physics and mathematics. In 1964 the school moved to the building on Kazansky Street 48/1, which was previously occupied by school of working youth, and in 1966 it moved again to [[Moika River]], 108. Finally, in 1975 the school relocated to its current location, into the historic [[Annenschule]] building.
In 1990, the Russian Ministry of Education granted school the status of physico-mathematical lyceum and experimental laboratory for standard of education in physics, mathematics and informatics in Saint Petersburg. In 1994, the school won the [[George Soros]] grant. The US Mathematical society voted the school as one of top ten schools of former Soviet Union. The first of January 2014 the school received a status of "''Presidential'' Physics and Mathematics Lyceum №239".

[[File:Agulhas chla.png|thumb|right|[[NASA]] map of the [[Agulhas Current]] showing the levels of [[primary production]] during 2009. This is a measure of how much food was available for the spawning sardines.]]

The '''sardine run''' of southern Africa occurs from May through July when billions of [[sardine]]s – or more specifically the Southern African [[pilchard]] ''[[Sardinops sagax]]'' – spawn in the cool waters of the [[Agulhas Bank]] and move northward along the east coast of [[South Africa]]. Their sheer numbers create a [[feeding frenzy]] along the [[coastline]].
The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to [[Mozambique]] where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the [[Indian Ocean]].

In terms of [[biomass]], researchers estimate the sardine run could rival East Africa's great [[wildebeest]] migration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/marine-scientists-scratch-heads-over-sardines-1.220684?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot Marine Scientists Scratch Heads Over Sardines]. Reuters. August 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, little is known of the phenomenon. It is believed that the water temperature has to drop below 21&amp;nbsp;°C in order for the migration to take place. In 2003, the sardines failed to 'run' for the third time in 23 years. While 2005 saw a good run, 2006 marked another non-run.&lt;ref name="Run"&gt;[http://www.divethebig5.com/html/sardine_run.html Sardine Run] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194553/http://www.divethebig5.com/html/sardine_run.html |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shoals are often more than 7&amp;nbsp;km long, 1.5&amp;nbsp;km wide and 30 metres deep and are clearly visible from spotter planes or from the surface.

Sardines group together when they are threatened. This instinctual behaviour is a defence mechanism, as lone individuals are more likely to be eaten than large groups.

==Causes==
[[File:Sardine Shoal Amanzimtoti 23 07 2010.JPG|thumb|Netting a shoal of sardines (dark patch in the water)]]
The sardine run is still poorly understood from an ecological point of view.
There have been various hypotheses, sometimes contradictory, that try to explain why and how the run occurs.

A recent interpretation of the causes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P Fréon |url=http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3728 |title=A review and tests of hypotheses about causes of the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run |journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=449–479 |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.519451 |last2=Coetzee |first2=J C |last3=Van Der Lingen |first3=C D |last4=Connell |first4=A D |last5=o’Donoghue |first5=S H |last6=Roberts |first6=M J |last7=Demarcq |first7=H |last8=Attwood |first8=C G |last9=Lamberth |first9=S J |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420094105/http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3728 |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the sardine run is most likely a seasonal reproductive migration of a genetically distinct subpopulation of sardine that moves along the coast from the eastern Agulhas Bank to the coast of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in most years if not in every year.

The migration is restricted to the inshore waters by the preference of sardine for cooler water and the strong and warm offshore Agulhas Current, which flows in the opposite direction to the migration, and is strongest just off the continental shelf.
A band of cooler coastal water and the occurrence of Natal Pulses and break-away eddies make it possible for sardine shoals to overcome their habitat constraints. The importance of these enabling factors is greatest where the continental shelf is narrowest.

The presence of eggs off the KwaZulu-Natal coast suggests that sardine stay there for several months and their return migration during late winter to spring is nearly always unnoticeable because it probably occurs at depths where the water is cooler than at the surface.

In some years there does not appear to be a sardine run. This may be because it is not detected by coastal observers either because it actually does not occur due to high water temperatures and/or other hydrographic barriers, or the migration may occur farther offshore and possibly deeper due to unusual conditions.

==Oceanographic influences==
Sardine prefer water temperatures between 14 and 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barange M|author2=Hampton I|year=1997|title=Spatial structure of co-occurring anchovy and sardine populations from acoustic data: implications for survey design|journal=Fisheries Oceanography|volume=6|pages=94–108|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2419.1997.00032.x|url=ftp://ftp.imarpe.pe/Curso_Modelos/Biblio%20Arnaud%201/Barange-Hampton-1997.pdf|issue=2}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each southern winter the nearshore sea temperature along the South African south east coast drops to within this range. Along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, sardine may be found in water warmer than 20&amp;nbsp;°C.
It was hypothesized that factors beside temperature may influence the movement of sardine along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, One of these factors may be predation pressure.

===Oceanographic regions of the KwaZulu-Natal coast===
The KwaZulu-Natal coast includes varied oceanographic regions, each influenced by distinct environmental forces.&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"/&gt;
*The continental shelf waters of the KwaZulu-Natal Mid to Lower South coasts are dominated by the warm Agulhas Current which flows toward the south west. This water has a mean winter temperature of 23&amp;nbsp;°C and the current speed is often more than 1&amp;nbsp;m/s within 5&amp;nbsp;km of the coast.
*The Agulhas Current follows a very constant path. The main stream is just offshore of the continental shelf break most of the time, which suggests that conditions are normally unsuitable for sardines along that part of the coast.
*Local winds do not appear to have much effect on the currents.
*Sardine move closer to shore as they travel northwards along the coast, but it is not known whether this is due to environmental conditions or biological conditions.
*There is a persistent cyclonic gyre known as the Durban Eddy, where warm Agulhas Current water flows onto the shelf and the resulting inshore current direction is from south to north. This section of coast may be considered a transition from the wind-dominated section of the continental shelf to the north, to the Agulhas Current dominated section of shelf to the south.
*The North Coast section of continental shelf is considerably wider (&gt;40&amp;nbsp;km) than that of the south coast (roughly 15&amp;nbsp;km). This causes the Agulhas Current to flow farther offshore, and current conditions over the shelf are more variable. Wind appears to be a dominant influence in the region. Longshore north-easterly or south-westerly winds precede currents of similar direction by roughly 18 hours. Sea temperature is often lower and nutrients higher than along the South Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lutjeharms JRE |author2=Valentine HR |author3=van Ballegooyen RC |year= 2000|title=The hydrography and water masses of the Natal Bight, South Africa|journal= Continental Shelf Research |volume=20|pages=1907–1939|doi=10.1016/S0278-4343(00)00053-4 |url=http://www.bcre.org.za/seaatlas/papers/natal_bight.pdf|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The North Coast would seem to be more suitable habitat for sardine, but it is not known to what extent they use it.

These distinct regions may affect sardine distribution and movement.

===Oceanographic variables and sardine presence===
Some oceanographic variables have been found useful for describing conditions influencing sardine presence.&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"&gt;{{cite journal|author=SH O’Donoghue, L Drapeau, SFJ Dudley and VM Peddemors|title=The KwaZulu-Natal sardine run: shoal distribution in relation to nearshore environmental conditions, 1997–2007|journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=293–307|doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.501587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Water temperature has an inverse and highly significant influence. This is consistent with the preferred temperature range of sardine.
*Sea currents have a significant effect, with calm current conditions most favourable for sardine presence and moderate current speeds from north to south most detrimental. As sardine movement during the run is northwards, this counter-current effect is expected.
Other conditions associated with sardine presence are:&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"/&gt;
*Increasing atmospheric pressure: sardine presence appears to be higher during periods between the cold fronts along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. These periods have calm atmospheric conditions and slow nearshore currents.
*Large swells and low water clarity associated with cold fronts have a negative effect on sardine presence.
*Wind direction, wind speed, current direction, air temperature and rainfall all significantly affect sea surface temperature and consequently sardine presence. *Current and wind direction effects dominated, with north-easterly wind and currents from north to south resulting in cooler sea surface temperatures.
*North-easterly winds cause the surface water layer to move away from shore (Ekman veering), allowing the cool water to reach the surface, and south-westerly winds push warm Agulhas Current surface water towards the shore causing inshore temperatures to increase, which would negatively impact upon sardine presence.
*Increasing maximum air temperature, south-easterly (onshore) winds, wind speeds in excess of 6&amp;nbsp;m/s, and rainfall, all result in warmer sea surface temperatures.
*Strong south-easterly winds and rainfall are associated with the passage of frontal systems, which would push warm surface waters shoreward resulting in warmer sea surface temperatures.
*Frequent light north-westerly land breezes: When north-westerly land breezes are the strongest winds of the day they have a cooling effect on sea surface temperature. This cooling should be greatest in the vicinity of the surf zone where mixing is most effective. Sardine are often sighted close inshore during early mornings, suggesting that they could be attracted by cooler conditions found there.

====Summary: Oceanographic predictors of sardine presence====
Favourable:
*Decreasing sea surface temperature
*Calm current conditions
*Light north-westerly land breezes
*Stable atmospheric conditions.
Unfavourable:
*Increasing sea surface temperature
*Moderate north to south currents
*Large swells
*Turbid water
North-easterly and north-westerly winds and north to south currents have a cooling effect upon nearshore sea surface temperatures, but south-easterly winds and increasing air temperatures cause nearshore sea surface temperature warming.

Dolphins (estimated as being up to 18,000 in number, mostly the [[common dolphin]] (''Delphinus capensis'')) are largely responsible for rounding up the sardines into bait balls. These [[bait ball]]s can be 10–20 metres in diameter and extend to a depth of 10 metres. The bait balls are short lived and seldom last longer than 10 minutes. Once the sardines are rounded up, sharks (primarily the [[bronze whaler]]), and birds (like the [[Cape gannet]]), and [[Bryde's whale]]s take advantage of the opportunity. Other whale species, regardless of whether do or not join the run, may appear in the vicinity such as [[humpback whale|humpback]], [[southern right whale|southern right]], and [[minke whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith D..

===Predators as predictors of sardine presence===
The Cape gannet is the predator species most closely associated with sardine presence along the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coastline and is the most useful indicator of sardine run activity.

Sharks and large gamefish presence is also strongly associated with sardine presence during the run, but as they are not as easily observed from the surface they are not as useful a predictor of sardine presence.

The presence of common dolphins inshore along the east coast during winter is significantly associated with sardine presence and common dolphin can be considered the third most useful species for predicting sardine presence.

The resident population of [[bottlenose dolphin]] does not appear to associate with the sardine run, whereas the migrant stock does. This may explain why the bottlenose dolphin is less likely to predict sardine presence.&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"/&gt;

===Record of predators===
'''2005 records''':
In June and July 2005 the avian and mammal predators included Bryde’s whale (''[[Balaenoptera edeni]]''), African penguin (''[[Spheniscus demersus]]''), Cape cormorant (''[[Phalacrocorax capensis]]'') which were predominantly found in the cooler southern part of the region.
Peak sardine run activity occurred within 4&amp;nbsp;km of shore at the northward limit of a strip of cool water (&lt;21&amp;nbsp;°C) stretching along the East Coast. The principal predators at this stage were common dolphins (''Delphinus capensis'') and Cape gannets (''Morus capensis'').&lt;ref name="Predators bird and mammal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=SH O’Donoghue, PA Whittington, BM Dyer and VM Peddemors|title=Abundance and distribution of avian and marine mammal predators of sardine observed during the 2005 KwaZulu-Natal sardine run survey|journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010|volume= 32|issue=2|pages= 361–374|doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.502640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic importance==
[[File:Sardines Amanzimtoti 17-06-07 1056.JPG|thumb|Sardines caught off [[Amanzimtoti]], South Africa]]

===Tourism===
The recent interest in the sardine run has had significant impact on the local economy. International and domestic divers join local tour operators on sardine run diving expeditions. Such expeditions run from Eastern Cape towns, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20160706203947/http://bluewilderness.co.za/durban-shark-dives/sardine-run-south-africa/ East London], Port Saint Johns, and Port Elizabeth. The run has become important to tourism and is considered to be one of the main attractions in KwaZulu-Natal during the winter holiday period. Both local and international tourists are attracted to the spectacle and are provided with opportunities to participate in activities such as dive charters and boat based predator viewing tours.
The [[KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board]] and East Coast Radio, facilitate a ‘Sardine Run Hotline’, which provides information on the position and movement of sardine shoals. Information is also provided on the internet.&lt;ref name="Overview of sardine run" /&gt;

The Sardine Run Association (www.thesardinerunassociation.org) has been formed to provide a link between [https://web.archive.org/web/20160706203947/http://bluewilderness.co.za/durban-shark-dives/sardine-run-south-africa/ tour operator] s, tourists, non-governmental organisations,
scientists, and local and national governments.

===Fishery===
The sardine run also supports a small-scale, seasonal beach [[seine net|seine]] fishery.

==History==
The oldest known record of the run is a mention in the Natal Mercury newspaper of 4 August 1853.
More recently, the run has been the subject of natural history documentaries (e.g. the BBC’s [[Nature's Great Events#4. .22The Great Tide.22|Nature's Great Events]]) and printed popular media
(e.g. [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]).&lt;ref name="Overview of sardine run"&gt;{{cite journal|author=CD van der Lingen, JC Coetzee and L Hutchings |title=Overview of the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run |journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=271–277 |url=http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3715 |doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.501581 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420094114/http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3715 |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 2011 run ===
Pilot shoals were netted at [[Hibberdene, KwaZulu-Natal|Hibberdene]] on 20 June 2011, while the main shoal was sighted near [[Port St. Johns, Eastern Cape|Port St. Johns]]. Small pockets of sardines were seen between [[Mfazazana]] and [[Margate, KwaZulu-Natal|Margate]]. About 25 crates of sardines were hauled out from the first netting at Hibberdene.&lt;ref name="Mercury21June"/&gt; A further 33 crates of sardines were netted, and were sold at R700 per crate or R30 per dozen sardines. The 58 crates were sold "within minutes".&lt;ref name="UpperCoastFeverJune24"&gt;Krishna, C. Upper Coast Fever: ''The sardines are finally here! Early arrivals netted on local beaches'', June 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt was also made to net sardines at [[Banana Beach]]. About 500 [[common dolphin]]s and numerous sharks were noted near Margate. [[Shark nets]] had been removed between [[Umgababa]] and [[Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal|Port Edward]].&lt;ref name="Mercury21June"&gt;Padayachee, K. The Mercury: ''First Trickle of Sardines Netted'', June 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sardines were netted at [[Park Rynie, KwaZulu-Natal|Park Rynie]] on 21 June 2011. Some large nets of 200–300 baskets of sardines were taken. The baskets sold at R600 each. A large gathering of sardine predators was seen off [[Port Grosvenor]] on the [[Wild Coast Region, Eastern Cape|Wild Coast]]. Thousands of [[Cape gannet]]s and dolphins were seen in a continuous line of about 6&amp;nbsp;km between [[Brazen Head]] and just north of the [[Umtata River]]. It is suspected that this year's shoal is "massive", and will produce a "bumper run". Shark nets have been removed to the south of [[Durban]]. The first shoals were expected to reach [[Amanzimtoti]] on 23 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Mercury22June"&gt;Langa, L. The Mercury: [http://m.iol.co.za/article/view/s/11/a/73405 ''Bumper sardine run could be just around the corner''], June 22, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052324/http://m.iol.co.za/article/view/s/11/a/73405 |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main shoal was still near Port St Johns.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJune22"&gt;Medley, L. Daily News: ''Sardines head for Amanzimtoti'', June 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2011, a "few" baskets were netted at Umgababa beach, and a "handful" of baskets were netted at [[Warner Beach]] in the afternoon. Sardines were also netted at [[Isipingo]], where 14 baskets were hauled out. The sardines therefore reached the Amanzimtoti area a day earlier than predicted.&lt;ref name="SunJune24"&gt;South Coast Sun: [http://www.looklocal.co.za/looklocal/content/en/amanzimtoti/amanzimtoti-news-general?oid=4494191&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=4197458&amp;Early-sardine--surprise-on-Upper-South-Coast ''Early sardine surprise on Upper South Coast''], June 24, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130421234317/http://www.looklocal.co.za/looklocal/content/en/amanzimtoti/amanzimtoti-news-general?oid=4494191&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=4197458&amp;Early-sardine--surprise-on-Upper-South-Coast |date=April 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rough seas (with waves up to 4.7 m) caused by strong winds associated with a [[cold front]] kept the sardines from the shore on 23 June 2011. Pockets of sardines were seen far out to sea off the [[Bluff, KwaZulu-Natal|Bluff]]. The rough water and far distance of the sardines from shore made it impossible for the fish to be netted. No dolphin or bird activity was seen in the Durban area associated with the sardines. The main shoal was still suspected to be off the [[Eastern Cape]] coastline,&lt;ref name=DailyNewsJune23&gt;Daily News: ''Feeling Swell'', June 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; with a report of some sardines still seen near Port St Johns on 22 and 23 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Shane"&gt;Shane's Fishing Blog: [http://www.shanesfishing.co.za/sardine-run-2011/ ''Sardine Run 2011''], retrieved 24 June 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619024516/http://www.shanesfishing.co.za/sardine-run-2011/ |date=June 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durban beaches were the scene of most netting activity on 27 June 2011. "Hundreds of baskets" of sardines were hauled onto the beaches in 13 nets. The price per basket was R350 in the morning, but later in the afternoon the price had dropped to R120 per basket.&lt;ref name="MercuryJune28"&gt;The Mercury: ''Rich Bounty'', June 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Each net contained in excess of 300 baskets of sardines, with one net containing around 500 baskets.&lt;ref name="TheCitizen29June"&gt;The Citizen: ''Sardine run at fever pitch off South Coast'', 29 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sardines were also netted at [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]], [[Port Shepstone, KwaZulu-Natal|Port Shepstone]], Margate, Umgababa, and [[Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal|Port Edward]]. Cape gannets and other seabirds were seen "plunging from considerable heights" to catch the sardines, especially on the South Coast.&lt;ref name="DailyNews27June"&gt;Daily News: ''Sardines all along the coastline'', June 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the sardines were netted along the Durban beaches as this was the area of calmest waters; swells along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline were around 2.5 m.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJune28"&gt;Daily News: ''Swells drop and sardines are there!'', June 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Shark nets had been removed from [[Salt Rock, KwaZulu-Natal|Salt Rock]] to Port Edward, and bathers were requested to consult with lifeguards before entering the water.&lt;ref name="TheCitizen29June"/&gt; Meanwhile, a baby dolphin washed up on the beach at [[Scottburgh, KwaZulu-Natal|Scottburgh]], with a gash behind its "flipper" (the photo showed a gash between the dorsal fin and the tail) that exposed the spine. The "weeks old" dolphin was taken to a nearby paddling pool, but authorities later [[euthanasia|euthanased]] it due to the severity of the injuries.&lt;ref name="UpperCoastFeverJuly1"&gt;Upper Coast Fever: ''Little Lost Stranger'', July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation was that the dolphin had been injured by a shark, or by a boat propeller; possibly related to the sardine run.

[[Swell (ocean)|Swells]] dropped to 1–1.5 m on 28 June 2011, allowing more netting of sardines. Sardines were netted at Amanzimtoti; on the main beach and at [[Chain Rocks, Amanzimtoti|Chain Rocks]].&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJune28"/&gt; A 22-year-old American marine biology student (research diver) named Paulo Edward Stanchi was attacked by a large [[dusky shark]] while diving at [[Aliwal Shoal|Aliwal Shoal Marine Protected Area]]. The group of divers had encountered a pocket of sardines when a 3&amp;nbsp;m long dusky shark bit Mr Stanchi on his left leg and hands. Mr Stanchi managed to free himself from the shark, and was treated on the diving boat before being transported to [[Rocky Bay, KwaZulu-Natal|Rocky Bay]], where medics stabilised him. He was then airlifted to [[Nkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital]], where he underwent surgery. Dusky sharks generally live offshore, but come closer to the shore during the sardine run. The annual sardine run allowed more dusky sharks in the Aliwal Shoal MPA than usual, but there was no reason for them to show any more interest in divers than usual. Mr Stanchi had been wearing split fins with black and grey stripes, and this may have looked like a small shoal of fish to the shark.&lt;ref name=SouthCoastSunJuly1&gt;South Coast Sun: ''Shark attacks diver off Aliwal Shoal'', July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheCitizen30June"&gt;Sampson, B. The Citizen: ''Family to visit US shark Attack victim'', 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a woman in her 40s broke her leg in the frenzy at Amanzimtoti when the sardines were netted. The woman is believed to have been trying to get some of the sardines when she "stepped wrong" and fractured her leg. Paramedics stabilized her before transporting her to hospital.&lt;ref name="SouthCoastSunJuly1p3"&gt;South Coast Sun: Sardine frenzy sees woman break her leg'', July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

5 July 2011 was a "quiet day" for the sardine run. "Plenty of birds" were seen diving at Karridene close to the shore. 50 crates of sardines were taken at Umgababa in the early afternoon, while a net of sardines pulled in at Karridene contained some [[Lichia amia|Garrick]]. More Garrick were caught by fishermen at Karridene, but in general there was little other [[game fish]] activity. There was reported to be a "massive shoal" of sardines off [[Coffee Bay]] in the Eastern Cape.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJuly6"&gt;Daily News: ''Quiet Day disappoints anglers, but main shoal on its way'', July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2011, 100 baskets were netted at [[Pennington, KwaZulu-Natal|Pennington]]. It was difficult to predict the sardines' movements as they were staying offshore.&lt;ref name="Independent16July"&gt;Waterworth, T. The Independent on Saturday: ''Fishing Tragedy Averted'', 16 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2011, 300 baskets of sardines were netted at Pennington in the morning. There were lots of gannets off [[Ballito, KwaZulu-Natal|Ballito]], and "quite a bit of fish" between Park Rynie and Mtwalume.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJuly20"&gt;Medley, L. Daily News: ''Sardine surges almost at an end'', July 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Turkey}}
'''Seljuk architecture''' comprises the building traditions used by the [[Seljuq dynasty]], when it ruled most of the [[Middle East]] and [[Anatolia]] during the 11th to 13th centuries. After the 11th century, the [[Seljuks of Rum]] emerged from the [[Great Seljuk Empire]] developing their own architecture, though they were influenced and inspired by the [[Armenian architecture|Armenian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Persian architecture|Persian]] architectural traditions.

==Great Seljuq Empire architecture==
Seljuq architectural elements can be found in a vast area stretching from the [[Hindu Kush]] to eastern Anatolia and from [[Central Asia]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The homeland of this building tradition was [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Iran]], where the first permanent Seljuk edifices were constructed. However, the [[Mongol invasions]] and [[earthquakes]] destroyed most of these buildings and only a few remain. In 1063 [[Isfahan]] was established as capital of the Great Seljuk Empire under [[Alp Arslan]].
[[File:Shrine_of_Warrior_Khalid_Waleed_(Back_side_Image).jpg|thumb|The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in central [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region.&lt;ref name=mughal/&gt;]] 
The most significant alteration carried out in the early twelfth century was the conversion of the mosque plan into a four-iwan plan mosque. Another mosque-type introduced at this time was the kiosk mosque, consisting of a domed space with three open sides and wall containing a mihrab on the qibla side.The architecture of this period was also characterized by memorial tombs which were usually octagonal structures with domed roofs, called [[Gonbad|Kümbet]] or [[Türbe]]. An impressive example of tomb architecture is the [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar|mausoleum]] of [[Sultan Sanjar]] at [[Merv]], a massive building measuring {{convert|27|m|abbr=off}} square with a huge double dome resting on squinches and muqarnas pendentives.

In [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] the surviving monuments are represented by [[madrassas]] and tombs. The madrassas such as the Mustansiriya in [[Baghdad]] or the Muristan in [[Damascus]] were built to a four-iwan plan, while the tombs were characterized by conical muqarnas domes. The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in southern [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region via [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=mughal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mughal|first1=Mohammad|authorlink1=Expansion of Architectural Traditions of Kunya-Urgench to Pakistan and Beyond|title=TURKEMINSTAN-UNESCO: APPRAISAL OF THE HISTORICAL CULTURAL VALUES AND DETERMINATION OF THE WAYS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES: Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|date=2006|publisher=Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|url=http://www.rafiquemughal.com/MUGHAL_2006_Ashgabat-KU-&amp;-Pakistan.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of Seljuk Empire architecture include:
* [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar]]
* [[Kharraqan towers]]

==Anatolian Seljuk architecture==
[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|Çifte Minareli Medrese in Erzurum]]
The greatest number of surviving Seljuk monuments are in [[Anatolia]].
The [[Seljuks of Rum]] built monumental stone buildings of elegantly simple design and harmonious proportion, for the most part severely plain, but with bursts of elaborate decoration around doorways.

In their construction of [[caravanserai]]s, [[medrese]]s and mosques, the Rum Seljuks translated the Iranian Seljuk architecture of bricks and plaster into the use of stone.&lt;ref&gt;''West Asia:1000-1500'', Sheila Blair and Jonathan Bloom, '''Atlas of World Art''', ed. John Onians, (Laurence King Publishing, 2004), 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, the caravanserais (or hans), used as stops, trading posts and defense for caravans, and of which about a hundred structures were built during the Anatolian Seljuqs period, are particularly remarkable. Along with Persian influences, which had an indisputable effect,&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture(Muhammadan)'', H. Saladin, '''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics''', Vol.1, ed. James Hastings and John Alexander, (Charles Scribner's son, 1908), 753.&lt;/ref&gt; Seljuk architecture was also influenced by [[Armenian architecture]], such as by having Muslim architects who originated from historical Armenia, and by having Armenian architects and masons.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Stierlin, "Turkey From the Selcuks to the Ottomans", Taschen's World Architecture, 1998, p73-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Armenia during the Seljuk and Mongol Periods'', Robert Bedrosian, '''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times: The Dynastic Periods from Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century''', Vol. I, ed. Richard Hovannisian, (St. Martin's Press, 1999), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Anatolian architecture represents some of the most distinctive and impressive constructions in the entire history of Islamic architecture. Later this Anatolian architecture would be transmitted to [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate India]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in Translation: Architecture, Taxonomy, and the "Eastern Turks"'', Finbarr Barry Flood, '''Muqarnas: History and Ideology: Architectural Heritage of the "Lands of Rum''', ed. Gulru Necipoglu, (Brill, 2007), 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Anatolian Seljuk works are of dressed stone, with brick reserved for minarets. The use of stone in Anatolia is the biggest difference with the Seljuk buildings in Iran, which are made of bricks. The buildings make frequent use of [[muqarnas]] (stalactite vaulting). In the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] the courts are often covered to protect against the colder and snowier winters of the Anatolian plateau. Thus some [[madrasas]] (theological seminaries) such as the [[Çifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum have an open court, and others, such as the [[Karatay Medrese]] in Konya, have covered courts.

[[File:Ince Minareli Medrese 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ince Minaret Medrese in Konya]].

[[Konya]], the capital of the Seljuks and the other great Seljuk cities--[[Alanya]], [[Erzurum]], [[Kayseri]], [[Sivas]]—have important Seljuk buildings, but Seljuk works are abundant in almost any Anatolian city or town, especially in Central and Eastern Anatolia. Seljuk power extended (briefly) as far as the Aegean coast, so there are Seljuk türbes (tombs) even in—appropriately—the town of [[Selçuk]], next to Ephesus, south of [[İzmir]].
The great [[caravanserais]], or hans, are among the finest and most characteristic of Seljuk buildings. Built during the 13th century to encourage trade throughout the empire, several dozen survive in good condition.

After the [[Mongol invasions]] of the mid-13th century, the wealth and power of the Seljuk empire declined. The few late 13th century-early 14th century buildings that survive include the bimarhane (madhouse) in [[Amasya]], and the "Süngür Bey Mosque" in [[Nigde]]. One of the last Seljuk architectural endeavors was the tomb of 'Ismat al-Dunya wa 'l-Din ibint al-malik al-Adil built by her daughters after 1243.&lt;ref&gt;'' Notes on Saldjūq Architectural Patronage in Thirteenth Century Anatolia'', H. Crane, ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 36, No. 1 (1993), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="818">'''Semantic audio''' is the extraction of symbols or meaning from an audio stream. [[Speech recognition]] is an important semantic audio application. But for speech, other semantic operations include language, speaker or gender identification. For more general audio or music, it includes identifying a piece of music (e.g. [[Shazam (service)]]) or a movie soundtrack.

Areas of research in semantic audio include the ability to label an audio waveform with where the harmonies change and what they are and where material is repeated and what instruments are playing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2732">[[Image:MaisonAColombage041101g.jpg|thumb|Timber frame building showing considerable, but tolerable settlement]]

'''Settlement''' in a structure refers to the distortion or disruption of parts of a building due to
* unequal compression of its foundations;
* shrinkage, such as that which occurs in timber-framed buildings as the frame adjusts its moisture content; or
* undue loads being applied to the building after its initial construction.&lt;ref name="curl"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlement should not be confused with [[subsidence]] which results from the load-bearing ground upon which a building sits reducing in level, for instance in areas of mine workings where shafts collapse underground.

Some settlement is quite normal after construction has been completed, but unequal (differential) settlement may cause significant problems for buildings. Traditional green oak-framed buildings are designed to settle with time as the oak seasons and warps, [[lime mortar]] rather than [[Portland cement]] is used for its elastic properties and glazing will often employ small leaded lights which can accept movement more readily than larger panes.

'''Sichuan Agricultural University''' (SAU) is a university located in [[Ya'an]] city, [[Sichuan]] province, [[China]], and part of the “[[Project 211]]”, specialized in [[biotechnology]] and [[agricultural sciences]], as well as offering degrees in physical science, engineering, economics, management, veterinary medicine, liberal arts, pedagogy and law. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institution was founded in 1906 as Sichuan Tong Sheng Agricultural School. It is the first public agricultural college in Sichuan Province. In 1935, it became a component of '''National Sichuan University'''. In 1956 it moved from [[Chengdu]] to Ya'an, where '''Sichuan Agricultural College''' was founded as an independent institution in 1956. In 1985 it was renamed as Sichuan Agricultural University.

Nowadays, Sichuan Agricultural University (SICAU) has three campuses, respectively located in Chengdu city, Ya'an city, and Dujiangyan city.  SICAU belongs to the '''211 State Key University Group''' in China.  The group member universities was officially selected by Chinese Central Government for priority funding as these universities were evaluated to rank in the top 100 in China for their distinguished achievements in research and education.

==Basic Profile==
[[File:Sichuan Agricultural University 2.jpg|thumb|left|The building is one of the main research building of SAU in Chengdu Campus.]]

===Campuses===
With a total area of 4,500 mu (300 ha.) and an educational population of about 40,000, SAU consists of three branches, i.e. the base campus in Ya’an city, the Dujiangyan campus in Dujiangyan city and the Wenjiang campus in Chengdu.&lt;ref name="Official web"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief Introduction of Sichuan Agricultural University|url=http://english.sicau.edu.cn/?p=1&amp;mdtp=2|website=Official website of SAU (EN)|publisher=Sichuan Agricultural University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ya'an Campus is the main campus of Sichuan Agricultural University, which covers an area equivalent to almost a quarter of the downtown of [[Ya'an]] City. Most colleges, undergraduate and graduate programs are organized here.

Dujiangyan Campus(Sichuan Forestry College for the original) mainly include some generally and specialist undergraduate education.

Chengdu Campus located in Wenjiang District, Chengdu, Sichuan, which covers an area of 600 acres.

'''Stochastic Petri nets''' are a form of [[Petri net]] where the transitions fire after a probabilistic delay determined by a [[random variable]].  

==Definition==
A ''stochastic Petri net'' is a five-tuple ''SPN'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'', ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Λ'') where:
# ''P'' is a set of states, called ''places''.
# ''T'' is a set of ''transitions''.
# ''F'' where ''F'' &lt;big&gt;⊂&lt;/big&gt; (''P'' × ''T'') &lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt; (''T'' × ''P'') is a set of flow relations called "arcs" between places and transitions (and between transitions and places).
# ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''initial marking''.
# ''Λ = '' is the array of ''firing rates λ'' associated with the transitions. The firing rate, a [[random variable]], can also be a function λ(''M'') of the current marking.

==Correspondence to Markov process==
The [[reachability]] graph of stochastic Petri nets can be mapped directly to a [[Markov process]]. It satisfies the [[Markov property]], since its states depend only on the current marking. 
Each state in the reachability graph is mapped to a state in the Markov process, and the firing of a transition with firing rate λ corresponds to a Markov state transition with probability λ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14893">:''This article deals with sum-of-squares constraints. For problems with sum-of-squares cost functions, see [[Least squares]].''

A '''sum-of-squares optimization''' program is an [[optimization]] problem with a linear [[loss function|cost function]] and a particular type of constraint on the decision variables. These constraints are of the form that when the decision variables are used as coefficients in certain [[polynomials]], those polynomials should have the [[polynomial SOS]] property. When fixing the maximum degree of the polynomials involved, sum-of-squares optimization is also known as the '''Lasserre hierarchy''' of relaxations in [[semidefinite programming]].

Sum-of-squares optimization techniques have been successfully applied by researchers in the [[control engineering]] field, in special in the search for polynomial Lyapunov functions for dynamical systems described by polynomial vector fields.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, W., Packard, A., 2004. "[http://jagger.me.berkeley.edu/papers/weehong_3.pdf Searching for control Lyapunov functions using sums of squares programming]". In: ''Allerton Conf. on Comm., Control and
Computing''. pp. 210&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tan, W., Topcu, U., Seiler, P., Balas, G., Packard, A., 2008. Simulation-aided
reachability and local gain analysis for nonlinear dynamical systems. In:
Proc. of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control. pp. 4097–4102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Chakraborty, P. Seiler, and G. Balas, “Susceptibility of F/A-18 Flight Controllers to the Falling-Leaf Mode: Nonlinear Analysis,” AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, Vol.34 No.1, 2011, 73–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optimization problem==

The problem can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \max_{u\in\R^n} c^T u  &lt;/math&gt;
subject to
:&lt;math&gt; a_{k,0}(x) + a_{k,1}(x)u_1 + \cdots + a_{k,n}(x)u_n \in \text{SOS}
\quad (k=1,\ldots, N_s).&lt;/math&gt;

Here "SOS" represents the class of sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomials.
The vector &lt;math&gt;c\in \R^n &lt;/math&gt; and polynomials &lt;math&gt;\{ a_{k,j} \} &lt;/math&gt; are given as part of the  data for the optimization problem. The quantities &lt;math&gt;u\in \R^n &lt;/math&gt; are the decision variables. SOS programs can be converted to [[semidefinite programming|semidefinite programs]] (SDPs) using the
[[Duality (optimization)|duality]] of the [[Polynomial SOS|SOS polynomial]] program and a relaxation for constrained polynomial optimization using [[positive-semidefinite matrix|positive-semidefinite matrices]], see the following section.

== Dual problem: constrained polynomial optimization ==
Suppose we have an &lt;math&gt; n  &lt;/math&gt;-variate polynomial &lt;math&gt; p(x): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}  &lt;/math&gt; , and suppose that we would like to minimize this polynomial over a subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt; A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n  &lt;/math&gt;.
Suppose furthermore that the constraints on the subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt; A  &lt;/math&gt; can be encoded using &lt;math display="inline"&gt; m  &lt;/math&gt; polynomial equalities of degree at most &lt;math&gt; 2d
  &lt;/math&gt;, each of the form &lt;math display="inline"&gt; a_i(x) = 0
  &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; a_i: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}  &lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree at most &lt;math&gt; 2d
  &lt;/math&gt;. 
A natural, though generally non-convex program for this optimization problem is the following:

:&lt;math&gt; \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}} \langle C, x^{\le d} (x^{\le d})^\top \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

subject to:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\langle A_i, x^{\le d}(x^{\le d})^\top \rangle = 0 \qquad \forall \ i \in [m]

&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ({{EquationRef|1}})

:&lt;math&gt; x_{\emptyset} = 1
  &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
 x^{\le d}

  &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt; 
 n^{O(d)}

  &lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector with one entry for every monomial in &lt;math&gt; 
 x

  &lt;/math&gt; of degree at most &lt;math&gt; 
 d

  &lt;/math&gt;, so that for each multiset &lt;math&gt; 
 S \subset [n], |S| \le d,

  &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; x_S = \prod_{i \in S}x_i  &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
 C

  &lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of coefficients of the polynomial  &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
p(x)

  &lt;/math&gt; that we want to minimize, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
 A_i

  &lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of coefficients of the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
a_i(x)

  &lt;/math&gt; encoding the &lt;math&gt; 
i

  &lt;/math&gt;th constraint on the subset &lt;math&gt; 
A \subset \mathbb{R}^n

  &lt;/math&gt;. The additional, fixed constant index in our search space, &lt;math&gt; x_{\emptyset} = 1
  &lt;/math&gt;, is added for the convenience of writing the polynomials &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
p(x)

  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
a_i(x)

  &lt;/math&gt; in a matrix representation.

This program is generally non-convex, because the constraints ({{EquationNote|1}}) are not convex. One possible convex relaxation for this minimization problem uses [[semidefinite programming]] to replace the rank-one matrix of variables &lt;math&gt; 
x^{\le d}(x^{\le d})^\top

  &lt;/math&gt; with a positive-semidefinite matrix &lt;math&gt; X
  &lt;/math&gt;: we index each monomial of size at most &lt;math&gt; 2d
  &lt;/math&gt; by a multiset &lt;math&gt;  S  &lt;/math&gt; of at most &lt;math&gt; 2d
  &lt;/math&gt; indices,  &lt;math&gt;  S \subset [n], |S| \le 2d  &lt;/math&gt;. For each such monomial, we create a variable &lt;math&gt; X_S
  &lt;/math&gt; in the program, and we arrange the variables &lt;math&gt; X_S
  &lt;/math&gt; to form the matrix &lt;math display="inline"&gt; X \in \mathbb{R}^{[n]^{\le d} \times [n]^{\le d}}  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; 
 \mathbb{R}^{[n]^{\le d}\times [n]^{\le d}}

  &lt;/math&gt;is the set of real matrices whose rows and columns are identified with multisets of elements from &lt;math&gt; 
 n

  &lt;/math&gt; of size at most &lt;math&gt; 
 d

  &lt;/math&gt;. We then write the following semidefinite program in the variables &lt;math&gt; X_S
  &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \min_{X \in \mathbb{R}^{[n]^{\le d} \times [n]^{\le d} }}\langle C, X \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

subject to:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\langle A_i, X \rangle =0 \qquad \forall \ i \in [m]

  &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
Q

  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; X_{\emptyset} = 1  &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; 
X_{U \cup V} = X_{S \cup T} \qquad  \forall \  U,V,S,T \subseteq [n], |U|,|V|,|S|,|T| \le d,\text{ and} \ U \cup V = S \cup T

  &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; 
X \succeq 0

  &lt;/math&gt;,

where again &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
 C

  &lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of coefficients of the polynomial  &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
p(x)

  &lt;/math&gt; that we want to minimize, and&lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
 A_i

  &lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of coefficients of the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
a_i(x)

  &lt;/math&gt; encoding the &lt;math&gt; 
i

  &lt;/math&gt;th constraint on the subset &lt;math&gt; 
A \subset \mathbb{R}^n

  &lt;/math&gt;. 

The third constraint ensures that the value of a monomial that appears several times within the matrix is equal throughout the matrix, and is added to make &lt;math&gt; X
  &lt;/math&gt; respect the symmetries present in the quadratic form &lt;math&gt; 
x^{\le d}(x^{\le d})^\top

  &lt;/math&gt;. 

=== Duality ===
One can take the dual of the above semidefinite program and obtain the following program:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\max_{y \in \mathbb{R}^{m'}} y_0

  &lt;/math&gt;,

subject to:

:&lt;math&gt; 
C  - y_0 e_{\emptyset}- \sum_{i \in [m]} y_i A_i - \sum_{S\cup T = U\cup V} y_{S,T,U,V} (e_{S,T} - e_{U,V})\succeq 0

  &lt;/math&gt;.

We have a variable &lt;math&gt; 
y_0

  &lt;/math&gt;corresponding to the constraint  &lt;math&gt; 
\langle e_{\emptyset}, X\rangle = 1

  &lt;/math&gt;(where &lt;math&gt; 
e_{\emptyset}

  &lt;/math&gt;is the matrix with all entries zero save for the entry indexed by &lt;math&gt; 
(\emptyset,\emptyset)
  &lt;/math&gt;), a real variable &lt;math&gt; 
y_i

  &lt;/math&gt;for each polynomial constraint &lt;math&gt; 
\langle X,A_i \rangle = 0 \quad s.t. i \in [m],

  &lt;/math&gt;and for each group of multisets &lt;math&gt; 
S,T,U,V \subset [n], |S|,|T|,|U|,|V| \le d, S\cup T = U \cup V

  &lt;/math&gt;, we have a dual variable &lt;math&gt; 
y_{S,T,U,V}

  &lt;/math&gt;for the symmetry constraint &lt;math&gt; 
\langle X, e_{S,T} - e_{U,V} \rangle = 0

  &lt;/math&gt;.  The positive-semidefiniteness constraint ensures that &lt;math&gt; 
p(x) - y_0

  &lt;/math&gt; is a sum-of-squares of polynomials over &lt;math&gt; 
A \subset \mathbb{R}^n

  &lt;/math&gt;: by a characterization of positive-semidefinite matrices, for any positive-semidefinite matrix &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
Q\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}

  &lt;/math&gt;, we can write  &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
Q = \sum_{i \in [m]} f_i f_i^\top

  &lt;/math&gt; for vectors &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
f_i \in \mathbb{R}^m

  &lt;/math&gt;. Thus for any &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
 x \in A \subset \mathbb{R}^n

  &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; 
 \begin{align}
p(x) - y_0
&amp;= p(x) - y_0 - \sum_{i \in [m']} y_i a_i(x) \qquad \text{since } x \in A\\
&amp;=(x^{\le d})^\top \left( C - y_0 e_{\emptyset} - \sum_{i\in [m']} y_i A_i - \sum_{S\cup T = U \cup V} y_{S,T,U,V}(e_{S,T}-e_{U,V}) \right)x^{\le d}\qquad \text{by symmetry}\\
&amp;= (x^{\le d})^\top \left( \sum_{i} f_i f_i^\top \right)x^{\le d} \\ 
&amp;= \sum_{i} \langle x^{\le d}, f_i\rangle^2 \\
&amp;= \sum_{i} f_i(x)^2,
\end{align}

  &lt;/math&gt;

where we have identified the vectors  &lt;math display="inline"&gt; 
f_i

  &lt;/math&gt; with the coefficients of a polynomial of degree at most &lt;math&gt; d
  &lt;/math&gt;. This gives a sum-of-squares proof that the value &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p(x) \ge y_0  &lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt; 
A \subset \mathbb{R}^n

  &lt;/math&gt;.

The above can also be extended to regions &lt;math&gt; A \subset \mathbb{R}^n
  &lt;/math&gt;defined by polynomial inequalities.

== Sum-of-squares hierarchy ==
The sum-of-squares hierarchy (SOS hierarchy), also known as the Lasserre hierarchy, is a hierarchy of convex relaxations of increasing power and increasing computational cost. For each natural number &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding convex relaxation is known as the ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;th level'' or ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;th round of the SOS hierarchy.'' The &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;st round, when &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d=1&lt;/math&gt;, corresponds to a basic [[Semidefinite programming|semidefinite program]], or to sum-of-squares optimization over polynomials of degree at most &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. To augment the basic convex program at the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;st level of the hierarchy to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;th level, additional variables and constraints are added to the program to have the program consider polynomials of degree at most &lt;math&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt;. 

The SOS hierarchy derives its name from the fact that the value of the objective function at the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;th level is bounded with a sum-of-squares proof using polynomials of degree at most &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt; via the dual (see "Duality" above). Consequently, any sum-of-squares proof that uses polynomials of degree at most &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt; can be used to bound the objective value, allowing one to prove guarantees on the tightness of the relaxation. 

In conjunction with a theorem of Berg, this further implies that given sufficiently many rounds, the relaxation becomes arbitrarily tight on any fixed interval. Berg's result&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The multidimensional moment problem and semigroups|last = Berg|first = Christian|date = 1987|journal = Proceedings of Symposia in Applied Mathematics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |editor-last = Landau|editor-first = Henry J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Sum of Squares Approximation of Nonnegative Polynomials|url = http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070693709|journal = SIAM Review|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 0036-1445|pages = 651-669|volume = 49|issue = 4|doi = 10.1137/070693709|first = J.|last = Lasserre|arxiv = math/0412398}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that every non-negative real polynomial within a bounded interval can be approximated within accuracy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; on that interval with a sum-of-squares of real polynomials of sufficiently high degree, and thus if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;OBJ(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the polynomial objective value as a function of the point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, if the inequality &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c +\epsilon - OBJ(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the region of interest, then there must be a sum-of-squares proof of this fact. Choosing &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to be the minimum of the objective function over the feasible region, we have the result.

=== Computational cost ===
When optimizing over a function in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables, the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;th level of the hierarchy can be written as a semidefinite program over &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n^{O(d)}&lt;/math&gt; variables, and can be solved in time &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n^{O(d)}&lt;/math&gt; using the ellipsoid method. 

==Sum-of-squares background==
A polynomial &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is a ''sum of squares'' (''SOS'') if there exist polynomials &lt;math&gt; \{f_i\}_{i=1}^m &lt;/math&gt;
such that  &lt;math&gt; p = \sum_{i=1}^m f_i^2 &lt;/math&gt;.  For example,
:&lt;math&gt;p=x^2 - 4xy + 7y^2&lt;/math&gt;
is a sum of squares since
:&lt;math&gt; p = f_1^2 + f_2^2&lt;/math&gt;
where  
:&lt;math&gt;f_1 = (x-2y)\text{ and  }f_2 = \sqrt{3}y.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that if &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is a sum of squares
then &lt;math&gt;p(x) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x \in \R^n&lt;/math&gt;. Detailed descriptions of [[polynomial SOS]] are available.&lt;ref&gt;Parrilo, P., (2000) ''Structured semidefinite programs and semialgebraic geometry
methods in robustness and optimization''. Ph.D. thesis, California
Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Parrilo, P. (2003) "Semidefinite programming relaxations for semialgebraic
problems". ''[[Mathematical Programming]]'' Ser. B 96 (2), 293–320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lasserre, J. (2001) "Global optimization with polynomials and the problem of
moments". ''SIAM Journal on Optimization'', 11 (3), 796{817.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quadratic forms]] can be expressed as &lt;math&gt; p(x)=x^T Q x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric matrix.  Similarly, polynomials of degree&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2''d'' can be expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt; p(x)=z(x)^T Q z(x) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the vector &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; contains all monomials of degree &lt;math&gt; \le d &lt;/math&gt;.  This is known as the [[Gram matrix]] form.  An important fact is that
&lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is SOS if and only if there exists a symmetric and [[positive-semidefinite matrix]] &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p(x)=z(x)^T Q z(x) &lt;/math&gt;.
This provides a connection between SOS polynomials and positive-semidefinite matrices.

A '''synchronoptic view''' is a [[graphical|graphic]] display of a number of [[entity|entities]] as they proceed through time. A synchronoptic view can be used for many purposes but is best suited to the visual display of [[history]]. A number of related [[Chronology|timeline]]s can be drawn on a single chart showing which events and lives are contemporary and which are unconnected.

A synchronoptic view has important [[education]]al advantages. [[Visual perception|Visible]] information is much more easily learned, than when it is presented only in pure text form. [[History]] is an ideal subject for a synchronoptic view. Multiple [[timeline]]s are able to show how events interacted. Multiple lifelines can show which people were contemporaries.
([http://www.hyperhistory.com/chart/section.html See example])

A combination of maps is also synchronoptic when it displays successive moments in time.

==Etymology==
The [[concept]] in question is made [[Visual perception|visual]] &amp;mdash; hence ''optic''.
The elements are displayed [[Synchronization|synchronously]]: i.e. which events in one area happened at the same time as events in another seemingly unrelated area.
Thus ''synchron-optic''.

Synchronoptic also means visible at the same time", or "with parallel views". i.e. The user gets a view of all the information in one go.

==Carte chronographique==
[[File:Barbeu-Dubourg - Chronographie (Tableau 34).png|thumb|right|''Carte chronographique'' (1753)]]
[[Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg]] (1709–1779) was the first to develop a synchronoptical visualisation with his ''Chronographie universelle &amp; details qui en dependent pour la Chronologie &amp; les Genealogies'' (1753) abbreviated to ''Carte chronographique''.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt-Burkhardt|first1=Astrit|title=Learning in the Age of Enlightenment|url=http://georgemaciunas.com/exhibitions/knowledge-as-art-chance-computability-and-improving-education-thomas-bayes-alan-turing-george-maciunas/george-maciunas/maciunas-learning-machine-learning-in-the-age-of-enlightenment-by-astrit-schmidt-burkhardt/|website=http://georgemaciunas.com/|publisher=George Maciunas Foundation Inc.|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronographic chart consisted of 35 prints which were designed to be stuck together in a row, enabling 6,500 years to be represented in 6.5 meters.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt; The horizontal axis representing the passage of time was consistent throughout, but the vertical axis was varied depending on the categories Barbeu-Dubourg considered relevant for that period of history.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4004">'''Test compression''' is a technique used to reduce the time and cost of testing [[integrated circuit]]s.  The first ICs were tested with test vectors created by hand.  It proved very difficult to get good coverage of potential faults, so [[Design for test]]ability (DFT) based on scan and [[automatic test pattern generation]] (ATPG) were developed to explicitly test each gate and path in a design.  These techniques were very successful at creating high-quality vectors for manufacturing test, with excellent test coverage.  However, as chips got bigger the ratio of logic to be tested per pin increased dramatically, and the volume of scan test data started causing a significant increase in test time, and required tester memory.  This raised the cost of testing.

Test compression was developed to help address this problem.  When an ATPG tool generates a test for a fault, or a set of faults, only a small percentage of scan cells need to take specific values. The rest of the scan chain is ''don't care'', and are usually filled with random values.  Loading and unloading these vectors is not a very efficient use of tester time.  Test compression takes advantage of the small number of significant values to reduce test data and test time.  In general, the idea is to modify the design to increase the number of internal scan chains, each of shorter length.   These chains are then driven by an on-chip decompressor, usually designed to allow continuous flow decompression where the internal scan chains are loaded as the data is delivered to the decompressor.   Many different decompression methods can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Survey of Test Vector Compression Techniques |author=Touba, NA |journal=IEEE Design &amp; Test of Computers |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=294–303 |year=2006 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1683715 |doi=10.1109/MDT.2006.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One common choice is a linear finite state machine, where the compressed stimuli are computed by solving linear equations corresponding to internal scan cells with specified positions in partially specified test patterns.  Experimental results show that for industrial circuits with test vectors and responses with very low fill rates, ranging from 3% to 0.2%, the test compression based on this method often results in compression ratios of 30 to 500 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Embedded deterministic test |author=Rajski, J. and Tyszer, J. and Kassab, M. and Mukherjee, N. |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=776–792 |year=2004 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1291587 |doi=10.1109/TCAD.2004.826558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a large number of test chains, not all the outputs can be sent to the output pins.  Therefore, a test response compactor is also required, which must be inserted between the internal scan chain outputs and the tester scan channel outputs. The compactor must be synchronized with the data decompressor, and must be capable of handling unknown (X) states.  (Even if the input is fully specified by the decompressor, these can result from false and multi-cycle paths, for example.)  Another design criteria for the test result compressor is that it should give good diagnostic capabilities, not just a yes/no answer.

[[File:Digitales_Geländemodell.png|thumb|TIN overlaid with [[contour line]]s]]

A '''triangulated irregular network''' ('''TIN''') is a representation of a continuous surface consisting entirely of triangular facets, used mainly as [[Discrete Global Grid]] in [[digital elevation model#Types_of_DEM|primary elevation modeling]].  

The vertices of these triangles are created from field recorded spot elevations through a variety of means including surveying through conventional, Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinematic (GPS RTK), photogrammetry, or some other means.  Associated with three-dimensional data (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') and topography, TINs are useful for the description and analysis of general horizontal (''x'' and ''y'') distributions and relationships.

Digital TIN [[data structures]] are used in a variety of applications, including [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), and computer aided drafting (CAD) for the visual representation of a topographical surface. A TIN is an [[Array data type|vector]]-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed [[vertex (geometry)|nodes]] and lines with [[dimension|three-dimensional]] [[coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') that are arranged in a network of non-overlapping triangles.

A TIN comprises a triangular network of vertices, known as mass points, with associated [[coordinates]] in three [[dimensions]] connected by edges to form a triangular [[tessellation]]. Three-dimensional visualizations are readily created by rendering of the triangular facets. In regions where there is little variation in surface height, the points may be widely spaced whereas in areas of more intense variation in height the point density is increased.

A TIN used to represent [[terrain]] is often called a [[digital elevation model]] (DEM), which can be further used to produce digital surface models (DSM) or digital terrain models (DTM).  An advantage of using a TIN over a  [[rasterized]] [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) in mapping and analysis is that the points of a TIN are distributed variably based on an [[algorithm]] that determines which points are most necessary to create an accurate representation of the terrain. Data input is therefore flexible and fewer points need to be stored than in a raster DEM, with regularly distributed points. While a TIN may be considered less suited than a raster DEM for certain kinds of GIS applications, such as analysis of a surface's [[slope]] and [[aspect (geography)|aspect]], it is often used in CAD to create contour lines. A DTM and DSM can be formed from a DEM. A DEM can be interpolated from a TIN.

TIN are based on a [[Delaunay triangulation]] or constrained Delaunay.  Delaunay conforming triangulations are recommended over constrained triangulations. This is because the resulting TINs are likely to contain fewer long, skinny triangles, which are undesirable for surface analysis. Additionally, natural neighbor interpolation and Thiessen (Voronoi) polygon generation can only be performed on Delaunay conforming triangulations.  A constrained Delaunay triangulation can be considered when you need to explicitly define certain edges that are guaranteed not to be modified (that is, split into multiple edges) by the triangulator.  Constrained Delaunay triangulations are also useful for minimizing the size of a TIN, since they have fewer nodes and triangles where breaklines are not densified.

The TIN model was developed in the early 1970s as a simple way to build a surface from a set of irregularly spaced points.  The first triangulated irregular network program for GIS was written by W. Randolph Franklin, under the direction of David Douglas and Thomas Peucker (Poiker), at [[Simon Fraser University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research – Triangulated Irregular Network |accessdate=2007-07-26 |url=http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/pmwiki/Research/TriangulatedIrregularNetwork }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban sociology''' is the [[sociology|sociological]] study of life and human interaction in [[metropolitan area]]s. It is a [[normative]] discipline of sociology seeking to study the structures, environmental processes, changes and problems of an [[urban area]] and by doing so provide inputs for [[urban planning]] and policy making. In other words, it is the sociological study of cities and their role in the development of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/urban+sociology Dictionary reference]&lt;/ref&gt;
Like most areas of sociology, urban sociologists use statistical analysis, observation, social theory, interviews, and other methods to study a range of topics, including migration and demographic trends, economics, poverty, race relations and economic trends&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, H.J., 2017. Urban Sociology in Trump's America and Beyond. City &amp; Community, 16(2), pp.127-130.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The philosophical foundations of modern urban sociology originate from the work of sociologists such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]] who studied and theorized the economic, social and cultural processes of [[urbanization]] and its effects on [[social alienation]], class formation, and the production or destruction of collective and individual identities.

These theoretical foundations were further expanded upon and analyzed by a group of sociologists and researchers who worked at the University of Chicago in the early twentieth century. In what became known as the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of sociology]] the work of [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]], [[Louis Wirth]] and [[Ernest Burgess]] on the inner city of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] revolutionized the purpose of urban research in sociology but also the development of [[human geography]] through its use of quantitative and ethnographic research methods. The importance of the theories developed by the Chicago School within urban sociology have been critically sustained and critiqued but still remain one of the most significant historical advancements in understanding [[urbanization]] and the city within the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;Martin, D.G., "Chicago School" in D. Gregory, R. Johnston, G. Pratt, M. Watts and S. Whatmore, eds., ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', London: Blackwell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and rise of urban sociology==
{{further|Chicago school (sociology)}}

Urban sociology rose to prominence within the academy in North America through a group of sociologists and theorists at the University of Chicago from 1915 to 1940 in what became known as the Chicago School of Sociology. The Chicago School of Sociology combined sociological and anthropological theory with ethnographic fieldwork in order to understand how individuals interact within urban social systems.&lt;ref name=Flanagan&gt;Flanagan, W., ''Contemporary Urban Sociology'' Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wirth&gt;Wirth, L., ''Urbanism as a Way of Life'' The American Journal of Sociology: Volume 44, Number 1, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the primarily macro-based sociology that had marked earlier subfields, members of the Chicago School placed greater emphasis on micro-scale social interactions that sought to provide subjective meaning to how humans interact under structural, cultural and social conditions. The theory of symbolic interaction, the basis through which many methodologically-groundbreaking ethnographies were framed in this period, took primitive shape alongside urban sociology and shaped its early methodological leanings. Symbolic interaction was forged out of the writings of early micro-sociologists [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]] and [[Max Weber]], and sought to frame how individuals interpret symbols in everyday interactions. With early urban sociologists framing the city as a 'superorganism', the concept of [[symbolic interaction]] aided in parsing out how individual communities contribute to the seamless functioning of the city itself.&lt;ref name=Trepl&gt;Trepl, L., ''City and Ecology'' Capitalism Nature Socialism: Volume 7, Number 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of the Chicago School originally sought to answer a single question: how did an increase in urbanism during the time of the Industrial Revolution contribute to the magnification of contemporary social problems? Sociologists centered on [[Chicago]] due to its '[[tabula rasa]]' state, having expanded from a small town of 10,000 in 1860 to an urban metropolis of over two million in the next half-century. Along with this expansion came many of the era's emerging social problems - ranging from issues with concentrated homelessness and harsh living conditions to the low wages and long hours that characterized the work of the many newly arrived European immigrants. Furthermore, unlike many other metropolitan areas, Chicago did not expand outward at the edges as predicted by early expansionist theorists, but instead 'reformatted' the space available in a concentric ring pattern.&lt;ref name= Burgess&gt;Burgess, E., "The growth of the city: an introduction to a research project," in Park, R.E. (ed) ''The City'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 47-62, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many modern cities the business district occupied the city center and was surrounded by slum and blighted neighborhoods, which were further surrounded by workingmens' homes and the early forms of the modern suburbs. Urban theorists suggested that these spatially distinct regions helped to solidify and isolate class relations within the modern city, moving the middle class away from the urban core and into the privatized environment of the outer suburbs.&lt;ref name=Sassen&gt;Sassen, S., ''New frontiers facing urban sociology at the millennium'' The British Journal of Sociology: Volume 51, Number 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the high concentration of first-generation immigrant families in the inner city of Chicago during the early 20th century, many prominent early studies in urban sociology focused upon the transmission of immigrants' native culture [[roles]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] into new and developing environments. Political participation and the rise in inter-community organizations were also frequently covered in this period, with many metropolitan areas adopting census techniques that allowed for information to be stored and easily accessed by participating institutions such as the University of Chicago. Park, Burgess and McKenzie, professors at the University of Chicago and three of the earliest proponents of urban sociology, developed the [[Subculture Theories]], which helped to explain the often-positive role of local institutions on the formation of community acceptance and social ties.&lt;ref name=Park&gt;Park, R., ''The City: Suggestions for Investigation of Human Behavior in the Urban Environment'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; When race relations break down and expansion renders one's community members anonymous, as was proposed to be occurring in this period, the inner city becomes marked by high levels of social disorganization that prevent local ties from being established and maintained in local political arenas.

The rise of urban sociology coincided with the expansion of [[statistical inference]] in the [[behavioural sciences]], which helped ease its transition and acceptance in educational institutions along with other burgeoning social sciences. [[Microsociology|Micro-sociology]] courses at the University of Chicago were among the earliest and most prominent courses on urban sociological research in the United States.

==Evolution of urban sociology==
{{further|Social network}}

The evolution and transition of sociological theory from the Chicago School began to emerge in the 1970s with the publication of [[Claude Fischer]]'s (1975) "Toward a Theory of Subculture Urbanism" which incorporated [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu's]] theories on [[social capital]] and [[symbolic capital]] within the invasion and succession framework of the Chicago School in explaining how cultural groups form, expand and solidify a neighbourhood. The theme of transition by subcultures and groups within the city was further expanded by [[Barry Wellman]]'s (1979) "The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers" which determined the function and position of the individual, institution and community in the urban landscape in relation to their community. Wellman's categorization and incorporation of community focused theories as "Community Lost", "Community Saved", and "Community Liberated" which center around the structure of the urban community in shaping interactions between individuals and facilitating active participation in the local community are explained in detail below:

'''Community lost:''' The earliest of the three theories, this concept was developed in the late 19th century to account for the rapid development of industrial patterns that seemingly caused rifts between the individual and their local community. Urbanites were claimed to hold networks that were “impersonal, transitory and segmental”, maintaining ties in multiple social networks while at the same time lacking the strong ties that bound them to any specific group. This disorganization in turn caused members of urban communities to subsist almost solely on secondary affiliations with others, and rarely allowed them to rely on other members of the community for assistance with their needs.

'''Community saved:''' A critical response to the community lost theory that developed during the 1960s, the community saved argument suggests that multistranded ties often emerge in sparsely-knit communities as time goes on, and that urban communities often possess these strong ties, albeit in different forms. Especially among low-income communities, individuals have a tendency to adapt to their environment and pool resources in order to protect themselves collectively against structural changes. Over time urban communities have tendencies to become “urban villages”, where individuals possess strong ties with only a few individuals that connect them to an intricate web of other urbanities within the same local environment.

'''Community liberated:''' A cross-section of the community lost and community saved arguments, the community liberated theory suggests that the separation of workplace, residence and familial kinship groups has caused urbanites to maintain weak ties in multiple community groups that are further weakened by high rates of residential mobility. However, the concentrated number of environments present in the city for interaction increase the likelihood of individuals developing secondary ties, even if they simultaneously maintain distance from tightly-knit communities. Primary ties that offer the individual assistance in everyday life form out of sparsely-knit and spatially dispersed interactions, with the individual's access to resources dependent on the quality of the ties they maintain within their community.&lt;ref name=Wellman&gt;Wellman, B., ''The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers'' American Journal of Sociology: Volume 84, Number 4, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the development of these theories, urban sociologists have increasingly begun to study the differences between the urban, rural and suburban environment within the last half-century. Consistent with the community liberated argument, researchers have in large part found that urban residents tend to maintain more spatially-dispersed networks of ties than rural or suburban residents. Among lower-income urban residents, the lack of mobility and communal space within the city often disrupts the formation of social ties and lends itself to creating an unintegrated and distant community space. While the high density of networks within the city weakens relations between individuals, it increases the likelihood that at least one individual within a network can provide the primary support found among smaller and more tightly-knit networks.
Since the 1970s, research into social networks has focused primarily on the types of ties developed within residential environments. Bonding ties, common of tightly-knit neighborhoods, consist of connections that provide an individual with primary support, such as access to income or upward mobility among a neighborhood organization. Bridging ties, in contrast, are the ties that weakly connect strong networks of individuals together. A group of communities concerned about the placement of a nearby highway may only be connected through a few individuals that represent their views at a community board meeting, for instance.&lt;ref name=Granovetter&gt;Granovetter, M., "The Strength of Weak Ties", ''American Journal of Sociology'',78(6), 1360-1380, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as theory surrounding social networks has developed, sociologists such as [[Alejandro Portes]] and the [[Wisconsin model| Wisconsin model of sociological research]] began placing increased leverage on the importance of these weak ties.&lt;ref name="Portes and Sensenbrenner" &gt;Portes, A., and Sensenbrenner, J.,"Embeddedness and immigration: notes on the social determinants of economic action," ''American Journal of Sociology'', 98, pp. 1320-1350, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; While strong ties are necessary for providing residents with primary services and a sense of community, weak ties bring together elements of different cultural and economic landscapes in solving problems affecting a great number of individuals. As theorist Eric Oliver notes, neighborhoods with vast social networks are also those that most commonly rely on heterogeneous support in problem solving, and are also the most politically active.&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;Oliver, E., ''Democracy in Suburbia'' Connecticut: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the suburban landscape developed during the 20th century and the outer city became a refuge for the wealthy and, later, the burgeoning middle class, sociologists and [[urban geography|urban geographers]] such as [[Harvey Molotov]], [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] began to study the structure and revitalization of the most impoverished areas of the inner city. In their research, impoverished neighborhoods, which often rely on tightly-knit local ties for economic and social support, were found to be targeted by developers for [[gentrification]] which displaced residents living within these communities.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, N., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EMM2xowSlEgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The New Urban Frontier: Gentrification and the Revanchist City]'', London: Routledge, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Political experimentation in providing these residents with semi-permanent housing and structural support - ranging from Section 8 housing to [[Community Development Block Grant]] programs- have in many cases eased the transition of low-income residents into stable housing and employment. Yet research covering the social impact of forced movement among these residents has noted the difficulties individuals often have with maintaining a level of economic comfort, which is spurred by rising land values and inter-urban competition between cities in as a means to attract capital investment.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, D., ""From Managerialism to Entrepreneurialism: The Transformation in Urban Governance in Late Capitalism". ''Geografiska Annaler. Series B, Human Geography'', 71, pp. 3-17, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;	&lt;ref name=Molotch&gt;Molotch, H., "The City as a Growth Machine: Toward a Political Economy of Place". ''American Journal of Sociology'', 82(2), pp. 309–332, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between inner-city dwellers and middle class passersby in such settings has also been a topic of study for urban sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duneier |first=Mitchell |title=Sidewalk|year=2001|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0374527259|edition=1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dromi|first=Shai M.|title=Penny for your Thoughts: Beggars and the Exercise of Morality in Daily Life|journal=Sociological Forum|date=December 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=847–871|doi=10.1111/j.1573-7861.2012.01359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many theories in urban sociology have been criticized, most prominently directed toward the ethnocentric approaches taken by many early theorists that lay groundwork for [[urban studies]] throughout the 20th century. Early theories that sought to frame the city as an adaptable “superorganism” often disregarded the intricate roles of social ties within local communities, suggesting that the urban environment itself rather than the individuals living within it controlled the spread and shape of the city. For impoverished inner-city residents, the role of highway planning policies and other government-spurred initiatives instituted by the planner [[Robert Moses]] and others have been criticized as unsightly and unresponsive to residential needs. The slow development of empirically-based urban research reflects the failure of local urban governments to adapt and ease the transition of local residents to the short-lived industrialization of the city.&lt;ref name=Caro&gt;[[Robert Caro|Caro, R.]], ''[[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'' Vintage: New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern social theorists have also been critical toward the apparent shortsightedness that urban sociologists have shown toward the role of culture in the inner city. [[William Julius Wilson]] has criticized theory developed throughout the middle of the twentieth century as relying primarily on structural roles of institutions, and not how culture itself affects common aspects of inner-city life such as poverty. The distance shown toward this topic, he argues, presents an incomplete picture of inner-city life.The urban sociological theory is viewed as one important aspect of sociology.

'''''Verstehen''''' ({{IPA-de|fɛɐˈʃteːən}}, literally: "to understand"), in the context of German philosophy and [[social science]]s in general, has been used since the late 19th century – in English as in German – with the particular sense of the "interpretive or participatory" examination of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |title=Verstehen: The Sociology of Max Weber |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307133502/http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |archive-date=2011-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely associated with the work of the German [[sociologist]], [[Max Weber]], whose [[antipositivism]] established an alternative to prior [[sociological positivism]] and [[economic determinism]], rooted in the analysis of [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm "Anti-positivism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403001519/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm |date=April 3, 2012 }} at Historylearningsite.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In [[anthropology]], ''Verstehen'' has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture attempts to relate to it and understand others. 

''Verstehen'' is now seen as a concept and a method central to a rejection of positivistic social science (although Weber appeared to think that the two could be united). ''Verstehen'' refers to understanding the [[Meaning-making|meaning]] of action from the actor's point of view. It is entering into the shoes of the other, and adopting this research stance requires treating the actor as a subject, rather than an object of your observations. It also implies that unlike objects in the natural world human actors are not simply the product of the pulls and pushes of external forces. Individuals are seen to create the world by organizing their own understanding of it and giving it meaning. To do research on actors without taking into account the meanings they attribute to their actions or environment is to treat them like objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?term=VERSTEHEN "Verstehen"]: entry in the ''Online Dictionary of the Social Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning&lt;!--'Interpretative sociology', 'Interpretative sociology' and 'Verstehende Soziologie' redirect here--&gt;==
'''Interpretative sociology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''verstehende Soziologie'') is the study of society that concentrates on the meanings people associate to their social world.&lt;ref name="Sociology"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretative sociology strives to show that reality is constructed by people themselves in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

''Verstehen'' roughly translates to "meaningful understanding" or "putting yourself in the shoes of others to see things from their perspective". Interpretive sociology differs from positivist sociology in three ways:
#Interpretive sociology deals with the meaning attached to behavior, unlike positivist sociology which focuses on action. 
#Interpretive sociology sees reality as being constructed by people, unlike positivist sociology which sees an objective reality "out there". 
#Interpretive sociology relies on qualitative data, unlike positivist sociology which tends to make use of quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

==Dilthey and hermeneutics==
''Verstehen'' was introduced into philosophy and the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaften]]'') by the German [[Historism|historist]] philosopher [[Johann Gustav Droysen]]. He first made a distinction between nature and history in terms of the categories of space and time. The method of the [[natural sciences]] (''Naturwissenschaften'') is explanation (''[[wikt:erklären|erklären]]&lt;!--German verb--&gt;''), while that of history is understanding (''verstehen&lt;!--German verb--&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Historik: Vorlesungen über Enzyklopädie und Methodologie der Geschichte''. Stuttgart: Fromann-Holzboog, [1858] 1977: 22, 150f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Grundriss der Historik'', Berlin 1862, p. 4 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droysen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7_lrAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl= ''Grundriss der Historik''], Verlag von Veit &amp; Comp., 1868, p. 11: §14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu4rCkENQvcC&amp;dq= ''Methodological Individualism: Background, History and Meaning''], Routledge, 2001, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Verstehen'' was later used by the German philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie'', Berlin 1894, p. 1314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Introduction to the Human Sciences''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the first-person participatory perspective that agents have on their individual experience as well as their culture, history, and society. In this sense, it is developed in the context of the theory and practice of ''interpretation'' (as understood in the context of [[hermeneutics]]) and contrasted with the external objectivating third-person perspective of ''explanation'' (''das Erklären'') in which human agency, subjectivity, and its products are analyzed as effects of impersonal natural forces in the natural sciences and social structures in sociology.

Twentieth-century philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[Truth and method]]'', Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; have been critical of what they considered to be the romantic and subjective character of ''Verstehen'' in Dilthey, although both Dilthey and the early Heidegger were interested in the "[[facticity]]" and "life-context" of understanding, and sought to universalize it as the way humans exist through language on the basis of [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcOjTiSNFZoC&amp;dq= ''Ontology: The Hermeneutics of Facticity''], Indiana University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Bambach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaWALY0raiEC&amp;dq= ''Heidegger, Dilthey, and the crisis of historicism''], Cornell University Press, 1995, p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' also played a role in [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schutz]]'s analysis of the "[[lifeworld]]." [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] further transformed the concept of ''Verstehen'', reformulating it on the basis of a transcendental-pragmatic philosophy of language and the theory of communicative action.

==Weber and the social sciences==
[[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simmel, ''Die probleme der Gechichtsphilosophie. Eine erkentnistheoretische Studie''. Munich: Verlag von Dunker und Humboldt, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced interpretive understanding (''Verstehen'') into [[sociology]], where it has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture (such as an [[anthropologist]] or [[sociologist]]) relates to an indigenous people or sub-cultural group on their own terms and from their own point of view, rather than interpreting them in terms of his or her own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' can mean either a kind of [[Empathy|empathic]] or participatory understanding of social phenomena. In anthropological terms this is sometimes described as [[cultural relativism]], especially by those that have a tendency to argue toward universal ideals. In sociology it is an aspect of the comparative-historical approach, where the context of a society like twelfth century "France" can be potentially better understood (''Besserverstehen'') by the sociologist than it could have been by people living in a village in Burgundy. It relates to how people in life give meaning to the social world around them and how the [[social scientist]] accesses and evaluates this "first-person perspective". This concept has been both expanded and criticized by later social scientists. Proponents laud this concept as the only means by which researchers from one culture can examine and explain behaviors in another. While the exercise of ''Verstehen'' has been more popular among social scientists in [[Europe]], such as Habermas, ''Verstehen'' was introduced into the practice of [[sociology]] in the [[United States]] by [[Talcott Parsons]], an American follower of [[Max Weber]]. Parsons used his [[structural functionalism]] to incorporate this concept into his 1937 work, ''The Structure of Social Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=John J. Macionis, Linda M.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|edition=7th Canadian|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber had more specific beliefs than Marx where he put value to understanding and meaning of key elements—not just with intuition or sympathy with the individual but also the product of "systematic and rigorous research". The goal is to identify human actions and interpreting them as observable events leading us to believe that it not only provides for a good explanation for individual actions but also for group interactions. The meaning attached needs to include constraints and limitations and analyze the motivation for action. Weber believed that this gives the sociologist an advantage over a natural scientist because "We can accomplish something which is never attainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective understanding of the action of the component individuals" (Weber, Economy and Society, p.&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gingrich|first=Paul|title=Max Weber|url=http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s30f99.htm|work=Sociology 250|publisher=University of Regina, Department of Sociology and Social Studies|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the social scientific concept of ''Verstehen'' such as [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Dean MacCannell]] counter that it is simply impossible for a person born of one culture to ever completely understand another culture, and that it is arrogant and conceited to attempt to interpret the significance of one culture's [[symbol]]s through the terms of another (supposedly superior) culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Such criticisms do not necessarily allow for the possibility that ''Verstehen'' does not involve "complete" understanding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Just as in physical science all knowledge is asymptotic to the full explanation, a high degree of cross-cultural understanding is very valuable. The opposite of ''Verstehen'' would seem to be ignorance of all but that which is immediately observable, meaning that we would not be able to understand any time and place but our own. A certain level of interpretive understanding is necessary for our own cultural setting, however, and it can easily be argued that even the full participant in a culture does not fully understand it in every regard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Critics also believe that it is the sociologist's job to not just observe people and what people do but also share in their world of meaning and come to appreciate why they act as they do. Subjective thoughts and feelings regarded as bias in the sciences is an important aspect to be controlled for while doing sociological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though '''women artists''' have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, is often both overlooked and undervalued. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as [[Textile arts|textile]] or [[fiber art]]s, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories both men and women participated in. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like "[[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]]", rather than [[fine art]].&lt;ref name="moca"&gt;Aktins, Robert. [http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=14 "Feminist art."] ''Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.'' 1997 (retrieved 23 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world.&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, [[feminist]] artists and art historians created a [[Feminist art movement]] that overtly addresses the role of women in the art world and explores the role of women in [[art history]]&lt;ref name="moca" /&gt; and in society.

==Prehistoric era==
There are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in [[Neolithic]] cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewelry. Collaboration on large projects was typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the [[Paleolithic]] era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. [[Cave painting]]s of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131008-women-handprints-oldest-neolithic-cave-art/ "Were the First Artists Mostly Women?"]  "National Geographic", October 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
"For about three thousand years, the women – and only the women – of [[History of Mithila|Mithila]] have been making devotional paintings of the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. It is no exaggeration, then, to say that this art is the expression of the most genuine aspect of Indian civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Vequaud, Ives, ''Women Painters of Mithila'', Thames and Hudson, Ltd., London, 1977 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Europe and the Middle East===
The earliest records of western cultures rarely mention specific individuals, although women are depicted in all of the art and some are shown laboring as artists. Ancient references by [[Homer]], [[Cicero]], and [[Virgil]] mention the prominent roles of women in textiles, poetry, music, and other cultural activities, without discussion of individual artists. Among the earliest European historical records concerning individual artists is that of [[Pliny the Elder]], who wrote about a number of Greek women who were painters, including [[Helena of Egypt]], daughter of Timon of Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/elliott/art/67.html Women in Art] retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html The Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026153755/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1479.html |date=2010-10-26 }} Retrieved January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' might not have been the work of [[Philoxenus of Cythera|Philoxenus]], but of Helena of Egypt.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Artists from the [[Medieval]] period include [[Claricia]], [[Diemudus]], [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], [[Guda]], [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.

There were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or English embroidery was already famous across Europe – a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. One of the most famous embroideries of the Medieval period is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which was embroidered with [[wool]] and is 230 feet long. Its images narrate the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the [[Tower of London]], and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including [[Ende (artist)|Ende]], a 10th-century Spanish nun; [[Guda]], a 12th-century German nun; and [[Claricia]], a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.

In many parts of Europe, with the [[Gregorian Reforms]] of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan [[Scandinavia]] (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female [[runemaster]], [[Gunnborga]], worked in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Upplands runinskrifter 1, s. 307 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, however, under the [[Ottonian Dynasty]], convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of [[Herrade of Landsberg]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]]. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote ''The Divine Works of a Simple Man'', ''The Meritorious Life'', sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, ''[[Scivias]]'' ''(Know the Ways of the Lord)'', which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the ''[[Scivias]]'', as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegarde experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.

The 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The [[Wife of Bath]] in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan [[guild]]s. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating ''Opus Anglicanum'', or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of [[Maître Honoré]] and the daughter of [[Jean le Noir (illuminator)|Jean le Noir]]. By the 13th century most [[illuminated manuscript]]s were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to [[printing]], and of book illustration to the [[printmaking]] techniques of [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]], where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.

This is the first period in Western history in which a number of secular female artists gained international reputations. The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward [[humanism]], a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, ''On Famous Women'' and ''The City of Women'', illustrate this cultural change. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a 14th-century humanist, wrote ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (Latin for ''[[On Famous Women]]'') (1335–59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of [[Thamar]] (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of ''On Famous Women'', Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. [[Christine de Pizan]], a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

The most notable of these was ''[[Il Cortegiano]]'' or ''[[The Courtier]]'' by 16th-century Italian humanist [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as [[Lavinia Fontana]] and [[Caterina van Hemessen]] began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the [[Academic art|Academy]], and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.

Although many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include [[Caterina dei Virgi]], [[Antonia Uccello]], and [[Suor Barbara Ragnoni]]. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter [[Lavinia Fontana]], the miniature portraitist [[Levina Teerlinc]], and the portrait painter [[Caterina van Hemessen]]. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[Bruges]] show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).

Artists from the [[Baroque]] era include: [[Mary Beale]], [[Élisabeth Sophie Chéron]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Katharina Pepijn]], [[Catharina Peeters]], [[Johanna Vergouwen]], [[Isabel de Cisneros]], [[Giovanna Garzoni]]&lt;ref name="3 women artists in Italy"&gt;[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/art/women-artist-3.asp 3 women artists in Italy] Retrieved June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Louise Moillon]], [[Josefa de Óbidos|Josefa de Ayala]] better known as Josefa de Óbidos, [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Van de Passe family|Magdalena de Passe]], [[Clara Peeters]], Maria Virginia Borghese (daughter of art collector [[Olimpia Aldobrandini]]),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Sheila, [http://www.medici.org/highlights/canvas-commoners Canvas is for Commoners], Highlights from the Mediceo del Principato, medici.org, 2008-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luisa Roldán]] known as La Roldana, [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Francisca-Catherina van Thielen]] and [[Elisabetta Sirani]]. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] is an excellent example of this. She was trained by her father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. [[Luisa Roldán]] was trained in her father's ([[Pedro Roldán]]) sculpture workshop.

Women artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as [[Elisabetta Sirani]] created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses.  One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and the more traditional woman, [[Fede Galizia]], depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. [[Still life]] emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included [[Clara Peeters]], a painter of ''banketje'' or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], the internationally renowned flower painter; and [[Rachel Ruysch]], a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including [[Giovanna Garzoni]], who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and [[Louise Moillon]], whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.

In many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style.  The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was [[history painting]], especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. [[Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun]] used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, ''Peace Bringing Back Plenty'', which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint.  She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Nancy G., ''Women Artists: An Illustrated History'', Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-89659-748-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, two women, [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Mary Moser]], were founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London in 1768.  Kauffmann helped [[Maria Cosway]] enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of ''The Academicians of the Royal Academy'' by Johan Zoffany now in The [[Royal Collection]]. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=400747| title = The Royal Academicians| last = Zoffany| first = Johan| authorlink = Johann Zoffany| year = 1771–1772| work = | publisher = [[Royal Collection|The Royal Collection]]|accessdate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis in [[Academic art]] on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.  After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until [[Laura Knight]] in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]].

==19th century==

=== Painters === 

Women artists of the early part of the 19th century include [[Marie-Denise Villers]], who specialized in portraiture; [[Constance Mayer]], who painted portraits and allegories; [[Marie Ellenrieder]], who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the [[Nazarenes (artists)|Nazarene]] style.

In the second half of the century, [[Emma Sandys]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman]], [[Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale]], and [[Maria Zambaco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p012261.htm Maria Zambaco] Retrieved June 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; were women artists of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were [[Evelyn De Morgan]] and the activist and painter [[Barbara Bodichon]].

Impressionist painters [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Marie Bracquemond]], and the [[United States|Americans]], [[Mary Cassatt]] and [[Lucy Bacon]], became involved in the French [[Impressionist]] movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist [[Lilla Cabot Perry]] was influenced by her studies with [[Monet]] and by [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century. [[Cecilia Beaux]] was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. [[Olga Boznańska]] is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism.  

[[Rosa Bonheur]] was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Elizabeth Weed (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTb9d7vZhA0C&amp;pg=PA50 The Question of Gender: Joan W. Scott's Critical Feminism]''. Indiana University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|0253223245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the [[Royal College of Art|Government School]], was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously ''[[Scotland Forever!]]'', showing a cavalry charge at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].

[[Kitty Lange Kielland]] was a Norwegian landscape painter.

[[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]] was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]]. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. 

In 1894, [[Suzanne Valadon]] was the first woman admitted to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in France. [[Anna Boch]] was a [[post-impressionist]] painter, as was [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], who exhibited at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and then in 1894 as part of the [[Société des artistes français]] in Paris. 

===Photography===

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[Gertrude Kasebier]] became well known in the new medium of [[photography]], where there were no traditional restrictions, and no established training, to hold them back. 

=== Sculpture ===
[[Camille Claudel]], [[Edmonia Lewis]] and [[Enid Yandell]].

In the late 19th century, [[Edmonia Lewis]], an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Ojibwe]]-[[Haitian Americans|Haitian American]] artist from New York began her art studies at [[Oberlin College]]. Her sculpting career began in 1863. She established a studio in [[Rome, Italy]] and exhibited her marble sculptures through Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonialewis.com/chronology.htm "Biography – Chronology of Mary Edmonia Lewis."] ''Edmonia Lewis.''

===Female education in the 19th century===

During the century, access to academies and formal art training expanded more for women in Europe and North America. The British Government School of Design, which later became the [[Royal College of Art]], admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a "Female School" which was treated somewhat differently, with "life"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. 

The Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the [[Slade School of Art]] from the 1870s, were more liberal.  By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called ''The [[Society of Women Artists]]'') was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.&lt;ref name=society&gt;[http://www.society-women-artists.org.uk/History.html "History"], ''The Society of Women Artists''.

[[Hilma af Klint]] (1862–1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Maurice|title=The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting, 1890–1985|publisher=Abbeville Pr|isbn=0896596699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] (1865–1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the "Glasgow Style" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 [[Vienna Secession]], where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as [[Gustav Klimt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/item/margaret-macdonald|title=Margaret Macdonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) was an early American modernist in New York City. She made significant contributions to modern American art through her work at the Art Students League and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Studio Club]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm'' by Clint B.

Among the other women artists prominent in the [[Russian avant-garde]] were [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]]. [[Sonia Delaunay]] and her husband were the founders of [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].

In the [[Art Deco]] era, [[Hildreth Meiere]] made large-scale mosaics and was the first woman honored with the Fine Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Architects Directory|year=1962|publisher=R.R.

[[Dorothea Lange]] documented the Depression. [[Margaret Bourke-White]] created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first ''Life Magazine''. [[Diane Arbus]] based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. [[Graciela Iturbide]]'s works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while [[Tina Modotti]] produced "revolutionary icons" from [[Mexico]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sarah M., ''Tina Modootti: Photographs'', Harry N. Abrams Inc., Publishers, 1995 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Leibovitz]]'s photographic work was of [[rock and roll]] and other celebrity figures. 

Mary Carroll Nelson founded the [[Society of Layerists in MultiMedia|Society of Layerists in Multi-Media]] (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of [[Emil Bisttram]] and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as [[Morris Graves]] of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a very important work of [[feminist art]]. [[Helen Frankenthaler]] was an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] painter and she was influenced by [[Jackson Pollock]]. [[Lee Krasner]] was also an [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] artist and married to Pollock and a student of [[Hans Hofmann]]. [[Elaine de Kooning]] was a student and later the wife of [[Willem de Kooning]], she was an [[New York Figurative Expressionism|abstract figurative painter]]. [[Anne Ryan]] was a collagist. [[Jane Frank]], also a student of [[Hans Hofmann]], worked with [[mixed media]] on canvas. In Canada, [[Marcelle Ferron]] was an exponent of [[Les Automatistes|automatism]].

From the 1960s on, [[feminism]] led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the [[art historian]]s [[Germaine Greer]], [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Griselda Pollock]] and others. Some [[art historian]]s such as [[Daphne Haldin]] have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Drummond Charig | first= Frankie | date= 4 April 2016 | title= Daphne Haldin’s Archive and the 'Dictionary of Women Artists' | url=  http://www.britishartstudies.ac.uk/issues/issue-index/issue-2/still-invisible#018 | journal= British Art Studies | publisher= [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] | issue= 2 | doi=10.17658/issn.2058-5462/issue-02/still-invisible/018 | access-date=  28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like Artemesia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist [[cultural icon|icons]]. The [[Guerilla Girls]], an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were "the conscience of the art world." They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, [[Catherine de Zegher]] curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, ''Inside the Visible'', that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring [[Claude Cahun]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Charlotte Salomon]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Lygia Clark]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] among others.

In 1993, [[Rachel Whiteread]] was the first woman to win the [[Tate]] Gallery's [[Turner Prize]]. [[Gillian Wearing]] won the prize in 1997, when there was an all-woman shortlist, the other nominees being [[Christine Borland]], [[Angela Bulloch]] and [[Cornelia Parker]]. In 1999, [[Tracey Emin]] gained considerable media coverage for her entry ''[[My Bed]]'', but did not win. In 2006 the prize was awarded to abstract painter, [[Tomma Abts]]. In 2001, a conference called "Women Artists at the Millennium" was organized at [[Princeton University]]. A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]] analysing prominent women artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sally Mann]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Rosemarie Trockel]]. Internationally prominent [[contemporary artists]] who are women also include [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Jaroslava Brychtova]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Lee Bul]], [[Sophie Calle]], [[Janet Cardiff]], [[Li Chevalier]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Runa Islam]], [[Chantal Joffe]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Karen Kilimnik]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Shazia Sikander]], [[Lorna Simpson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Stella Vine]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Rebecca Warren]], [[Bettina Werner]] and [[Susan Dorothea White]]. &lt;!--DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST--&gt;

[[Japan]]ese artist [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of [[feminism]], [[minimalism]], [[surrealism]], [[Outsider Art|Art Brut]], [[pop art]], and [[abstract expressionism]], and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an "obsessive artist". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting ''No. 2'' for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/15/artmarkets | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New York art sales: 'I knew it was too good to last' | date=2008-11-15 | first=Anthony | last=Haden-Guest}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–2011, [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named ''elles@Centrepompidou''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212114941/http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=953|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-12-12|title=Communiqué présentation 3e rotation de l’exposition "elles" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw [[Eileen Cooper]] elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame [[Elizabeth Blackadder]] in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982.

An interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art.

Women artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm|title=Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |first= Nicole|last=Myers|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including:
* Scarcity of biographical information
* Anonymity – Women artists were often most active in artistic expressions that were not typically signed. During the Early Medieval period, manuscript illumination was a pursuit of monks and nuns alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035602/http://books.google.com/books?id=B_qNtLc72fYC |date=2014-10-19 }}, Jeffrey F. Hamburger, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Painters' Guild]]s – In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, many women worked in the workshop system. These women worked under the auspices of a male workshop head, very often the artist's father. Until the twelfth century there is no record of a workshop headed by a woman, when a widow would be allowed to assume her husband's former position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prak|first1=Maarten R.|title=Craft Guilds in Early Modern Low Countries: Work, Power and Representation|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=0754653390|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[guild]] rules forbade women from attaining the various ranks leading to master,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting: Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035605/http://books.google.com/books?id=ucZcPgAACAAJ |date=2014-10-19 }}, Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-10237-2}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC Dutch Painting 1600–1800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035608/http://books.google.com/books?id=_v3WNI0DiKIC |date=2014-10-19 }} Pelican history of art, {{ISSN|0553-4755}}, Yale University Press, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; so they remained "unofficial" in their status.
* Naming Conventions – the [[Family name|convention whereby women take their husbands' last names]] impedes research on female articles, especially in cases in which a work of unknown origin was signed only with a first initial and last name. Even the simplest biographical statements may be misleading. For example, one might say that [[Jane Frank]] was born in 1918, but in reality she was [[Jane Schenthal]] at birth – Jane "Frank" didn't exist until over twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Phoebe B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=izcwMwEACAAJ "The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank"]  [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/ow/3569fb46ba6eb6ea.html World Cat] ([[A.S.

* Mistaken identity and incorrect attribution – In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, work by women was often reassigned. Some unscrupulous dealers even went so far as to alter signatures, as in the case of some paintings by [[Judith Leyster]] (1630) that were reassigned to [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede de Groot, Cornelis. "Judith Leyster," ''Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'' vol. 14 (1893), pp. 190–198; 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofrichter, Frima Fox.

Accessed Feb. 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Denise Villers]] (1774–1821) was a French painter who specialized in [[portrait]]s. Villers was a student of the French painter [[Girodet]]. Villers' most famous painting, Young Woman Drawing, (1801) is displayed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The painting was attributed to [[Jacques-Louis David]] at one time, but was later realized to be Villers' work.

==Background==
The standard deviation of wind direction is a measure of lateral [[turbulence]] and is used in a method for estimating the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#The Pasquill atmospheric stability classes|Pasquill stability category]] in air pollution dispersion.

The simple method for calculating standard deviation requires two passes through the list of values. The first pass determines the average of those values; the second pass determines the sum of the squares of the differences between the values and the average. This double-pass method requires access to all values. A [[Standard deviation#Rapid calculation methods|single-pass method]] can be used for normal data but is unsuitable for [[Polar coordinate system|angular]] data such as wind direction where the 0°/360° (or ±180°) discontinuity forces special consideration. For example, the directions 1°, 0°, and 359° (or −1°) should not average to the direction 180°.

The Yamartino method, introduced by Robert J. Yamartino in 1984, solves both problems. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has chosen it as the preferred way to compute the standard deviation of wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance/met/mmgrma.pdf Meteorological Monitoring Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications (section 6.2.1)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A further discussion of the Yamartino method, along with other methods of estimating the standard deviation of wind direction can be found in Farrugia &amp; Micallef.

It is possible to calculate the exact standard deviation in one pass. However, that method needs slightly more calculation effort.

==Algorithm==
Over the time interval to be averaged across, ''n'' measurements of wind direction (''θ'') will be made and two totals are accumulated without storage of the ''n'' individual values. At the end of the interval the calculations are as follows: with the average values of sin&amp;nbsp;''θ'' and cos&amp;nbsp;''θ'' defined as

:&lt;math&gt;s_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \sin \theta_i,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \cos \theta_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the average wind direction is given via the four-quadrant arctan(x,y) function as

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_a=\arctan(c_a,s_a).&lt;/math&gt;

From twenty different functions for ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; using variables obtained in a single-pass of the wind direction data, Yamartino found the best function to be

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \arcsin (\varepsilon) \left[1+\left(\tfrac 2 {\sqrt 3} -1\right) \varepsilon^3\right], &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\sqrt{1-(s^2_a+c^2_a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The key here is to remember that sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' = 1 so that for example, with a constant wind direction at any value of ''θ'', the value of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; will be zero, leading to a zero value for the standard deviation.
 
The use of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; alone produces a result close to that produced with a double-pass when the dispersion of angles is small (not crossing the discontinuity), but by construction it is always between 0 and 1.  Taking the [[arcsine]] then produces the double-pass answer when there are just two equally common angles: in the extreme case of an oscillating wind blowing backwards and forwards, it produces a result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians, i.e. a [[right angle]].  The final factor adjusts this figure upwards so that it produces the double-pass result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt; radians for an almost uniform distribution of angles across all directions, while making minimal change to results for small dispersions.

The theoretical maximum error against the correct double-pass ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore about 15% with an oscillating wind. Comparisons against Monte Carlo generated cases indicate that Yamartino's algorithm is within 2% for more realistic distributions.

A variant might be to weight each wind direction observation by the wind speed at that time.
