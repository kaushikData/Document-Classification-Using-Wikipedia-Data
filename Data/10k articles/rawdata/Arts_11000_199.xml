[[File:Akaa logo.png|{{largethumb}}|Logo for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture]]
The '''Aga Khan Award for Architecture''' ('''AKAA''') is an [[List of architecture prizes|architectural prize]] established by [[Aga Khan IV]] in 1977. It aims to identify and reward [[architecture|architectural]] concepts that successfully address the needs and aspirations of [[Muslim world|Islamic societies]] in the fields of contemporary [[design]], [[social housing]], [[community development]] and improvement, [[Building restoration|restoration]], [[reuse]] and [[Architectural conservation|area conservation]], as well as [[landscape design]] and [[Environmental science|improvement of the environment]].&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"&gt;"[http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0109/news_1-1.html Aga Khan Award for Architecture]." ''ArchitectureWeek'' 9 Jan. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented in three-year cycles to multiple projects and has a monetary award, with prizes totalling [[United States dollar|US$]] 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;^[http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/aga-khan-award-for-architecture-prize-doubled-to-us-1-million/1001116410/ ''Canadian Architect'', April 26, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Uniquely among architectural awards, it recognizes projects, teams, and stakeholders in addition to buildings and people.&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"/&gt;

The award is associated with the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] (AKTC), an agency of the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] (AKDN).

==Award process==
The award is aimed at societies in which Muslims have a significant presence.&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"/&gt; It is organised on the basis of a three-year cycle and is governed by a steering committee chaired by the Aga Khan IV.&lt;ref name="CanadianArc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/aga-khan-award-for-architecture-announces-master-jury-for-2007/1000060192/|title=Aga Khan Award for Architecture announces Master Jury for 2007 - Canadian Architect|date=12 January 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new committee is constituted each cycle to establish the eligibility criteria for projects, provide thematic direction with reference to current concerns, and to develop plans for the long-term future of the award. The ''Steering Committee'' is responsible for the selection of the ''Master Jury'' appointed for each award cycle, and for activities such as [[seminar]]s and field visits, the [[award ceremony]], publications and exhibitions.

===Chairman's Award===
The ''Chairman's Award'' is given in honour of accomplishments that fall outside the mandate of the Master Jury. It recognises lifetime achievements. It has been presented four times: in 1980 to Egyptian architect and urban planner [[Hassan Fathy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/firstcycle/chairman.html Lifetime Achievements of Hassan Fathy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208004014/http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/firstcycle/chairman.html |date=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 to Iraqi architect and educator [[Rifat Chadirji]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/thirdcycle/thirdcycle_chairman.html Lifetime Achievements of Rifat Chadirji] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208004020/http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/thirdcycle/thirdcycle_chairman.html |date=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001 to [[Sri Lanka]]n architect [[Geoffrey Bawa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/eighthcycle/bawa.htm Lifetime Achievements of Geoffrey Bawa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219135634/http://www.akdn.org/agency/akaa/eighthcycle/bawa.htm |date=February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 to historian of Islamic art and architecture [[Oleg Grabar]].&lt;ref name="Grabar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org/Content/1037|title=Speech by Oleg Grabar, Recipient of the 2010 Chairman's Award - Aga Khan Development Network|website=www.akdn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion===
The Aga Khan Foundation funded the television series ''Architects on the Frontline'' which was about entries to the competition. The media watchdog [[Ofcom]] criticised [[BBC World News]] for breaking United Kingdom broadcasting rules with the series, which praised the competition; viewers were not informed that it was sponsored content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33971919|title=News channels breached sponsorship rules, Ofcom says|date=18 August 2015|access-date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award cycles==
Prizes totalling up to US$ 1m, constituting the largest architectural award in the world,&lt;ref name="ArcWeek"/&gt; are presented every three years to projects selected by the Master Jury.&lt;ref name="CanadianArc"/&gt; Since 1977, documentation has been compiled on over 7500 building projects located throughout the world, of which over 100 projects have received awards.&lt;ref name="CanadArc2013"/&gt;

===Seventh (1996-1998)===
The 1998 award ceremony took place at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]]. The Master Jury selected seven winning projects of the 424 presented. During this cycle, special emphasis was placed on projects that responded creatively to the emerging forces of [[globalization]]. Issues such as [[demographic pressure]], [[environmental degradation]], and the crisis of the [[nation-state]], and the changes in lifestyle, cultural values, and relationships among social groups and between governments and people at large they prompted, were considered.

Of the winning projects, the rehabilitation of Hebron Old Town and Slum Networking of Indore City sought to reclaim community space in environments strained by social, physical and environmental degradation. The Lepers Hospital created a sustainable and dignified shelter for a marginalized segment of society. The remaining projects were recognized for their contribution in evolving an architectural vocabulary in response to contemporary social and environmental challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Cynthia C.

The '''baldachin of Ribes''' ({{lang-ca|baldaquí de Ribes}}) is a fragmentary [[baldachin|altar-canopy]] in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque style]] now in the [[Museu Episcopal de Vic|Episcopal Museum of Vic]]. It is the masterpiece of the so-called "Ripoll workshop" (''taller de Ripoll''). It dates to the second quarter of the twelfth century. The surviving fragment is only one fourth the size of the original, which contained a central [[mandorla]] with the figure of Christ and four angels on each side.

The style of the baldachin shows strong south French influence, and borrows many features from the tympanum of [[Moissac Abbey]], especially in the robes of Christ. The robes of the angels, however, and the hairstyles of all the figures are more typically Iberian.&lt;ref&gt;Walter W. S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11984">'''Black Theatre Workshop''' is a professional not-for-profit theatre company based in [[Montreal]], and is Canada's oldest Black theatre company in [[Quebec]].

==History==

Black Theatre Workshop was incorporated in 1972 but has roots going back to the [[Trinidad and Tobago]] Drama Committee. [[The Drama Committee was created by Clarence Bayne and Arther Goddard, both of whom were the founders of the Trinidad and Tobago Association and wrote its first Constitution and bylaws]]. [[Dr Bayne invited a number of professional Black Trinidadian artists resident in Montreal in the late sixties (1968) to conduct Black Workshops as part of the activities of the Drama Committee]]. [[It was the Black Workshops under the auspices of the Trinidad and Tobago Association that produced the first professional play of the BTW, written by Professor Lorris Elliott, and named "How Now Black Man". Dr. Bayne was appointed by the Trinidad and Tobago Association to be the Executive Producer of that production and to represent the Association's interest. Except for a brief absence from the company 1970-1972, Dr, Bayne continued to hold  the position of Executive producer and president of the company  for early the formative years of the company between 1973-4 to 1990]]. He negotiated the first professional grant from Canada Council with matching funds from the Multicultural Directorate (Ottawa) that launched the company as a professional theatre company in 1984, making it eligible for funding from all three level of the cultural funding agencies]] &lt;ref&gt;Le Black Theatre Workshop de MOntreal: un nouveau bilan by Clarence Bayne, L'Annuaire theatral 29, Methods en question,  Printemps 2001,  pp 141-155.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Black Theatre Workshop company is committed to reflecting Black culture and community by developing and providing visibility for Black Canadian artists; and the creation of a Black Canadian theatre and literature. Black Theatre Workshop is an award-winning English-speaking theatre company. [[ Its first play "How Now Black Man" was produced  in 1970 under the name '''Black Workshop''']] at the [[Centaur Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0012088 Canadian Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; But Black [Theatre] [[ Workshop defacto existed from July 17 1968]]. 

Over the years the [[theatre]] has had many artistic directors including[[ Dr.]] Clarence Bayne, [[Errol Sitahal]], Terry Donald, Dwight Bacquie, [[Lorena Gale]], Don Jordan, Winston Sutton, Fleurette Fernando, Nancy Delva, Kate Bligh and Rachael Van Fossen, and [[Tyrone Benskin]]. Since August 2011, the Artistic Director has been Quincy Armorer. He is a graduate of the Theatre Department at Concordia University and also studied at the Birmingham Conservatory for Classical Theatre at the Stratford Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/quincy-armorer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

Black Theatre Workshop's mission is to encourage and promote the development of a Black and Canadian Theatre, rooted in a [[literature]] that reflects the creative will of Black Canadian writers and artists, and the creative collaborations between Black and other artists. Black Theatre Workshop aims to promote and produce Black theatre that educates, entertains and delights its audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacktheatreworkshop.ca/about/who-we-are/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and merits==

Then Executive Director Dr. Clarence Bayne secured a [[Canada Council]] grant in 1976 and contributed new plays for the theater, including The Black Experience, Bonanza 70 and Martin Luther King Who?.

In 2005 BTW was recognized by the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Legacy Committee of Montreal for its Historic Contribution to the Development of Black [[Performing Arts]] in Canada. It has also received a Trail Blazer Award (Black History Month Round Table Award) in recognition of its exceptional dedication to the development of the community by promoting cultural diversity, educational awareness and social consciousness.


 
== Dr. Clarence Bayne Community Service Award ==

This award has been created by the Black Theatre Workshop in recognition of and to   honour of the exceptional   dedication and contributions of  Dr Clarence  Bayne to Black arts and culture in Canada; and his tireless  work in the development  of the Black community in Quebec and Canada.  He is an exemplary model of selfless devotion to community and commitment to the creation of a truly  just, equitable and sustainable multicultural  society in Canada.  His contributions span some sixty years and addresses  a wide range of issues and problems  affecting the full participation,  growth and development of  Blacks in Canadian societies.  The Workshop truly believes that his life achievements serve as a guide and motivator to successor generations of Black community leaders. 

Dr. Clarence Bayne is a founding past President of the National Black Coalition of Canada; a founder of the Black Community Council of Quebec; a founder and  member of the Board of Directors of the Queen Elizabeth Health Complex; a collaborator in the creation of the Monkland Community Center (NDG); a founder of the Montreal CEDEC.  He is the Founding Director of the Institute for Community Entrepreneurship  and Development (ICED) , Concordia University, Montreal.  He is a founding member of the Quebec Board of Black Educators and Founding President of the Black Studies Center, Montreal. He is   a founder and Senior Editor in Chief of the International Journal for Community Development and Management Sciences; a Full   professor Emeritus  in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management. JMSB, Concordia University.  He is widely published in the field of social economy and community development.
   
A crowning achievement is that he is the founder and sitting member and past president of the Black Theatre Workshop of Montreal.  For his selfless volunteer work Dr. Bayne has received  a vast number of awards from numerous community organizations and public institutions; national and international governments: several Governor General Awards including the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Award; The Trinidad and Tobago Commemorative Award on the 50th Anniversary of  the Independence of Trinidad and Tobago; The Black History Month Laureate Award and a special mention  as a member of the community group that spear-headed the naming of February Black History Month in Montreal; a Seniors Montreal Award; The Community Contact Award  as one of  19 Top Contributors to the Black Community of Montreal;  and the prestigious Martin Luther King life time Achievement Award (Black Theatre Workshop).  Dr Bayne is also a published Black poet,essayist, and social critic whose writings appear in several academic journals and publications.
  
Thus,  against this background  and the critical importance of Dr Bayne’s contributions to the creation and development of  Black theatre and culture in Montreal and Canada, making the srts a critical factor in community development  and the building of a better society, the Black Theatre Workshop at each Vision Celebration shines the spot light on volunteerism and community building, by presenting the Dr. Clarence Bayne Community Service Award to someone who demonstrates exemplary selflessness, persistence,  and creative drive in working for the betterment of our community and the creation of a better Canada.

The '''California Society of Printmakers''' (CSP) is the oldest continuously operating association of printmakers and friends of printmakers in the United States. CSP is a non-profit arts organization with an international membership of print artists and supporters of the art of fine [[printmaking]]. CSP promotes professional development and opportunity for printmakers, and educates artists and the public about printmaking. New members are admitted by portfolio review. Friends and supporters of printmaking are admitted by fee. They are based in [[San Francisco]], California.

== Early history: American print clubs (printmakers societies) and California Society of Etchers (CSE)==
[[File:California Society of Printmakers 2004 logo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Logo 2004-.]]
[[American print clubs]] or printmaking societies were prolific in the 19th century. Their impetus was primarily exhibition, technical exchange, shared equipment, and the promotion of printmaking as a fine art, as opposed to a method of reproducing images. The invention of photography meant that reproduction of art works could be achieved photographically instead of through the graphic arts of etching, engraving, and lithography. Thus, these methods of printmaking were freed from their reproducing role to develop as pure fine arts. In addition to the rise of printmaking societies/clubs, individual printmaking artists also sought to distinguish their work as a fine art, as opposed to a craft. Generally these artists from the 19th century were referred to as painter-etchers.  Nineteenth century printmaking societies in the United States were the New York Etchers Club (1877), Boston Etchers Club (1880?), Philadelphia Society of Etchers (1880), Brooklyn Etchers Club (1881), Brooklyn Scratchers Club (1882), Society of American Etchers (1888), Cincinnati Etchers Club (circa 1890).

Early 20th century printmaking societies were the very influential [[Chicago Society of Etchers]] (1910), begun and promoted by [[Bertha Jaques]]. After the Chicago Society, a flurry of other printmakers' societies followed. Next was the California Society of Etchers (1912), the Los Angeles group called the Printmakers of California (1914), and the Brooklyn Society of Etchers (1915).

The California Society of Etchers (CSE) merged with Bay Printmakers Society in 1968 when the current name, California Society of Printmakers (CSP), was adopted. Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s short histories of the society penned by various elected officers always referred to CSE/CSP as " the second oldest" continuous operating club in the United States. However, these historians failed to mention what the oldest society was. A little research revealed that the oldest American society of printmakers was the Chicago Society of Etchers. The California Society of Etchers was very aware of its Chicago predecessor, as the Chicago founder [[Bertha Jaques]] encouraged printmakers to establish their own local societies. Jaques also joined the California Society of Etchers in 1913, when non-resident members were first admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Millman, Mary and Dave Bohn, ''Master of Line: John W. Winker, American Etcher'' (Capra Press: Santa Barbara, 1994), p. 31, note 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Society of Etchers ceased operations in 1956, leaving California Society of Printmakers as the longest lived printmakers' society in the U.S.

== Origins of the California Society of Etchers (CSE)==

The California Society of Etchers (CSE) was founded in San Francisco in December 1912 and announced in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' on January 19, 1913  ("Etchers Form a State Organization", p.&amp;nbsp;27). Several sources cite an earlier 1911 date, such Marilyn S. Kushner's detailed chapter, "Genesis of the Twentieth-Century Print Club", although she does not cite her source. Robert B. Harshe, founder, and later first president of California Society of Etchers, leaves the founding date ambiguous in his chapter in the 1916 book, ''Art in California''. His chapter mentions the four years of the society, although the chapter itself is undated. Mary Millman and Dave Bohn's very thorough biography of John W. Winkler, cited above, supports the CSE founding date of 1912.

The founding of CSE is intimately connected with the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] (PPIE), a world’s fair held in 1915 in San Francisco to showcase the city’s recovery from the 1906 earthquake. It was Joseph Pennell, scheduled to be a juror for this event, who inspired a handful of local printmakers to launch the California Society of Etchers in preparation for that great event. Pennell, perhaps the best known American etcher, local to New York City and London, had traveled to Panama to sketch the construction of the Canal, then traveled to San Francisco where he produced a series of etchings of San Francisco, exhibiting them in 1912 in San Francisco. It is said that his presence in San Francisco achieved its purpose: encouraging local printmakers to get prepared and organized to take advantage of the promotional opportunities afforded by the upcoming San Francisco PPIE, the largest display of original art work of its time.

The four founders of the California Society of Etchers were artist colleagues: [[Robert B. Harshe]] (1879–1938), himself an etcher and then art professor at Stanford University;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/musarchives/archharshe.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706022242/http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/musarchives/archharshe.html# |archive-date=2008-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos|Pedro Joseph J. Lemos]] (1882–1954), then etcher and professor at the San Francisco Institute of Art (now [[San Francisco Art Institute]]);&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=4-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gottardo Piazzoni]] (1872–1945), painter and muralist; and [[Ralph Stackpole]] (1885–1973), a sculptor, printmaker, and at that time Piazzoni's studio assistant.

The young organization began exhibiting immediately, with its first annual exhibition in April 1913 at Vickery, Atkins and Torrey Print Gallery, 550 Sutter Street, San Francisco. Its second annual exhibition was also held in 1913.

Admission of artist members to the Society was originally not by juried portfolio review, as it is today. Then the society was open to all artists, painters and sculptors alike, any artist who had experience with etching techniques.  Artist membership was expanded beyond California in 1913 to include artists throughout the United States as well as American printmakers living abroad. It is not clear when precisely CSE began accepting international printmakers, but 1964 was CSE's first major international print competition.

The primary purpose of the Society was exhibition and education, promoting printmaking as a fine art, and sharing workspace and equipment. Non-artist members, then as now, were accepted as Associate or Patron members. Membership in both artist and associate categories grew quickly. The four founding members grew to fifteen charter members, those who were members at the time of publication of the first Constitution of the CSE in 1915; among these charter members was [[Gertrude Partington Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;Hailey, Gene, ed. [https://archive.org/stream/californiaartres15hail#page/n79/mode/2up "Gertrude Partington Albright"]. ''California Art Research 15 (1937): 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 there were 41 artist members and 107 associate members. Among the most prominent associate members were the Moore S. Achenbachs, the Sigmund Sterns, Dr. Leon Kolb, the Milton Esbergs, the Zellerbachs, [[Albert M. Bender]], and institutions such as the De Young Museum, Oakland Public Library, and the Print Club of Albany New York.

== Mid-Century==

California Society of Etchers (CSE) had enjoyed a dedicated executive secretary, Nicholas Dunphy (1896–1955), for more than 20 years, from 1932 to his death in 1955.  Understandably, Dunphy’s death created a huge hole in CSE's leadership. Nonetheless, annual membership shows continued except for the year of his death, with [[Elizabeth Ginno]] (1911–1991) becoming secretary after Dunphy's death. Ginno, Ginno's husband John W. Winkler, aka Winks (1890–1979), and Mark Luca (1918–2005), were active CSE members between 1955 and 1968, the year that CSE merged with Bay Printmakers Society to form California Society of Printmakers (CSP)

== Bay Printmakers Society==

In 1955 two graduate students from Oakland's California College of Arts and Crafts (now the [[California College of the Arts]]) were eager for exhibition opportunities.   According to [http://www.jeaneger.com  Jean Womack], former CSP historian, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080706141751/http://denverlibrary.org/about/art/strawn.html Mel Strawn] (1929–) and [http://www.oakton.edu/museum/pcpwill.html Will Petersen] (1928–1994) placed an ad in a national art magazine announcing themselves as the Bay Printmakers Society hosting a national exhibition. Work was to be sent to the address cited even though a location for the actual show had not yet been established. As the work poured in, Paul Mills, then director of the [[Oakland Museum]] of Art, provided the venue, and remained a strong supporter during the next five national exhibitions. The first exhibition was juried by John Paul Jones, respected printmaker from UCLA. The jurying took place at the home of Eldon Mills, friend of Mel Strawn, and an active supporter of Bay Printmakers; it was monitored/observed by Sabro Hasegawa, a visiting teacher from Japan at CCAC.

Charter members of the Bay Printmakers Society included artists [[Beth Van Hoesen]] (1926–2010 ), [http://www.printdealers.com/artist_template.cfm?id=1985 John Ihle] (1925–2002), [[Karl Kasten]] (1916–2010 ), [[Nathan Oliveira]] (1928–2010 ), Gordon Cook (1927–1985), Virginia Vandegrift, and art collector Eldon Mills.  Their activities were focused exclusively on the national show. Between 1955 and 1960, Bay Printmakers generally had one-person juries for their open national shows. After John Paul Jones, BPS jurors were printmaker Leonard Edmondson (1916–2002); poet [[Kenneth Patchen]] (1911–1972); and Director of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts [[Ernst Gunter Troche]] (1909–1971).

Between 1959 and 1965 CSE created three-person jury teams for their national open, juried print exhibitions. These generally consisted of one artist member, one critic, and one museum curator. In 1959 the jurors were Ernest Freed, John Winkler, and John LaPlante. In 1960 the jurors were Doel Reed, E. Gunter Troche, and Raymond E. Lewis. Other CSE national annual jurors were: 1961 Gordon Cook; 1965 Wayne Thiebaud, Alan Lynch, and Moses Lasky.

== Merger History: California Society of Etchers Joins Bay Printmakers==

In 1968 Ginno invited Bay Printmaker member John Ihle to join CSE, probably the first dual member of both organizations.  Ginno then approached Bay Printmaker president [[Karl Kasten]], who had help create the etching studios at the new San Francisco State University campus in 1949 and then joined UC Berkeley's art department in printmaking, about the possibility of merging CSE and BPS. Kasten took up the suggestion immediately. Both organizations met at the Oakland Museum in 1968 and approved the merger, electing Kasten as the first president of the new society, which they named California Society of Printmakers. A new constitution was created, and exhibitions, education of members and the public, and publications continued.

== CSP Today==

Today, CSP  has approximately 250 artist members, 19 honorary members, and 12 associate and patron memberships. CSP publishes the annual ''California Printmaker '''Journal''''' and previously published 
the semi-annual ''California Printmaker '''Newsbrief'''''.

== Archives ==

California Society of Printmakers maintains two separate archives: one of its records, the other of prints. The California Society of Printmakers Records were given to The [[Bancroft Library]], [[University of California, Berkeley]] by the California Society of Printmakers in January 1988. Additions were made in 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007. A finding aid to the records may be found at the [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2g5002s7/ Online Archive of California].

A small archive of prints is maintained by CSP at a San Francisco storage facility. An inventory has not yet been created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7109">'''Cascade Yachts''' was a pioneering [[United States|U.S.]]-based builder of fiberglass [[monohull]] sloop-rigged [[sailboats]] ranging in sizes from 23 to {{convert|42|ft|m}} in length. It was founded in 1954 in [[Portland, Oregon]] by a group of local sailors interested in experimenting with [[fiberglass]] sailboat construction.

==History==
In 1954 the company was launched by five sailors under the name Yacht Constructors. The first design, the {{convert|34|ft|m|adj=on}} Chinook, came from the desk of well-known Philadelphia naval architect Frederick Geiger, adapted from a wood design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cramermarine.com/ch34_news.html |title=Chinook 34 |accessdate=2010-10-08 |publisher=Freshwater News,1984-11 |author=Scott Gibson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402001521/http://www.cramermarine.com/ch34_news.html |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first five were launched in 1956-1957 to the founders, and began winning local races and gathering attention in the press. Eventually 70 were produced,&lt;ref name="The loss of Falcon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodoldboat.com/newsletter/08_junnews60.php|publisher=Good Old Boat, June 2008|title=The loss of Falcon|accessdate=2010-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it arguably the first production fiberglass sailboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robarta A. Smith, a former [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens]] designer, would later design a series of boats for the company:
* Cascade 29 1961 360 were eventually produced.
* Cascade 42 1964
* Cascade 36 1967
* Cascade 23 1977
* Cascade 24 1977
* Cascade 27 1978

Like many early producers of fiberglass boats, the company's production methods resulted in yachts that were heavier than later builders. Experimenting with fiberglass, at that time a relatively novel material for boat construction, the founders made test samples that were shot at from {{convert|10|ft|m}} with various firearms to test the material strength. The test samples repelled .45 slugs and became the foundation of the company's reputation for producing [[bulletproof]] yachts. In various cases Cascade Yachts have been dropped off slings, fallen off a trailer at highway speed, and submerged in a mudslide, and suffered little consequential damage.&lt;ref name="The loss of Falcon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/or/petermarsh/cascade.htm |title=Cascade Yachts: Building Boats for the Long Run |accessdate=2010-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427100117/http://www.angelfire.com/or/petermarsh/cascade.htm |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Cascade hulls were sold in various stages of completion for owners to finish the interiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=cascade%20yachts&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=cascade%20yachts&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|accessdate=2010-10-07|author=Jim Howard, Charles J.

'''COOKFOX Architects''' (formerly Cook+Fox Architects) is a firm of architects founded by [[Rick Cook (architect)|Rick Cook]] and [[Robert F. Fox, Jr. (Architect)|Robert F. Fox, Jr.]] in 2003. The firm provides both new projects and works on the [[adaptive reuse]] of existing buildings. COOKFOX is best known for designing the [[Bank of America Tower (New York City)|Bank of America Tower]] at One Bryant Park.

==Work==
The firm’s portfolio includes a range of commercial, institutional and residential projects. COOKFOX has completed multiple projects in New York City’s historic Landmarks districts. Works include the redevelopment of Historic Front Street, a revitalization of a 19th-century neighborhood that won an AIA-NY/Boston Society of Architects Honor Award for Housing Design;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, David. “Development in a Historic District: New Life on a Street Left for Dead.” New York Times. 3 Jun 2003. https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/03/nyregion/development-in-a-historic-district-new-life-on-a-street-left-for-dead.html?scp=1&amp;sq=david%20dunlap%20development%20in%20a%20historic%20district&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt;  401 W 14th Street, a mixed-use building in Manhattan’s [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]] that won an AIA-NY State Award for Adaptive Reuse; and the redevelopment of Henry Miller’s Theatre, a newly constructed theater with a Landmarked 1918 façade that will receive LEED Gold certification—making it Broadway’s first green theater.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Patrick. "White Way Gets a 'Green' Theater." New York Times. 3 May 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/theater/04Green.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=patrick%20healy%20white%20way%20gets%20a%20green%20theater&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent projects, notably the [[Bank of America Tower (New York City)|Bank of America Tower]] and Henry Miller’s Theatre (renamed the [[Stephen Sondheim Theatre]]), focus on creating a healthy workplace.
In 2009 the firm was completing construction on the LiveWorkHome, a green, affordable home in Syracuse, NY that was one of three winning entries in the “From the Ground Up” Competition.&lt;ref&gt;Applebaum, Alec. “Building New Neighborhoods in Syracuse, Using Some Pieces of the Old.” 15 Dec 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/realestate/commercial/16homes.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt; It was also completing the Center for Friends Without a Border, a visitors’ center at the Angkor Hospital for Children in [[Siem Reap]], [[Cambodia]].

The firm itself has won awards including the Museum of the City of New York’s Gotham Giant Award and New York School of Interior Design’s inaugural Honor Roll of Green Design Award.&lt;ref&gt;”New York School of Interior Design (NYSID) to Present COOKFOX Architects with Green Design Award.” New York School of Interior Design. http://www.nysid.edu/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=314{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; COOKFOX’s LEED Platinum office – the first LEED Platinum project in New York State – is located in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood. The office’s interior was restored and the firm built a green roof, which was featured in National Geographic’s May 2009 issue.&lt;ref&gt;“Green Roof, New York City.” National Geographic. http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/wallpaper/green-roof-nyc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Dante's Inferno'''" is a song by the American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iced Earth]]. The song was originally released on the group's 1995 album ''[[Burnt Offerings (album)|Burnt Offerings]]'', and was re-recorded in 2011, with the current line-up of the band. "Dante's Inferno" is also one of the longest songs the band has ever recorded, with the original clocking in at sixteen minutes and twenty-six seconds and the re-recorded version clocking in at seventeen minutes and twenty-eight seconds.

==Lyrics==
{{Main|Inferno (Dante)}}

The song is based on the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' -segment of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s [[epic poem]] the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.&lt;ref name="Dante"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icedearth.com/home/iced-earth-re-records-epic-%E2%80%9Cdante%E2%80%99s-inferno%E2%80%9D-gives-it-away-free |title=Iced Earth re-record "Dante's Inferno" and give it away for free &amp;#124; The Official Iced Earth Website |publisher=Icedearth.com |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Dante travels through the nine circles of [[Hell]], guided by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Virgil]]. The circles are [[concentric]], representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at the centre of the earth, where [[Satan]] is held in bondage. Each circle's sinners are punished in a fashion fitting their crimes: each sinner is afflicted for all of eternity by the chief sin they committed.

The first circle is [[Limbo]], where reside the [[Babtism|unbaptized]] and the [[virtuous pagan]]s, who, though not sinful, did not accept Christ. Beyond the first circle, all of those condemned for active, deliberately willed sin are judged by the serpentine [[Minos]], who sentences each soul to one of the lower eight circles. In the second circle are those overcome by [[lust]]. These souls are blown back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without hope of rest. The third circle is [[gluttony]], where the gluttons, guarded by [[Cerberus]], are forced to lie in a vile slush produced by ceaseless foul, icy rain. Those whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate mean are punished in the fourth circle, avarice. They include the avaricious or miserly, who hoarded possessions, and the prodigal, who squandered them. The two groups are guarded by a figure Dante names as Pluto. The two groups joust, using as weapons great weights which they push with their chests. In the fifth circle, anger, in the swamp-like water of the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], the wrathful fight each other on the surface, and the sullen lie gurgling beneath the water, withdrawn "into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe."
[[File:Gustave Dore Inferno34.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Gustave Doré]]'s original painting of [[Lucifer]] from the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]
The lower parts of Hell are contained within the walls of the city of [[Dis (Divine Comedy)|Dis]], which is itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh. Punished within Dis are active (rather than passive) sins. The walls of Dis are guarded by [[fallen angel]]s. Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter, while [[Erinyes|Furies]] and [[Medusa]] threaten Dante. An angel sent from [[Heaven]] secures entry for the poets, opening the gate by touching it with a wand, and rebuking those who opposed Dante. In the sixth circle, the [[Christian heresy|heretics]] are trapped in flaming tombs. The seventh circle houses the violent. Its entry is guarded by the [[Minotaur]], and it is divided into three rings: the outer ring (which houses the violent against people and property), the middle ring (where lie the suicides) and the inner ring (the violent against God and the violent against nature). The last two circles of Hell punish sins that involve conscious fraud or treachery. In the ninth circle, the very centre of Hell, condemned for committing the ultimate sin (personal treachery against God), is Satan. Satan is described as a giant, terrifying beast with three faces, one red, one black, and one a pale yellow. Satan is waist deep in ice, weeping tears from his six eyes, and beating his six wings as if trying to escape, although the icy wind that emanates only further ensures his imprisonment (as well as that of the others in the ring). Each face has a mouth that chews on a prominent traitor, with [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] feet-first in the left and right mouths respectively. In the central, most vicious mouth is [[Judas Iscariot]]. Judas is being administered the most horrifying torture of the three traitors, his head gnawed by Satan's mouth, and his back being forever skinned by Satan's claws. Dante and Virgil finally escape Hell by climbing down Satan's ragged fur, passing through the centre of the earth.

==Live==
After its release in 1995, the song was only performed live in 1999, for the ''[[Alive in Athens]]'' concert.&lt;ref name="Dante"/&gt;&lt;ref name="That Drummer Guy"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R76Q-uCO4Js | title=Jon Schaffer interviewed by That Drummer Guy. | publisher= |date= | accessdate =July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhythm guitarist [[Jon Schaffer]] later shed light on why the song was only played at said concert:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''The simple reason why we haven’t [played the song] is because the original click track was erased, therefore requiring a keyboard player to do the parts live. That's OK for a special event like when we recorded Alive in Athens, but to hire a keyboard player for a full tour, for one song, just isn't financially feasible.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="Dante"/&gt;

After Iced Earth re-recorded "Dante's Inferno" in 2011, they announced that the song would be played on all dates of the upcoming [[Dystopia World Tour]].&lt;ref name="Dante"/&gt; According to Jon Schaffer, it may be the last tour on which the song will be performed.&lt;ref name="Ampmagazine"&gt;{{cite video

In 2011, Iced Earth re-recorded "Dante's Inferno" with the line-up of rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer (who also played on the original recording), lead guitarist Troy Seele, bassist Freddie Vidales, drummer Brent Smedley and singer [[Stu Block]].&lt;ref name="Dante"/&gt; Stu Block had just joined Iced Earth earlier that year, and according to Schaffer, the band had already planned to re-record "Dante's Inferno" prior to the leaving of previous vocalist [[Matt Barlow]] (who also sang on the original "Dante's Inferno").&lt;ref name="Jon Schaffer interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=166045| title=Jon Schaffer interviewed on "KASC The Blsze 1330 AM." | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date= | accessdate = 29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-recorded "Dante's Inferno" was given away for free on the band's official website on September 5, 2011.&lt;ref name="Dante"/&gt;

Now that the band had re-recorded the song, they were in possession of a new [[click track]], which meant that they no longer required a keyboard player to the play the song live. As a result, "Dante's Inferno" was brought back in to Iced Earth's setlist for their Dystopia World Tour.&lt;ref name="Dante"/&gt; A CD version of the song was also sold on the tour.&lt;ref name="Jon Schaffer interview"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4208">[[File:Devil's Door, Church of St Peter and St Paul, Broadhempston (Geograph Image 946268 448f35b9).jpg|thumb|The Devil's door at the Church of St Peter and St Paul, [[Broadhempston]], Devon]]

'''Devil's doors''' are structural features found in the north wall of some [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] and older churches in the United Kingdom.  They are particularly common in the historic county of [[Sussex]], where more than 40 extant churches have one.&lt;ref name="Collins52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collins|2007|p=52.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have their origins in the early Christian era, when pre-Christian worship was still popular, and were often merely symbolic structures—although they were sometimes used as genuine entrances.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"&gt;{{Harvnb|Piccardi|Masse|2007|p=291.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
[[File:St Nicholas Church, Worth, Crawley.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon-era]] [[St Nicholas' Church, Worth|St Nicholas' Church]] at [[Worth, West Sussex]], has a Devil's door]]

Before and during the [[Middle Ages]], the north face of a church was considered to belong to the Devil and to people considered [[Paganism|heathen]].&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppin138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Coppin|2006|p=138.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Churches were invariably built to the north of roads and tracks, to ensure their main entrance was on the south side.&lt;ref name="Coppin138"/&gt;  It was also common for them to be [[Christianised sites|built on pre-Christian sacred sites]].  Such places were still considered sacred by their former worshippers, who would often continue to visit them.  A doorway would often be inserted in the "heathen" north side of the church to allow them to enter and worship on the site.  Because of the association of that side with the Devil, the name "Devil's door" became established.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;

A later, and more common purpose, (especially in Sussex) was to allow the Devil to escape from the church.  A widespread belief in the Middle Ages held that the Devil resided in an unbaptised child's [[soul]]; at the [[baptism]], the Devil would be driven out of the child and had to be able to leave.  Accordingly, a door was often built into the north wall for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;  These doors were often too small to have any real use, and were therefore only figurative.&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt;  Most of the doors that remain have been bricked up—reputedly to prevent the Devil re-entering.&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;G291"/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:St Margaret's Church, Ditchling.jpg|thumb|St Margaret's Church, Ditchling, Devil's door]]

Devil's doors can be found throughout Britain, but they are concentrated in Sussex: churches in that county with visible examples include [[St Margaret's Church, Ditchling]]; [[St Peter's Church, Hamsey]]; [[St Helen's Church, Hangleton]]; [[All Saints Church, Patcham]]; [[Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting|St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting]]&lt;ref name="Collins52"/&gt; and [[St Nicholas' Church, Worth]].&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmes|1920|loc=Unpaginated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund Burke''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|ɜr|k}}; 12 January &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[New Style|NS]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1729&lt;ref&gt;The exact year of his birth is the subject of a great deal of controversy; 1728, 1729, and 1730 have been proposed. The month and day of his birth also are subject to question, a problem compounded by the [[Julian calendar|Julian]]–[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] changeover in 1752, during his lifetime. For a fuller treatment of the question, see F. P. Lock, ''Edmund Burke. Volume I: 1730–1784'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 16–17. [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] (2008; p. 14) questions Burke's birthplace as having been in Dublin, arguing in favour of Shanballymore, Co. Cork (in the house of his uncle, James Nagle).&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1797) was an [[Irish people| Irish]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark 2001, p. 25: "Edmund Burke was an Irishman, born in Dublin but in an age before 'Celtic nationalism' had been constructed to make Irishness and Englishness incompatible: he was therefore free also to describe himself, without misrepresentation, as 'a loyalist being loyal to England' to denote his membership of the wider polity. He never attempted to disguise his Irishness (as some ambitious Scots in eighteenth-century England tried to anglicise their accents), did what he could in the Commons to promote the interests of his native country and was bitterly opposed to the Penal Laws against Irish Catholics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |authorlink=Christopher Hitchens |title=Reactionary Prophet |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2004/04/hitchens.htm |newspaper=The Atlantic |location=Washington |date=April 2004 |quote=Edmund Burke was neither an Englishman nor a Tory. He was an Irishman, probably a Catholic Irishman at that (even if perhaps a secret sympathiser), and for the greater part of his life he upheld the more liberal principles of the Whig faction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - History - Edmund Burke|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politician|statesman]] born in [[Dublin]], as well as an author, orator, [[political theorist]] and philosopher, who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] with the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]].

Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bourke, ''Empire and Revolution: The Political Life of Edmund Burke'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} These views were expressed in his ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. Burke criticized British treatment of the [[British America|American colonies]], including through its taxation policies. He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. Burke is remembered for his support for [[Catholic emancipation]], the impeachment of [[Warren Hastings]] from the [[East India Company]] and for his staunch opposition to the [[French Revolution]]. In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society and traditional institutions of state and society, and condemned the persecution of the [[Catholic Church]] that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], which he dubbed the "Old Whigs", as opposed to the pro-French Revolution "New Whigs", led by [[Charles James Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke lived before the terms "conservative" and "liberal" were used to describe political ideologies, cf. J. C. D. Clark, ''English Society, 1660–1832'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2000), pp. 5, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dennis O'Keeffe |author2=John Meadowcroft |title=Edmund Burke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVO9QuYUGwwC&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2009 |publisher=Continuum |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Heywood, ''Political Ideologies: An Introduction. Third Edition'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Lock, ''Edmund Burke. Volume II: 1784–1797'' (Clarendon Press, 2006), p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Burke was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland. His mother Mary ''née'' Nagle (c. 1702–1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a [[wikt:declasse|declasse]] [[County Cork]] family (and a cousin of [[Nano Nagle]]), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the [[Church of Ireland]]; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Langford, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4019 Burke, Edmund (1729/30–1797)], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Burke|Burke dynasty]] descends from an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[knight]] surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as ''de Burgo'') who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following [[Henry II of England]]'s 1171 [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invasion of Ireland]] and is among the chief "Gall" (or "[[Normans in Ireland#Old English|Old English]]") families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming "[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Prior (surgeon)|James Prior]], ''Life of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Fifth Edition'' (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Connor Cruise|page=10|title=The Great Melody|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, his political enemies repeatedly accused him of having been educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[College of St. Omer]], near [[Calais]], France, and of harbouring secret Catholic sympathies at a time when membership of the Catholic Church would disqualify him from public office (''see'' [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws in Ireland]]). As Burke told [[Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe|Frances Crewe]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Burke's Enemies often endeavoured to convince the World that he had been bred up in the Catholic Faith, &amp; that his Family were of it, &amp; that he himself had been educated at St. Omer—but this was false, as his father was a regular practitioner of the Law at Dublin, which he could not be unless of the Established Church: &amp; it so happened that though Mr. B—was twice at Paris, he never happened to go through the Town of [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Extracts from Mr. Burke's Table-talk, at Crewe Hall. Written down by Mrs. Crewe, pp. 62.", ''Miscellanies of the Philobiblon Society. Volume VII'' (London: Whittingham and Wilkins, 1862–63), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After being elected to the House of Commons, Burke was required to take the [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath of Allegiance]] and [[Abjuration#Great Britain and Ireland|abjuration]], the [[oath of supremacy]], and declare against [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although never denying his Irishness, Burke often described himself as "an Englishman". According to the historian [[J. C. D. Clark]], this was in an age "before 'Celtic nationalism' sought to make Irishness and Englishness incompatible".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child he sometimes spent time away from the unhealthy air of Dublin with his mother's family in the [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]] Valley in County Cork. He received his early education at a [[Quakers|Quaker]] school in [[Ballitore]], County Kildare, some {{convert|67|km|mi}} from Dublin; and possibly, like his cousin [[Nano Nagle]] at a [[Hedge school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.distancesfrom.com/ie/distance-from-Dublin-to-Baltimore-Ireland/DistanceHistory/1830632.aspx?IsHistory=1&amp;GMapHistoryID=1830632 |title=DistanceFrom.com Dublin, Ireland to Ballitore, Co. Kildare, Ireland|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=DistanceFrom.com |publisher=softusvista. |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in correspondence with his schoolmate from there, [[Mary Leadbeater]], the daughter of the school's owner, throughout his life.

In 1744, Burke started at [[Trinity College Dublin]], a Protestant [[university|establishment]], which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take [[academic degree|degrees]].&lt;ref name="millbanksystems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1834/may/08/catholics-and-trinity-college-dublin|title=Catholics and Trinity College Dublin. (Hansard, 8 May 1834)|publisher=hansard.millbanksystems.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1747, he set up a debating society, "Edmund Burke's Club", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the [[College Historical Society]]; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the [[Middle Temple]], before soon giving up legal study to travel in [[Continental Europe]]. After eschewing the Law, he pursued a livelihood through writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edmund Burke|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_burke.html|publisher=The Basics of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early writing==
The late [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]]'s ''Letters on the Study and Use of History'' was published in 1752 and his collected works appeared in 1754. This provoked Burke into writing his first published work, ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society|A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind]]'', appearing in Spring 1756. Burke imitated Bolingbroke's style and ideas in a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of his arguments for [[atheistic]] [[rationalism]], in order to demonstrate their [[absurdity]].&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 45"&gt;Prior, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim McCue, ''Edmund Burke and Our Present Discontents'' (The Claridge Press, 1997), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edmund Burke2 c.jpg|left|thumb|"The writers against religion, whilst they oppose every system, are wisely careful never to set up any of their own." ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]'']]

Burke claimed that Bolingbroke's arguments against [[Revelation|revealed religion]] could apply to all social and civil institutions as well.&lt;ref name="Critical Dict"&gt;{{cite book |title=A critical dictionary of English literature and British and American authors, living and deceased, from the earliest accounts to the latter half of the nineteenth century. Containing over forty-six thousand articles (authors), with forty indexes of subjects |ol=7102188M |url=https://archive.org/details/criticaldictiona01alliuoft/page/288 |authorlink=Samuel Austin Allibone |last=Allibone |first=Samuel Austin |year=1908 |publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.]] |volume=1 |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] and [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]] (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a [[satire]].&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the [[ironic]] nature of the book, which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 85"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Hurd (clergyman)|Richard Hurd]] believed that Burke's imitation was near-perfect and that this defeated his purpose: an [[ironist]] "should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the ''ridicule'' shine through the Imitation. Whereas this ''Vindication'' is everywhere enforc'd, not only in the language, and on the principles of L. Bol., but with so apparent, or rather so real an earnestness, that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 85" /&gt; A minority of scholars have taken the position that, in fact, Burke did write the ''Vindication'' in earnest, later disowning it only for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html |title=Edmund Burke, Anarchist |accessdate=14 October 2007 |author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Sobran|Sobran, Joseph]], [http://www.sobran.com/columns/2002/020124.shtml Anarchism, Reason, and History]: "Oddly enough, the great conservative Edmund Burke began his career with an anarchist tract, arguing that the state was naturally and historically destructive of human society, life, and liberty. Later he explained that he'd intended his argument ironically, but many have doubted this. His argument for anarchy was too powerful, passionate, and cogent to be a joke. Later, as a professional politician, Burke seems to have come to terms with the state, believing that no matter how bloody its origins, it could be tamed and civilized, as in Europe, by "the spirit of a gentleman, and the spirit of religion". But even as he wrote, the old order he loved was already breaking down. "&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757, Burke published a treatise on [[aesthetics]], ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', which attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. It was his only purely philosophical work, and when asked by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] and [[French Laurence]] to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation (Burke had written it before he was nineteen years of age).&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 1757, Burke signed a contract with [[Robert Dodsley]] to write a "history of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne", its length being eighty quarto sheets (640 pages), nearly 400,000 words. It was to be submitted for publication by Christmas 1758.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped; it was not published until after Burke's death, being included in an 1812 collection of his works, entitled ''An Essay Towards an Abridgement of the English History''. [[G. M. Young]] did not value Burke's history and claimed that it was "demonstrably a translation from the French".&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Young, 'Burke', ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', XXIX (London, 1943), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Acton]], on commenting on the story that Burke stopped his history because [[David Hume]] published his, said "it is ever to be regretted that the reverse did not occur".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Butterfield, ''Man on His Past'' (Cambridge, 1955), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the year following that contract, with Dodsley, Burke founded the influential ''[[Annual Register]]'', a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Burke contributed to the ''Annual Register'' is unclear:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wellsted Copeland, 'Edmund Burke and the Book Reviews in Dodsley's Annual Register', ''Publications of the [[Modern Language Association]]'', Vol. 57, No. 2. (Jun. 1942), pp. 446–68.&lt;/ref&gt; in his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the ''Register'' as evidence of Burke's opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference.&lt;ref name="Copeland, p. 446"&gt;Copeland, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke remained the [[chief editor]] of the publication until at least 1789 and there is no evidence that any other writer contributed to it before 1766.&lt;ref name="Copeland, p. 446" /&gt;

On 12 March 1757, Burke married Jane Mary Nugent (1734–1812), daughter of Dr [[Christopher Nugent (physician)|Christopher Nugent]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/41200 www.ucl.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; a Catholic physician who had provided him with medical treatment at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Their son [[Richard Burke Jr.|Richard]] was born on 9 February 1758; an elder son, Christopher, died in infancy. Burke also helped raise a [[Ward (law)|ward]], Edmund Nagle (''later'' [[Admiral]] [[Sir Edmund Nagle]]), the son of a maternal cousin orphaned in 1763.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19720 Nagle, Sir Edmund], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[John Knox Laughton|J. K. Laughton]], (subscription required), Retrieved 22 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

At about this same time, Burke was introduced to [[William Gerard Hamilton]] (known as "Single-speech Hamilton"). When Hamilton was appointed [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], Burke accompanied him to Dublin as his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|private secretary]], a position he held for three years. In 1765 Burke became [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|private secretary]] to the liberal Whig statesman, [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Charles, Marquess of Rockingham]], then [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]], who remained Burke's close friend and associate until his untimely death in 1782. Rockingham also introduced Burke as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;Denslow, William R., 10,000 Famous Freemasons, 4 vol., Missouri Lodge of Research, Trenton, Missouri, 1957–61. vol. 1, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/burke_e/burke_e.html |title=Edmund Burke |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
{{The Club|size=250px|align=right}}&lt;!--the grammar in the caption is incorrect, ''who is '''who''''' should read, ''to identify each member''--&gt;

In December 1765, Burke entered the House of Commons of the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] as Member for [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]], a [[pocket borough]] in the gift of Lord Fermanagh, later [[Earl Verney|2nd Earl Verney]] and a close political ally of Rockingham. After Burke delivered his [[maiden speech]], [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] said he had "spoken in such a manner as to stop the mouths of all Europe" and that the Commons should congratulate itself on acquiring such a Member.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first great subject Burke addressed was the controversy with the American colonies, which soon developed into [[American Revolutionary War|war]] and ultimate [[United States Declaration of Independence|separation]]; in reply to the 1769 [[George Grenville|Grenvillite]] [[pamphlet]], ''The Present State of the Nation'', he published his own pamphlet on, ''Observations on a Late State of the Nation''. Surveying the finances of France, Burke predicts "some extraordinary convulsion in that whole system".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, with mostly borrowed money, Burke purchased ''Gregories'', a {{convert|600|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} estate near [[Beaconsfield]]. Although the [[Estate (land)|estate]] included saleable assets such as [[art work]]s by [[Titian]], ''Gregories'' proved a heavy financial burden in the following decades and Burke was never able to repay its purchase price in full. His speeches and writings, having made him famous, led to the suggestion that he was the author of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''.

At about this time, Burke joined the circle of leading intellectuals and artists in London of whom [[Samuel Johnson]] was the central luminary. This [[Social circle|circle]] also included [[David Garrick]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and [[Joshua Reynolds]]. [[Edward Gibbon]] described Burke as 'the most eloquent and rational madman that I ever knew'.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Letters of Edward Gibbon, II (1896)'' Prothero, P. (ed.). p. 251 cited in ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781–1998'' (2007) Brendon, Piers. Jonathan Cape, London. p. 10 {{ISBN|978-0-224-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson admired Burke's brilliance, he found him a dishonest politician.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Life of Samuel Johnson'', edited by Hill-Powell; v. II, p. 349; 7 April 1775&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, Journals, ''Boswell: The Ominous Years'', p. 134, edited by Ryskamp &amp; Pottle; McGraw Hill, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke took a leading role in the debate regarding the constitutional limits to the executive authority of the [[George III of the United Kingdom|king]]. He argued strongly against unrestrained royal power and for the role of political parties in maintaining a principled opposition capable of preventing abuses, either by the monarch, or by specific factions within the government. His most important publication in this regard was his ''Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents'' of 23 April 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=Burke: Select Works of Edmund Burke, Vol. 1, Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke identified the "discontents" as stemming from the "secret influence" of a neo-Tory group he labelled as, the "king's friends", whose system "comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, ''Double Cabinet''".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain needed a party with "an unshaken adherence to principle, and attachment to connexion, against every allurement of interest". Party divisions "whether operating for good or evil, are things inseparable from free government".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gregories Estate near Beaconsfield Buckinghamshire 1792.jpg|thumb|The ''Gregories'' estate, purchased by Burke for £20,000 in 1768]]
During 1771, Burke wrote a Bill that, if passed, would have given [[jury|juries]] the right to determine what was [[libel]]. Burke spoke in favour of the Bill but it was opposed by some, including [[Charles James Fox]] thus not becoming law. Fox, when introducing [[Libel Act 1792|his own Bill]] in 1791 in Opposition, repeated almost verbatim the text of Burke's Bill without acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 127 + pp. 340–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also was prominent in securing the right to publish debates held in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in a parliamentary debate on the prohibition on the export of grain on 16 November 1770, Burke argued in favour of a [[free market]] in corn: "There are no such things as a high, &amp; a low price that is encouraging, &amp; discouraging; there is nothing but a natural price, which grain brings at an universal market."&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', pp. 321–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772 Burke was instrumental in the passing of the [[Repeal of Certain Laws Act 1772]], which repealed various old laws against dealers and forestallers in corn.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Annual Register'' for 1772 (published in July 1773), Burke condemned the [[First Partition of Poland|Partition of Poland]]. He saw it as "the first very great breach in the modern political system of Europe" and as upsetting the balance of power in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan Simms]], ''Three Victories and a Defeat. The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714–1783'' (Allen Lane, 2007), pp. 569–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 1774, Burke was elected Member for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]], at the time "England's second city" and a large constituency with a genuine electoral contest. The platform on which he was elected included the ''Speech to the Electors of Bristol'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.html uchicago.edu: "Edmund Burke, Speech to the Electors of Bristol"] 3 Nov. 1774, Works 1:446--48&lt;/ref&gt; a remarkable disclaimer of the constituent-imperative form of democracy, for which he substituted his statement of the "representative mandate" form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article

In May 1778, Burke supported a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] revising restrictions on Irish trade. His constituents, citizens of the great trading city of Bristol, however urged Burke to oppose [[free trade]] with Ireland. Burke resisted their protestations and said: "If, from this conduct, I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election, it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England, that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke published, ''Two Letters to Gentlemen of Bristol on the Bills relative to the Trade of Ireland'', in which he espoused "some of the chief principles of commerce; such as the advantage of free intercourse between all parts of the same kingdom...the evils attending restriction and monopoly...and that the gain of others is not necessarily our loss, but on the contrary an advantage by causing a greater demand for such wares as we have for sale".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 175–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke also supported the attempts of [[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet|Sir George Savile]] to repeal some of the [[penal laws]] against Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also called capital punishment "the Butchery which we call justice" in 1776 and in 1780 he condemned the use of the [[pillory]] for two men convicted for attempting to practice [[sodomy]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

This support for unpopular causes, notably free trade with Ireland and [[Catholic Emancipation]], led to Burke losing his [[Legislative seat|seat]] in 1780. For the remainder of his parliamentary career, Burke represented [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]], another pocket borough under the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]]'s patronage.

==American War of Independence==
Burke expressed his support for the grievances of the [[American Colonies]] under the government of [[King George III]] and his appointed representatives. On 19 April 1774 Burke made a speech, "[[On American Taxation]]" (published in January 1775), on a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to repeal the [[Tea Act|tea duty]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again and again, revert to your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, if she has taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor attempting to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 142–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 22 March 1775, in the House of Commons, Burke delivered a speech (published during May 1775) on reconciliation with America. Burke appealed for peace as preferable to civil war and reminded the House of America's growing population, its industry, and its wealth. He warned against the notion that the Americans would back down in the face of force, since most Americans were of British descent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen... They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles. The people are Protestants... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke prized peace with America above all else, pleading with the House of Commons to remember that the interest by way of money received from the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] was far more attractive than any sense of putting the [[colonist]]s in their place:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war, not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations, not peace to arise out of universal discord... it is simple peace, sought in its natural course and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke was not merely presenting a [[Peace treaty|peace agreement]] to Parliament; rather, he stepped forward with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned. He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in [[British America|Colonial America]] would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. "An armament", Burke said, "is not a victory".&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Edmund|title=Speech to Parliament on Reconciliation with the American Colonies|url=http://americainclass.org/sources/makingrevolution/war/text1/burkereconspeech.pdf|website=America in Class|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt; Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic—the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil.

It was not temporary force, uncertainty, impairment, or even experience that Burke cited as the number one reason for avoiding war with the American colonies, however; it was the character of the American people themselves: "In this character of Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole... this fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies, probably, than in any other people of the earth... [the] men [are] acute, inquisitive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defense, full of resources..."&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt; Burke concludes with another plea for peace, and a prayer that Britain might avoid actions which, in Burke's words, "may bring on the destruction of this Empire".&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt;

Burke proposed six resolutions to settle the American conflict peacefully:
# Allow the American colonists to elect their own representatives, thus settling the dispute about taxation without representation;
# Acknowledge this wrongdoing and apologise for grievances caused;
# Procure an efficient manner of choosing and sending these delegates;
# Set up a General Assembly in America itself, with powers to regulate taxes;
# Stop gathering taxes by imposition (or law), and start gathering them only when they are needed; and
# Grant needed aid to the colonies.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt;

The effect of these resolutions, had they been passed, can never be known. Unfortunately, Burke delivered this speech just less than a month before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexington and Concord|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/11c.asp|website=USHistory.org|publisher=Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict.

Among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]] (1684–1775); Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: "Young man, There is America—which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 384"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Johnson]] was so irritated at hearing it continually praised, that he made a parody of it, where the devil appears to a young Whig and predicts that in short time, [[Whiggism]] will poison even the paradise of America!&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 384" /&gt;

The administration of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] (1770–1782) tried to defeat the colonist rebellion by military force. British and American forces clashed in 1775 and, in 1776, came the [[American Declaration of Independence]]. Burke was appalled by celebrations in Britain of the defeat of the Americans at New York and Pennsylvania. He claimed the English national character was being changed by this authoritarianism.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Burke wrote: "As to the good people of England, they seem to partake every day more and more of the Character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate. I am satisfied, that within a few years there has been a great Change in the National Character. We seem no longer that eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery people, which we have been formerly".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Burke's view, the British Government was fighting "the American English" ("our English Brethren in the Colonies"), with a [[House of Hanover|Germanic king]] employing "the hireling sword of German boors and vassals" to destroy the English liberties of the colonists.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; On [[American independence]], Burke wrote: "I do not know how to wish success to those whose Victory is to separate from us a large and noble part of our Empire. Still less do I wish success to injustice, oppression and absurdity".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gordon Riots]] in 1780, Burke became a target of hostility and his home was placed under armed guard by the military.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert pp. 48–73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paymaster of the Forces==
[[File:Cincinnatus in retirement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In ''Cincinnatus in Retirement'' (1782), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Burke's support of rights for Catholics.]]

The fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power in March 1782. Burke was appointed [[Paymaster of the Forces]] and a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], but without a seat in Cabinet. Rockingham's unexpected death in July 1782 and replacement with Shelburne as Prime Minister, put an end to his administration after only a few months, however, Burke did manage to introduce two Acts.

The [[Paymaster General Act 1782]] ended the post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. This act was repealed by Shelburne's administration, but the act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 511 + n. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782]] was a watered down version of Burke's original intentions as outlined in his famous ''Speech on Economical Reform'' of 11 February 1780. He managed, however, to abolish 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The third [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] and the [[Board of Trade]] were abolished and pensions were limited and regulated. The Act was anticipated to save £72,368 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', pp. 511–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1783, Burke resumed the post of Paymaster of the Forces when Shelburne's government fell and was replaced by a coalition headed by North that included Charles James Fox. That coalition fell in 1783, and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of [[William Pitt the Younger]], which lasted until 1801. Accordingly, having supported Fox and North, Burke was in opposition for the remainder of his political life.

==Democracy==
In 1774, Burke's ''Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll'' was noted for its defence of the principles of [[Representation (politics)|representative]] government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume I'' (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), pp. 446–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political scientist [[Hanna Pitkin]] points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, "Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve."&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, ''The concept of representation'' (1972) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over [[Tyranny of the majority|unpopular minorities]], who needed the protection of the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hamburger, "Burke, Edmund" in Seymour Martin Lipset, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Democracy'' (Congressional Quarterly, 1995) 1:147–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==India and the impeachment of Warren Hastings==
{{main|Impeachment of Warren Hastings}}

For years Burke pursued impeachment efforts against [[Warren Hastings]], formerly Governor-General of Bengal, that resulted in the trial during 1786. His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Siraj Ahmed, "The Theater of the Civilized Self: Edmund Burke and the East India Trials". ''[[Representations]]'' 78 (2002): 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the [[East India Company]] when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke's primary concern. This committee was charged "to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirk, ''Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered'' (1988), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the [[Maharaja|Indian princes]] that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the East India Company should recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that "began 'in commerce' but 'ended in empire.'"&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth D. Samet, "A Prosecutor and a Gentleman: Edmund Burke's Idiom of Impeachment", ''[[ELH]]'' 68, no. 2 (2001): 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1785, Burke delivered a now-famous speech, ''The [[Nabob of Arcot]]'s Debts'', wherein he condemned the damage to [[India]] by the East India Company. In the province of the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]] the Indians had constructed a system of reservoirs to make the soil fertile in a naturally dry region, and centred their society on the husbandry of water:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own. These are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke held that the advent of British dominion, and in particular the conduct of the East India Company, had destroyed much that was good in these traditions and that, as a consequence of this, and the lack of new customs to replace them, the Indians were suffering. He set about establishing a set of British expectations, whose moral foundation would, in his opinion, warrant the empire.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 1786, Burke presented the Commons with the ''Article of Charge of [[High Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' against Hastings. The [[impeachment]] in Westminster Hall, which did not begin until 14 February 1788, would be the "first major public discursive event of its kind in England",&lt;ref&gt;Mithi Mukherjee, "Justice, War, and the Imperium: India and Britain in Edmund Burke's Prosecutorial Speeches", ''Law and History Review'' 23, no. 3 (2005): 589.&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the morality and duty of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke already was known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, ''Justice, War, and the Imperium'', 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781–1998'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2007), p. 35. {{ISBN|978-0-224-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Commons eventually [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|impeached Hastings]], but subsequently, the House of Lords acquitted him of all charges.

==French Revolution: 1688 versus 1789==
[[File:Smelling out a rat.jpg|thumb|''Smelling out a Rat;—or—The Atheistical-Revolutionist disturbed in his Midnight "Calculations"'' (1790) by Gillray, depicting a caricature of Burke holding a crown and a cross; the seated man, Dr. Richard Price, is writing "On the Benefits of Anarchy Regicide Atheism" beneath a picture of the execution of [[Charles I of England]].]]
[[File:BurkeReflections.jpg|thumb|''Reflections on the Revolution in France, And on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris. By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke.'']]

Initially, Burke did not condemn the [[French Revolution]]. In a letter of 9 August 1789, he wrote: "England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The events of 5–6 October 1789, when [[Women's March on Versailles|a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles]] to compel [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken "as no more than the expression of doubt" but he added: "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month he described France as "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the House had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in France. The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world. In that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground, their monarchy; their church; their nobility; their law; their revenue; their army; their navy; their commerce; their arts; and their manufactures... [there was a danger of] an imitation of the excesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious, bloody and tyrannical democracy... [in religion] the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but from Atheism; a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind; which seems in France, for a long time, to have been embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1790, Burke read Dr. [[Richard Price]]'s sermon of 4 November 1789 entitled, ''[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]'', to the [[Revolution Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/price/price_8.htm |title=A Discourse on the Love of our Country |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That society had been founded to commemorate the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. In this sermon Price espoused the philosophy of universal [[human rights|"Rights of Men"]]. Price argued that love of our country "does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Price asserted that Englishmen should see themselves "more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community".

A debate between Price and Burke ensued that was "the classic moment at which two fundamentally different conceptions of national identity were presented to the English public".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''English Society'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Price claimed that the principles of the Glorious Revolution included "the right to choose our own governors, to cashier them for misconduct, and to frame a government for ourselves".

Immediately after reading Price's sermon, Burke wrote a draft of what eventually became ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/241734 |title=The Genesis of Burke's Reflections |year=1978 |author=Dreyer, Frederick |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |volume=50|issue=3 |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 1790, a notice in the press said that shortly, Burke would publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its British supporters, however he spent the year revising and expanding it. On 1 November he finally published the ''Reflections'' and it was an immediate best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, but by the end of 1790, it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator, Pierre-Gaëton Dupont, wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold. The French translation ran to ten printings by June 1791.&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Lock, ''Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1985), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

What the Glorious Revolution had meant was as important to Burke and his contemporaries as it had been for the last one hundred years in British politics.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Reflections'', Burke argued against Price's interpretation of the Glorious Revolution and instead, gave a classic Whig defence of it.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 24–25, 34, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke argued against the idea of abstract, metaphysical rights of humans and instead advocated national tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The Revolution was made to preserve our ''antient'' indisputable laws and liberties, and that ''antient'' constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty... The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as ''an inheritance from our forefathers''. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon [scion] alien to the nature of the original plant... Our oldest reformation is that of [[Magna Carta|Magna Charta]]. You will see that Sir [[Edward Coke]], that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove that the ancient charter... were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom... In the famous law... called the ''[[Petition of Right]]'', the parliament says to the king, "Your subjects have ''inherited'' this freedom", claiming their franchises not on abstract principles "as the rights of men", but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 181–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke said  "We fear God, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is ''natural'' to be so affected".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is "the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages" and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. "Prejudice", Burke claimed, "is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised [[social contract]] theory by claiming that society is indeed, a contract, but "a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous passage in Burke's ''Reflections'' was his description of the events of 5–6 October 1789 and the part of [[Marie-Antoinette]] in them. Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 289–90.&lt;/ref&gt; His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. [[Philip Francis (politician)|Philip Francis]] wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was "pure foppery".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], however, reacted differently: "I adore his chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the [[Armand Louis de Gontaut|Duchesse de Biron]], that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cobban and Robert A. Smith (eds.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Price had rejoiced that the French king had been "led in triumph" during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XVI translated the ''Reflections'' "from end to end" into French.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 313–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Whig MPs [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] and [[Charles James Fox]], disagreed with Burke and split with him. Fox thought the ''Reflections'' to be "in very bad taste" and "favouring Tory principles".&lt;ref&gt;L. G. Mitchell, ''Charles James Fox'' (Penguin, 1997), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Whigs such as the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] and [[William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam|Earl Fitzwilliam]] privately agreed with Burke, but did not wish for a public breach with their Whig colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote on 29 November 1790: "I have received from the Duke of Portland, [[Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], the [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], [[Lord John Cavendish]], Montagu ([[Frederick Montagu]] MP), and a long et cetera of the old Stamina of the Whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution".&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke of Portland said in 1791 that when anyone criticised the ''Reflections'' to him, he informed them that he had recommended the book to his sons as containing the true Whig creed.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 161, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of [[Paul Langford]],&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Burke [[crossing the Rubicon|crossed something of a Rubicon]] when he attended a levee on 3 February 1791 to meet the king, later described by Jane Burke:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On his coming to Town for the Winter, as he generally does, he went to the Levee with the Duke of ''Portland'', who went with [[Lord William Bentinck|Lord William]] to [[Kissing hands|kiss hands]] on his going into the [[Coldstream Guards|Guards]]—while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, but his Eyes were fixed on [Burke] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for [Burke]'s coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of how long have you been in Town and the weather, He said you have been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [Burke] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see—[Burke] made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of ''use to us all'', it is a general opinion, is it not so [[John Dalrymple, 6th Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]]? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said [Burke]—I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke's ''Reflections'' sparked a [[Revolution Controversy|pamphlet war]]. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was one of the first into print, publishing ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' a few weeks after Burke. [[Thomas Paine]] followed with the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' in 1791. [[James Mackintosh]], who wrote ''Vindiciae Gallicae'', was the first to see the ''Reflections'' as "the manifesto of a Counter Revolution". Mackintosh later agreed with Burke's views, remarking in December 1796 after meeting him, that Burke was "minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relating to the French Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Mackintosh later said: "Burke was one of the first thinkers as well as one of the greatest orators of his time. He is without parallel in any age, excepting perhaps Lord Bacon and Cicero; and his works contain an ampler store of political and moral wisdom than can be found in any other writer whatever".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles James Fox00.jpg|thumb|[[Charles James Fox]]]]

In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the [[National Assembly of France]], wrote to Burke, praising ''Reflections'' and requesting more "very refreshing mental food" that he could publish.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 162–69.&lt;/ref&gt; This Burke did in April 1791 when he published ''A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly''. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed "a considerable insight into human nature" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–67 Burke was a friend of [[David Hume]], with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau "entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but ''vanity''"—which he "was possessed to a degree little short of madness". He also cited Rousseau's ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' as evidence that Rousseau had a life of "obscure and vulgar vices" that was not "chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: "a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 356–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox. In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was "overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and "the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man".&lt;ref name="McCue, p. 23"&gt;McCue, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Frank O'Gorman, ''The Whig Party and the French Revolution'' (Macmillan, 1967), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] and seconded by Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.

Burke's response was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It certainly was indiscreet at any period, but especially at his time of life, to parade enemies, or give his friends occasion to desert him; yet if his firm and steady adherence to the British constitution placed him in such a dilemma, he would risk all, and, as public duty and public experience taught him, with his last words exclaim, "Fly from the French Constitution".&lt;ref name="McCue, p. 23" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this point, Fox whispered that there was "no loss of friendship". "I regret to say there is", Burke replied, "I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend. There is something in the detested French constitution that envenoms every thing it touches".&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 329"&gt;Prior, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; This provoked a reply from Fox, yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered "unusually bitter sarcasms".&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 329" /&gt; This only aggravated the rupture between the two men. Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him.&lt;ref name="O'Gorman, p. 75"&gt;O'Gorman, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke was dismayed that some Whigs, instead of reaffirming the principles of the Whig Party he laid out in the ''Reflections'', had rejected them in favour of "French principles" and that they criticised Burke for abandoning Whig principles. Burke wanted to demonstrate his fidelity to Whig principles and feared that acquiescence to Fox and his followers would allow the Whig Party to become a vehicle for Jacobinism.

Burke knew that many members of the Whig Party did not share Fox's views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the French Revolution. Burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole Whig party "as tolerating, and by a toleration, countenancing those proceedings" so that he could "stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be...their sentiments".&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, on 3 August 1791 Burke published his ''Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs'', in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them, as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the Whig party.

Burke owned two copies of what has been called "that practical compendium of Whig political theory", ''The Tryal of Dr. [[Henry Sacheverell]]'' (1710).&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40"&gt;Clark, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote of the trial: "It rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a clear, authentic, recorded, declaration of their political tenets upon the subject of a great constitutional event like that of the [Glorious] Revolution".&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40" /&gt; Writing in the third person, Burke asserted in his ''Appeal'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;... that the foundations laid down by the Commons, on the trial of Doctor Sacheverel, for justifying the revolution of 1688, are the very same laid down in Mr. Burke's Reflections; that is to say,—a breach of the ''original contract'', implied and expressed in the constitution of this country, as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in King, Lords and Commons.—That the fundamental subversion of this antient constitution, by one of its parts, having been attempted, and in effect accomplished, justified the Revolution. That it was justified ''only'' upon the ''necessity'' of the case; as the ''only'' means left for the recovery of that ''antient'' constitution, formed by the ''original contract'' of the British state; as well as for the future preservation of the ''same'' government. These are the points to be proved.&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke then provided quotations from Paine's ''Rights of Man'' to demonstrate what the New Whigs believed. Burke's belief that Foxite principles corresponded to Paine's was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Burke denied that a majority of "the people" had, or ought to have, the final say in politics and alter society at their pleasure. People had rights, but also duties, and these duties were not voluntary. Also, the people could not overthrow morality derived from God.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Whig [[grandee]]s such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke's ''Appeal'', they wished he had used more moderate language. Fitzwilliam saw the ''Appeal'' as containing "the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset|Francis Basset]], a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: "...though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox &amp; from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386" /&gt; Burke sent a copy of the ''Appeal'' to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it "with great Satisfaction".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386" /&gt; Burke wrote of its reception: "Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice".&lt;ref name="O'Gorman, p. 75" /&gt; [[Charles Burney]] viewed it as "a most admirable book—the best &amp; most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen" but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 385–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, most of the Whigs sided with Burke and gave their support to Pitt's "conservative" government, which, in response to France's declaration of war against Britain, declared war on France's Revolutionary Government in 1793.

In December 1791, Burke sent Government ministers his ''Thoughts on French Affairs'' where he put forward three main points: no counter-revolution in France would come about by purely domestic causes; the longer the Revolutionary Government exists the stronger it becomes; and the Revolutionary Government's interest and aim is to disturb all of the other governments of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke, as a Whig, did not wish to see an [[absolute monarchy]] again in France after the extirpation of Jacobinism. Writing to an ''émigré'' in 1791, Burke expressed his views against a restoration of the ''ancien régime'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When such a complete convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, or in the Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness as well as other inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 479–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke delivered a speech on the debate of the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Bill]] on 28 December 1792. He supported the Bill as it would exclude "murderous atheists, who would pull down Church and state; religion and God; morality and happiness".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; The peroration included a reference to a French order for 3,000 daggers. Burke revealed a dagger he had concealed in his coat and threw it to the floor: "This is what you are to gain by an alliance with France". Burke picked up the dagger and continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When they smile, I see blood trickling down their faces; I see their insidious purposes; I see that the object of all their cajoling is—blood! I now warn my countrymen to beware of these execrable philosophers, whose only object it is to destroy every thing that is good here, and to establish immorality and murder by precept and example—'Hic niger est hunc tu Romane caveto' ['Such a man is evil; beware of him, Roman'. Horace, ''Satires'' I. 4. 85.].&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke supported the war against revolutionary France, seeing Britain as fighting on the side of the [[royalist]]s and ''émigres'' in a civil war, rather than fighting against the whole nation of France.&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also supported the [[War in the Vendée|royalist uprising]] in [[Vendée|La Vendée]], describing it on 4 November 1793 in a letter to [[William Windham]], as "the sole affair I have much heart in".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453" /&gt; Burke wrote to [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] on 7 October urging him to send reinforcements there, as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on Paris. Dundas did not follow Burke's advice, however.

Burke believed the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] was not taking the uprising seriously enough, a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the [[Charles X of France|Prince Charles of France]] (''S.A.R. le comte d'Artois''), dated 23 October, requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the Government. Burke was forced to reply on 6 November: "I am not in His Majesty's Service; or at all consulted in his Affairs".&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke published his ''Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France'', begun in October, where he said: "I am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners. La Vendée is a proof of this".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume VII'' (F. C. and J. Rivington, 1815), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son [[Richard Burke Jr.|Richard]]. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for [[Catholic emancipation]]). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him [[Earl of Beaconsfield]], but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and the [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale|Earl of Lauderdale]], to whom Burke replied in his ''Letter to a Noble Lord'' (1796):&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; "It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, ''To innovate is not to reform''".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''A Letter from The Right Honourable Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord, on the Attacks made upon him and his pension, in the House of Lords, by The Duke of Bedford and The Earl of Lauderdale, Early in the present Sessions of Parliament.'' (F. and C. Rivington, 1796), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: "Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But as to ''our'' country and ''our'' race, as long as the well compacted structure of our church and state, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress at once and a temple, shall stand inviolate on the brow of the British Sion—as long as the British Monarchy, not more limited than fenced by the orders of the State, shall, like the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers, as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land—so long as the mounds and dykes of the low, fat, Bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of France.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke's last publications were the ''[[Letters on a Regicide Peace]]'' (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as [[appeasement]], injurious to national dignity and honour.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 439–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Second Letter'', Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary Government: "Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects—dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Blakemore, 'Burke and the Revolution: Bicentennial Reflections', in Blakemore (ed.), ''Burke and the French Revolution. Bicentennial Essays'' (The [[University of Georgia Press]], 1992), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is held to be the first explanation of the modern concept of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke regarded the war with France as ideological, against an "armed doctrine". He wished that France would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in Europe, and that the war was not against France, but against the revolutionaries governing her.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 443–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke said: "It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning with the conquest of France".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Later life==
In November 1795, there was a debate in Parliament on the high price of corn and Burke wrote a memorandum to Pitt on the subject. In December [[Samuel Whitbread (1764–1815)|Samuel Whitbread]] MP introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and Fox said he would vote for it. This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the [[Board of Agriculture (1793–1822)|Board of Agriculture]], [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]; but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as, ''[[Thoughts and Details on Scarcity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eccleshall, ''English Conservatism since the Restoration'' (London: Unwin Hyman, 1990), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Burke expounded "some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages, and set out what the limits of government should be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the State ought to confine itself to what regards the State, or the creatures of the State, namely, the exterior establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing that is ''truly and properly'' public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The economist [[Adam Smith]] remarked that Burke was "the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do, without any previous communications having passed between us".&lt;ref&gt;E. G. West, ''Adam Smith'' (New York: Arlington House, 1969), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing to a friend in May 1795, Burke surveyed the causes of discontent: "I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency, as they affect Ireland; or of Indianism [i.e. corporate tyranny, as practiced by the British East Indies Company], as they affect these countries, and as they affect Asia; or of Jacobinism, as they affect all Europe, and the state of human society itself. The last is the greatest evil".&lt;ref&gt;R. B. McDowell (ed.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1796, however Burke had changed his mind: "Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism, and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all ''formal'' Government".&lt;ref&gt;McDowell (ed.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'', p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than a year prior to his death, Burke knew that his 'stomach' was "irrecoverably ruind".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; After hearing that Burke was nearing death, Fox wrote to Mrs. Burke enquiring after him. Fox received the reply the next day:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs. Burke presents her compliments to Mr. Fox, and thanks him for his obliging inquiries. Mrs. Burke communicated his letter to Mr. Burke, and by his desire has to inform Mr. Fox that it has cost Mr. Burke the most heart-felt pain to obey the stern voice of his duty in rending asunder a long friendship, but that he deemed this sacrifice necessary; that his principles continue the same; and that in whatever of life may yet remain to him, he conceives that he must live for others and not for himself. Mr. Burke is convinced that the principles which he has endeavoured to maintain are necessary to the welfare and dignity of his country, and that these principles can be enforced only by the general persuasion of his sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke died in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, on 9 July 1797,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Cavendish |first=Richard |date=1997-07-07 |title=Edmund Burke, Political Writer and Philosopher Dies  |url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/edmund-burke-political-writer-and-philosopher-dies |magazine=History Today |volume=47 |issue=7 |access-date=2018-07-07 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried there alongside his son and brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|12496191|Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife survived him by nearly fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, Burke.

Burke believed that property was essential to human life. Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence. As [[Christopher Hitchens]] summarises, "If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=Reactionary Prophet|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/04/reactionary-prophet/302914/?single_page=true|website=www.theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's support for Irish Catholics and Indians often led him to be criticised by [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Sack, ''From Jacobite to Conservative. Reaction and orthodoxy in Britain, c. 1760–1832'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to British imperialism in Ireland and India and his opposition to French imperialism and radicalism in Europe, made it difficult for Whig or Tory to accept Burke wholly as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century Burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives. Burke's friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke "was a man who truly &amp; prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles" but because Burke wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, 'The ''Reflections'' refracted: the critical reception of Burke's ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' during the early 1790s', in John Whale (ed.), ''Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. New interdisciplinary essays'' ([[Manchester University Press]], 2000), p. 55, n. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had, when he had separated from Fox, and an observer said Windham spoke "like the ghost of Burke" when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Harvey, ''Britain in the early nineteenth century'' (B T Batsford Ltd, 1978), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hazlitt]], a political opponent of Burke, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau), and made it "a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke to be a great man".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in 'A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff' (1793), but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke. In his ''Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland'' Wordsworth called Burke "the most sagacious Politician of his age" whose predictions "time has verified".&lt;ref name="Lock, p. 173"&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; He later revised his poem ''[[The Prelude]]'' to include praise of Burke ("Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders") and portrayed him as an old oak.&lt;ref name="Lock, p. 173" /&gt; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] came to have a similar conversion: he had criticised Burke in ''[[The Watchman (periodical)|The Watchman]]'', but in his ''Friend'' (1809–10) Coleridge defended Burke from charges of inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', pp. 173–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'' (1817) Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring "habitually to ''principles''. He was a ''scientific'' statesman; and therefore a ''seer''".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] wrote of Burke: "... all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity".&lt;ref name="Claeys, p. 50"&gt;Claeys, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Canning]] believed that Burke's ''Reflections'' "has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled".&lt;ref name="Claeys, p. 50" /&gt; In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Burke's "last works and words [as] the manual of my politics".&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Stapleton (ed.), ''Some Official Correspondence of George Canning. Volume I'' (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1887), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] "was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's later writings".&lt;ref&gt;William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, ''The Life of Benjamin Disraeli. Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume I. 1804–1859'' (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] considered Burke "a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America" and in his diary recorded: "Made many extracts from Burke—''sometimes almost divine''".&lt;ref&gt;John Morley, ''The Life of William Ewart Gladstone. Volume III (1880–1898)'' (London: Macmillan, 1903), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The Radical MP and anti-[[Corn Law]] activist [[Richard Cobden]] often praised Burke's ''Thoughts and Details on Scarcity''.&lt;ref&gt;John Morley, ''The Life of Richard Cobden'' (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1905), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Paul (ed.), ''Letters of Lord Acton to Mary Gladstone'' (Macmillan, 1914), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: "I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since [[John Milton|Milton]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Trevelyan, ''The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay. Volume II'' (London: Longmans, 1876), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gladstonian Liberal MP [[John Morley]] published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Hamer, ''John Morley. Liberal Intellectual in Politics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cobdenite Radical [[Francis Wrigley Hirst|Francis Hirst]] thought Burke deserved "a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site".&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Hirst, ''Liberty and Tyranny'' (London: Duckworth, 1935), pp. 105–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a [[manifesto]] for Conservative thinking.

Two contrasting assessments of Burke also were offered long after his death by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sycophant—who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the romantic ''laudator temporis acti'' against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of the North American colonies at the beginning of the American troubles, he had played the liberal against the English oligarchy—was an out-and-out vulgar [[bourgeois]]. "The laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God." (E. Burke, l.c., pp. 31, 32) No wonder that, true to the laws of God and Nature, he always sold himself in the best market.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Winston Churchill, in ''Consistency in Politics'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the one hand [Burke] is revealed as a foremost apostle of Liberty, on the other as the redoubtable champion of Authority. But a charge of political inconsistency applied to this life appears a mean and petty thing. History easily discerns the reasons and forces which actuated him, and the immense changes in the problems he was facing which evoked from the same profound mind and sincere spirit these entirely contrary manifestations. His soul revolted against tyranny, whether it appeared in the aspect of a domineering Monarch and a corrupt Court and Parliamentary system, or whether, mouthing the watch-words of a non-existent liberty, it towered up against him in the dictation of a brutal mob and wicked sect. No one can read the Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority without feeling that here was the same man pursuing the same ends, seeking the same ideals of society and Government, and defending them from assaults, now from one extreme, now from the other.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian [[Piers Brendon]] asserts that Burke laid the moral foundations for the [[British Empire]], epitomised in the trial of [[Warren Hastings]], that was ultimately to be its undoing: when Burke stated that "The British Empire must be governed on a plan of freedom, for it will be governed by no other",&lt;ref&gt;K. Brittlebank, ''Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy'' (Delhi, 1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; this was "...an ideological bacillus that would prove fatal. This was Edmund Burke's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust. It was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright—freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Brendon, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this opinion, Burke objected to the opium trade, which he called a "smuggling adventure" and condemned "the great Disgrace of the British character in India".&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Whelan, ''Edmund Burke and India'' (Pittsburgh, 1996), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Royal Society of Arts]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Burke at [[Gerrard Street, London|37 Gerrard Street]] now in [[Chinatown, London|London's Chinatown]].&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/burke-edmund-1729-1797|title=BURKE, EDMUND (1729–1797)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Edmund Burke==
One of Burke's largest and most developed critics was [[Leo Strauss]], who was thoroughly analyzed by Steven Lenzner. Strauss in his book ''Natural Right and History'' makes a series of points in which he somewhat harshly evaluates Burke's writings.

One of the topics that he first addresses is the fact that Burke creates a definitive separation between happiness and virtue, and explains that "Burke, therefore, seeks the foundation of government 'in a conformity to our duties' and not in 'imaginary rights of man"&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Leo|title=Natural Right and History|publisher=University of Chicago Publication|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo3643753.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenzner|first1=Steven|title=Strauss's Three Burkes: The Problem of Edmund Burke in Natural Right and History|jstor=191417|publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Strauss views Burke as believing that government should focus solely on the duties that a man should have in society as opposed to trying to address any additional needs or desires. Government is simply a practicality to Burke, and not necessarily meant to function as a tool to help individuals live their best lives. Strauss also argues that in a sense, Burke's theory could be seen as opposing the very idea of forming such philosophies. Burke expresses the view that theory cannot adequately predict future occurrences, and thus, men need to have instincts that can't be practiced or derived from ideology.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt;

This leads to an overarching criticism that Strauss holds regarding Burke, which is his rejection of the use of logic. Burke dismisses a widely held view amongst theorists that reason should be the primary tool in the forming of a constitution or contract.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; Burke instead believes that constitutions should be made based on 'natural processes' as opposed to rational planning for the future. Strauss points out, however, that criticising rationality actually works against Burke's original stance of returning to traditional ways because some amount human reason is inherent, and therefore is in part grounded in tradition.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; In regards to this formation of legitimate social order, Strauss does not necessarily support Burke's opinion— that order cannot be established by individual wise people, but exclusively by a culmination of individuals with historical knowledge of past functions to use as a foundation.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; Strauss notes that Burke would oppose more newly formed republics due to this thought,&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; although Lenzner adds the fact that he did seem to believe that America's constitution could be justified given the specific circumstances.&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; France's constitution, on the other hand, was much too radical as it relied too heavily on enlightened reasoning as opposed to traditional methods and values.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==Religious thought of Edmund Burke==
{{main|Religious thought of Edmund Burke}}
Burke's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion. Burke's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1964), 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Harris, "Burke and Religion," in David Dwan and Christopher J Insole eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Edmund Burke'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns.&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt; He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity's benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to political arrangements.&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;Harris, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==False quotations==
===When good men do nothing===
The statement that "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" is often attributed to Burke despite the debated origin of this quote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bromwich|title=The Intellectual Life of Edmund Burke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wWMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175|year=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=175–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Garson|title=The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/12/04/good-men-do/|website=Quote Investigator|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, however, it is known that in "[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]", Burke wrote that:
{{quote|…when bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrGAIvlkf-sC&amp;pg=PR13 |year=1990 |title=Edmund Burke: appraisals and applications |isbn=978-0-88738-328-1 |author=Daniel Ritchie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbouAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA106| title=Thoughts on the cause of the present discontents |year=1770 |author=Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Stuart Mill]] later made a similar statement in an inaugural address delivered before the University of St. Andrews during 1867:
{{quote|Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DFNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 ''Inaugural Address Delivered to the University of St. Andrews, Feb. 1st 1867'' (1867)], p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Those who don't know history===
Burke is sometimes credited with [[George Santayana]]'s quote: "Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it", but scholars have not found any reliable evidence indicating that Burke actually spoke (or wrote) those words.&lt;ref&gt;It is not among the 67 authentic Burke quotes in ''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">[[Albert Einstein]], in searching for the [[transformation group]] for his [[unified field theory]], wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every attempt to establish a unified field theory must start, in my opinion, from a group of transformations which is no less general than that of the continuous transformations of the four coordinates.  For we should hardly be successful in looking for the subsequent enlargement of the group for a theory based on a narrower group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |first2= E. G. |last2=Straus |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~mxv091000/Einstein-Straus-46.pdf |title=A Generalization of the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation |journal=Annals of Mathematics |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=October 1945 |pp=578&amp;ndash;584 |doi=10.2307/1969197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- the following paragraph appears to be non-sense --&gt;

==The Poincaré group==

The [[Poincaré group]], the transformation group of [[special relativity]], being [[orthogonal]], the inverse of a transformation equals its transpose, introducing [[discrete reflections]]. This, in turn, violates Einstein's dictum for a group "no less general than that of the continuous transformations of the four coordinates."  Specifically, any pair of Euler angles ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;minus;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are not independent, nor are any pair of boosts ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''c'' and &amp;minus;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''c''.  Available parameters are thus reduced, from the 16 needed to express all transformations in a curved spacetime, per the general [[principle of relativity]], ∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&amp;prime;&lt;/sup&gt;/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;, to the 10 of the Poincaré group.

==The Einstein group==

[[Mendel Sachs]], in the 1960s, found the transformation group that Einstein had sought, the "Einstein" group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Most General Form of a Field Theory from Symmetry Principles|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v226/n5241/abs/226138a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1970-04-11|pages = 138–139|volume = 226|issue = 5241|doi = 10.1038/226138a0|first = Mendel|last = Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Einstein group can be obtained by factorizing the squared spacetime invariant interval

: ''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;mu;&amp;nu;''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;mu;''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;nu;''&lt;/sup&gt;

into a [[quaternion]]-valued form and its conjugate, ''ds''&amp;nbsp;''ds*'', where

: ''ds'' = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;mu;''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;mu;''&lt;/sup&gt;

and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is a [[four-vector]] of [[Hermitian]] [[quaternions]].

Note that the Einstein group approaches—but never reaches—the Poincare group as the flat spacetime ([[special relativity]] limit) is approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sachs | first = Mendel | year = 2010 | title = Physics of the Universe | publisher = Imperial College Press, London | ISBN = 978-1-84816-532-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Entertainment Software Rating Board''' ('''ESRB''') is an American [[self-regulatory organization]] that assigns [[Video game content rating system|age and content ratings]] to consumer [[video game]]s. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of [[video game controversy|controversial video games]] with excessively violent or [[Sex and nudity in video games|sexual content]].

The board assigns [[Content rating|ratings]] to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the [[motion picture rating system]]s used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of "content descriptors" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB maintains a [[ethics code|code of ethics]] for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences. In 2011, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and [[mobile app]]s, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff. Through the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] (IARC), this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides certification services for [[online privacy]] on websites and mobile apps.

The ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American [[video game industry|video game]] and retail industries; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB's highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major [[console manufacturer]]s will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only. The ESRB ratings system is not enforced under federal laws in any of the countries where it is actively used, although it is enforced under provincial laws in some regions of Canada.

Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for being the "strongest" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other [[watchdog group]]s for the structure of its operations, particularly in the wake of a 2005 [[Hot Coffee mod|incident]] that surrounded the organization's handling of "hidden", objectionable content in a [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|game]] which could be accessed using a [[Game mod|user-created modification]].

Critics of the ESRB have asserted that the organization has a [[conflict of interest]] because of its [[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]] in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.

== History ==

===Background===
Video games with objectionable content date back as far as 1976; the arcade game ''[[Death Race (video game)|Death Race]]'' required users to run over "[[gremlin]]s" with a vehicle and avoid the [[gravestone]]s they leave behind. Although its graphics were relatively primitive, the game's overall theme and the sound effects made when gremlins were killed were considered disturbing by players, prompting media attention.&lt;ref name="sn-controversal"/&gt; A developer known as [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] became known for making sexually explicit [[adult video game]]s for the [[Atari 2600]] console, but garnered the most attention with its controversial 1982 game ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', which infamously featured a crude simulation of the [[rape]] of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] woman. [[Atari]] received numerous complaints about the game, and responded by trying to sue the game's makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml | title=Gamespy's Top Ten Shameful Games | publisher=IGN Entertainment | work=GameSpy | accessdate=November 17, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426012823/http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml | archivedate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Phoenix: The Fall &amp; Rise of Video Games | last=Herman | first=Leonard | year=1997 | page=88 | isbn=0964384825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[North American video game crash of 1983|1983 industry crash]], caused by the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted a higher degree of [[Closed platform|regulation]] by future console manufacturers: when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) was launched in the [[United States]] in 1985, [[Nintendo of America]] instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a [[10NES|lockout chip]] to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-nintendobanned"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo: Banned in the USA|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-banned-in-the-usa/|work=GamesRadar|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/06/7076-2/ | title=ESRB to game firms: lying will cost one million dollars | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 1987 about the suitability of a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film-like rating system]] for video games, a representative of the [[Software Publishers Association]] said that "Adult computer software is nothing to worry about. It's not an issue that the government wants to spend any time with ... They just got done with [[Parents Music Resource Center|a big witchhunt in the music recording industry]], and they got absolutely nowhere". The association did recommend voluntary warnings for games like ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name="CGW"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date= January 1988|last=Williams|first=John|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Goodbye "G" Ratings: The Perils of "Larry"|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&amp;pub=2&amp;id=43 |pages = 48–49|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation and early years ===
Video games' progression into the 1990s brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities, and the ability to use [[full-motion video]] (FMV) content in games. In the [[United States Senate]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] of [[Connecticut]] and [[Herb Kohl]] of [[Wisconsin]] led [[1993 Congressional hearings on video games|hearings on video game violence]] and the corruption of society which began in 1992. Two games of this era were specifically cited in the hearings for their content; the [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' featured realistic, digitized sprites of live-action actors, blood, and the ability to use violent "[[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|fatality]]" moves to defeat opponents, while ''[[Night Trap]]'' featured 90 minutes of FMV content, with scenes that were considered to be sexually suggestive and [[Sexual exploitation|exploitive]].&lt;ref name="sn-controversal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rogues Gallery: Controversial Video Games|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/38876/the-rogues-gallery-controversial-video|work=ShackNews|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inappropriate Content: A Brief History of Videogame Ratings and the ESRB|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/the-needles/1300-Inappropriate-Content-A-Brief-History-of-Videogame-Ratings-and-the-ESRB|work=The Escapist|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]] had differing views on objectionable content in video games; a port of ''Mortal Kombat'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was censored to remove the game's overly violent content, whereas the port for Sega consoles retained much of this content, which helped increase sales.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-nintendobanned"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-worstcoinop"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2006/06/28/top-10-tuesday-worst-coin-op-conversions | title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Coin-op Conversions | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=June 27, 2006 | accessdate=March 18, 2014 | last=Harris | first=Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sega had implemented its own voluntary ratings system, the [[Videogame Rating Council]] (VRC), largely to rate games released for its own consoles. ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''Night Trap'' were rated "MA-13" and "MA-17" on Sega's scale respectively. During the hearings, [[Howard Lincoln]] and Bill White (chairmen of Nintendo and Sega's U.S. divisions respectively) attacked each other's stances on objectionable content in video games; Lincoln condemned Sega for even releasing ''Night Trap'' and felt it "simply has no place in our society", while White argued that Sega was more responsible to consumers because they actually had a rating system in place, rather than a blanket presumption that all its games would be suitable for general audiences.&lt;ref name="Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29"/&gt; Fragmentation would also develop in the classification of games; [[The 3DO Company]] created their own age-based rating system, the [[3DO Rating System]], for games released on its [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform, and the [[Recreational Software Advisory Council]] (RSAC) was formed for rating PC games, which used a system that rated the intensity of specific classes of objectionable content, but did not use age recommendations. However, Lieberman did not believe that these systems were sufficient, and in February 1994, threatened to propose the creation of a federal commission for regulating and rating video games.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"/&gt;

With the threat of federal regulations, a group of major video game developers and publishers, including [[Acclaim Entertainment]] and [[Electronic Arts]] along with Nintendo and Sega, formed a political trade group known as the [[Entertainment Software Association|Interactive Digital Software Association]] in April 1994, with a goal to create a self-regulatory framework for assessing and rating video games. While Sega had proposed that the industry use its VRC rating system, Nintendo representatives objected to the idea because they did not want to associate themselves with the work of their main competitor; instead, a vendor-neutral rating system known as the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was developed. The formation of the ESRB was officially announced to Congress on July 29, 1994. The ESRB was officially launched on September 16, 1994; its system consisted of five age-based ratings; "Early Childhood", "Kids to Adults" (later renamed "Everyone" in 1998), "Teen", "Mature", and "Adults Only". The ESRB would also use "descriptors" with brief explanations of the content contained in a game.&lt;ref name="Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Kohler |title=July 29, 1994: Videogame Makers Propose Ratings Board to Congress |date=July 29, 2009 |work=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/07/dayintech_0729/ |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/news.aspx|title=Press releases and announcements from ESRB|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. arcade gaming industry did not adopt the ESRB system, with the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) having cited "fundamental differences between the coin-operated and consumer segments of the video game industry" as reasoning. The AAMA, the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association, and the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry, adopted their own three-tier "Parental Advisory System" in 1994, which uses three color-coded levels of content intensity (designated by green, yellow, and red stickers affixed to arcade cabinet artwork).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://coin-op.org/pas-frequently-asked-questions/|title=PAS - Frequently Asked Questions|work=AAMA - American Amusement Machine Association|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theater-group-to-impose-ratings-on-arcade-games/1100-6075491/|title=Theater group to impose ratings on arcade games|last=Layton|first=Thomas|date=2003-09-19|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion and recent developments ===
Alongside its efforts to classify video games, the ESRB also formed a division known as Entertainment Software Rating Board Interactive (ESRBi), which rated internet content using a similar system to its video game ratings. ESRBi also notably partnered with the [[internet service provider]] [[America Online]] to integrate these ratings into its existing [[parental controls]].&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vchip-debate"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Monroe E.|title=The V-chip debate: content filtering from television to the Internet|year=1998|isbn=1136684328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copa-speech"&gt;{{cite web|title=TESTIMONY OF DR.

In 2002, Dr. Arthur Pober, the original president of the ESRB, stepped down so he could focus on academics. In November 2002, he was formally replaced by Patrica Vance, who formerly worked for [[The Princeton Review]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref name="lat-strategy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Strategy for Parents: Use Ratings, Be Informed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/26/news/tt-42068|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=April 13, 2014|first=Jinny|last=Gudmundsen|date=October 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-newpresident"&gt;{{cite web|title=New President Named To ESRB|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/92492/New_President_Named_To_ESRB.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the ESRB introduced a new rating, "Everyone 10+", designating games with content of a relatively higher impact than those of games rated "Everyone", but still not high enough to garner a "Teen" rating.&lt;ref name="ftc-ratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-e10plus"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Introduces E10+ Game Rating|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2005/03/02/esrb-introduces-e10-game-rating|work=IGN|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the growth of [[smartphone]] use, in November 2011, [[CTIA – The Wireless Association|CTIA]], a group of major U.S. companies representing the wireless industry, and ESRB announced the co-development of a free, voluntary ratings process for [[Mobile app|mobile]] [[app store]]s. The system uses ESRB's icons and content descriptors, along with four additional "Interactive Elements" ("Digital Purchases", "Shares Info," "Shares Location," and "Users Interact") to inform users of an app's behavior in regards to data collection and interactions with others. [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[T-Mobile US]] were among the first to implement the system for their own application storefronts, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Phone Store|Windows Phone Marketplace]] already supported ESRB ratings upon its introduction.&lt;ref name="cnet-kneecap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ctia-appratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB, CTIA Detail Voluntary Mobile App Rating System|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/128390/ESRB_CTIA_Detail_Voluntary_Mobile_App_Rating_System.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku-esrblootboxes"/&gt; ESRB president Patricia Vance explained that the partnership was intended to help broaden the ESRB's reach into the mobile market, and that "consumers, especially parents, benefit from having a consistently applied set of ratings for games rather than a fragmented array of different systems."&lt;ref name="poylgon-iconupdate"/&gt;

In November 2012, the ESRB and other video game ratings boards, including [[PEGI]], the [[Australian Classification Board]], and [[USK]] among others, established a consortium known as the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] (IARC). The group sought to design an online, questionnaire-based rating process for digitally-distributed video games that could generate ratings for multiple video game ratings organizations at once. The resulting ratings information is tied to a unique code, which can then be used by online storefronts to display the corresponding rating for the user's region.&lt;ref name="ign-ausiarc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting Digitally-Distributed Games Classified in Australia to Be Cost-Free|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free|website=IGN.com|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-consistency"&gt;{{cite news|title=Game Makers Push to Make Ratings Consistent Across All Platforms|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324595904578117484171808510|accessdate=March 17, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three major console makers, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have all committed to supporting IARC for their digital storefronts, including ESRB ratings for North American markets.&lt;ref name="gibiz iarc consoles"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-03-17-esrb-expanding-to-mobile-digital-platforms | title = ESRB expanding to mobile, digital platforms | first = James | last = Brightman | date = March 17, 2015 | accessdate = November 27, 2017 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Play Store]] was updated in March 2015 to adopt and display ESRB ratings for apps in North America through IARC.&lt;ref name="verge-googleplayesrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Play adopts industry standard for age ratings on mobile games|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8231207/google-play-esrb-iarc-game-ratings|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Store]] also implemented IARC in January 2016.&lt;ref name="gibiz-iarcwindows"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows Store adopts IARC rating system|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-01-07-windows-store-adopts-iarc-rating-system|website=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS App Store|App Store]] still uses its own generic age rating system and does not use the ESRB or IARC systems.&lt;ref name="cnet-kneecap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple, Google kneecap 'universal' content rating for apps|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57332972-94/apple-google-kneecap-universal-content-rating-for-apps/|work=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc-ctiaapps"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/29/ctia-and-esrb-debuts-app-rating-system-no-buy-in-from-google-or-apple/ | title=CTIA And ESRB Debut App Rating System, No Buy-In From Google Or Apple | publisher=[[AOL]] | work=TechCrunch | accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating process==
To obtain a rating for a game, a publisher submits a detailed questionnaire and a DVD containing footage of the most graphic and extreme content found in the game to the ESRB, including content related to the game's context, storyline, reward system, unlockable and otherwise "hidden" content, and other elements that may affect its rating. They may also provide printed copies of the game's script and lyrics from songs in the game. The footage is reviewed by a team of at least three raters, who discuss what the most appropriate and "helpful" rating for the game would be, based on the footage and details provided. Raters represent various demographics, including parents, along with [[Gamer|casual and "hardcore" gamers]]. Raters were formerly hired on a part-time basis, but in 2007, ESRB transitioned to a team of seven full-time raters, who all live in the [[New York City]] area.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gs-fulltime"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/esrb-hiring-full-time-raters/1100-6166197/ | title=ESRB hiring full-time raters | publisher=[[CNET Networks]] | work=GameSpot | accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gi-ratingsgame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-notyetrated"&gt;{{cite web|title=This Game Is Not Yet Rated: Inside The ESRB Ratings System|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130387/this_game_is_not_yet_rated_inside_.php?|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-changes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/09/5311-2/ | title=ESRB makes changes in wake of Hot Coffee | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"/&gt;

If a publisher does not agree with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|The Punisher]]'' was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating.&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"/&gt; There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-notyetrated"/&gt;

When the game is ready for release, the publisher sends copies of the final version of the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are [[Game testing|play tested]] for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs about ESRB|url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place [[news embargo|embargoes]] on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/esrb-reins-premature-game-leaks/ | title=ESRB Reins In Premature Game Leaks | publisher=Future Publishing | work=Edge | date=June 19, 2008 | accessdate=March 18, 2014 | last=Graft | first=Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the ESRB introduced its Short Form, a free streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable games as a way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product (the Long Form), publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for [[mobile app]]s.&lt;ref name="ctia-appratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-googleplayesrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-busyjob"&gt;{{cite news|title=Busy Job of Judging Video-Game Content to Be Ceded to Machines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/arts/video-games/video-games-rating-board-questionnaire.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 19, 2014|first=Seth|last=Schiesel|date=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB planned to phase out the Short Form for digital-only games, instead directing those developers and publishers to use the similar free questionnaire-driven IARC program, which was being adopted beyond mobile app stores, including the Nintendo eShop and PlayStation Store, as a requirement for posting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/67069/esrb-confirms-digital-games-will-still-get-free-ratings/ | title = ESRB confirms digital games will still get free ratings | first = Natalie | last = Clayton | date = May 18, 2018 | accessdate = May 18, 2018 | work = [[PC Games Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to concerns from Sony on the growing number of indie game titles that were receiving physical releases alongside retail ones, the ESRB began instituting new rules around August 2017 that any retail product was mandated to undergo the standard Long Form review for the game, disallowing the use of the Short Form for such titles. Alongside this, ESRB introduced a "value tier" for the Long Form review process for games developed at lower budgets (under $1 million), with a cost of $3000 for obtaining the retail rating. This decision has impacted the choice of several boutique indie game publishers, who have either cancelled plans for retail versions or had to stop selling retail versions to comply with the new ESRB rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/new-rating-requirement-makes-life-harder-for-smaller-ga-1820296023 | title = New Rating Requirement Makes Life Harder For Smaller Game Publishers | first= Ethan | last= Gach | date = November 9, 2017 | accessdate = November 10, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|right|160px|A typical ESRB rating label, listing the rating and specific content descriptors for ''[[Rabbids Go Home]]''.]]

ESRB ratings are primarily identified through icons, which are displayed on the packaging and promotional materials for a game. Each icon contains a stylized alphabetical letter representing the rating.  In addition to the main age-based, ratings, ESRB ratings also incorporate one or more of 30 "content descriptors" which provide detailed information about the specific types and levels of objectionable content contained in a game, including categories covering different levels of [[violence]], language, [[Sex and nudity in video games|sexual content]], [[Sex and nudity in video games|nudity]], use of [[alcoholic beverage]]s or other [[drug]]s, crude and mature humor, or [[gambling]]. The full label, containing both the descriptors and rating, are typically displayed on the back of a game's packaging.&lt;ref name="ftc-ratings"/&gt;

Games which incorporate [[online game|online]] features must display the additional notice "Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB" (previously "Game Experience May Change During Online Play"), which disclaims that the rating only applies to the content contained within the game itself, and does not cover any [[user-generated content]] available within.&lt;ref name="escapist-op"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obsolescence Pending: Rating the ESRB|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_223/6647-Obsolescence-Pending-Rating-the-ESRB|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=The Escapist|date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist-didnotbreak"&gt;{{cite web|title="Boobies Did Not Break the Game": The ESRB Clears the Air On Oblivion|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/op-ed/797-Boobies-Did-Not-Break-the-Game-The-ESRB-Clears-the-Air-On-Oblivi|website=The Escapist|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games that provide post-release [[downloadable content]] must have ensure that the new content remains consistent with the original ESRB rating; otherwise the ESRB requires that the original game be re-evaluated and remarked with the more appropriate rating in considering this new content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2008/04/esrb-dlc-must-m/ | title = ESRB: Downloadable Content Must Maintain Original Rating | first = Earnest | last = Cavalli | date = April 17, 2008  | accessdate = November 27, 2017 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings information also disclaims if a game offers digital goods or other premiums (including downloadable content, [[microtransaction]]s, and "[[loot boxes]]") that require payment of real money to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/new-video-game-label-will-be-required-for-in-game-purchases/|title=ESRB mandating new label for games with microtransactions|date=2018-02-27|work=CNET|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the ratings icons themselves have been updated several times; originally carrying a stylized, pixelated look, they were first updated in 1999 to carry a cleaner appearance. In August 2013, the rating icons were streamlined again; the textual name of the rating became black text on white, the "content rated by" tagline was removed, and [[registered trademark symbol]]s were moved to the bottom-right corner. The changes were intended to increase the icons' clarity at smaller sizes (such as on mobile devices), reflecting the growth in the digital distribution of video games.&lt;ref name="poylgon-iconupdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/2/4580328/esrb-tweaks-rating-icons-digital-mobile-future-patricia-vance-interview | title=ESRB tweaks rating icons for digital and mobile future | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=Polygon | accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{see also|List of AO-rated video games}}
Games with this rating contain content which the ESRB believes is only suitable for those aged 18 years and older; they contain content with an impact higher than the "Mature" rating can accommodate, such as strong sexual themes and content, graphic nudity, extreme portrayals of violence, or unsimulated gambling with real currency. The majority of AO-rated titles are pornographic [[adult video game]]s; the ESRB has seldom issued the AO rating solely for violence.&lt;ref name="ftc-ratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-notyetrated" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ftc-interactions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet-sonysaysno"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20006844-17.html | title=Vivid: Sony said no to PS3 porn streaming | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | work=CNET | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6172830.html | title=Sony, Nintendo refuse to allow AO rated games on their consoles | publisher=CNET Networks | work=GameSpot | date=June 20, 2007 | accessdate=January 12, 2011 | last=Sinclair | first=Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
The ESRB rating system is primarily enforced on a [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulatory]] basis by the [[Video game industry|video game]] and [[Retail industry|retail industries]]; in markets where it is used, retailers typically enforce the "Mature" rating using [[photo identification]], and refuse to stock video games that have not been rated by the organization, or are rated "Adults Only".&lt;ref name="ars-housebill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-esrblaw"/&gt; Modern [[video game console]]s may also include [[parental controls]] that can be configured to restrict games played by specific users, using factors such as their ESRB rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0270-kids-parents-and-video-games#controls|title=Kids, Parents, and Video Games|date=2012-06-26|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/video-games-how-to-setup-parental-controls-version-1431990207/|title=Gaming with guidance: How to set up parental controls on modern consoles, handhelds, and computers|date=2017-05-09|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB has also taken action against video game distributors who use the ratings icons in advertising without authorization or having actually been issued the rating by the board.&lt;ref name="gibiz-wartune"/&gt;

[[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest digital distribution storefront for personal computers, does display ratings when available, and allows games to be categorized and filtered based on categories, but an ESRB rating is not mandatory. As of June 2018, following complaints regarding inconsistent enforcement of its previous guidelines, Steam only bans the sale of games that contain blatantly illegal content, or games that it classifies as being "straight up [[trolling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/31/16570552/steam-adult-games-uncensored-patches|title=Steam blocking adult game developers from sharing uncensored patches|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gibiz iarc consoles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/361305/steam-threatens-to-remove-anime-style-adult-games|title=Steam Threatens to Remove Anime-Style Adult Games|work=PC Magazine|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/active-shooter-game-steam-1202822402/|title=Valve Criticized Over ‘Appalling’ School Shooting Game on Steam|last=Fogel|first=Stefanie|date=2018-05-25|work=Variety|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/the-sex-games-that-steam-censors-1680718912|title=The Sex Games That Steam Censors|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there have been attempts at the state and federal level to introduce laws requiring retailers to enforce the ESRB ratings system. In 2004, California Assemblyman [[Leland Yee]] sponsored a state bill requiring retailers to stock M-rated games on separate shelves that are at least {{convert|5|ft|in}} from the ground. The bill was passed, after it was modified to only require that retailers promote awareness of the ESRB ratings system to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | title = Schwarzenegger Signs California Video Games Bill | work = [[Gamasutra]] |publisher=UBM plc | date = September 22, 2004 | accessdate=  November 2, 2010 | first =David | last = Jenkins | first2= Simon | last2= Carless }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, California passed AB 1179, a second bill sponsored by Yee, which banned the sale of "violent video games" to minors. The term was defined using a variation of the [[Miller test]] (originally created to judge whether a work is [[obscenity|obscene]]), separate from any rating the game may have received. In a landmark ruling, the law was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'', which ruled that AB 1179 was unconstitutional because video games are a [[Freedom of the press|protected form of expression]].&lt;ref name="ars-housebill"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/01/house-bill-wants-5000-fine-for-video-games-without-esrb-rating/ | title=House bill wants $5,000 fine for video games without ESRB rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/ftc-report-retailers-clamping-down-on-m-rated-game-sales/ | title=FTC report: retailers clamping down on M-rated game sales | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-esrblaw"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/id-please-bill-would-mandate-carding-for-m-rated-game-buys/ | title=ID, please: Bill would mandate carding for M-rated game buys | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6191/video_game_regulation_and_the_.php | title = Video Game Regulation and the Supreme Court: Schwarzenegger v.

In [[Canada]], ESRB ratings are enforced under provincial laws by film ratings boards in [[Manitoba]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. As in the U.S., most retailers voluntarily enforce the ratings regardless.&lt;ref name="manitoba-esrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video and Computer Game Update|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/mfcb/pdf/game_update.pdf|work=[[Manitoba Film Classification Board]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ofrb-videogames"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video and Computer Games|url=http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/english/page15.htm|work=[[Ontario Film Review Board]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208132646/http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/english/page15.htm|archivedate=February 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vsun-california"&gt;{{cite web|title=California seeks gaming age limits|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=09f7b9c0-f538-495c-97df-5bbfd8faadee&amp;sponsor=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140318212437/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=09f7b9c0-f538-495c-97df-5bbfd8faadee&amp;sponsor=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 18, 2014|work=[[Vancouver Sun]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the implementation of the [[Film Classification Act, 2005]], which gave it the power to enforce ESRB ratings, the [[Ontario Film Review Board]] had used its own powers to classify the M-rated ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' as a film and give it a [[Canadian motion picture rating system|"Restricted" rating]], legally barring its sale to those under 18. By contrast, the [[British Columbia Film Classification Office]] considered the ESRB rating to be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bcfilmclass.com/decisions/2004/manhunt.pdf | title=Opinion Review: In the Matter of Manhunt published by Rockstar Games | date=February 6, 2004 | publisher=[[British Columbia Film Classification Office]] | accessdate=October 12, 2006 | format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214090109/http://bcfilmclass.com/decisions/2004/manhunt.pdf |archivedate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-rrated"/&gt;

== Marketing ==
The ESRB enforces guidelines that have been adopted by the video game industry in order to ensure responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging, advertisements, and trailers properly display rating information, restricting where advertising materials for games rated "Teen" or higher can appear, forbidding publishers from "glamoriz[ing] or exploiting" a game's rating in advertising, and requiring online marketing of games rated "Mature" or higher to be restricted to users who are [[Age gate|appropriately aged]].&lt;ref name="gibiz-wartune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wartune advertising runs afoul of ESRB|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-05-10-wartune-advertising-runs-afoul-of-esrb|website=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-enforcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enforcement|url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/enforcement.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising "to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate."&lt;ref name="esrb-principles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices|url=https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles_guidlines.jsp|publisher=ESRB|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers' websites or social media outlets.&lt;ref name="gb-esrbtraliers"/&gt; A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.&lt;ref name="esrb-ewccode"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Website Council "Code of Conduct" |url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/downloads/ewc_code.pdf |publisher=ESRB |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824172525/http://www.esrb.org/ratings/downloads/ewc_code.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the ESRB eased certain restrictions on the promotion of M-rated games. Firstly, trailers for games that are or are anticipated to be rated "Mature" can be cleared by the ESRB as being appropriate for "general" audiences—similarly to the [[MPAA rating system#Advertising materials|"green band"]] ratings issued by the MPAA for film trailers. Secondly, the board began to allow, on a case-by-case basis depending on the target demographic of the game, M-rated games to be [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] in the marketing materials of games with lower ratings.&lt;ref name="gb-esrbtraliers"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB Changes Rules for Marketing Mature-Rated Video Games|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/esrb-changes-rules-for-marketing-mature-rated-vide/1100-4602/|website=Giant Bomb|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online privacy ==
In addition to its video game ratings operation, the ESRB also offers an [[online privacy]] program which helps websites adopt [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] and data usage practices which comply with relevant laws and best practices for the collection and use of personal information, and provides "Privacy Certified" seals indicating certification under the ESRB's privacy guidelines. In June 2013, the service was extended to mobile apps, with a particular emphasis on helping application developers comply with the then-upcoming changes to the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]].&lt;ref name="ars-esrbprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB’s privacy badge all about best practices, not anonymity|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/07/esrbs-privacy-badge-all-about-best-practices-not-anonymity/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-privacycertification"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB will extend privacy certification services to mobile developers|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/26/4466196/esrb-will-extend-privacy-certification-services-to-mobile-developers|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat-esrbprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB expands its ‘Privacy Certified’ services for mobile apps|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/06/25/esrb-expands-its-privacy-certified-services-for-mobile-apps/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The ESRB has considered its system to be effective, due in part to initiatives by the Board to promote enforcement and consumer awareness of the system, and efforts by retailers to prevent the sale of M-rated games to minors.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-decry"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB, game retailers decry "bad report card"|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/12/5665-2/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year following its 1994 launch, the ESRB rating system had achieved widespread usage across the console game industry, although adoption was not yet as high within the PC gaming industry. Lieberman and Kohl also reported that some retailers were reluctant to the idea of removing older, non-rated games from their shelves, and that some retail employees lacked knowledge of the new system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=One Year Later, Is Senator Lieberman Satisfied?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] reported 20% of underaged [[mystery shopper]]s were able to successfully purchase an M-rated video game from a selection of retailers—a 22 percent reduction from 2007.&lt;ref name="ars-ftcratings" /&gt; By 2011, these numbers had dropped further to 13%.&lt;ref name="ars-ftc2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC: kids thwarted 87% of the time on M-rated game purchases|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/ftc-kids-thwarted-87-of-the-time-on-m-rated-game-purchases/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2009 Report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], the FTC recognized the ESRB for having "the strongest self-regulatory code" of all entertainment sectors because of its enforcement of advertising and marketing guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/ftc-praises-us-game-regulation-code | title=FTC Praises US Game Regulation Code | publisher=Future Publishing | work=Edge | date=December 4, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-mratedvideo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/03/m-rated-video-the-esrb-and-video-game-trailers/ | title=M-rated video: the ESRB and video game trailers | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings accuracy===
The ESRB has often been accused of not rating certain games, such as ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' and the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, harshly enough for violence and other related themes, and for lacking [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in certain aspects of the ratings process. Critics have argued that some games only received the M rating rather than the stricter AO rating because of the commercial effects of such a rating; console manufacturers and most retailers refuse to distribute AO-rated games, dramatically affecting their commercial availability. An ESRB representative stated that the Board uses the AO rating when warranted, even due to violence, and that in most occasions, publishers would edit the game to meet the M rating to ensure wide commercial availability instead of keeping the AO rating.&lt;ref name="gi-ratingsgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ratings Game: The Controversy Over The ESRB |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200610/N06.1004.1635.57594.htm |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023055510/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200610/N06.1004.1635.57594.htm |archivedate=October 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-worldratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRB president Patricia Vance's plan for a world ratings solution|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168233/ESRB_president_Patricia_Vances_plan_for_a_world_ratings_solution.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmoney-snuff"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/26/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ | title=Snuff games and ratings | publisher=[[Time Warner]] | work=[[CNNMoney]] | accessdate=March 19, 2014 | date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film classification boards of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] respectively classified the M-rated games ''[[Soldier of Fortune (video game)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' and ''Manhunt'' as [[film]]s due to concerns over the nature of their content, and gave them [[Canadian motion picture rating system|"Restricted"]] ratings, legally restricting their sale to adults.&lt;ref name="cbc-rrated"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ontario-slaps-r-rating-on-video-game-1.473046 |work=CBC News |title=Ontario slaps 'R' rating on video game |date=March 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-manitobaviolent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manitoba moves to rate violent video games|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba-moves-to-rate-violent-video-games-1.477320|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a correlation between the M rating and sales; a 2007 study by Electronic Entertainment Design and Research found that M-rated games "have both the highest average [[Metacritic]] scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States", and [[NPD Group]] found that 7 of the top 20 video games of 2010 (including the #1 game, ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'') were M-rated, even though only 5% of games released that year carried the rating.&lt;ref name="ars-5percentm"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: 5% of games given M rating, including 29% of big sellers|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/03/in-2010-5-percent-of-games-were-rated-m/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-higherrating"&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: M rated games have higher scores, better sales|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/11/study-m-rated-games-have-higher-scores-better-sales/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] criticized the ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating, arguing because it has a [[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]] in the video game industry, it did not want to perform actions that would affect their commercial availability. The organization stated that "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took [[Hot Coffee mod|explicit porn]] to get ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have been calling for AO ratings for the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request." The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was "imposing its own narrow values and morality on the rest of the country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and "[[report card]]" used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.&lt;ref name="ars-decry"/&gt;

On the other hand, some have felt that the "Mature" rating is too broad; [[video game journalism|video game journalist]] Ben Kuchera noted that ''[[Halo 3]]''—a [[sci-fi]] [[first-person shooter]] whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, had received an M rating for "Blood and Gore," "Mild Language" and "Violence". He argued that "having a game like ''Halo 3'' share the same rating as ''[[Saints Row IV]]'', which carries the 'Blood,' Intense Violence,' 'Partial Nudity,' 'Sexual Content,' 'Strong Language' and 'Use of Drugs' descriptors was always silly, and it weakened the thrust of the ratings system." Likewise, he felt that the tone and content of the PG-13 rated film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was relatively harsher to children than that of the ''[[Saints Row (series)|Saints Row]]'' series due to the latter's light-hearted tone, but still noted that "as parents we know what's right and what isn't for our kids, and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents."&lt;ref name="polygon-destinyrating"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuchera|first1=Ben|title=Destiny's Teen rating fixes Halo's goofiest problem: a Mature rating that never made sense|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/26/5845600/destiny-esrb-teen-rating-halo|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', the most recent installment in the franchise, received a "Teen" rating instead of "Mature". Microsoft [[Xbox]] division executive Aaron Greenberg argued that consumers had been "surprised" by the M rating on previous installments "given the style of the game and the lack of real graphic violence and things like that", but that the "Teen" rating would theoretically enable the game to reach a broader audience of younger players.&lt;ref name="gamespot-halo5teen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Halo 5's Teen Rating Will Improve Sales, Xbox Exec Says|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-5s-teen-rating-will-improve-sales-xbox-exec-s/1100-6431866/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults Only rating ===
The "Adults Only" (AO) rating has attracted a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which has been criticized for stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is "true in every entertainment medium", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would be a good thing for the ESRB system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168266/We_could_use_more_Adults_Only_games_says_ESRBs_Vance.php|title=We could use more 'Adults Only' games, says ESRB's Vance|date=April 10, 2012|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are [[Think of the children|generally considered children's products]]; for example, the availability of a [[Wii]] version of ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' was condemned by Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] over fears that children could use the game's [[Wii Remote|motion controls]] to act out the game's "many graphic torture scenes and murders".&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Adults Only rating may be pointless and harmful to games as an art form|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/10/5362502/adults-only-rating-pointless-and-harmful-games-as-art-form|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/10/5397680/the-cold-war-on-the-ao-rating-must-stop-if-gaming-is-to-grow-up|title=The cold war on the Adults Only rating must stop if gaming is to grow up|date=February 20, 2014|author=Ben Kuchera|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-mutedviolence"&gt;{{cite web|title=A history of (muted) violence|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/8/4595050/adults-only-ao-games|work=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes towards AO-rated games have also been influenced by the types of games that have received the rating; Peter Payne, head of [[Peach Princess]], a publisher of English translations of Japanese [[eroge]] [[visual novel]]s, believed that the "Adults Only" rating had acquired a "smutty" and "tasteless" reputation since the majority of AO-rated titles were either niche pornographic titles such as eroge games, or immature titles such as ''[[Riana Rouge]]'' (which ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' described as a game which had the quality of an [[adult movie]], and "[aimed] to do nothing more than tell low-brow jokes and show nude women prancing around") and ''[[Lula 3D]]'' (whose packaging advertised the inclusion of "Bouncin' [[Breast|Boobs]] Technology").&lt;ref name="polygon-aoartform"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-mutedviolence"/&gt;

By contrast, the ESRB has only officially issued the AO rating for extreme violence three times: ''[[Thrill Kill]]'', a fighting game with heavy sexual overtones, received an AO rating with content descriptors for "Animated Violence" and "Animated Blood and Gore". Due to objections over the game's content, ''Thrill Kill'' was canceled by [[Electronic Arts]] after it acquired the North American operations of the game's publisher, [[Virgin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html |title=EA kills 'Thrill Kill' game before release |work=[[ZDNet]] |date=October 15, 1998 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116223732/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' also received an AO rating for its extreme violence; while the uncut version would be released exclusively for PCs, the console versions were edited to meet the M rating criteria.&lt;ref name="gamespot-manhunt2pc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/manhunt-2-pc-gets-ao-rating/1100-6216220/ | title=Manhunt 2 PC gets AO rating | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-manhuntsaga"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/06/the-manhunt-saga-esrb-assigns-ao-rating/ | title=The Manhunt Saga: ESRB assigns AO rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-manhunt2newrating"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/08/manhunt-2-will-see-halloween-release-date-after-getting-m-rating/ | title=Manhunt 2 will see Halloween release date after getting M rating | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, ''[[Hatred (video game)|Hatred]]'', a controversial game whose plot centers around a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, received the rating for its extreme violence and harsh language; one of the game's developers disputed the rating, arguing that "its violence isn't really that bad and this harsh language isn't overused", but also acknowledged the rarity of their situation.&lt;ref name="polygon-hatredao"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hatred given Adults Only rating in US and Canada|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/16/7557639/hatred-esrb-ao-rating|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: revels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/16/6988687/the-worst-trailer-of-the-year-revels-in-slaughtering-innocents |accessdate=October 16, 2014 |title=The worst trailer of the year revels in slaughtering innocents |last=Campbell |first=Colin |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TNPdKo0E?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/16/6988687/the-worst-trailer-of-the-year-revels-in-slaughtering-innocents |archivedate=October 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GabeApology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crossley|first=Rob|title=Gabe Newell Steps in to Reinstate Controversial Shooter on Steam|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-steps-in-to-reinstate-controversial-sh/1100-6424263/|publisher=''[[GameSpot]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Hot Coffee mod|ESRB re-rating of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion}}
In 2005, members of the [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] community discovered that the PC version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' could be modified to unlock an incomplete sex [[minigame]] known as "Hot Coffee", which [[Rockstar North]] had decided to leave out of the final game. The discovery of the minigame caused [[California State Assembly]]man [[Leland Yee]] to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not doing its job properly. US Senators [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Joe Lieberman]] also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame was created by the mod community and was not a part of the original game. This was disproven when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the "Hot Coffee" scenes in console versions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4702737.stm |title=Hidden sex scenes hit GTA rating |publisher=BBC News |date=July 21, 2005 |accessdate=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation, the ESRB changed its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated due to the presence of pertinent content that exists on the game's disc, even if that content is programmed to not be playable without modification or unauthorized use of a third-party cheat device.&lt;ref name="escapist-boobiesdidnotbreak"&gt;{{cite web|title="Boobies Did Not Break the Game": The ESRB Clears the Air On Oblivion|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/op-ed/797-Boobies-Did-Not-Break-the-Game-The-ESRB-Clears-the-Air-On-Oblivion|work=The Escapist|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of a version excluding the content, the rating was reverted to M.&lt;ref name="RevertToMRating"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152490.html |title=FTC Hot Coffee ruling scalds, but doesn't burn Take-Two |publisher=CBS Interactive |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715081911/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152490.html |archivedate=July 15, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' had its rating changed from T to M due to "more detailed depictions of blood and gore than were considered in the original rating", along with a third-party mod for the PC version allowing the use of topless female characters. The game's publisher, [[Bethesda Softworks]], decided not to re-edit the game or contest the new rating, but noted that ''Oblivion''{{'}}s content was "not typical" of games with the M rating, and that the game "does not present the central themes of violence that are common to those products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf |title=ESRB Changes Rating For The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion From Teen to Mature |publisher=ESRB |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206215229/http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148897.html | title=Oblivion rerated M for Mature | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | date=May 3, 2006 | accessdate=December 18, 2006 | last=Sinclair | first=Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148925.html |title=Bethesda responds to Oblivion rerating |publisher=CBS Interactive |work=GameSpot |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221919/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148925.html |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of these two incidents, the ESRB changed its policies in June 2006 to account for hidden content; publishers must disclose information surrounding all unlockable or otherwise "hidden" content in the game as part of the ratings process, and publishers can be fined up to US$1 million if they are found to have misrepresented the content of their game after further reviews.&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-changes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esrb-faq"/&gt; In response to the aftermath of Hot Coffee and the resulting policy changes, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that in her opinion, "there is no other industry self-regulatory system willing or capable of imposing such swift and sweeping sanctions on its own members, which in this particular case resulted in the removal of a top-selling product from the market and a major loss of sales."&lt;ref name="ars-lying1m" /&gt; However, several U.S. politicians, including Senator [[Sam Brownback]], [[California]] Senator [[Leland Yee]], and [[Michigan]] Senator [[Fred Upton]] (who was a major critic against Rockstar during the controversy), still felt that the ESRB had "lost" its trust of consumers, believing that video game developers were taking advantage of the board's [[conflict of interest]] with the industry to incorporate objectionable content into their products without the ESRB's full knowledge.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/96828/Yee_Blasts_ESRB_For_Grand_Theft_Auto_San_Andreas_Rating.php|title=Yee Blasts ESRB For Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Rating|date=July 5, 2005|author=[[Simon Carless]]|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=[[UBM plc|UBM]]|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-truthact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-vgda"/&gt;

In late 2006, both Upton and Brownback tabled bills to place governmental oversight on aspects of the ESRB rating process, and make it illegal for publishers to misrepresent the playable content of a video game to a ratings board; Upton proposed a bill known as the  [[Video Game Decency Act]], explaining that developers had "done an end-run around the process to deliver violent and pornographic material to our kids", and that the bill would "[go] hand in hand with the mission of the industry’s own ratings system." Brownback proposed a bill known as the [[Truth in Video Game Rating Act]], which would have also forced the ESRB to have full, hands-on access to games instead of just video footage, and have initiated a government study on the "effectiveness" of the organization and the possibility of forming a ratings organization independent from the video game industry.&lt;ref name="escapist-esrb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-truthact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brownback Re-Intros Truth in Video Game Rating Act|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/103712/Brownback_ReIntros_Truth_in_Video_Game_Rating_Act.php|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra-vgda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Game Decency Act of 2006 Introduced To Senate|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11070|work=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM plc|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microtransactions ===
In October 2017, in response to growing criticism of the [[loot box]] model for video game [[microtransactions]] (which grant chances at earning randomized items of various rarities, typically cosmetic in nature, in exchange for payment), the ESRB stated their opinion that they were not a form of gambling. They described them as a voluntary and optional aspect of a video game, and comparable to [[booster pack]]s for [[collectible card game]]s because their purchase guarantees that a user will receive items at all, but not necessarily high-value items all the time. The ESRB added that games that contain actual wagering of real money would hold the Adults Only rating.&lt;ref name="kotaku-esrblootboxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091|title=ESRB Says It Doesn't See 'Loot Boxes' As Gambling|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=October 11, 2017|work=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/state-legislators-weigh-law-to-block-battlefront-ii-sale-w512412 | title = State Legislators Weigh Law to Block Sale of 'Battlefront II' to Children | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = November 22, 2017 | accessdate = November 22, 2017 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2018, U.S. senator [[Maggie Hassan]] asked the ESRB to examine if games with loot box microtransactions were being marketed in an "ethical and transparent way" that "adequately protects the developing minds of young children from predatory practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/us-senator-demands-review-of-loot-box-policies-citing-potential-harm/|title=US Senator demands review of loot box policies, citing potential harm [Updated]|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB subsequently announced on February 27, 2018, that it would introduce a new label for any games that contain "the ability to purchase digital goods or premiums with real world currency". The announcement was criticized for being overreaching and ambiguous, as it applies to not only microtransactions, but any purchases of digital goods in relation to a game (which includes [[downloadable content]]), and would thus apply to almost all modern video games. Patrica Vance stated that the ESRB avoided references to specific types of microtransactions, so that the advisory label could be understood by parents unaware of specific details. Vance added that the ESRB was "unable to find any evidence that children specifically have been [psychologically] impacted by loot boxes" or that they caused children to develop "some sort of tendency towards gambling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/after-months-of-controversy-esrb-will-add-in-game-purc-1823356171|title=After Months Of Controversy, ESRB Will Add 'In-Game Purchases' Label To Games|last=Schreier|first=Jason|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17058400/esrb-in-game-purchases-label-microtransactions-loot-boxes-regulation-oversight|title=ESRB’s loot box response is new "in-game purchases" label that applies to almost every game|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/esrb-defends-fun-loot-boxes-as-it-starts-labeling-all-in-game-purchases/|title=ESRB defends "fun" loot boxes as it starts labeling all "in-game purchases" [Updated]|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst ESRB ratings are officially recognised in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and their respective territories, most major game publishers extended their use as ''de facto'' in various South American countries (except for Brazil due to [[Brazilian advisory rating system|its own rating system]]), and, in Nintendo's case, some Asian countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8246">{{nihongo|'''Ero guro nansensu''', frequently shortened to '''ero guro''' or just '''guro''', |エログロ|ero-guro}} is a literary and artistic movement originating c. 1930 in Japan.&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;Silverberg, Miriam Rom. “By Way of a Preface: Defining ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense''”. Galley copy of the preface for ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense: The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times''. December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ero guro puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; While ero guro is a specific movement, many of its components can be found throughout Japanese history and culture.

The term itself is an example of ''[[wasei-eigo]]'', a Japanese combination of English words or abbreviated words: ''ero'' from "ero(tic)", ''guro'' from "gro(tesque)", and ''nansensu'' from "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=William J.|title=Introduction: making sense of ''nansensu''|journal=Japan Forum|date=27 Apr 2009|volume=21|issue=1 (Special Issue: URBAN NONSENSE)|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/09555800902856932|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555800902856932|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In actuality the "grotesqueness" implied in the term refers to things that are malformed, unnatural, or horrific.&lt;ref name="ucla" /&gt; Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ''ero guro'', and vice versa. The term is often used incorrectly by western audiences to mean "[[Graphic violence|gore]]"—depictions of horror, blood, and guts.

==History==
Ero guro nansensu, characterized as a "prewar, bourgeois cultural phenomenon that devoted itself to explorations of the deviant, the bizarre, and the ridiculous,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichert | first = Jim | title = Deviance and Social Darwinism in Edogawa Ranpo's Erotic-Grotesque Thriller Koto no Ōni | journal = Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages =113–114 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.2307/3591938 | author2 = Reichert, Jim | publisher = Journal of Japanese Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1 | jstor = 3591938}}&lt;/ref&gt; manifested in the popular culture of [[Taishō period|Taishō]] Tokyo during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Buruma"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ian Buruma|last=Buruma|first=Ian|title=Inventing Japan, 1853–1964|pages=67–68|year=2003|publisher=The Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-679-64085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Ian Buruma]] describes the social atmosphere of the time as "a skittish, sometimes nihilistic hedonism that brings [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] Berlin to mind."&lt;ref name="Buruma"/&gt; Its roots go back to artists such as Tsukioka [[Yoshitoshi]], who, besides erotic [[Shunga (art)|shunga]], also produced woodblock prints showing decapitations and acts of violence from Japanese history. [[Ukiyo-e]] artists such as [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] presented similar themes with bondage, rape and erotic [[crucifixion]].

Ero guro's first distinct appearance began in 1920s and 1930s [[Japanese literature]]. The [[Sada Abe|Sada Abe Incident]] of 1936, where a woman [[Erotic asphyxiation|strangled]] her lover to death and [[castration|castrated]] his corpse, struck a chord with the ero guro movement and came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston|first=William|title=Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-13052-X|pages=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other like activities and movements were generally suppressed in Japan during [[World War II]], but re-emerged in the postwar period, especially in [[manga]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark.

Over time, the ero guro movement's influence expanded into parts of Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]], [[Japanese art|art]], [[manga]], and eventually into film and music.

==Later influences==
Ero guro is also an element of many [[Japanese horror]] films and ''[[Pink film|pinku eiga]]'', particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Examples include [[Teruo Ishii]]'s ''[[Shogun's Joys of Torture]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]) and ''[[Horrors of Malformed Men]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]) and [[Yasuzo Masumura]]'s ''[[Blind Beast]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), the latter two based on the works of [[Edogawa Rampo]]. A more recent example of ero guro in cinema is [[Sion Sono]]'s ''[[Strange Circus]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]).

There are modern guro artists, some of whom cite Erotic Grotesque Nonsense as an influence on their work. These artists explore the macabre intermingled with sexual overtones. Often the erotic element, even when not explicit, is merged with grotesque themes and features similar to the works of [[H. R. Giger]]. Others produce ero guro as a genre of [[Japanese pornography]] and [[hentai]] involving [[blood]], [[Disembowelment|gore]], [[disfiguration]], [[violence]], [[Body integrity identity disorder|mutilation]], [[Urolagnia|urine]], [[Klismaphilia|enemas]], or [[Coprophilia|feces]].

Well-known guro [[Mangaka|manga artists]] include [[Suehiro Maruo]], [[Hajime Yamano]], [[Jun Hayami]], [[Go Nagai]], [[Shintaro Kago]], [[Toshio Maeda]], [[Henmaru Machino]], [[Yamamoto Takato]], [[Horihone Saizō]], and [[Waita Uziga]].

The modern genre of [[Tentacle erotica|tentacle rape]] began within the category of ero guro (although it has much older roots in Japanese art; see ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife|Octopi and shell diver]]'') but became so popular that it is now usually considered separately.

==In music==
Some [[visual kei]] bands have a concept or theme relating to ero guro, most notably [[Cali Gari]].&lt;ref name="bounce.com"&gt;[http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ Bounce ''Di(s)ctionary Number 13—Visual Kei''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173324/http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ |date=June 16, 2008 }}. Retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western visual kei fans assumed their theme was a subgenre of visual kei and linked it with other similar bands.

The 2014 [[Flying Lotus]] album ''[[You're Dead!]]'' prominently featured ero guro artwork from Japanese manga artist [[Shintaro Kago]] on the cover and inner sleeve, with further art being utilised in the accompanying live show. Much of the drawings featured men and women being disfigured and mutilated in unrealistic, hi-tech ways with a significant amount of gore and nudity.

{{For|a comparison of fairy tale with other kinds of stories, such as myths, legends and fable|Traditional story}}

[[File:Däumling.jpg|thumb|alt= Illustration of the fairy tale character, Tom Thumb, on a hillside, next to a giant's foot.|1865 illustration of [[Hop-o'-My-Thumb]] and the [[ogre]]]]
A '''fairy tale''', '''wonder tale''', '''magic tale''', or '''''Märchen''''' is a [[folklore genre]] that takes the form of a [[short story]]. Such stories typically feature entities such as [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]], [[dragons]], [[Elf|elves]], [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[gnome]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[griffins]], [[mermaid]]s, [[talking animals]], [[troll]]s, [[unicorn]]s, or [[witchcraft|witches]], and usually [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[incantation|enchantments]]. Fairy tales may be distinguished{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} from other folk narratives such as [[legend]]s (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Stith. ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology &amp; Legend'', 1972 s.v. "Fairy Tale"&lt;/ref&gt; and explicit moral tales, including beast [[fable]]s. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to [[children's literature]].

In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in "fairy-tale ending" (a [[happy ending]])&lt;ref&gt;http://w.com/dictionary/fairy%2{{Dead link|date= October 2018 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "fairy-tale [[romance (love)|romance]]". Colloquially, the term "fairy tale" or "fairy story" can also mean any far-fetched story or [[tall tale]]; it is used especially of any story that not only is not true, but could not possibly be true. Legends are perceived{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as real; fairy tales may merge into [[legend]]s, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike [[legend]]s and [[Epic poems|epics]], fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to [[religion]] and to actual places, people, and events; they take place "[[once upon a time]]" rather than in actual times.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form; the name "fairy tale" was first ascribed to them by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] in the late 17th century. Many of today's fairy tales have evolved from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Richard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6142964/Fairy-tales-have-ancient-origin.html "Fairy tales have ancient origin"]. ''The Telegraph'' 5 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because only the literary forms can survive. Still, according to researchers at universities in [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa|Lisbon]], such stories may date back thousands of years, some to the Bronze Age more than 6,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= BBC|title= Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35358487|website= BBC News|publisher =BBC|accessdate= 20 January 2016|date= 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.

Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]] and the morphological analysis of [[Vladimir Propp]] are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.

==Terminology==

Some [[folkloristics|folklorists]] prefer to use the [[German language|German]] term ''Märchen'' or "wonder tale"&lt;ref name=companion/&gt; to refer to the genre over ''fairy tale'', a practice given weight by the definition of Thompson in his 1977 [1946] edition of ''The Folktale'': "a tale of some length involving a succession of [[motif (literature)|motifs]] or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without definite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the marvellous. In this never-never land, humble [[hero]]es kill adversaries, succeed to kingdoms and marry princesses."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stith Thompson]], ''The Folktale'', 1977 (Thompson: 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The characters and motifs of fairy tales are simple and archetypal: princesses and goose-girls; [[youngest son]]s and gallant [[prince]]s; [[ogre]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[dragon]]s, and [[troll]]s; [[wicked stepmother]]s and [[false hero]]es; [[fairy godmother]]s and other [[donor (fairy tale)|magical helpers]], often [[talking animal|talking horses, or foxes, or birds]]; glass mountains; and prohibitions and breaking of prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fairy tale with a tragic rather than a [[happy ending|happy end]] is called an [[anti-fairy tale]].

==Definition==

[[File: Straparola's The Crucifix Comes To Life.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A painting from the fairy tale "The Facetious Nights of Straparola", showing people observing as a person jumps inside a building.|From ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' by [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]]]]

Although the fairy tale is a distinct genre within the larger category of folktale, the definition that marks a work as a fairy tale is a source of considerable dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/introduction/ftdefinition.html What Is a Fairy Tale?]"&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself comes from the translation of Madame D'Aulnoy's ''Conte de fées'', first used in her collection in 1697.)&lt;ref name=Windling1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forconte.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140328002739/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forconte.html | archivedate = 2014-03-28 | title = Les Contes de Fées: The Literary Fairy Tales of France | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common parlance conflates fairy tales with [[beast fable]]s and other folktales, and scholars differ on the degree to which the presence of fairies and/or similarly mythical beings (e.g., elves, goblins, trolls, giants, huge monsters) should be taken as a differentiator. [[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folktale'', criticized the common distinction between "fairy tales" and "animal tales" on the grounds that many tales contained both [[fantasy|fantastic]] elements and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, to select works for his analysis, Propp used all [[Russian folklore|Russian folktales]] classified as a folklore [[Antti Aarne|Aarne-Thompson]] 300-749&amp;nbsp;– in a cataloguing system that made such a distinction&amp;nbsp;– to gain a clear set of tales.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; His own analysis identified fairy tales by their [[plot (narrative)|plot]] elements, but that in itself has been criticized, as the analysis does not lend itself easily to tales that do not involve a [[quest]], and furthermore, the same plot elements are found in non-fairy tale works.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Were I asked, what is a fairytale? I should reply, Read [[Undine (novella)|Undine]]: that is a fairytale ... of all fairytales I know, I think Undine the most beautiful. |author=[[George MacDonald]], ''The Fantastic Imagination''}}

As [[Stith Thompson]] points out, talking animals and the presence of [[magic (fantasy)|magic]] seem to be more common to the fairy tale than fairies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p. 55, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mere presence of animals that talk does not make a tale a fairy tale, especially when the animal is clearly a mask on a human face, as in [[fable]]s.&lt;ref name=Tolkien15&gt;Tolkien, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", [[J.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Tolkien]] agreed with the exclusion of "fairies" from the definition, defining fairy tales as stories about the adventures of men in ''[[Álfheimr|Faërie]]'', the land of fairies, fairytale [[prince]]s and [[princess]]es, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], elves, and not only other magical species but many other marvels.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same essay excludes tales that are often considered fairy tales, citing as an example ''[[The Heart of a Monkey|The Monkey's Heart]]'', which [[Andrew Lang]] included in ''[[The Lilac Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref name=Tolkien15 /&gt;

Steven Swann Jones identified the presence of magic as the feature by which fairy tales can be distinguished from other sorts of folktales.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of the Imagination''. Routledge, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson and Chaudri identify "transformation" as the key feature of the genre.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;''A companion to the fairy tale''. By Hilda Ellis Davidson, Anna Chaudhri. Boydell &amp; Brewer 2006. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; From a psychological point of view, [[Jean Chiriac]] argued for the necessity of the [[fantastic]] in these narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/fairy_tales.html |title=Psychoanalysis and Fairy-Tales |publisher=Freudfile.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of aesthetic values, [[Italo Calvino]] cited the fairy tale as a prime example of "quickness" in literature, because of the economy and concision of the tales.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Six Memos for the Next Millennium'', pp. 36–37. {{ISBN|0674810406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the genre===

[[File:Perrault1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A picture by Gustave Doré showing Mother Goose, an old woman, reading written (literary) fairy tales to children|A picture by [[Gustave Doré]] of [[Mother Goose]] reading written (literary) fairy tales]]

Originally, stories that would contemporarily be considered fairy tales were not marked out as a separate genre. The German term "Märchen" stems from the old German word "Mär", which means story or tale. The word "Märchen" is the [[diminutive]] of the word "Mär", therefore it means a "little story". Together with the common beginning "[[once upon a time]]" it means a fairy tale or a märchen was originally a little story from a long time ago when the world was still magic. (Indeed, one less regular German [[once upon a time|opening]] is "In the old times when wishing was still effective".)

The English term "fairy tale" stems from the fact that the French ''contes'' often included fairies.

Roots of the genre come from different oral stories passed down in European cultures. The genre was first marked out by writers of the [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]], such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], and stabilized through the works of later collectors such as [[Charles Perrault]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; In this evolution, the name was coined when the ''[[précieuses]]'' took up writing literary stories; [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] invented the term ''Conte de fée'', or fairy tale, in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 858.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the definition of the genre of [[fantasy]], many works that would now be classified as fantasy were termed "fairy tales", including Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', p. 83, {{ISBN|0253356652}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Tolkien's "On Fairy-Stories" includes discussions of [[world-building]] and is considered a vital part of fantasy criticism. Although fantasy, particularly the subgenre of [[fairytale fantasy]], draws heavily on fairy tale motifs,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; the genres are now regarded as distinct.

===Folk and literary===

The fairy tale, told orally, is a sub-class of the [[folklore|folktale]]. Many writers have written in the form of the fairy tale. These are the literary fairy tales, or ''Kunstmärchen''.&lt;ref name="Windling1"/&gt; The oldest forms, from ''[[Panchatantra]]'' to the ''[[Pentamerone]]'', show considerable reworking from the oral form.&lt;ref name=" Swann Jones, p. 35"&gt;Swann Jones, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brothers Grimm]] were among the first to try to preserve the features of oral tales. Yet the stories printed under the Grimm name have been considerably reworked to fit the written form.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in Matthew's American Literature'', p. 5, {{ISBN|0253356652}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fairy tales and oral fairy tales freely exchanged plots, motifs, and elements with one another and with the tales of foreign lands.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary fairy tale came into fashion during the 17th century, developed by aristocratic women as a parlour game. This, in turn, helped to maintain the oral tradition. According to [[Jack Zipes]], "The subject matter of the conversations consisted of literature, mores, taste, and etiquette, whereby the speakers all endeavoured to portray ideal situations in the most effective oratorical style that would gradually have a major effect on literary forms."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fairy tale as myth/myth as fairy tale|last=Zipes|first=Jack|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many 18th-century folklorists attempted to recover the "pure" folktale, uncontaminated by literary versions. Yet while oral fairy tales likely existed for thousands of years before the literary forms, there is no pure folktale, and each literary fairy tale draws on folk traditions, if only in parody.&lt;ref name=" Zipes, p. 846"&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it impossible to trace forms of transmission of a fairy tale. Oral story-tellers have been known to read literary fairy tales to increase their own stock of stories and treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Redsun.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Illustration of the Russian fairy tale about Vasilisa the Beautiful, showing a rider on a horse in a forest|[[Ivan Bilibin]]'s illustration of the Russian fairy tale about [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]]]

The [[oral tradition]] of the fairy tale came long before the written page. Tales were told or enacted dramatically, rather than written down, and handed down from generation to generation. Because of this, the history of their development is necessarily obscure and blurred. Fairy tales appear, now and again, in written literature throughout literate cultures, as in ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', which includes ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]'' ([[Ancient Rome|Roman]], 100–200 AD),&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/introduction/timeline.html "Fairy Tale Timeline"]&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' ([[Folklore of India|India]] 3rd century BC),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; but it is unknown to what extent these reflect the actual folk tales even of their own time. The stylistic evidence indicates that these, and many later collections, reworked folk tales into literary forms.&lt;ref name=" Swann Jones, p. 35"/&gt; What they do show is that the fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' collection of magical tales (compiled ''circa'' 1500 AD),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; such as ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]'', and ''[[Bel and the Dragon]]''. Besides such collections and individual tales, in [[Chinese folklore|China]], [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophers such as [[Liezi]] and [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] recounted fairy tales in their philosophical works.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Moss Roberts, "Introduction", p. xviii, ''Chinese Fairy Tales &amp; Fantasies''. {{ISBN|0394739949}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader definition of the genre, the first famous Western fairy tales are those of [[Aesop]] (6th century BC) in [[ancient Greece]].

Jack Zipes writes in ''When Dreams Came True'', "There are fairy tale elements in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', and&amp;nbsp;... in many of [[William Shakespeare]] plays."&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[King Lear]]'' can be considered a literary variant of fairy tales such as ''[[Water and Salt]]'' and ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Soula Mitakidou and Anthony L. Manna, with Melpomene Kanatsouli, ''Folktales from Greece: A Treasury of Delights'', p. 100, Libraries Unlimited, Greenwood Village CO, 2002, {{ISBN|1563089084}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tale itself resurfaced in [[Western literature]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, with ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' by [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] (Italy, 1550 and 1553),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; which contains many fairy tales in its inset tales, and the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tales of [[Giambattista Basile]] (Naples, 1634–36),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; which are all fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Gozzi]] made use of many fairy tale motifs among his [[Commedia dell'Arte]] scenarios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140210083152/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archivedate = 2014-02-10 | title = White as Ricotta, Red as Wine: The Magic Lore of Italy | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including among them one based on ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love For Three Oranges]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, [[Pu Songling]], in China, included many fairy tales in his collection, ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' (published posthumously, 1766).&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt; The fairy tale itself became popular among the ''[[précieuses]]'' of upper-class [[Early Modern France|France]] (1690–1710),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; and among the tales told in that time were the ones of [[La Fontaine]] and the ''Contes'' of [[Charles Perrault]] (1697), who fixed the forms of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Straparola's, Basile's and Perrault's collections contain the oldest known forms of various fairy tales, on the stylistic evidence, all the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Salon Era===

In the mid-17th century, a vogue for magical tales emerged among the intellectuals who frequented the [[salon (gathering)|salons]] of Paris. These salons were regular gatherings hosted by prominent aristocratic women, where women and men could gather together to discuss the issues of the day.

In the 1630s, aristocratic women began to gather in their own living rooms, salons, in order to discuss the topics of their choice: arts and letters, politics, and social matters of immediate concern to the women of their class: marriage, love, financial and physical independence, and access to education. This was a time when women were barred from receiving a formal education. Some of the most gifted women writers of the period came out of these early salons (such as [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] and [[Madame de Lafayette]]), which encouraged women's independence and pushed against the gender barriers that defined their lives. The [[salonnières]] argued particularly for love and intellectual compatibility between the sexes, opposing the system of arranged marriages.

Sometime in the middle of the 17th century, a passion for the conversational [[parlour game]] based on the plots of old [[Folklore|folk tales]] swept through the salons. Each [[salonnière]] was called upon to retell an old tale or rework an old theme, spinning clever new stories that not only showcased verbal agility and imagination but also slyly commented on the conditions of aristocratic life. Great emphasis was placed on a mode of delivery that seemed natural and spontaneous. The decorative language of the fairy tales served an important function: disguising the rebellious subtext of the stories and sliding them past the court censors. Critiques of court life (and even of the king) were embedded in extravagant tales and in dark, sharply dystopian ones. Not surprisingly, the tales by women often featured young (but clever) aristocratic girls whose lives were controlled by the arbitrary whims of fathers, kings, and elderly wicked fairies, as well as tales in which groups of wise fairies (i.e., intelligent, independent women) stepped in and put all to rights.

The [[salon (gathering)|salon]] tales as they were originally written and published have been preserved in a monumental work called ''[[Le Cabinet des Fées]]'', an enormous collection of stories from the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=Windling1 /&gt;

The first collectors to attempt to preserve not only the plot and characters of the tale, but also the style in which they were told, was the [[Brothers Grimm]], collecting German fairy tales; ironically, this meant although their first edition (1812 &amp; 1815)&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; remains a treasure for folklorists, they rewrote the tales in later editions to make them more acceptable, which ensured their sales and the later popularity of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such literary forms did not merely draw from the folktale, but also influenced folktales in turn. The Brothers Grimm rejected several tales for their collection, though told orally to them by Germans, because the tales derived from Perrault, and they concluded they were thereby [[French folklore|French]] and not German tales; an oral version of ''[[Bluebeard]]'' was thus rejected, and the tale of ''Little Briar Rose'', clearly related to Perrault's ''[[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', was included only because Jacob Grimm convinced his brother that the figure of [[Brynhildr]], from much earlier [[Norse mythology]], proved that the sleeping princess was authentically [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ronald Murphy, ''The Owl, The Raven, and the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimms' Magic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0195151690}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This consideration of whether to keep ''Sleeping Beauty'' reflected a belief common among folklorists of the 19th century: that the folk tradition preserved fairy tales in forms from pre-history except when "contaminated" by such literary forms, leading people to tell inauthentic tales.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The rural, illiterate, and uneducated peasants, if suitably isolated, were the ''folk'' and would tell pure ''folk'' tales.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they regarded fairy tales as a form of fossil, the remnants of a once-perfect tale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie]], ''The Classic Fairy Tales'' p. 17. {{ISBN|978-0192115591}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, further research has concluded that fairy tales never had a fixed form, and regardless of literary influence, the tellers constantly altered them for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], p. 22, ''Touch Magic''. {{ISBN|0874835917}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of [[romantic nationalism]], that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the [[Russia]]n [[Alexander Afanasyev]] (first published in 1866),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; the [[Norway|Norwegians]] [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] (first published in 1845),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; the Romanian [[Petre Ispirescu]] (first published in 1874), the [[England|English]] [[Joseph Jacobs]] (first published in 1890),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; and [[Jeremiah Curtin]], an American who collected [[Ireland|Irish]] tales (first published in 1890).&lt;ref name=" Zipes, p. 846"/&gt; Ethnographers collected fairy tales throughout the world, finding similar tales in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Australia]]; [[Andrew Lang]] was able to draw on not only the written tales of Europe and Asia, but those collected by ethnographers, to fill his [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|"coloured" fairy books series]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Brown Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/brown.htm "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; They also encouraged other collectors of fairy tales, as when [[Yei Theodora Ozaki]] created a collection, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'' (1908), after encouragement from Lang.&lt;ref&gt;Yei Theodora Ozaki, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/books/japan/freemanmitford/preface.html "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, writers such as [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[George MacDonald]] continued the tradition of literary fairy tales. Andersen's work sometimes drew on old folktales, but more often deployed fairytale motifs and plots in new tales.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Hans Christian Andersen", pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald incorporated fairytale motifs both in new literary fairy tales, such as ''[[The Light Princess]]'', and in works of the genre that would become [[fantasy]], as in ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' or ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "George MacDonald", p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural transmission==

Two theories of origins, have attempted to explain the common elements in fairy tales found spread over continents. One is that a single point of origin generated any given tale, which then spread over the centuries; the other is that such fairy tales stem from common human experience and therefore can appear separately in many different origins.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales with very similar plots, characters, and motifs are found spread across many different cultures. Many researchers hold this to be caused by the spread of such tales, as people repeat tales they have heard in foreign lands, although the oral nature makes it impossible to trace the route except by inference.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 845.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorists have attempted to determine the origin by internal evidence, which can not always be clear; [[Joseph Jacobs]], comparing the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] tale ''[[The Ridere of Riddles]]'' with the version collected by the Brothers Grimm, ''[[The Riddle (fairy tale)|The Riddle]]'', noted that in ''The Ridere of Riddles'' one hero ends up [[polygamy|polygamously]] married, which might point to an ancient custom, but in ''The Riddle'', the simpler riddle might argue greater antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More Celtic Fairy Tales''. London: David Nutt, 1894, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreceltic/ridere.html Notes and References]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorists of the "Finnish" (or historical-geographical) school attempted to place fairy tales to their origin, with inconclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes influence, especially within a limited area and time, is clearer, as when considering the influence of Perrault's tales on those collected by the Brothers Grimm. ''Little Briar-Rose'' appears to stem from Perrault's ''The [[Sleeping Beauty]]'', as the Grimms' tale appears to be the only independent German variant.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the close agreement between the opening of the Grimms' version of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' and Perrault's tale points to an influence, although the Grimms' version adds a different ending (perhaps derived from ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Velten, pp. 966–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted because it contradicts what is in the Cinderella article (see "Chinese or Egyptian origin for Cinderella?" in talk page): "Occasionally, internal evidence points towards one source; not only is [[Duan Chengshi]]'s ''[[Ye Xian]]'' the oldest known variant of ''Cinderella'', but the value the tale places on small feet points to its being the origin of the others, reflecting the importance of tiny feet (causing the practice of [[footbinding]]) in Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Windling, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forashs.html "Cinderella: Ashes, Blood, and the Slipper of Glass"]&lt;/ref&gt;"--&gt;

Fairy tales tend to take on the color of their location, through the choice of motifs, the style in which they are told, and the depiction of character and local color.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers Grimm believed that European fairy tales derived from the cultural history shared by all [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples and were therefore ancient, far older than written records. This view is supported by research by the [[anthropologist]] Jamie Tehrani and the folklorist Sara Graca Da Silva using [[cladistics|phylogenetic analysis]], a technique developed by [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] to trace the relatedness of living and fossil [[species]]. Among the tales analysed were ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', traced to the time of splitting of Eastern and Western Indo-European, over 5000 years ago. Both ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'' appear to have been created some 4000 years ago. The story of ''The Smith and the Devil'' ([[Deal with the Devil]]) appears to date from the [[Bronze Age]], some 6000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35358487|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 January 2016|date=20 January 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with children==

[[File:Cutlery for children detail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Spoons for children;engraved on them are fairy tale scenes from "Snow White", "Little Red Riding Hood", and "Hansel and Gretel".|Cutlery for children. Detail showing fairy-tale scenes: [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]

Originally, adults were the audience of a fairy tale just as often as children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary fairy tales appeared in works intended for adults, but in the 19th and 20th centuries the fairy tale became associated with [[children's literature]].

The ''[[précieuses]]'', including [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], intended their works for adults, but regarded their source as the tales that servants, or other women of lower class, would tell to children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Seifert]], "The Marvelous in Context: The Place of the ''Contes de Fées'' in Late Seventeenth Century France", Jack Zipes, ed., ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 913.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a novel of that time, depicting a countess's suitor offering to tell such a tale, has the countess exclaim that she loves fairy tales as if she were still a child.&lt;ref&gt;Seifert, p. 915.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the late ''précieuses'', [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] redacted a version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' for children, and it is her tale that is best known today.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brothers Grimm titled their collection ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'' and rewrote their tales after complaints that they were not suitable for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, fairy tales were altered so that they could be read to children. The Brothers Grimm concentrated mostly on sexual references;&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapunzel]], in the first edition, revealed the prince's visits by asking why her clothing had grown tight, thus letting the witch deduce that she was pregnant, but in subsequent editions carelessly revealed that it was easier to pull up the prince than the witch.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in many respects, violence{{nsmdns}}particularly when punishing villains{{nsmdns}}was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, pp. xlii–xliv.&lt;/ref&gt; Other, later, revisions cut out violence; J.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}Tolkien noted that ''[[The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)|The Juniper Tree]]'' often had its [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] stew cut out in a version intended for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The moralizing strain in the [[Victorian era]] altered the classical tales to teach lessons, as when [[George Cruikshank]] rewrote ''Cinderella'' in 1854 to contain [[temperance movement|temperance]] themes. His acquaintance [[Charles Dickens]] protested, "In an utilitarian age, of all other times, it is a matter of grave importance that fairy tales should be respected."&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pp. 181–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva239.html |title=A Transcription of Charles Dickens's "Frauds on the Fairies" (1 October 1853) |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalysts]] such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]], who regarded the cruelty of older fairy tales as indicative of psychological conflicts, strongly criticized this expurgation, because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48, {{ISBN|0312293801}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairy tales do teach children how to deal with difficult times. To quote Rebecca Walters (2017, p.&amp;nbsp;56) “Fairytales and folktales are part of the cultural conserve that can be used to address children’s fears …. and give them some role training in an approach that honors the children’s window of tolerance”. These fairy tales teach children how to deal with certain social situations and helps them to find their place in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Rebecca|date=2017-04-01|title=Fairytales, psychodrama and action methods: ways of helping traumatized children to heal|journal=Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=53–60|doi=10.1007/s11620-017-0381-1|issn=1619-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy tales teach children other important lessons too. For example, Tsitsani et al. carried out a study on children to determine the benefits of fairy tales. Parents of the children who took part in the study found that fairy tales, especially the color in them, triggered their child's imagination as the read them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsitsani|first=P.|last2=Psyllidou|first2=S.|last3=Batzios|first3=S.

"An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales". Zurich, New York 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; based on Jung‘s view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung: The Phenomoneology of the Sprit in Fairytales (1948). In: Collected Works, Vol. 9,I, Princeton/Bollingen 1980, par. 432&lt;/ref&gt; That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the “purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes” and “they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form” because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. “In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche”. “The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these”. “I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact, but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician’s variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness; and even then the theme is not exhausted. This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self, which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious. [...] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, Marie-Louise (1970), An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales, Zurich, New York: Spring publications, {{ISBN|0882141015}}] 1–2 (chapter 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous people commented on the importance of fairy tales, especially for children. For example, Albert Einstein once showed how important he believed fairy tales were for children’s intelligence in the quote “If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales."&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1427525203&lt;/ref&gt;

The adaptation of fairy tales for children continues. [[Walt Disney]]'s influential ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' was largely (although certainly not solely) intended for the children's market.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Grant and Clute, "Cinema", p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anime]] ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo]]'' draws on the fairy tale ''[[Momotarō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Zipes has spent many years working to make the older [[traditional stories]] accessible to modern readers and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric James The Art of Storytelling Show Interview [http://www.artofstorytellingshow.com/2008/06/29/jack-zipes-fairy-tales/ Jack Zipes&amp;nbsp;– Are Fairy tales still useful to Children?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary tales==

===Literary===

[[File:John Bauer 1915.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of three trolls surrounding a princess in a dark area, as adapted from a collection of Swedish fairy tales|[[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]'s illustration of trolls and a princess from a collection of Swedish fairy tales]]

In [[contemporary literature]], many authors have used the form of fairy tales for various reasons, such as examining the [[human condition]] from the simple framework a fairytale provides.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'' and so on!, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors seek to recreate a sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Fairytale", p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers use fairy tale forms for modern issues;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; this can include using the psychological dramas implicit in the story, as when [[Robin McKinley]] retold ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' as the novel ''[[Deerskin (novel)|Deerskin]]'', with emphasis on the abusive treatment the father of the tale dealt to his daughter.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky&gt;{{cite journal | author = Helen Pilinovsky | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325011315/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archivedate = 2014-03-25 | title = Donkeyskin, Deerskin, Allerleirauh: The Reality of the Fairy Tale | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, especially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist simply for comic effect, such as ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales|The Stinky Cheese Man]]'' by [[Jon Scieszka]] and ''The ASBO Fairy Tales'' by Chris Pilbeam. A common comic motif is a world where all the fairy tales take place, and the characters are aware of their role in the story,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the film series [[Shrek (film series)|Shrek]].

Other authors may have specific motives, such as [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[feminism|feminist]] reevaluations of predominantly [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] masculine-dominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of the [[damsel in distress]] has been particularly attacked by many feminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure include ''The Paperbag Princess'' by [[Robert Munsch]], a picture book aimed at children in which a princess rescues a prince, and [[Angela Carter]]'s ''The Bloody Chamber'', which retells a number of fairy tales from a female point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angela Carter – The Bloody Chamber And Other Stories|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/rote/CARTER.html|publisher=Angelfire.com|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many contemporary erotic retellings of fairy tales, which explicitly draw upon the original spirit of the tales, and are specifically for adults. Modern retellings focus on exploring the tale through use of the erotic, explicit sexuality, dark and/or comic themes, female empowerment, [[Fetishism|fetish]] and [[BDSM]], multicultural, and heterosexual characters. [[Cleis Press]] has released several fairy tale themed erotic anthologies, including ''Fairy Tale Lust'', ''Lustfully Ever After'', and ''A Princess Bound''.

It may be hard to lay down the rule between fairy tales and [[fairytale fantasy|fantasies]] that use fairy tale motifs, or even whole plots, but the distinction is commonly made, even within the works of a single author: George MacDonald's ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' are regarded as fantasies, while his "[[The Light Princess]]", "[[The Golden Key]]", and "The Wise Woman" are commonly called fairy tales. The most notable distinction is that fairytale fantasies, like other fantasies, make use of [[novelist]]ic writing conventions of prose, characterization, or setting.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', pp. 22–23, {{ISBN|068910846X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Fairy tales have been enacted dramatically; records exist of this in [[commedia dell'arte]],&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Commedia Dell'Arte", p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Commedia Dell'Arte", p. 745.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[film|cinema]] has meant that such stories could be presented in a more plausible manner, with the use of [[special effects]] and [[animation]]. [[The Walt Disney Company]] has had a significant impact on the evolution of the fairy tale film. Some of the earliest short silent films from the Disney studio were based on fairy tales, and some fairy tales were adapted into shorts in the musical comedy series "[[Silly Symphony]]", such as ''[[Three Little Pigs (1933 film)|Three Little Pigs]]''. [[Walt Disney]]'s first feature-length film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', released in 1937, was a ground-breaking film for fairy tales and, indeed, fantasy in general.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Disney and his creative successors have returned to traditional and literary fairy tales numerous times with films such as ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). [[Disney]]'s influence helped establish the fairy tale genre as a genre for children, and has been accused by some of [[bowdlerizing]] the gritty naturalism&amp;nbsp;– and sometimes unhappy endings&amp;nbsp;– of many folk fairy tales.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky /&gt; However, others note that the softening of fairy tales occurred long before Disney, some of which was even done by the Grimm brothers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Kay|year=1981|title=Märchen to Fairy Tale: An Unmagical Transformation|journal=Western Folklore|volume=40|issue=3|pages=232–44|doi=10.2307/1499694|jstor=1499694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, M.|year=1987|title=The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=24|isbn=978-0691067223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many filmed fairy tales have been made primarily for children, from Disney's later works to Aleksandr Rou's retelling of ''[[Vasilissa the Beautiful]]'', the first [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet film]] to use Russian folk tales in a big-budget feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = James Graham | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archivedate = 2013-01-09 | title = Baba Yaga in Film | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used the conventions of fairy tales to create new stories with sentiments more relevant to contemporary life, as in ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scheib, [http://www.moria.co.nz/fantasy/labyrinth-1986.htm Review of ''Labyrinth'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', and the films of [[Michel Ocelot]].&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works have retold familiar fairy tales in a darker, more horrific or psychological variant aimed primarily at adults. Notable examples are [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131115234313/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archivedate = 2013-11-15 | title = Beauty and the Beast | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', based on [[Angela Carter]]'s retelling of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130920005533/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archivedate = 2013-09-20 | title = The Path of Needles or Pins: Little Red Riding Hood | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html|title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-07-14|date=2006-12-25 |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]|last=Spelling|first=Ian| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707173614/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html| archivedate = July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Suspiria]]'', and ''[[Spike (2008 film)|Spike]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://variety.com/2008/film/news/festival-highlights-1117987482/ | title = Festival Highlights: 2008 Edinburgh International Film Festival | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2008-06-13 | accessdate = 2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; create new stories in this genre from fairy tale and folklore motifs.

In comics and animated TV series, ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'', ''[[Princess Tutu]]'', ''[[Fables (Vertigo)|Fables]]'' and ''[[MÄR]]'' all make use of standard fairy tale elements to various extents but are more accurately categorised as [[fairytale fantasy]] due to the definite locations and characters which a longer narrative requires.

A more modern cinematic fairy tale would be [[Luchino Visconti|Luchino Visconti's]] ''[[Le Notti Bianche]]'', starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]] before he became a superstar. It involves many of the romantic conventions of fairy tales, yet it takes place in post-[[World War II]] [[Italy]], and it ends realistically.

Any comparison of fairy tales quickly discovers that many fairy tales have features in common with each other. Two of the most influential classifications are those of [[Antti Aarne]], as revised by [[Stith Thompson]] into the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]], and [[Vladimir Propp]]'s ''[[Morphology of the Folk Tale]]''.

===Aarne-Thompson===

This system groups fairy and folk tales according to their overall plot. Common, identifying features are picked out to decide which tales are grouped together. Much therefore depends on what features are regarded as decisive.

For instance, tales like ''[[Cinderella]]''&amp;nbsp;– in which a persecuted heroine, with the help of the [[fairy godmother]] or similar [[donor (fairy tale)|magical helper]], attends an event (or three) in which she wins the love of a prince and is identified as his true bride{{nsmdns}}are classified as type 510, the persecuted heroine. Some such tales are ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; ''[[Aschenputtel]]''; ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]''; ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]''; ''[[Ye Xian]]''; ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''; ''[[Catskin]]''; ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]''; ''[[Finette Cendron]]''; ''[[Allerleirauh]]''.

Further analysis of the tales shows that in ''Cinderella'', ''The Wonderful Birch'', ''The Story of Tam and Cam'', ''Ye Xian'', and ''Aschenputtel'', the heroine is persecuted by her stepmother and refused permission to go to the ball or other event, and in ''Fair, Brown and Trembling'' and ''Finette Cendron'' by her sisters and other female figures, and these are grouped as 510A; while in ''Cap O' Rushes'', ''Catskin'', and ''Allerleirauh'', the heroine is driven from home by her father's persecutions, and must take work in a kitchen elsewhere, and these are grouped as 510B. But in ''Katie Woodencloak'', she is driven from home by her stepmother's persecutions and must take service in a kitchen elsewhere, and in ''Tattercoats'', she is refused permission to go to the ball by her grandfather. Given these features common with both types of 510, ''Katie Woodencloak'' is classified as 510A because the villain is the stepmother, and ''Tattercoats'' as 510B because the grandfather fills the father's role.

This system has its weaknesses in the difficulty of having no way to classify subportions of a tale as motifs. ''[[Rapunzel]]'' is type 310 (The Maiden in the Tower), but it opens with a child being demanded in return for stolen food, as does ''[[Puddocky]]''; but ''Puddocky'' is not a Maiden in the Tower tale, while ''[[The Canary Prince]]'', which opens with a jealous stepmother, is.

It also lends itself to emphasis on the common elements, to the extent that the folklorist describes ''[[The Black Bull of Norroway]]'' as the same story as ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''. This can be useful as a shorthand but can also erase the coloring and details of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===

[[File:1932. Билибин. Морозко.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Father Frost, a fairy tale character made of ice, acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale "Father Frost". He tests the heroine, a veiled young girl sitting in the snow, before bestowing riches upon her.|Father Frost acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', testing the heroine before bestowing riches upon her]]

[[Vladimir Propp]] specifically studied a collection of [[Russian fairy tale]]s, but his analysis has been found useful for the tales of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''.&lt;/ref&gt; Having criticized Aarne-Thompson type analysis for ignoring what motifs ''did'' in stories, and because the motifs used were not clearly distinct,&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; he analyzed the tales for the ''function'' each character and action fulfilled and concluded that a tale was composed of thirty-one elements ('functions') and seven characters or 'spheres of action' ('the princess and her father' are a single sphere). While the elements were not all required for all tales, when they appeared they did so in an invariant order&amp;nbsp;– except that each individual element might be negated twice, so that it would appear [[rule of three (writing)|three times]], as when, in ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', the brother resists drinking from enchanted streams twice, so that it is the third that enchants him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Propp's 31 functions also fall within six 'stages' (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition), and a stage can also be repeated, which can affect the perceived order of elements.

One such element is the ''[[donor (fairy tale)|donor]]'' who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the talking [[fox]] tests the hero by warning him against entering an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find the object of his quest; in ''[[The Boy Who Drew Cats]]'', the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in ''[[Cinderella]]'', the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers' spirits do in ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; in ''[[The Fox Sister]]'', a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk gives the brothers magical bottles to protect against the [[Huli jing|fox spirit]]. The roles can be more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Red Ettin]]'', the role is split into the mother{{nsmdns}}who offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessing{{nsmdns}}and when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in ''[[Mr Simigdáli]]'', the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kallo and the Goblins]]'', the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in ''[[Schippeitaro]]'', the evil [[cat]]s betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'', do not feature the donor.

Analogies have been drawn between this and the analysis of myths into the [[Monomyth|Hero's journey]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Vogler, ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers'', 2nd edition, p. 30, {{ISBN|0941188701}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

Many fairy tales have been interpreted for their (purported) significance. One mythological interpretation saw many fairy tales, including ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog King]]'', as [[solar deity|solar myths]]; this mode of interpretation subsequently became rather less popular.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychoanalysis|Freudian]], [[analytical psychology|Jungian]], and other [[psychology|psychological]] analyses have also explicated many tales, but no mode of interpretation has established itself definitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bettleheim Bruno|title= The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales |publisher= Penguin|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0140137279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific analyses have often been criticized{{by whom|date=May 2016}} for lending great importance to motifs that are not, in fact, integral to the tale; this has often stemmed from treating one instance of a fairy tale as the definitive text, where the tale has been told and retold in many variations.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dundes, "Interpreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically", pp. 18–19, James M. McGlathery, ed., ''The Brothers Grimm and Folktale'', {{ISBN|0252015495}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In variants of ''[[Bluebeard]]'', the wife's curiosity is betrayed by [[Bluebeard|a blood-stained key]], by [[Fitcher's Bird|an egg's breaking]], or by [[How the Devil Married Three Sisters|the singing of a rose she wore]], without affecting the tale, but interpretations of specific variants have claimed that the precise object is integral to the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other folklorists have interpreted tales as historical documents. Many{{quantify|date=May 2016}} German folklorists, believing the tales to have preserved details from ancient times, have used the Grimms' tales to explain ancient customs.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach sees the topography of European Märchen as echoing the period immediately following the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]].&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = As the glaciers of the last ice age retreated (from c. 10,000 BC) forests, of various types, quickly colonised the land and came to cover most of Europe. [...] These forests formed the topography out of which the fairy stories (or as they are better called in German – the ''marchen''), which are one of our earliest and most vital cultural forms, evolved.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Other folklorists have explained the figure of the wicked stepmother in a historical/sociological context: many women did die in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p. 213. {{ISBN|0374159017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 lecture, [[Jack Zipes]] reads fairy tales as examples of what he calls "childism". He suggests that there are terrible aspects to the tales, which (among other things) have conditioned children to accept mistreatment and even abuse.&lt;ref&gt;
Jack Zipes, [https://archive.is/20121212173344/http://ias.umn.edu/2012/11/15/zipes-jack/ "Fairy Tales, Child Abuse, and 'Childism'"], (lecture, University of Minnesota Institute for Advanced Study, November 15, 2012).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fairy tales in music ==
Fairy tales have inspired music, namely opera, such as the French [[Opéra féerie]] and the German [[Märchenoper]]. French examples include Gretry's ''[[Zémire et Azor]]'', and Auber's ''[[Le cheval de bronze]]'', German operas are Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', Siegfried Wagner's ''[[An allem ist Hütchen schuld!]]'', which is based on many fairy tales, and Carl Orff's ''[[Die Kluge]]''. Even contemporary fairy tales have been written for the purpose of inspiration in the music world. "Raven Girl" by [[Audrey Niffenegger]] was written to inspire a new dance for the Royal Ballet in London.

In [[theatre]], '''house management''' concerns the selling of [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s, the [[wiktionary:usher|usher]]ing of [[patron]]s in [[FOH (theatre)|front of house]] areas, and the maintenance and management of the [[Theater (structure)|theatre building]]. House management staff usually work for the theatre, under the supervision of the ''house manager'', and not for the theatrical [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] which is occupying it. Often in regional or smaller theatres the responsibility falls under the aegis of the ''production manager''. In any case, house management works closely with the [[production management]] team for the presentation of the theatrical production.

In domestic services, "house management" refers to the overseeing of employees that make up the staff of the household, including drivers, nannies, and housekeepers.

The '''Housewares Design Awards''' is an annual U. S. product design award competition focused on the [[Household goods|housewares industry]]. The competition was introduced in 2003 by ''HomeWorld Business'', a leading housewares industry [[trade publication]], to recognize design innovation as one of the major drivers for housewares industry growth. 
 
The Housewares Design Awards attracts hundreds of product entries each year. These entries are evaluated by an independent panel of judges made up of renowned designers and retailer buyers, a process managed by the Housewares Design Awards LLC. Products are evaluated along multiple dimensions. Criteria include unique appearance, functionality, positioning, innovative technology or materials, safety, environmental benefits, emotional appeal, social impact and the ability to meet consumer needs.

Twelve “Best in Category” Awards and three “Best of the Best” awards are presented at the gold, silver and bronze levels. The “Green House Design Awards,” which honor eco-friendly housewares products, are also given each year.

The '''Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy''' began in July 2007 with a series of [[drawing]]s by Swedish artist [[Lars Vilks]] that depicted the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]] (a form of [[street installation]] in Sweden). Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on 18 August as part of an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from Muslims in Sweden as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=2007-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release|title=PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE PUBLICATION OF OFFENSIVE SKETCH IN SWEDEN |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=2007-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jordan]],&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the inter-governmental [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC).&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of Prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy occurred about a year and a half after the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark in early 2006.

== Background ==

[[Image:Lars Vilks 20050722.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lars Vilks]]]]
On 11 June 2007, Vilks was invited to participate in an art exhibition on the theme "The Dog in Art" ({{lang-sv|Hunden i konsten}}) that was to be held in the small town of [[Tällerud]] in [[Värmland]]. Vilks submitted three [[pen]] and [[ink]] [[drawing]]s on [[ISO 216|A4 paper]] depicting [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]]. At this time, Vilks was already participating with drawings of Muhammad in another exhibition in [[Vestfossen]], Norway, on the theme "Oh, My God". Vilks, who is a known proponent of [[institutional art]], has stated that his original intention with the drawings was to "examine the [[political correctness]] within the boundaries of the art community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Argument 6 september 2007 : Debatt om Yttrandefrihet |episodelink= |series=Argument |serieslink=Argument (television program) |credits= |network=[[Sveriges Television]] |station=[[SVT1]] |airdate=2007-09-06 |season=2 |number=1 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vilks, the art and culture communities in Sweden repeatedly criticize the United States and [[Israel]], whereas Muslim values are rarely even questioned.&lt;ref name=site&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamists push for boycott of Swedish firms |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8542/20070919/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028162633/http://www.thelocal.se/8542/20070919/ |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July, the day before the opening of the exhibition in Tällerud, the organizers decided to withdraw Vilks's drawings from the exhibition due to security concerns and fear of violence from [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] (''see [[Islam and blasphemy]] and [[Islam and animals]]''). Märta Wennerström, the exhibition's organizer, said that at first she "didn't realize the gravity of the situation" and that she made the decision to remove the drawings after consulting [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agencies]] and private persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammed som rondellhund stoppas |url=http://www.nwt.se/ArticlePages/200707/20/20070720205557_NWT845/20070720205557_NWT845.dbp.asp |publisher=[[Nya Wermlands-Tidningen]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-20 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823022045/http://www.nwt.se/ArticlePages/200707/20/20070720205557_NWT845/20070720205557_NWT845.dbp.asp |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bosse |last=Brink |title=Teckningar på Muhammed togs bort |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_16316985.asp |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the first refusal to publish the drawings, Vilks submitted his drawings to the [[Gerlesborg School of Fine Art]] in [[Bohuslän]] (where he is a frequent lecturer) for a special teachers' exhibition that was going to be opened on 18 August. On 13 August, however, the school announced that they also had decided to reject the drawings due to security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Johan |last=Sjöstrand |title=Stopp igen för Vilks Muhammed-bilder |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_16670977.asp |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second rejection started an intense debate in the Swedish media about [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of expression]].

On 18 August, the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of Vilks's drawings in an [[editorial]] on freedom of expression. The editorial defended "Muslims' right to freedom of religion" but also said it must be permitted to "ridicule Islam's most foremost symbols — just like all other religions' symbols."&lt;ref name=na/&gt; On the same day, the drawings were also published in several other Swedish newspapers including ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', ''[[Expressen]]'' and ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]''.

== Reactions ==

=== International reactions ===
On 27 August, the Swedish ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' in [[Tehran]], Gunilla von Bahr, was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry where she received a protest from the [[Government of Iran|Iranian government]] against the publication in ''Nerikes Allehanda''.&lt;ref name=iran/&gt; On 28 August the [[President of Iran]], [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], commented on the drawings during a press conference. He was quoted by the [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] as saying: "Religions call for friendship, equality, justice, peace and respect for divine prophets. The Zionists only pretend to believe in religion. They are telling lies. They are perpetrating oppression against the Europeans and putting at risk the prestige of Europe." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President castigates Swedish daily for publishing blasphemy |url=http://www2.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0708280953195316.htm |publisher=[[Islamic Republic News Agency]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091659/http://www2.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0708280953195316.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmadinejad claims 'Zionists' behind Swedish cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8319/20070828/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830131140/http://www.thelocal.se/8319/20070828/ |archivedate=2007-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August, the Swedish ''chargé d'affaires'' in [[Islamabad]], Lennart Holst, was summoned to the [[Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to receive a similar protest from the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James |last=Savage |title=Muhammad cartoon: Sweden 'sorry for hurt feelings' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8341/20070830/ |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902154003/http://www.thelocal.se/8341/20070830/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs later issued a statement where it condemned the publication "in the strongest terms".&lt;ref name=pakistan/&gt;

On the same day the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), an inter-governmental organization which represents 57 Muslim countries, issued a statement where it strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of Muhammad by Swedish artist Lars Vilks in the ''Nerikes Allehanda'' newspaper. The secretary-general of OIC, [[Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu]], further called on the Swedish government to take "immediate punitive actions against the artist and the publishers of the cartoon and asked for their unqualified apology".&lt;ref name=oic/&gt;

On 31 August, supporters from Islamic parties in Pakistan burned the [[Flag of Sweden|Swedish flag]] in the city of [[Lahore]]. In [[Karachi]], others torched an effigy of the [[Swedish Prime Minister]] to protest the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslims Protest Swedish Newspaper's Cartoon of Prophet Muhammad |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,295431,00.html |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] newspaper ''[[Kabul Times]]'' published a statement by religious scholars, imams and the Afghan [[Ministry of Islamic Guidance]]. The statement said that "The sold-out enemies of Islam draw the cartoon of the respected Prophet of Islam once more. This has disturbed the Islamic world and aroused the indignation of all Muslims". The statement demanded those responsible be handed over to a court for prosecution and punishment.&lt;ref name=afghanistan/&gt;

On 3 September, the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments]] condemned the publication, saying that "such an irresponsible act is not conducive to friendly ties between the Islamic world and the west".&lt;ref name=egypt/&gt; On the same day, also the [[Government of Jordan|Jordanian government]] condemned the publication. A spokesperson for the government said that "The publication of this cartoon, which seeks to attack the character of the Prophet Mohammed, is unacceptable, rejected and condemned".&lt;ref name=jordan/&gt;

=== Domestic reactions ===
On 25 August, a group of about 60 Muslims held a demonstration outside ''Nerikes Allehanda'''s office in Örebro to protest against the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Hedtjärn |title=Demonstration mot Muhammedhundar |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=684516 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826215156/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=684516 |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August, [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Swedish Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] commented on the issue and said: "I think it's important to say two things. First, we are eager to ensure that Sweden remains a country in which Muslims and Christians, people who believe in God and people who don't believe in God, can live side by side in a spirit of mutual respect [...] We are also eager to stand up for freedom of expression, which is enshrined in the [[Constitution of Sweden|constitution]] and comes naturally to us, and which ensures that we do not make political decisions about what gets published in the newspapers. I want to make sure we keep things that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reinfeldt speaks out about Muhammad controversy |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8350/20070831/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902154105/http://www.thelocal.se/8350/20070831/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, around 300 demonstrators – led by the Islamic Cultural Centre in Örebro – assembled outside the offices of ''Nerikes Allehanda'' to protest against the newspaper's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Demonstrators in Muhammad picture protest |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8351/20070831/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902153815/http://www.thelocal.se/8351/20070831/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt met with ambassadors from 22 Muslim countries to discuss the issue. Reinfeldt said that he had "explained how Swedish society works and that we don't have elected representatives making editorial decisions", adding that "this is an open country, a tolerant country".&lt;ref name=meeting1&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim ambassadors 'made no demands' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8424/20070907/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]/[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910191024/http://www.thelocal.se/8424/20070907/ |archivedate=2007-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the meeting, Egyptian ambassador [[Mohamed Sotouhi]] said, according to the news agency [[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]], that he and a group of fellow ambassadors had agreed on a list of measures that Sweden needed to take and to present it to the Prime Minister. "We want to see action, not just nice words. We have to push for a change in the law", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim ambassadors: 'Sweden needs to change its laws' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8412/20070906/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]/[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908151322/http://www.thelocal.se/8412/20070906/ |archivedate=2007-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the meeting however, Reinfeldt denied that any such list had been presented to him.&lt;ref name=meeting1/&gt; According to the [[Syrian Arab News Agency]], a statement had been delivered from the Swedish embassy in [[Damascus]] to Syria's [[Grand Mufti]] [[Ahmad Bader Hassoun]] in which Reinfeldt "expressed his regret of the incident which has offended and upset Muslims, calling against instigating or offending other religions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweden Apologizes for Newspapers Offending Muslims |url=http://www.sana.org/eng/22/2007/09/05/137784.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308164039/http://sana.org/eng/22/2007/09/05/137784.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-08 |publisher=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2007-09-12}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish government has not commented on this statement.

[[Image:Muh-hund-originallit.JPG|thumb|right|200px|One of Vilks's original three drawings, depicting [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]].]]
Also on 7 September, a group of about 550 Muslims gathered outside the offices of the newspaper ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]'' in [[Uppsala]], to protest against the newspaper's publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad cartoons spark new protest |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8428/20070907/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910031849/http://www.thelocal.se/8428/20070907/ |archivedate=2007-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats and attacks ==
Following the publication in ''Nerikes Allehanda'', the [[Swedish Police Authority|Swedish police]] raised the security level around the newspaper's headquarters and some of its employees have been forced to use bodyguards after receiving death threats. Vilks himself has also received several death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Scherlund |title=Lars Vilks hotad till livet |url=http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |publisher=[[TV4Nyheterna]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902105232/http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Muslim woman in western Sweden has been arrested on charges of issuing a death threat ({{lang-sv|olaga hot}}) against Vilks in an e-mail. The woman confirmed in police interrogation that she had written the mail and said that she did not have any regrets about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kvinna delgiven för mordhot av Vilks |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_17015499.asp?blogAbuseID=36649 |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, one actual roundabout dog created by Vilks and local children was set alight as an apparent threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/8420/20070907/ The Local – Sculpture by controverial &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; artist set on fire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115075921/http://www.thelocal.se/8420/20070907/ |date=November 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September, it was reported that the group [[Islamic State of Iraq]] had placed a bounty of at least $100,000 on the head of Lars Vilks and 50,000 dollars on [[Ulf Johansson (editor)|Ulf Johansson]], editor-in-chief of ''Nerikes Allehanda''. The statement was found in an audio file on an Islamist website and was read by a person who identified himself as [[Abu Omar al-Baghdadi]], the purported head of the Islamic State of Iraq. "We announce a reward of $100,000 to anyone who kills this infidel criminal. This reward will be raised to $150,000 if he is slaughtered like a lamb," the statement said. The statement also threatened attacks on Swedish companies unless unspecified "crusaders" issued an apology. Vilks responded to the statement by saying: "I suppose this makes my art project a bit more serious. It's also good to know how much one is worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Al-Qaida: Bounty on Swedish cartoonist |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070915/ap_on_re_mi_ea/al_qaida_cartoonist_1 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Qaeda puts bounties on heads of Swedes |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8498/20070915/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918190204/http://www.thelocal.se/8498/20070915/ |archivedate=2007-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bounty set over Prophet cartoon |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6996553.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States-based [[SITE Institute]] has reported that websites run by militant Islamists have listed the names of over 100 Swedish companies with addresses, maps and logos. The websites called for their readers to boycott these firms and "take revenge" on Sweden for the publication of the drawings.&lt;ref name=site/&gt;

The [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]] (ECFR) and the [[Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe]] (FIOE) both condemned the death threats against Vilks and Johansson. ECFR also said it planned to issue a "counter [[fatwa]]" against the threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=European Muslims condemn death sentence |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8517/20070917/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027165042/http://www.thelocal.se/8517/20070917/ |archivedate=2007-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Association of Newspapers]] (WAN), which represents over 18,000 newspapers around the world, issued a statement where it condemned the death threats and expressed support for ''Nerikes Allehanda'' in its right to publish the drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=WAN Backs Swedish Publishers in Freedom of Expression Dispute |publisher=[[World Association of Newspapers]] |date=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.wan-press.org/article15067.html |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:DavidIofScotland.jpg|150px|thumb|right|David I, who codified the ''Laws of the Bretts and Scotts''.]]

The '''Leges inter Brettos et Scottos''' or '''Laws of the Brets and Scots''' was a legal [[Codification (law)|codification]] under [[David I of Scotland]] (reigned 1124 – 1153). Only a small fragment of the original document survives, describing the penalties for several offences against people.

Historically, the term "Brets" refers to [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] peoples, while "Scots" refers to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]-speaking peoples. [[William Forbes Skene|Skene]] however, asserted that here "Scots" refers to all of the peoples living north of the firths of [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] and [[Firth of Forth|Forth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Skene|1890|p=217}} In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDsUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 The Tribe in Scotland]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the document's intrinsic importance to [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]], it is significant in its similarity to corresponding areas both of Irish [[Early Irish law|Brehon law]] and of [[Welsh law]], which are better-preserved than the laws of medieval southern Scotland, allowing reasonable conjectures to be made regarding the laws and customs of the region, as few historical records exist.

The '''Laws''' or their precursor were relevant in the early twelfth century, as the ''Laws of the Four Burghs'' (Latin: ''Leges Quatuor Burgorum'') explicitly banned parts of it relating to the ''cro'' (or [[weregild]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Seebohm|1902|p=298}} ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EROFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298 Clause XVII]'' of the ''Leges Quatuor Burgorum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Anonymous|1868|p=10}} the text of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CUpkgY6ivDoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA10 XVII. De blodewit et consimilibus]'' in the ''Leges Quatuor Burgorum''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="expl"&gt;The ''Laws of the Four Burghs'' is dated between 1135 and 1157, and there is uncertainty and some contention in establishing the specific date. The four burghs were then [[Stirling]], Edinburgh, [[Lanark]], and [[Linlithgow]], with the latter two replaced by [[Roxburgh]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in 1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Laws''' are known to have been relevant until 1305, as [[Edward I of England]] specifically abolished them in that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Seebohm|1902|p=298}} ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EROFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298 1305 abolishment of the laws by Edward I]''&lt;/ref&gt; following his invasion of Scotland. There is no further mention of them, and when Scotland successfully [[Wars of Scottish Independence|reasserted its independence]], the [[feudalism|feudal]] [[Scots law]] then became applicable.

== The surviving clauses ==

The surviving clauses&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Seebohm|1902|pp=307–318}} ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EROFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA307 Leges Inter Brettos et Scotos]'' (annotated)&lt;/ref&gt; show the society's origins as a [[tribe|tribal]] culture, where a perpetrator's family is responsible for the perpetrator's transgressions, and the family of a victim is compensated for the loss of a family member. As with other [[Celt]]ic societies, the rights and obligations of women are explicitly guaranteed (though at a lesser standing than that of men). Marriages are treated as relationships between different families, and payments accrue to the family of the victim's spouse under some circumstances, but accrue to the victim's family under other circumstances.

'''Definition of the penalties'''

* Penalties for death, including honour-price (clause LV) – ''cro'', ''enach'', and  ''galnes'' (cf. Irish ''crólige báis'' relating to ''[[éraic]]'', Irish ''enech'', and Welsh ''[[galanas]]'', resp.). Payment is made to the victims or their families. This is the feature of tribal law commonly known in English as a [[weregild]].
* Penalties for homicides that breach the king's peace (clause LVI) – These are separate from other penalties that might result from killing a person. It includes breaches to the peace of lesser individuals (such as breaching the peace of a noble), which have lesser penalties. Payment is made to the person whose peace was breached.
* Penalties for wounding or insults to personal honour (clauses LVII and LVIII) – ''kelchin'' or ''gelchach'' (cf. Irish ''enech'' and Welsh ''sarhad''). Payment is made to the victims or their families. Penalties are distinguished for greater and lesser wounds (e.g., different penalties for drawing blood than for a wound that does not draw blood).

'''Penalty amount according to social position'''

The amounts to be paid were on a scale according to the social position of the victim, with the king at the top with the greatest value, then with a lesser amount for his son or high-ranking noble, an even lesser amount for other nobles, and so on down to the least amount for a common person. Amounts for homicide were given both as a number of cows, and as an equivalent amount of gold. Amounts for wounding or insult were given in gold only.

Payments for a female victim were one third less than that of her husband (but equal to that of her brother if she were unmarried), and make clear that women retained their original kinship and rights after marriage, as death penalties were owed by her family (and not by her husband's family), while death payments were made to her family (and not to the husband's family). Also, the importance of the marriage is acknowledged in that some payments for insult accrue to the spouse of the victim, rather than to the victim's family.

Despite his refusal, footage does exist of him performing "Mr. Soul" and "Long Time Gone." The "Mr. Soul" performance can be found as an Easter Egg on his Archives 1963-1972 DVD box set, however because of his resistance to being filmed during much of the performance the camera remains focused on Stills. Young's "Sea of Madness," heard on the album, was drawn from the Fillmore East concert, one month after the festival.

Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles)]]
'''Louis XIV furniture''' was massive and lavishly covered with sculpture and ornament of gilded bronze in the earlier part of his personal reign (1660–1690). After about 1690, thanks in large part to the furniture designer [[André Charles Boulle]], a more original and delicate style appeared.  It was based on the use of [[marquetry]], the inlay of piece of [[ebony]] and other rare woods, a technique first used in Florence in the 15th century, which was refined and developed by Boulle and others working for the King.  Furniture was inlaid with thin plaques of ebony, copper, mother of pearl, and exotic woods of different colors in elaborate designs.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

New and often enduring types of furniture appeared;  the [[commode]], with two to four drawers,  replaced the old ''coffre'', or chest.  The ''canapé'', or sofa, appeared, in the form of a combination of two or three armchairs. New kinds of armchairs appeared, including the ''fauteuil en confessionale'' or "Confessional armchair", which had padded cushions ions on either side of the back of the chair.  The console table also made its first appearance;  it was designed to be placed against a wall.  Another new type of furniture was the ''table à gibier'', a marble-topped table for holding dishes.  Early varieties of the desk appeared;  the [[Bureau Mazarin|Mazarin desk]] had a central section set back, placed between two columns of drawers, with four feet on each column.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the period of the King's youth, (1643–1660) when France was effectively run by the Regent, [[Anne of Austria]], the furniture style was that of Louis XIII, mixed with the Italian influence brought by [[Cardinal Mazarin]].  Rooms were dominated by massive cabinets, decorated with columns, frontons, pilasters, balustrades, niches and other decoration. which matched the elaborate carved wood paneling, called ''lambris'', placed is squares or rectangles on the walls, and the sculpted ceilings with similar decorations. Cabbinets, tables and chairs were geometric. Armchairs appeared with high backs, made with pieces of ''bois tourné'', cut in a spiral form. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=120}}

The second period, from 1660 to about 1690, was the beginning of the personal reign of Louis XIV,  Much of the furniture of this period was made for the decoration of the grand new halls of the Palace of Versailles designed by [[Louis Le Vau]] and then by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]].  The characteristics of the first style in decoration and furniture were richness of materials and an effort to achieve a monumental effect.  Decorative elements on the walls and furniture were often military;  helmets, crossed weapons, oak leave clusters symbolizing victory, sculpted, gilded, and placed on the walls.  Other common decorations were masks of [[Apollo]] (the Sun God symbolized Louis, the "Sun King"); the eagle of Jupiter, the lion, the rooster, and a wide variety of crowns, scepters and royal batons. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=120}}

The Royal furniture manufactory was established in 1667, part of the royal art establishment which included the Academy of Fine Arts and the royal tapestry manufactory at Sèvres. Its designers and craftsmen created most of the new furniture made for the Palace of Versailles and other royal residences. {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=345}}

In the final period, from about 1690 onwards, under the influence of Haroudin-Mansart, Pierre Lapautre and other designers, the style of decor and furniture became less grandiose and more elegant; marble on walls was replaced by wood paneling in light colors, or natural wood that was waxed or vanished. As heating systems improved, fireplaces became smaller;  as glass technology improved, mirrors became larger, and could cover entire walls, as they soon did at Versailles. New and lighter decorative themes appeared that were often exotic and playful, notably [[putti]] or cherubs, and [[grotesques]], [[arabesque]]s and lace-like ''dentelle'' designs. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=128-29}}

The style of the last period was strongly influenced by the [[marquetry]] of the ''ebeniste'' [[André-Charles Boulle]], who between 1675-80 greatly refined the classic techniques of applying thin plaques of [[ebony]], exotic woods, copper, tortoise shell,  and mother-of-pearl. Sometimes copper decoration was placed on a background of tortoise shell,  and sometimes the tortoise shell design was on a background of copper.  The decor became more and more elaborate, fanciful and exotic, particularly in the work of another influential designer, [[Jean Bérain the Elder]]. Another popular decoration on furniture was bronze ornament, sculpted and gilded.  Reliefs of gilded bronze covered the faces of the pieces of furniture, decorating the keyholes and the angles.  The corners of commodes were occupied by sculptures of women or angels, and the feet were dressed in gilded bronze shoes or sculpted lions' or deer feet. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=128-29}}

In the later style, the geometric forms were gradually replaced by curving lines, and an assortment of new, more portable furniture appeared, including folding chairs and small tables, called ''tabourets'', which could be moved easily from room to room. These tendencies led directly to the more fanciful and curving forms of [[Louis XV furniture]].{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=130}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Chairs and sofas==
The armchairs chairs of the early Louis XIV style had legs in a form called ''en gain'' or ''en balustre'', which were lavishly decorated with sculpted and often gilded ornaments called ''godsons'', ''cannelures'', ''and feuillages'' or leaves. The four legs were connected for support by a cross beam under the chair in the form of an 'H', which evolved into an 'X'.  The chairs were upholstered either with leather or with tapestry.  The feet of chairs were either ''en gain'', or geometric and tapering,  or ''en console'', with a curved 'S' form.  An early version of the sofa appeared, a ''canapé'' which looked like two armchairs joined together.  In the later period of the Louis XIV style, the amount of decoration on the frame diminished, and their form became more graceful and curving. The feet 'en console' often ended in the form known as a 'deer's foot', or a gilded bronze shoe. {{Sfn|Duchet|1988|page=130}}  The ''Fauteuil a la Reine'' or Queen's armchair, was introduced,  and became a popular form, which continued to be made, with various modifications, throughout the reigns of Louis XV and XVI.  The ''fauteuil en confessional'' was another innovation, an armchair with wings with thick cushions on either side of the head.  Another innovation was the Fauteuil ''à os de mouton'', which featured braces between the legs in the form of curving sheep bones.{{Sfn|Renault and Lazé|2006|page=60}}

In the early years of the reign, the King demanded that all members of the court, no matter what their rank,  remain standing, often for very long periods, while he was seated in a fauteuil, or armchair. Later, princes and princesses were allowed to sit on simple ''tabourets'', stools made of cane. Gradually this privilege was extended to Duchessses, then other high nobility, and eventually to all the official members of the Court Portable chairs were invented to meet the changing demands of court protocol. These included chairs with cane backs, folding chairs (''ployants'') and a variety of (''tabourets'').{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=346}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Tables==
Tables had the same two types of feet and legs as chairs;  either ''en gaine'' or ''en baluster''. The brace between the legs underneath was often in an X form, and the meeting place often had a very elaborate console with reverse S shapes.  The ''ceinture'' or belt around the edge of the table was richly ornamented with sculptural decoration, which often cascaded downwards.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=130}}

The console was a particular type of table made to stand against a wall;  It usually had a plaque of marble on top, and was richly ornamented, but only on side facing the room.

In the later Louis XIV period, under the influence of Boulle, marquetry became the dominant decoration of tables. A particularly fine example is a table by [[Andre-Charles Boulle]], from 1670–80, which features marquetry made with an assortment of woods, plus pewter, brass, copper, horn, and tortoiseshell It is now in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.  A variant of this design by Boulle from the same period is found in the [[Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Commodes and chests==
The ornate and heavy chests of Louis XIII gradually disappeared were replaced by a new item of furniture, the commode, which had a column of drawers.  In the earlier years of Louis XIV the chests were massive an geometric, sometimes with columns and pediments and panels of wood with carved decorative elements in diamond and other geometric shapes.  The early chests and commodes were often of dark wood, which made them sombre. [[André-Charles Boulle]] lightened the appearance of the commodes with marquetry of ivory, mother of pearl, tin,  and brass.  He also used different colored woods to create elaborate floral bouquets and other designs.

A variety of specialized chests were created, including  ''bibliotheques'' or bookcases; ''Médailliers'' for displaying medals;  and special cabinets or stands for clocks, which were large and heavy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Desks==
The bureau or [[desk]] in its rough modern form appeared under Louis XIV.  The earliest version was the Mazarin desk, named for Louis's prime minister, [[Cardinal Mazarin]].  It had two columns of three drawers each, each mounted on four feet and connected by an E-shaped brace, supporting a flat writing surface with a single drawer beneath. Later variations included a folding top.  Later in the reign, the Mazarin desk was replaced by a large flat topped writing table with four legs and two drawers.  A very elegant version of this desk was made by André-Charles Boulle, for [[Nicolas Fouquet]], the King's minister of finance, for his chateau at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Beds==
The bedroom was a place of ceremony under Louis XIV. The formal awakening of the King at the Palace of Versaille was a daily event, which any member of the Court or visitor to the Palace could attend. It was common for members of the nobility to receive guests when they were in bed.  The beds had very high canopies and draperies supported by four posts and a rectangual frame or panel, called a tester, above. The draperies were largely to keep heat in and drafts out.  The beds were separated from the rest of the room by a balustrade.

The '''Marvel Cinematic Universe''' ('''MCU''') is an American [[media franchise]] and [[shared universe]] that is centered on a [[film series|series]] of [[superhero film]]s, independently produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original [[Marvel Universe]] in comic books, was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. [[Phil Coulson]], portrayed by [[Clark Gregg]], is an original character to the MCU and the only character to appear across all its different media.

The first film released in the MCU was ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), which began the first phase of films culminating in the crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]'' (2012). Phase Two began with ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013), and concluded with ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015). The films are currently in Phase Three, which began with the release of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and is set to conclude with an [[untitled Avengers film]] (2019). [[Marvel Television]] expanded the universe further, first to network television with ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the [[2013–14 United States network television schedule|2013–14 television season]], followed by [[Streaming media|online streaming]] with ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Marvel's Daredevil]]'' on [[Netflix]] in [[2015 in American television#Television programs|2015]] and ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' on [[Hulu]] in [[2017 in American television#Television programs|2017]], and then to [[cable television]] with ''[[Cloak &amp; Dagger (TV series)|Marvel's Cloak &amp; Dagger]]'' on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] in [[2018 in American television#Television programs|2018]]. Marvel Television has also produced the digital series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', which is a supplement to ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D''. [[Film score|Soundtrack albums]] have been released for all of the films, along with many of the television series, as well as the release of [[compilation album]]s containing existing music heard in the films. The MCU also includes [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]] published by Marvel Comics, while Marvel Studios has also produced a series of [[Marvel One-Shots|direct-to-video short films]] and a [[viral marketing]] campaign for its films and the universe with the faux news program ''[[WHIH Newsfront]]''.

The franchise has been commercially successful as a multimedia shared universe, though some critics have found that some of its films and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has inspired other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared universes. The MCU has also been the focus of other media, outside of the shared universe, including attractions at various [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], an attraction at [[Discovery Times Square]], a [[Queensland Gallery of Modern Art]] exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.

===Films===
{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="It's never been done before and that's kind of the spirit everybody's taking it in. The other filmmakers aren't used to getting actors from other movies that other filmmakers have cast, certain plot lines that are connected or certain locations that are connected, but I think ... everyone was on board for it and thinks that it's fun. Primarily because we've always remained consistent saying that the movie that we are making comes first. All of the connective tissue, all of that stuff is fun and is going to be very important if you want it to be. If the fans want to look further and find connections, then they're there. There are a few big ones obviously, that hopefully the mainstream audience will able to follow as well. But ... the reason that all the filmmakers are on board is that their movies need to stand on their own. They need to have a fresh vision, a unique tone, and the fact that they can interconnect if you want to follow those breadcrumbs is a bonus."|source=—[[Kevin Feige]], President of Production for Marvel Studios, on constructing a shared film universe.&lt;ref name="FiegeQuote" /&gt;}}

By 2005, [[Marvel Entertainment]] began planning to independently produce its own films and distribute them through [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Variety2005" /&gt; Previously, Marvel had [[co-production (film)|co-produced]] [[Marvel Studios#Co-productions|several superhero films]] with [[Columbia Pictures]], [[New Line Cinema]] and others, including a seven-year development deal with [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="Variety2006" /&gt; Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution.&lt;ref name="June2007NYTimes" /&gt; [[Avi Arad]], head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films]] at Sony, but was less pleased about others. As a result, they decided to form [[Marvel Studios]], Hollywood's first major [[independent film|independent]] movie studio since [[DreamWorks]].&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt;

Arad's second-in-command,&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt; [[Kevin Feige]], realized that unlike [[Spider-Man]] and the [[X-Men]], whose film rights were licensed to Sony and Fox, respectively, Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="BostonApril2012" /&gt; To raise capital, the studio secured funding from a seven-year, $525&amp;nbsp;million revolving credit facility with [[Merrill Lynch]].&lt;ref name="June2007NYTimes" /&gt; Marvel's plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] film.&lt;ref name="CinematicalCrossover" /&gt; Arad, who doubted the strategy yet insisted that it was his reputation that helped secure the initial financing, resigned the following year.&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMarsMay2014" /&gt;

[[File:Kevin Feige - Guardians of the Galaxy premiere - July 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Kevin Feige helped conceive of a shared media universe of Marvel properties.]]
In 2007, at 33 years old, Feige was named studio chief. In order to preserve its artistic integrity, Marvel Studios formed a creative committee of six people familiar with its comic book lore: Feige, Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, Marvel Comics' president of publishing [[Dan Buckley]], Marvel's chief creative officer [[Joe Quesada]], writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]], and Marvel Entertainment president [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], who oversaw the committee.&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt; Feige initially referred to the shared narrative continuity of these films as the "Marvel Cinema Universe",&lt;ref name="FeigeCinemaUniverse" /&gt; but later used the term "Marvel Cinematic Universe".&lt;ref name="FeigeCinematicUniverse" /&gt; Marvel has designated the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Earth-199999 within the [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the company's [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], a collection of fictional alternate universes.&lt;ref name="Earth-199999" /&gt;

In November 2013, Feige said that "in an ideal world" releases each year would include one film based on an existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's "a nice rhythm" in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''Thor: The Dark World'', he said it is "certainly something to aim for."&lt;ref name="SlashFilmNov2013" /&gt; Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, "I don't know that we'll keep to [that model] ''every'' year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, "so I think it would be fun to continue that sort of thing."&lt;ref name="FeigeIGNJuly2014" /&gt; In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the "rhythm" that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like "a big [[Events from the Modern Age of Comic Books|event]] or [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] series,"&lt;ref name="IGNFeb2014" /&gt; with ''Avengers'' films acting as "big, giant linchpins."&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed" /&gt; After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014,&lt;ref name="MCU2019" /&gt; Feige stated, "I think if you look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [existing] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going."&lt;ref name="FeigeCBRJuly2014" /&gt; After the titles were revealed in October 2014,&lt;ref name="Oct2014Event" /&gt; Feige said, "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [in 2017 and 2018] instead of just two, without changing our methods."&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /&gt;

On expanding the characters in the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outside of ''Avengers'' films, Feige stated, it's about "teaching the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. Just like comic readers have been doing for decades and decades ... people sort of are accepting that there's just a time when they should be together and there's a time when they're not."&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg4" /&gt; In April 2014, Feige revealed that [[Edgar Wright]]'s pitch for ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' in 2006 helped shape the early films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, "We changed, frankly, some of the MCU to accommodate this version of [[Ant-Man]]. Knowing what we wanted to do with Edgar and with Ant-Man, going years and years back, helped to dictate what we did with the roster for ''Avengers'' the first time. It was a bit of both in terms of his idea for the Ant-Man story influencing the birth of the MCU in the early films leading up to ''Avengers''."&lt;ref name="RamaApril2014" /&gt;

In October 2014, Marvel held a press event to announce the titles of their Phase Three films.&lt;ref name="Oct2014Event" /&gt; The event, which drew comparisons to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]],&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventApple" /&gt; was done because all the information was ready. As Feige explained, "We wanted to do this at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|[San Diego] Comic-Con]] this year. Things were not set ... So the plan has been, since a few weeks before Comic-Con when we realized we weren't going to be able to do everything we wanted to do, is to decide 'let's do either something we haven't done in a long time, or something we've never done.' Which is a singular event, just to announce what we have when it's ready. I thought that might be early August, or mid-September, it ended up being [at the end of October]."&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /&gt;

By September 2015, after Marvel Studios was integrated into [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman [[Alan F. Horn|Alan Horn]] instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO [[Isaac Perlmutter]],&lt;ref name="MarvelDisneyAug2015" /&gt; the studios' creative committee had "nominal" input on the films moving forward, though they continued to consult on [[Marvel Television]] productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control.&lt;ref name="CreativeCommitteeEnd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CreativeCommittee2" /&gt; All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso.&lt;ref name="CreativeCommitteeEnd" /&gt; At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are "broad strokes" though sometime "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies before we get to the culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref name="FeigeSep2015" /&gt;

In April 2016, on moving the universe to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, "I think there will be a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a {{em|very}} different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." Joe Russo added, "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with ''[[Captain America: Civil War|[Captain America:] Civil War]]'' and leading into ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|[Avengers:] Infinity War]]'', which are the culmination films."&lt;ref name="FeigePhaseFour" /&gt; A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, "it might be a new thing."&lt;ref name="FeigeColliderApr2017" /&gt; Feige also mentioned that the [[Untitled Avengers film]] would provide "a definitive end" to the films and storylines preceding it, with the franchise having "two distinct periods. Everything before ''Avengers 4'' and everything after."&lt;ref name="VanityFairNov2017" /&gt;

On the potential for "superhero fatigue", Feige stated, "This year [2016], we've got ''Civil War'' and we've got ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' in November, two completely different movies. To me, and to all of Marvel Studios, that's what keeps it going. As long as we're surprising people, as long as we're not falling into things becoming too similar ... next year, [''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''], [''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''], ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. Those are three totally different movies ... as long as the only shared thing is they come from the same source material and they've got our Marvel logo in front of the movies. Other than that they can be very distinct. What other studios do, what other properties, nothing we can do about it."&lt;ref name="FeigeFatigueApr2016" /&gt;

In December 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] [[Proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|agreed to acquire assets]] from [[21st Century Fox]], including 20th Century Fox, for $52.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="FoxDisneyPressRelease" /&gt; The following June, after a counter offer from [[Comcast]] worth $65&amp;nbsp;billion, Disney increased its offer to $71.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="DisneyFoxBidIncrease" /&gt; The acquisition would see the return of the film rights to [[Deadpool]], and the X-Men and [[Fantastic Four]] characters to Marvel Studios, which would "create richer, more complex worlds of inter-related characters and stories."&lt;ref name="FoxDisneyPressRelease" /&gt;

====Distributors====
Over time, the [[Film distribution|distribution rights]] to Marvel Studios' films changed hands on multiple occasions. In November 2006, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] announced that it would distribute ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'',&lt;ref name="HulkUniversal" /&gt; in an arrangement separate from Marvel's 2005 deal with Paramount, which was distributing Marvel's other films.&lt;ref name="Variety2005" /&gt; In September 2008, after the international success of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', Paramount signed a deal to have worldwide distribution rights for ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor'', ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref name="ParamountInternational" /&gt;

In late December 2009, The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4&amp;nbsp;billion. Additionally, in October 2010, Walt Disney Studios bought the distribution rights for ''The Avengers'' and ''Iron Man 3'' from Paramount Pictures,&lt;ref name="DisneyAvengersIM3" /&gt; with Paramount's logo remaining on the films, as well as for promotional material and merchandise,&lt;ref name="ParamountLogo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ParamountLogo2" /&gt; although [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] is the only studio credited at the end of these films.&lt;ref name="VarietyParamount" /&gt; Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films.&lt;ref name="DisneyPurchase" /&gt; In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to ''Iron Man'', ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'' and ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' from Paramount.&lt;ref name="DisneyDistribution" /&gt; ''The Incredible Hulk'' was not part of the deal, due to an agreement between Marvel and Universal, where Marvel owns the film rights and Universal owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the [[right of first refusal]] to distribute future [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] films.&lt;ref name="HulkRights" /&gt; According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', a potential reason why Marvel has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Disney wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].&lt;ref name="HulkRights2" /&gt;

In February 2015, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and Marvel Studios announced a licensing deal that would allow Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character first appearing in ''Captain America: Civil War''.&lt;ref name="SpideyMCU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJSpidey" /&gt; Marvel Studios also explored opportunities to integrate other characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into future ''Spider-Man'' films financed, distributed, and controlled by Sony Pictures,&lt;ref name="SpideyMCU" /&gt; with [[Robert Downey Jr.]] the first confirmed to reprise his role as [[Iron Man|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] in ''Spider-Man: Homecoming''.&lt;ref name="DowneySMH" /&gt; In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal does not apply to the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|MCU television series]], as it was "very specific ... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."&lt;ref name="SpideyDealClarified" /&gt; Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal formed between the two studios (where Marvel gained full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for making a one-time payment of $175&amp;nbsp;million to Sony and paying up to $35&amp;nbsp;million for each future Spider-Man film, and forgoing receiving their previous 5% of any Spider-Man film's revenue), with Marvel getting to reduce their $35&amp;nbsp;million payment to Sony if ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' grossed more than $750 million.&lt;ref name="WSJDealNumbers" /&gt;

===Television===
[[File:Jeph Loeb at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Head of Marvel Television [[Jeph Loeb]] serves as executive producer on every television series set in the universe.|alt=Jeph Loeb sitting.]]

====Broadcast====
In June 2010, [[Marvel Television]] was launched with [[Jeph Loeb]] as head.&lt;ref name="TVLaunch" /&gt; By July 2012, the division had entered into discussions with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to create a show set in the MCU,&lt;ref name="July2012TVshow" /&gt; and in August, ABC ordered a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a show called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'', with ''The Avengers'' writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] involved;&lt;ref name="DeadlineSHIELDPilot" /&gt; it was later renamed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''&lt;ref name="Apr2013ABCAllAccess" /&gt; In January 2014, the series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Marvel's Agent Carter]]'' was announced, joining ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' at ABC,&lt;ref name="AtwellAgentCarterTV"/&gt; while a [[put pilot]] order for the half-hour live-action comedy series, ''Marvel's Damage Control'', was revealed in October 2015.&lt;ref name="DamageControl" /&gt; While talking about Marvel potentially making comedy series, Loeb said in January 2016 that Marvel always feels humor should be a part of anything they produce, despite possibly fitting more within a darker genre, as ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' do, while also staying "grounded and real". He added, "There are moments of levity that are in life that you need to bring to the table, or else it just becomes overwhelmingly oppressive ... If you're going to [explore comic book elements], it's always a good idea to make sure that the audience is aware that, yeah, it's funny [too]."&lt;ref name="LoebComediesCBJan2016" /&gt;

In May 2016, after ABC had canceled ''Agent Carter'' and passed on ''[[Most Wanted (TV pilot)|Marvel's Most Wanted]]'', [[ABC Entertainment]] president [[Channing Dungey]] said that Marvel and ABC were working together, looking "at series that would be beneficial to both brands" moving forward.&lt;ref name="DungeyMay2016" /&gt; In November 2016, Marvel and [[IMAX Corporation]] announced ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', based on the species [[Inhumans|of the same name]], after a planned film based on the characters had been removed from Marvel Studios' slate.&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InhumansNoThe" /&gt; The first two episodes of the series were set to premiere in [[IMAX]] theaters in September 2017 for two weeks, before airing on ABC with the remainder of the series.&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement" /&gt; [[Ben Sherwood]], president of [[Disney–ABC Television Group]], said, "We've worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise we are only enhancing" the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films—the theatrical run of the series will take place between the releases of ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Thor: Ragnarok''.&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InhumansTHR2" /&gt; The deal was initially suggested to Marvel by IMAX after they had held a successful IMAX event with ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' in 2015. Sherwood described it as "a quadruple win—a win for IMAX, a win for Marvel, a win for ABC Studios and a win for ABC to launch a show in an innovative way and get attention" in an increasingly crowded market. Sherwood hoped that this would be the first of "several innovative ways to launch [television] programming."&lt;ref name="InhumansTHR2" /&gt;

====Online streaming====
=====Netflix=====
By October 2013, Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.&lt;ref name="DeadlineTVOct2013" /&gt; In November 2013, Disney was set to provide Netflix with live-action series based on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Luke Cage]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].&lt;ref name="DeadlineTVNov2013" /&gt; Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films.&lt;ref name="VarietyTVNov2013" /&gt; Loeb later stated that Marvel was not "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing."&lt;ref name="LoebJan2017" /&gt; Loeb also added that the four characters chosen "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [in the comics]. So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows are going to be the same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'"&lt;ref name="IGNApr2015" /&gt;

Quesada confirmed in April 2014 that the Netflix series would be set within the MCU.&lt;ref name="QuesadaNetflix" /&gt; Loeb explained that "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [Iron Man]. It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies."&lt;ref name="EW7ThingsDD" /&gt; In January 2015, Netflix COO [[Ted Sarandos]] said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after ''Daredevil''{{'}}s April 2015 release.&lt;ref name="NetflixReleasePlans" /&gt; A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out more than one or two [each] year ... The complex one is really ''The Defenders''. ''The Defenders''{{'}} production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." He also noted on potential spin-offs that "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" into their own series at some point,&lt;ref name="SarandosJan2016" /&gt; with Netflix ordering ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|Marvel's The Punisher]]'', a spin-off from ''Daredevil'', that April.&lt;ref name="PunisherEWApr2016" /&gt; Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the ''Defenders'' series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.&lt;ref name="SarandosJuly2016" /&gt; In July 2016, Marvel and Netflix committed to complete production on 135 episodes by the end of 2017, making the deal the largest television production commitment in New York State. Production for the different series had engaged 500 local vendors and small businesses for various stages of development, and had required over 14,000 production-related hires.&lt;ref name="Netflix135" /&gt;

In October 2018, Netflix canceled ''Iron Fist'' after two seasons, with ''Deadline Hollywood'' reporting that Disney was considering reviving the series on its streaming service [[Disney+]].&lt;ref name="IFCanceledDeadline" /&gt; Sarandos confirmed that the series were Netflix's to renew or cancel if they wished, and the company was "super happy with [the other series'] performance so far".&lt;ref name="SarandosNoCancelling" /&gt; Despite this, ''Luke Cage'' was canceled by the streamer a week after ''Iron Fist'' was. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported there were no plans to revive the series on Disney+ as with ''Iron Fist''.&lt;ref name="LCCanceled" /&gt; Shortly after, at the end of November 2018, Netflix canceled ''Daredevil'' after three seasons, with ''Deadline Hollywood'' again reporting there was the potential for the series to be revived on Disney+.&lt;ref name="DDCanceled" /&gt; Conversely, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt it was unlikely the series would be revived on Disney+ and also noted the two other remaining series at the time (''Jessica Jones'' and ''The Punisher'') would remain on Netflix "until they run their course".&lt;ref name="DDCanceledTHR" /&gt;

=====Hulu=====
In August 2016, Marvel announced that ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' had received a pilot order from [[Hulu]],&lt;ref name="RunawaysHulu2" /&gt; eventually receiving a 10 episode order the following May.&lt;ref name="RunawaysSeriesOrder" /&gt; That July, Loeb confirmed the series would take place in the MCU saying, "It all lives in the same world, how it's connected and where it's connected and what it's going to be connected to remains to be seen." He added that the characters would not be concerned with the actions of other in the universe, instead focusing on their own issues. This allowed showrunners [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]] to deal with concepts such as superheroics and fantasy without explaining them to the audience, since they are already well established in the MCU, while still focusing on their own characters, which they described as "liberating".&lt;ref name="RunawaysMCU" /&gt;

=====Disney+=====
By November 2017, Disney was looking to develop a new Marvel television series for their streaming service [[Disney+]].&lt;ref name="DisneyStreaming2" /&gt; In July 2018, Feige noted discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement Marvel Studios could have with the streaming service, since Feige felt the service was "an important thing for the company".&lt;ref name="FeigeStreamingServiceJul2018" /&gt; In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series centered on "second tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.&lt;ref name="Disney+SeriesSep2018" /&gt; Feige noted the series being developed for the streaming service would "tell stories... that we wouldn't be able to tell in a theatrical experience — a longer-form narrative".&lt;ref name="FeigeStreamingTHRNov2018" /&gt;

====Cable====
In April 2016, the ABC-owned [[Cable television|cable]] network [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] announced ''[[Cloak &amp; Dagger (TV series)|Marvel's Cloak &amp; Dagger]]'', based on the characters [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|of the same name]], with a straight-to-series order for 2018.&lt;ref name="CloakandDaggerApr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDAiring" /&gt; The network confirmed that the series would be "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a "superhero love story", a premise that ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called "a seamless fit for Freeform" given the network's target audience of "Becomers" (the 14–34 age demographic).&lt;ref name="CloakandDaggerApr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CloakandDaggerMCU" /&gt; This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series ''[[New Warriors (TV series)|Marvel's New Warriors]]'' ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important to both of us to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here."&lt;ref name="NewWarriorsApril2017" /&gt; Loeb noted that it was "exciting" to Marvel "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who is trying to figure out who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" in ''Cloak &amp; Dagger'', ''New Warriors'' and Hulu's ''Runaways''.&lt;ref name="TCAJul2017THR" /&gt; By November 2017, ''New Warriors'' was no longer set to air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks.&lt;ref name="NWBeingShopped" /&gt;

====Crossovers to feature films====
{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=After [running something by Jeph] Loeb we'll run it through New York, Joe Quesada, Dan Buckley and those guys. [Then we] pitch our stuff to Kevin Feige and his movie group to see if there's something we can tie into, to see if they're okay about us using a character, or a weapon or some other cool thing. Everything is interconnected.|source=—''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer Jeffrey Bell in September 2014, explaining the process of working in with the MCU&lt;ref name="BellSep2014" /&gt;}}
''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer [[Jeffrey Bell]] revealed at the show's 2014 PaleyFest panel that the producers and writers are able to read the screenplays for upcoming MCU films to know where the universe is heading.&lt;ref name="AoSHitfixPg2" /&gt; He noted that since the films have to be "big" and move "quickly through a lot of huge pieces", it is beneficial for the films to have the television series fill in any "gaps" for them.&lt;ref name="BellPasteSep2015" /&gt; His fellow executive producer [[Jed Whedon]] explained that each Marvel project is intended to standalone first before there is any interweaving, and noted that the series has to be aware of the film division's plans so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe.&lt;ref name="AoSProducersTHR" /&gt; Bell said this was preferable so that people who do not watch the films can still follow the series, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="BellPasteSep2015" /&gt; Joss Whedon noted that this process "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s scepter from ''The Avengers'' but were unable due to his plans for it in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.&lt;ref name="JossScepter" /&gt;

In April 2014, Quesada stated that, beyond connecting to themselves, the Netflix series would connect with the films and other television series.&lt;ref name="QuesadaNetflix" /&gt; In October 2014, Feige said the opportunity "certainly" exists for characters in the Netflix series to appear in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /&gt; In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the Netflix series to crossover with the films and the ABC series, saying, "As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''The Avengers'', it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into ''Thor 2'' and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of ''Iron Man 3''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling".&lt;ref name="LoebDigitalSpy" /&gt; In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying "I think that's inevitable at some point ... The schedules do not always quite match up to make that possible. It's easier for [the shows]. They're more nimble and faster and produce things quicker than we do, which is one of the main reasons you see the repercussions of ''Winter Soldier'' or [''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''] in the show ... by the time we start doing a movie, they'd be mid-way through a season. By the time our movie comes out, they'd be [starting the next season].&lt;!--This wording allows for it to apply to all seasons, not just the second and third--&gt; So finding the timing on that is not always easy."&lt;ref name="FeigeSep2015" /&gt;

Loeb talked further on the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of scheduling by saying "if I'm shooting a television series and that's going to go on over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [a television series actor] to be able to go be in a movie?" He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded."&lt;ref name="LoebJuly2016" /&gt; Eric Carroll, producer on ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', felt with the introduction of [[Queens]]-based Spider-Man to the MCU it "would be really fun" to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, "it's definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later."&lt;ref name="HomecomingDefenders" /&gt;

In January 2017, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], who portrays [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', said he "would love to switch over to the movies, but I think it's pretty much been said it's not going to happen. Or at least not for a very, very long time." D'Onofrio cited Feige's previous reasoning as well as the fact that the films already had difficulty "bringing big characters in that they have to service in the writing" and adding characters from the television series would be "just too many characters" since the films were "trying to figure out already how to individualize more and at the same time keep ''The Avengers'' going."&lt;ref name="DOnofrioJan2017" /&gt; In March 2017, [[Anthony Mackie]], who portrays [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] in the films, felt a crossover between the films and television series "wouldn't work at all" given they are "different universes, different worlds, different companies, different designs" and that "Kevin Feige is very specific about how he wants the Marvel Universe to be seen in the film world."&lt;ref name="MackieMar2017" /&gt; That May, Feige noted that a character appearing in a television series would not necessarily exclude them from appearing in a film, adding that "at some point, there's going to be a crossover. Crossover, repetition, or something."&lt;ref name="FeigeTVCharactersMay2017" /&gt; Regarding the potential for the Avengers to learn in the films that [[Phil Coulson]] is alive, Loeb stated, "It's certainly something that will get resolved, and it may get resolved in a very surprising way."&lt;ref name="CoulsonAliveFilms" /&gt;

Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had no plans for series to crossover across networks. Specifically for the similarly themed ''Cloak &amp; Dagger'', ''New Warriors'', and ''Runaways'', which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted, "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. [where ''Runaways'' is set] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans [where ''Cloak &amp; Dagger'' is set]... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense."&lt;ref name="TCAJul2017THR" /&gt; He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network "feelings" need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show [[Avengers Tower]] as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be "less specific" about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.&lt;ref name="LoebOct2017" /&gt;

In June 2018, speaking to how the MCU television series would be affected by the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Loeb noted that "For the most part our stories will take place before Thanos clicked his fingers. A lot of that has to do with production and when we are telling our stories versus when the movies come out."&lt;ref name="LoebAMAJun2018" /&gt; In September 2018, with the report of Marvel Studios developing limited series for Disney's streaming service, it was expected that the actors that portrayed the characters in the films would portray them again for the limited series.&lt;ref name="Disney+SeriesSep2018" /&gt;

===Other media===
In 2008, the first official tie-in comic was released.&lt;ref name="FirstComic"/&gt; Quesada outlined his plan to expand the MCU into comic books, saying, "The MCU [comics] are going to be stories set within movie continuity. [They are] not necessarily direct adaptations of the movies, but maybe something that happened off screen and was mentioned in the movie ... Kevin Feige is involved with these and in some cases maybe the writers of the movies would be involved [as well.]"&lt;ref name="QuesadaComicBooks" /&gt; Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts should be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics, and what to leave for the films.&lt;ref name="IM2comics"/&gt; Marvel has clarified which of the tie-in comics are considered official canonical MCU stories, with the rest merely inspired by the MCU, "where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form."&lt;ref name="PilgrimCanon2015" /&gt;

In August 2011, Marvel announced a series of [[direct-to-video]] [[short film]]s called [[Marvel One-Shots]],&lt;ref name="ShortsAnnouncement" /&gt; the name derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comics]].&lt;ref name="AssemblingAUniverse" /&gt; Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said "It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features."&lt;ref name="ShortsAnnouncement" /&gt; Each short film is designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films.&lt;ref name="ShortsDescription" /&gt; In July 2012, D'Esposito stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, "There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. So maybe there are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [with a short] – and they take off. I could see that happening."&lt;ref name="Item47" /&gt;

In March 2015, Marvel's Vice President of Animation Development and Production, Cort Lane, stated that animated tie-ins to the MCU were "in the works".&lt;ref name="LaneECCC2015" /&gt; That July, Marvel Studios partnered with [[Google]] to produce the faux news program ''[[WHIH Newsfront|WHIH Newsfront with Christine Everhart]]'', a series of in-universe [[YouTube]] videos serving as the center of a [[viral marketing]] campaign to promote the films and universe.&lt;ref name="WHIHPromo" /&gt; In December 2016, a six-part web series, ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', was revealed, which debuted on ABC.com on December 13, 2016. It follows [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena "Yo-Yo" Rodriguez]] on a secret mission, shortly before the start of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth season]], with [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]] reprising her role.&lt;ref name="Slingshot" /&gt;

===Business practices===
[[File:Joss Whedon by Gage Skidmore 7.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joss Whedon]] was a large contributor to Phase Two, offering creative insight to all its films and launching the first MCU television series, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', while writing and directing ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.]]
Marvel Studios developed specific business practices to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, "You don't have to have directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome,"&lt;ref name="ChooseDirector" /&gt; adding "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [such as [[Jon Favreau]], [[Joss Whedon]], [[Kenneth Branagh]], and the [[Russo brothers]],] that have done very, very good things. Very rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie."&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg2" /&gt; The studio looks for filmmakers to hire who are able to guide a film.&lt;ref name="FastCompany" /&gt; When hiring directors, the studio usually has "a kernel of an idea of what we want", which is presented to potential directors over the course of several meetings to discuss and further expand. "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige.&lt;ref name="FeigeSep2015" /&gt; Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a "lookbook" of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every "18 months or so" to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.&lt;ref name="FeigeRetreats" /&gt;

[[Scott Derrickson]] did not see a lookbook for ''Doctor Strange'', instead putting together his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and his vision of the film to Marvel. In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what ''Thor: Ragnarok'' could be with prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that. [[Taika Waititi]] created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films.&lt;ref name="FeigeRetreats" /&gt; For ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they "kept getting more and more specific about what our vision was", putting together "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, you name it. We did like a 30-page book that had everything that we'd do with the character, from the theme of the movie to the tone of the film to the fighting style to what we liked about the character and what we didn't like". This meant that by the time they were hired they had already "figured the movie out".&lt;ref name="RussosDirectingProcess" /&gt;

When the studio hired Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston to direct ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', respectively, it made sure both directors were open to the idea of a shared universe and including ''Avengers'' set-up scenes in their films.&lt;ref name="BostonApril2012" /&gt; Joe Russo stated, "That's the exciting component of [incorporating references to the larger universe]. 'What can we set up for the future?' You're constantly pitching out ideas that not only affect your movie, but may have a ripple effect that affects other films ... It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic."&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg4" /&gt; Anthony added, "The great thing about the Marvel [Cinematic Universe], just like the publishing [arm], it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters."&lt;ref name="RussosMTVAug2014" /&gt; He added that, for directors to "fit" in at Marvel, they must understand how to "take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment", yet keep it connected.&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg4" /&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=The most simple way I could put it is Marvel doesn't come to the filmmakers and say, "Here's what the next movie is." They come to the filmmakers and say, "What is the next movie?" That's very much the process.|source=—Director Anthony Russo in April 2016&lt;ref name="RussosDirectingProcess" /&gt;}}
On allowing directors and writers to work within Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but the way that you get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." For the Russos in ''The Winter Soldier'', they had to deal with the idea of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] being infiltrated by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], with Joe saying, "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film."&lt;ref name="RussosCrave" /&gt; Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team "come up with conceptually what we want to do" for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes."&lt;ref name="RussosDirectingProcess" /&gt;

Loeb explained that Marvel Television sees "ourselves as producers who are working to support the vision of our showrunner. But we're involved in every aspect of the production—whether it's being in the writers' room, editing on set, casting—every step of the production goes through the Marvel team to tell the best story that we can." He added that the studio is able to work on so many series across different networks and platforms because "it just requires that we make sure that there's always someone from Marvel there to help guide the process."&lt;ref name="LoebJul2017" /&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=The thing about Marvel is ... they're looking for artists that are willing to take chances and are willing to create characters, even if that character has been around for years and years in comic books.|source=—[[Vincent D'Onofrio]] ([[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'') in August 2014&lt;ref name="D'OnofrioArtists" /&gt;}}
Marvel Studios also began contracting their actors for multiple films, including signing actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] to a then "unprecedented" nine-movie contract.&lt;ref name="THRFeb2009" /&gt; In July 2014, Feige said that the studio has all actors sign contracts for multiples films, with the norm being for 3 or more, and the 9 or 12 film deals "more rare".&lt;ref name="FeigeContracts" /&gt; Actor's contracts also feature clauses that allows Marvel to use up to three minutes of an actor's performance from one film for another, which Marvel describes as "bridging material".&lt;ref name="CreativeCommittee2" /&gt; At Marvel Television, actors such as [[Charlie Cox]] ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]] in ''Daredevil'') and [[Adrianne Palicki]] ([[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse / Mockingbird]] in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'') are contractually obliged to appear in a Marvel film if asked.&lt;ref name="CoxFilms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PalickiFilms" /&gt; In May 2015, after starring as [[Claire Temple]] in the first season of ''Daredevil'', [[Rosario Dawson]] signed with Marvel to return for the second season of the series as part of an "exclusive TV deal" that also allows her to appear in any other Marvel Netflix series.&lt;ref name="DawsonDeal" /&gt; Dawson's character has been featured as well in all the other Netflix shows, except ''The Punisher'', linking them together similarly to Jackson's Nick Fury in the films.&lt;ref name="DawsonNoPunisher" /&gt; Dawson explained that she signs on with Marvel for a year at a time, for a certain amount of episodes, and finds out which series the episodes are for closer to the time of filming.&lt;ref name="DawsonExplain" /&gt;

In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an exclusive contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would "contribute creatively" on Phase Two of the MCU and develop the first television series set in the universe.&lt;ref name="WhedonConsultDeal" /&gt; In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, "I understand what Kevin [Feige] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts and talk to the directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful."&lt;ref name="WhedonConsultQuote" /&gt; Whedon later elaborated that "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with ''Avengers 2'', we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying "well I don't know, what if I need that?" It's like "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor the events of the last movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see ''Avengers[: Age of Ultron]'' who did not see any of the movies in between or even ''Avengers 1''." He also found working in television and [[script doctor]]ing to be "great training ground[s] for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't."&lt;ref name="WhedonConsultInterview" /&gt;

For the Russo brothers and writers [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] working on ''Avengers: Infinity War'' and Phase Three, they saw "a through line from ''Winter Soldier'', through ''Civil War'', right to ''Infinity War''", with films like ''Doctor Strange'' and ''Thor: Ragnarok'' laying groundwork for the "culmination" in ''Infinity War''. Subsequently, they talked "to the directors and writers of the other Phase 3 movies on an almost weekly basis, to make sure everything lines up right."&lt;ref name="RussosWritersPhase3" /&gt; [[Peyton Reed]], director of ''Ant-Man'' and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', felt the relationship and collaboration between the Phase Three directors was "probably the closest thing that this generation will have to a '30s- or '40s-era [[studio system]] where you are all on the lot and you are all working on different things."&lt;ref name="ReedTHRJul2018" /&gt; Similarly, when developing the crossover miniseries ''The Defenders'', showrunner Marco Ramirez consulted with the creators of all the individual Marvel Netflix series, having them read each of the scripts for ''The Defenders'' and provide insight into the individual character's world.&lt;ref name="RamirezEWJan2017" /&gt; In April 2017, along with his announcement that he was returning to write and direct ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'', [[James Gunn]] revealed he would be working with Marvel "to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far."&lt;ref name="GunnVol3Confirm" /&gt; However, in July 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn following controversy surrounding several old jokes Gunn had made.&lt;ref name="GunnFiredTHR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GunnFiredDeadline" /&gt;

Additionally, [[Paul Bettany]] was the first actor to portray two main characters within the universe, voicing [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] in the ''Iron Man'' and ''Avengers'' films, and portraying [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] in ''Avengers'' films and ''Captain America: Civil War''.&lt;ref name="BettanyRoles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BettanyCapCW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BettanyIW" /&gt; [[Stan Lee]], creator or co-creator of many of the characters seen in the MCU, has [[cameo appearance]]s in all of the feature films and television series except ''Inhumans''. In ''Iron Fist'', it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Captain [[Forbush Man|Irving Forbush]].&lt;ref name="LeeForbush" /&gt; His cameo in ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' sees Lee appearing as an informant to the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a [[FedEx]] delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in ''Captain America: Civil War''.&lt;ref name="LeeCameo3" /&gt; This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos,&lt;ref name="LeeCameo2" /&gt; with writer and director James Gunn noting that "people thought Stan Lee is &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU."&lt;ref name="LeeCameo3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeeCameo2" /&gt; Feige added that Lee "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in ''Guardians''...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?"&lt;ref name="LeeCameo" /&gt;

==Reception==
Jim Vorel of ''[[Herald &amp; Review]]'' called the Marvel Cinematic Universe "complicated" and "impressive", but said, "As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations, the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing."&lt;ref name="Herald&amp;Review" /&gt; Kofi Outlaw of ''Screen Rant'' stated that while ''The Avengers'' was a success, "Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe".&lt;ref name="ScreenRant_2013-06-27" /&gt; Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own. In his review of ''Thor: The Dark World'', ''[[Forbes]]'' critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to "a glorified television series", with ''The Dark World'' being a "'stand-alone' episode that contains little long-range mythology."&lt;ref name="ForbesMCUReception" /&gt; Collider's Matt Goldberg considered that while ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'' and ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' were quality productions, "they have never really been their own movies", feeling that the plot detours to S.H.I.E.L.D. or lead-ups to ''The Avengers'' dragged down the films' narratives.&lt;ref name="ColliderMCUReception" /&gt;

The metaphor of the MCU as "the world's biggest TV show" was discussed again, after the release of ''Captain America: Civil War'', by Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of ''Captain America: Civil War'' makes little to no sense ... [but] when you think about where [Captain America] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack "visual spark", or "shoehorn in story elements" that "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' being equivalent to the character [[Daenerys Targaryen]]—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." He noted that this format was an extension of early "TV-like" film franchises such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's the end of the world if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that."&lt;ref name="VoxCivilWarTV" /&gt;

Following the conclusion of season one of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', Mary McNamara at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that "never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... [''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''] is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination."&lt;ref name="LATimesSHIELDReview" /&gt; Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that "the fact that [''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''] so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven", though "the fault there seems to be that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' had to bide time until ''The Winter Soldier''{{'}}s release", which led to much criticism.&lt;ref name="Zap2itSHIELDReview" /&gt;

In January 2015, Michael Doran of [[Newsarama]] and Graeme McMillian of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' had a "point-counterpoint" debate in response to the first ''Ant-Man'' trailer. Doran stated, "Marvel has raised the bar {{em|sooo}} high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [MCU] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it". McMillian responded, "at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer up something like [the trailer] {{em|without}} it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it {{em|doesn't}} offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience {{em|is}} expecting something to knock their socks off." Doran concluded, "That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... [and] Marvel {{em|is}} going to eventually falter."&lt;ref name="NewsaramaDiscussionJan2015" /&gt;

After seeing the portrayal of [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]] in ''Ant-Man'', the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, &lt;blockquote&gt;It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios has a bit of a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... [their] villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: ''evil''. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [they are] treated in such a way that their freak flags are allowed to fly free.&lt;ref name="THRVillians" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of ''Jessica Jones'', David Priest at [[CNET|c&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;net]] wrote about how the series rescues "Marvel from itself ... ''Jessica Jones'' takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming."&lt;ref name="CNETJJ" /&gt; For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of ''Forbes'', watching the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the "morally complex, violent, dark world of ''Jessica Jones'' has no place in the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Daredevil'', while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU."&lt;ref name="KainForbesJJ" /&gt; Tassi went so far as to wonder what "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the ''Winter Soldier'' reveal on ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and saying that ''Jessica Jones'' is "so far removed from the world of ''The Avengers'', it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... [I] really don't understand the point of [the MCU] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes".&lt;ref name="TassiForbesJJ" /&gt; Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called ''Jessica Jones''{{'}}s lack of overt connections to the MCU "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, ''Jessica Jones'' also proves the MCU's thematic durability."&lt;ref name="InverseJJ" /&gt;

In April 2016, Marvel Studios revealed that [[Alfre Woodard]] would appear in ''Captain America: Civil War'', having already been cast as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]] in ''Luke Cage'' the previous year.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt; This "raised hopes that Marvel could be uniting its film and Netflix universes",&lt;ref name="WoodardIGN" /&gt; with "one of the first and strongest connections" between the two.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt; However, ''Civil War'' writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely revealed that Woodard would instead be portraying [[Miriam Sharpe]] in the film, explaining that she had been cast on the suggestion of Robert Downey, Jr., and they had not learnt of her casting in ''Luke Cage'' until afterwards.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt; This was not the first instance of actors being cast in multiple roles in the MCU, but this casting was called more "significant", and seen by many as a "disappointing" indication of "the growing divide" and "lack of more satisfying cooperation" between Marvel Studios and Marvel Television following the September 2015 corporate reshuffling of Marvel Entertainment.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodardSF" /&gt;

Speaking to the 1990s setting of ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', "the MCU's first full period piece since Phase One's ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' in 2011", Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the return of younger versions of some characters introduced and killed in earlier films "open[ed] up the MCU in a whole new way and broaden[ed] the franchise's mantra of 'it's all connected'." Speaking specifically to Clark Gregg's appearance as Agent Phil Coulson in the film, Newby noted the appearance "doesn't exactly mend fences between Marvel's film and TV divisions, [but] it does strengthen the connective tissue and the sense that these characters still matter in the grand scheme of Marvel's film plans." He also hoped that continuity from ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' would be maintained in ''Captain Marvel'', especially since Coulson has dealt with the Kree in the series. Newby also added that shifting to different time periods would help Marvel Studios "sustain this cinematic universe for the next 10 years" by allowing them to repeat some of the genres previously used, as they could then feel "fresh" and have "different rules and different restraints," as well as allow them to build upon material established in the television series such as ''Agent Carter''. He concluded, "Marvel Studios has an entire sandbox to play in, but, for necessary reasons, has largely chosen to remain in a small corner in order to ground audiences in these concepts. Now that the basis has been laid, the opportunity for exploration in both film and television lies ahead, with ''Captain Marvel'' leading the way. Wherever Marvel Studios plans to take the MCU in the future, it's refreshing to know that its past is expansive and filled with infinite possibilities."&lt;ref name="THRMar2018CaptainMarvel" /&gt;

==Cultural impact==

===Other studios===
After the release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Tom Russo of [[Boston.com]] noted that aside from the occasional "novelty" such as ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Aliens vs. Predator]]'' (2004), the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="BostonApril2012" /&gt; Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters. In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning "megafranchises" for years to come, opposed to working one blockbuster at a time. Amobi added, "A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust. Disney has proved that this [approach and genre] can be a gold mine."&lt;ref name="ASM2EW" /&gt; However, with additional studios now "playing the megafranchise game", Doug Creutz, media analyst for [[Cowen and Company]], feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: "If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox [is] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario? I'm not sure they can."&lt;ref name="ASM2EW" /&gt; In March 2018, Patrick Shanley of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' opined that "the key differences between a regular franchise, such as ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' or [[Pitch Perfect (film series)|''Pitch Perfect'' films]], and a shared universe is the amount of planning and interweaving that goes into each individual film. Its all too easy to make a film that exists solely for the purpose of setting up future installments and expanding a world, rather than a film that stands on its own merits while deftly hinting or winking at its place in the larger mythos. In that, the MCU has flourished." He felt that ''Iron Man'' "itself was aimed at being an enjoyable stand-alone experience, not as an overall advertisement for 17 subsequent movies. That mentality has persisted through most of the MCU films over the past decade, which is all the more impressive as its roster of heroes now exceeds the two-dozen mark."&lt;ref name="THRMarch2018SharedUniverses" /&gt;

====DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures====
{{main|DC Extended Universe|Arrowverse}}
In October 2012, following its legal victory over [[Joe Shuster]]'s estate for the rights to [[Superman]], [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] announced that it planned to move ahead with its long-awaited [[Justice League]] [[Justice League in other media#Film|film]], uniting such [[DC Comics]] superheroes as [[Batman]], Superman, and [[Wonder Woman]]. The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a [[team-up]] film.&lt;ref name="LATimesOct2012" /&gt; The release of ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' in 2013 was intended to be the start of a new shared universe for DC, "laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics."&lt;ref name="ManofSteel" /&gt; In 2014, Warner Bros. announced that slate of films, similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance.&lt;ref name="DCUntitledFilms" /&gt; That year, DC CCO [[Geoff Johns]] stated that the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' were set in a separate universe from the new film one,&lt;ref name="DCSeparateUniverses" /&gt; later clarifying that "We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach [to Marvel's]."&lt;ref name="DCMultiverse" /&gt;

Discussing the apparent failure of the cinematic universe's first team-up film, ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like "showrunner" in Feige, "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director [[Zack Snyder]], whose DC films "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but a long series of teases for other ones. It's like he knows what he needs to do but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled."&lt;ref name="VoxCivilWarTV" /&gt; Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the ''Justice League'' films, on top of Johns' involvement in several "solo" films, such as the post-production process of ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' or the writing process of a standalone Batman film.&lt;ref name="DCEUShakeUp" /&gt; After the successful release of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] stating, "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them." Additionally, DC began focusing on films "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].&lt;ref name="VultureDCFilmsSep2017" /&gt;

====20th Century Fox====
{{main|X-Men (film series)|Fantastic Four in film}}
In November 2012, [[20th Century Fox]] announced plans to create their own shared universe, consisting of Marvel properties that it holds the rights to including the [[Fantastic Four]] and X-Men, with the hiring of [[Mark Millar]] as supervising producer. Millar said, "Fox are thinking, 'We're sitting on some really awesome things here. There is another side of the Marvel Universe. Let's try and get some cohesiveness going.' So they brought me in to oversee that really. To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new ways we could take this stuff and new properties that could spin out of it."&lt;ref name="SlashFilmNov2012" /&gt; ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', released in 2014, was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe,&lt;ref name="IGNFoxSony" /&gt; ahead of the release of a [[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|''Fantastic Four'' reboot film]] the next year.&lt;ref name="FantasticFour" /&gt; However, in May 2014, ''Days of Future Past'' and ''Fantastic Four'' screenwriter [[Simon Kinberg]] stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the ''X-Men'' films, explaining that "none of the ''X-Men'' movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team—the Fantastic Four. And the Fantastic Four acquire powers, so for them to live in a world where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated, because you're like, 'Oh, you're just a mutant.' Like, 'What's so fantastic about you?' ... they live in discrete universes."&lt;ref name="FantasticFour" /&gt; In July 2015, ''X-Men'' director [[Bryan Singer]] said that there was still potential for a crossover between the ''X-Men'' and ''Fantastic Four'' franchises, if reaction to ''Fantastic Four'' and ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' warranted it.&lt;ref name="SingerCrossover" /&gt;

Feeling that Singer's efforts in ''Apocalypse'' to establish a larger world, similar to the MCU, did not meet the standards established by Marvel, VanDerWerff noted that unlike Feige's ability to serve as "pseudo-showrunner", Singer is instead "steeped in film and the way movie stories have always been told", so "when it comes time to have ''Apocalypse'' dovetail with story threads from the earlier ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (which was directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]]), both Singer's direction and Simon Kinberg's script rely on hackneyed devices and clumsy storytelling", indicating a lack of "the kind of big-picture thinking this sort of mega franchise requires".&lt;ref name="VoxCivilWarTV" /&gt;

====Sony Pictures====
{{main|Spider-Man in film}}
In November 2013, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] Co-Chairman [[Amy Pascal]] announced that the studio intended to expand their universe created within the [[Spider-Man in film#Marc Webb series|Marc Webb ''Amazing Spider-Man'' series]], with spin-off adventures for supporting characters, in an attempt to replicate Marvel and Disney's model.&lt;ref name="IGNFoxSony" /&gt; The next month, Sony announced [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Sinister Six]] films, both set in the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' universe. With this announcement, [[IGN]] stated that the spin-offs are "the latest example of what we can refer to as "the ''Avengers'' effect" in Hollywood, as studios work to build interlocking movie universes."&lt;ref name="VenomSinisterSixIGN" /&gt; Sony chose not to replicate the Marvel Studios model of introducing individual characters first before bringing them together in a team-up film, instead making the Spider-Man adversaries the stars of future films.&lt;ref name="ASM2EW" /&gt; However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that the ''Spider-Man'' franchise would be retooled, with a new film co-produced by Feige and Pascal being released in July 2017, and the character being integrated into the MCU. Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own, and have final creative control of the ''Spider-Man'' films.&lt;ref name="SpideyMCU" /&gt; With this announcement, sequels to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' were canceled,&lt;ref name="VarietySpidey" /&gt; and by November 2015 the Venom and Sinister Six films, as well as spin-offs based on female characters in the Spider-Man universe, were no longer moving forward.&lt;ref name="VarietySpidey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SpideySpinoffs" /&gt; By March 2016, the Venom film had itself been retooled, to start its own franchise unrelated to the MCU Spider-Man.&lt;ref name="VenomMar2016" /&gt; A year later, Sony officially announced the Venom film to be in development, for an October 5, 2018 release,&lt;ref name="VenomMar2017" /&gt; along with a film centered on the characters [[Silver Sable]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] known as ''Silver &amp; Black''.&lt;ref name="SilverSableBlackCat" /&gt; Both projects were not intended to be a part of the MCU nor spin-offs to ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', but rather part of an intended separate shared universe known as [[Sony's Marvel Universe]].&lt;ref name="SilverSableBlackCat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VenomNotMCU" /&gt;

After Sony canceled their shared universe plans and started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of ''[[The Week]]'' noted the perceived flaws of the first ''Amazing Spider-Man'' film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel "doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. …We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course."&lt;ref name="ASMWeek" /&gt; Scott Mendelson noted that ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' "was sold as less a sequel to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' than a backdoor pilot for ''Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six''. …Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate." This would have saved Sony "a boatload of money", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.&lt;ref name="ASMForbes" /&gt;

===Academia===
In September 2014, the [[University of Baltimore]] announced a course beginning in the 2015 [[academic term|spring semester]] revolving around the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to be taught by Arnold T. Blumberg. "Media Genres: Media Marvels" examines "how Marvel's series of interconnected films and television shows, plus related media and comic book sources and [[Joseph Campbell]]'s [[monomyth|monomyth of the 'hero's journey']], offer important insights into modern culture" as well as Marvel's efforts "to establish a viable universe of plotlines, characters, and backstories."&lt;ref name="UBaltCourse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UBaltCourse2" /&gt;

==Outside media==
===Disney theme park attractions===
{{main|Marvel-themed areas at Disney parks}}
After the acquisition by Disney in 2009, Marvel films began to be marketed at the [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]] attraction in [[Tomorrowland#Disneyland (California)|Tomorrowland]] at [[Disneyland]]. For ''Iron Man 3'', the exhibit, entitled Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries, features the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there is a simulator game, titled "Become Iron Man", that uses [[Kinect]]-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of "tests," in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark's workshop. The game is guided by [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], who is voiced again by [[Paul Bettany]]. The exhibit also has smaller displays that include helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref name="IM3Disneyland" /&gt; The exhibit for ''Thor: The Dark World'' is called Thor: Treasures of Asgard, and features displays of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] relics and transports guests to [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]'s throne room, where they are greeted by Thor.&lt;ref name="ThorTDWDisneyland" /&gt; ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''{{'}}s exhibit, Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage, features a meet and greet experience.&lt;ref name="CapTWSDisneyland" /&gt;

From May to September 2017, Disneyland Resort featured the "Summer of Heroes", which sees members of the Guardians and Avengers making appearances throughout the Disneyland Resort. Additionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Dance Off event was featured, which involved [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill / Star-Lord]] blasting music from his boombox, along with the Avengers Training Initiative, a limited experience where [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] "assemble a group of young recruits to see if they have what it takes to be an Avenger." Marvel related food and merchandise was also available throughout [[Hollywood Land]] at [[Disney California Adventure]] during the "Summer of Heroes".&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutOpening" /&gt;

In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced three new Marvel-themed areas inspired by the MCU to Disney California Adventure, [[Walt Disney Studios Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. The developments will be designed by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] in collaboration with [[Marvel Studios]] and Marvel Themed Entertainment.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;

====Hong Kong Disneyland====
In October 2013, the [[Iron Man Experience]] attraction was announced for Hong Kong Disneyland.&lt;ref name="IronManExperience" /&gt; It is set in the [[Tomorrowland]] section of the park,&lt;ref name="IMExpDS" /&gt; with the area built to look like a new Stark Expo created by Tony Stark after the 2010 one, as seen in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',&lt;ref name="IMExpStarkExpo" /&gt; with various exhibit halls that include the Mark III armor from the films.&lt;ref name="IMExpDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMExpMKIII" /&gt; The area also has Iron Man and Marvel-themed merchandise items and memorabilia, plus an interactive game where guests can have the chance to try on Iron Man's armor.&lt;ref name="IMExpReleaseDate" /&gt; Iron Man Experience sees guests assist Iron Man in defeating Hydra throughout Hong Kong,&lt;ref name="IMExpDS" /&gt; and opened on January 11, 2017.&lt;ref name="IMExpReleaseDate" /&gt;

In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Hong Kong Disneyland and a new attraction where guests team up with Ant-Man and the Wasp, to join Iron Man Experience.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DisneyParksMar2018" /&gt; Inspired by ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'',&lt;ref name="AMWaspRide" /&gt; Ant Man and the Wasp: Nano Battle! is an enclosed interactive dark ride that sees guests use laser powered weapons to team up with Ant-Man and the Wasp to defeat [[Arnim Zola]] and his army of Hydra swarm bots.&lt;ref name="AMWaspRide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMWaspRideName" /&gt; Ant Man and the Wasp: Nano Battle! replaces the [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters]] ride,&lt;ref name="AMWaspRide" /&gt; and is scheduled to open in 2019.&lt;ref name="AMWaspRideName" /&gt;

====Disney California Adventure====
By San Diego Comic-Con 2016, the [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Tower of Terror]] at Disney California Adventure was set to be replaced by a new attraction, [[Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!]]. [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] all filmed exclusive footage for the attraction, reprising their roles as [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill / Star-Lord]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] and [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan / The Collector]], respectively.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GotGBreakout2" /&gt; James Gunn, director of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel, directed footage for the attraction and consulted on all aspects of it.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutGunn" /&gt; Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! sees visitors assisting Rocket to rescue the other Guardians from the Collector's fortress, while the attraction features randomized events during the experience and music inspired by the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)#Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|Awesome Mix Vol. 1]]'' soundtrack. The attraction opened on May 27, 2017.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutOpening" /&gt; Despite having multiple references to the MCU, the attraction is not part of the MCU, rather the start of its own theme park universe that is inspired by the MCU.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutMCUConnection" /&gt;

In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Disney California Adventure, anchored by Mission: Breakout!, that will see characters from the MCU such as Iron Man and Spider-Man join the Guardians of the Galaxy in a "completely immersive superhero universe." The area will replace the "[[A Bug's Land]]" area, which closed in mid-2018 to start construction on the Marvel area.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DisneyParksMar2018" /&gt;

====Walt Disney Studios Park====
In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to [[Disneyland Paris]]' Walt Disney Studios Park. The area will include a reimagined attraction where riders will team up with Iron Man and other Avengers on a "hyper-kinetic adventure" in 2020. The park will also host the "Summer of Super Heroes" live-action stage show from June–September 2018.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DisneyParksMar2018" /&gt;

===Other live attractions===
====Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N.====
In May 2014, the Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. (Scientific Training and Tactical Intelligence Operative Network) exhibit opened at the [[Discovery Times Square]] center. The exhibit features replica set pieces, as well as actual props from the films, mixed with interactive technology and information, crafted through a partnership with [[NASA]] and other scientists. Titus Welliver also provides a "debrief" to visitors, reprising his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake. Created by Victory Hill Exhibits, Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. cost $7.5&amp;nbsp;million to create,&lt;ref name="AvengersSTATIONDailyNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AvengersSTATIONEW" /&gt; and ran through early September 2015.&lt;ref name="AvengersSTATIONClosing" /&gt;

The exhibit also opened in [[South Korea]] at the [[War Memorial of Korea]] in April 2015,&lt;ref name="STATIONKorea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STATIONLasVegas" /&gt; in Paris, France, at [[Esplanade de La Défense (Paris Métro)|Esplanade de La Défense]] a year later, and in Las Vegas at the [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino]] in June 2016.&lt;ref name="STATIONLasVegas" /&gt; The Las Vegas version of the exhibit featured updated character details and corresponding science to incorporate the Marvel films that have released since the original exhibit in New York. Additionally, the Las Vegas version features Cobie Smulders reprising her role as Maria Hill to "debrief" visitors, replacing Welliver.&lt;ref name="STATIONLasVegas2" /&gt;

====GOMA exhibit====
An art exhibit, titled "Marvel: Creating the Cinematic Universe", was displayed exclusively at the [[Queensland Gallery of Modern Art]] (GOMA) from May to September 2017. The exhibit, which included "300 plus objects, films, costumes, drawings and other ephemera", featured content "from the collection of Marvel Studios and Marvel Entertainment and private collections" with "significant focus [given] to the creative artists who translate the drawn narrative to the screen through production design and storyboarding, costume and prop design, and special effects and postproduction". "Marvel: Creating the Cinematic Universe" was also extended to GOMA's Australian Cinémathèque with a retrospective of the MCU films.&lt;ref name="GOMA" /&gt;

===Television specials===
===={{anchor|Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe}}''Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe'' (2014)====
On March 18, 2014, ABC aired a one-hour [[television special]] titled ''Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe'', which documented the history of Marvel Studios and the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and included exclusive interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from all of the films, One-Shots and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and sneak peeks of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', unaired episodes of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',&lt;ref name="TVSpecial" /&gt; and ''Ant-Man''.&lt;ref name="TVSpecialAntMan" /&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt the special, "contains a pretty interesting business and creative story. While it might all make sense in hindsight, there was appreciable audacity in Marvel's plan to release five loosely connected movies from the same hero-filled world, beginning with the cinematically unproven ''Iron Man'' and culminating with superhero team ''The Avengers''. As such, this fast-moving hour qualifies as more than just a cut-and-paste job from electronic press kits, although there's an element of that, certainly."&lt;ref name="VarietySpecialReview" /&gt; The special was released on September 9, 2014 on the home media for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' season 1.&lt;ref name="SHIELDS1HomeMedia" /&gt;

===={{anchor|Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!}}''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!'' (2014)====
In September 2014, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer Jeffrey Bell stated that in order to meet production demands and avoid having to air repeat episodes, ABC would likely air a Marvel special in place of a regular installment at some point during the first ten episodes of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s second season.&lt;ref name="BellSep2014" /&gt; In October, the special was revealed to be ''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!'', which was hosted by [[Emily VanCamp]], who portrays [[Sharon Carter|Agent 13]] in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', and aired on November 4, 2014.&lt;ref name="PulptoPop" /&gt; The special features behind the scenes footage from ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'', as well as footage from the ''Agent Carter'' television series previously screened at [[New York Comic-Con]].&lt;ref name="IGNSpecial2Review" /&gt; Brian Lowry of ''Variety'' felt an hour for the special did not "do the topic justice" adding, "For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or [[Steve Ditko]], ''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop!'' should probably be required viewing. Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs."&lt;ref name="VarietySpecial2Review" /&gt; Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, "Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by ''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!'', but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined."&lt;ref name="IGNSpecial2Review" /&gt;

===Books===
In September 2015, Marvel announced the ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe'', named as a nod to the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]''. Each guidebook is compiled by Mike O'Sullivan and the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' team, with cover art from [[Mike del Mundo]] and Pascal Campion, and features facts about the MCU films, film-to-comic comparisons, and production stills. ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Iron Man'', ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Incredible Hulk / Marvel's Iron Man 2'',&lt;ref name="Guidebook" /&gt; ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Thor'',&lt;ref name="GuidebookThor" /&gt; and ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger''&lt;ref name="GuidebookCapTFA" /&gt; released each month from October 2015 to January 2016, respectively.

In November 2018, Marvel and [[Titan Publishing Group]] released ''Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years'' to celebrate the first ten years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe which featured cast interviews, in-depth sections on each film, and an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] guide.&lt;ref name="TitanFirstTenYears" /&gt; In May 2019, in conjunction with the release of the fourth ''Avengers'' film, a two-volume book, also titled ''Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years'', will be released, written by Tara Bennett and Paul Terry.

===''A Mini Marvel''===
In February 2016, a commercial for [[Coca-Cola]] mini cans aired during [[Super Bowl 50]]. ''A Mini Marvel'' was created by [[Wieden+Kennedy]] for Coca-Cola through a partnership with Marvel, and was directed by the [[Russo brothers]].&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke2" /&gt; In the ad, [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] (voiced by [[Paul Rudd]], reprising his role) and the Hulk first fight, and then bond, over a Coke mini can.&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke" /&gt; [[Luma Pictures]] provided visual effects for the spot, having worked previously with the two characters in MCU films. For the Hulk, Luma redefined its previous muscular system and simulation process to create and render the character, while Ant-Man received new motion capture.&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke2" /&gt; The Super Bowl campaign extended to "limited-edition Coke mini cans [six packs] that are emblazoned with images of Marvel characters, including Hulk, Ant-Man, Black Widow, [Falcon, Iron Man] and Captain America." Consumers had the opportunity to purchase the cans by finding hidden clues in the commercial, though "if the program goes well, Coke will consider making the cans available in stores."&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke" /&gt; The ad had the third most social media activity of all the film-related trailers that aired during the game,&lt;ref name="DeadlineCoke" /&gt; and was nominated for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Commercial at the [[Visual Effects Society Awards 2016|15th Visual Effects Society Awards]].&lt;ref name="MiniMarvelVESNom" /&gt;

The '''Northcote Koori Mural''' is located in St Georges Road [[Thornbury, Victoria]] in the [[City of Darebin]]. It was designed by former [[Northcote High School]] art teacher [[Megan Evans]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://meganevans.asia/meganevans.asia/Biography.html Megan Evans Visual Artist, Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with members of the Thornbury-based [[Aborigines Advancement League]], which owns the mural.

Evans worked with Aboriginal artist and elder [[Lin Onus]] researching and designing the mural in collaboration with members of the Victorian Aboriginal Community, and it was painted in between 1983 and 1985, by trainee artists including Les Griggs, a Gunditjmara man (1962–93), Ray Thomas, Millie Yarran, Ian Johnson and Elaine Trott and many other volunteers.

The Northcote Koori Mural  was originally located opposite the [[Northcote Town Hall]] on Council land in High Street. this site was later sold and the mural was moved to the Aboriginal Advancement League in St. Georges Road, Thornbury where a large, free-standing wall was erected specifically to accommodate the mural on the edge of the Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] Sporting Complex. Megan Evans considered the artwork significant because “…it was a landmark for the Aboriginal community at that time and because Northcote Council was prepared to support a project which was politically ahead of its time.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofdarebin.vic.gov.au/Files/Creating_Place.pdf Creating Place, Public Art Policy and Practice in Darebin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209195843/http://www.cityofdarebin.vic.gov.au/Files/Creating_Place.pdf |date=9 February 2012 }} Arts &amp; Cultural Planning Unit of Darebin City Council with the assistance of Sarah Poole Arts Management&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the local council sold the land where the mural was situated and it was relocated to nearby St George’s Road, Thornbury, close to the AAL’s current location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowitja.org.au/sites/default/files/docs/Sort-of-like-reading-a-map-amended.pdf Fran Edmonds with Maree Clarke ‘'SORT OF LIKE READING A MAP A COMMUNITY REPORT ON THE SURVIVAL OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART SINCE 1834'' page 29, Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health, 2009] {{ISBN|978-0-7340-4090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darebin Council allocated $10,000 in its 2011-12 budget for a report on how to restore the artwork and then a further $80,000 in the 2012-13 budget for the mural's conservation and restoration, after it had become dilapidated from weather and an occasional target of graffiti vandals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://northcote-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/cash-ensures-brighter-picture-for-thornbury-mural/ 'Cash ensures brighter picture for Thornbury mural Council' ''Northcote Leader'' 11 Jul 12 by Madeline Healey]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''property designer''' or '''prop designer''' is a person who designs [[theatrical property|props]] for use in theatre, film, television, etc. Prop designers work in liaison with the [[costume designer]]s, [[set designer]]s and [[sound designer]]s, under the direction of the [[art director]] or [[technical director]].

However, the public seems to associate the term with home designer, or an [[interior designer]], a person who is considered a professional in the field of interior design or one who designs interiors as part of their job.

'''The Prospect Theatre Company''' was an English company founded, as '''Prospect Productions''', in 1961. Based at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre, Cambridge]] from 1964 until 1969, the company, with [[Toby Robertson]] as artistic director and [[Richard Cottrell]] as associate director, toured both nationally and internationally with a mainly classical repertoire, providing notable appearances of such actors as [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Timothy West]]. The company became closely associated with the [[Edinburgh Festival]] after its first appearance there in 1967. Separating from the Arts Theatre in 1969, the company, renamed The Prospect Theatre Company, survived without a permanent base for the next eight years under the direction of Toby Robertson, mounting productions in which [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[Dorothy Tutin]] made significant appearances. Eventually the company found a new home at London's [[Old Vic]] in 1977: two years later it became the Old Vic Theatre Company. Though noted for its exemplary ensemble playing, the company lost its [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] funding in 1980 after Timothy West's first season as Robertson's successor, leading to Prospect's demise.

==Early years, Cambridge and Edinburgh==
[[Iain Mackintosh]], [[Richard Cottrell]] and [[Elizabeth Sweeting]] formed Prospect Productions in 1961 to present a summer season of plays at the [[Oxford Playhouse]]. A successful first season led to a further season in 1962. The following year, when the Playhouse closed for renovations, Prospect became a touring company associated with the [[Century Theatre (UK)|Century Theatre]]. [[Toby Robertson]] directed the last play of the season, [[Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'', with [[Eileen Atkins]] and [[Trevor Martin]]. The production opened the newly restored [[Georgian Theatre Royal]] in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]], then transferred to the [[Vaudeville Theatre]], London. The success of the Oxford seasons prompted the idea that Prospect should present productions beyond the summer season each year.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Prospect Theatre Company | work = | publisher =Ian McKellen Stage | date = | url =http://www.mckellen.com/stage/r2/prospect.htm | doi = | accessdate = 4 September 2014 | archiveurl =  | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, with support from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and [[Dadie Rylands|Dr. George Rylands]], Prospect became a touring company based at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre, Cambridge]], with Toby Robertson as artistic director, Richard Cottrell as associate director, and Iain Mackintosh as administrator. Between 1964 and 1966 Prospect staged 15 productions, presenting well-known plays as well as several rarely performed Classics including Vanbrugh's ''The Confederacy'', with [[Robert Eddison]] and [[Hy Hazell]], to celebrate the third centenary of Vanbrugh's birth, and [[Etherege]]'s ''[[The Man of Mode]]'', and a number of new plays. [[Timothy West]] joined the Company in 1966 to play [[Prospero]]. Later that year Prospect had its first invitation to the [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

Prospect's first Edinburgh Festival appearance in 1967 was with [[Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', [[Lila Kedrova]] playing Madam Ranyevskaya in Cottrell's production. The production transferred to London, where Kedrova won the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' Best Actress of the Year Award. 1968 saw the production of Prospect's first "musical" - Gay's ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'', which was also the first Prospect show to be televised, and in 1969 the Company appeared for the first time at the Assembly Hall.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

At the 1969 Edinburgh festival [[Ian McKellen]] made his breakthrough performances with the company as [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] (directed by Cottrell) and Marlowe's [[Edward II (play)|Edward II]] (directed by Robertson), the latter in the play's first professional revival for 300 years and causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-toby-robertson-obe-theatre-director-1-2400165| publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' | accessdate=2013-09-16 | date=6 September 2012 | title= Obituary: Toby Robertson, OBE, theatre director | first=Alasdair | last= Steven | work=The Scotsman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy West appeared as McKellen's sparring partner in both those productions,&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt; which subsequently toured Britain and Europe before being staged at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in London and breaking box-office records at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/08/toby-robertson | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | accessdate=2013-09-16 | date=8 July 2012 | title= Toby Robertson obituary| first=Michael | last=Coveney | work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1967 and 1977 Prospect was invited to appear at eight Edinburgh International Festivals, and largely as a result of its close association with the Edinburgh Festival, Prospect was asked to tour abroad for the British Council, visiting the Middle East, Russia, Hong Kong, and Australia.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

==Years of touring==
In 1969 the Company was asked to extend its touring to the large "No 1" theatres in the regions; at the same time the Cambridge Arts Theatre wanted Prospect to help in the formation of a new theatre company. As these two developments pointed in totally different directions with implications of a conflicting scale of work, Richard Cottrell left Prospect to become director of the newly formed [[Cambridge Arts Theatre#Cambridge Theatre Company|Cambridge Theatre Company]]: Toby Robertson became cirector of Prospect, and its role as the UK's leading touring company was recognised, with its new name - The Prospect Theatre Company.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

Under Robertson, the company pioneered a style of production in which stage designs and setting were kept to a minimum, partly from the belief that Shakespeare's plays in particular benefited from an uncluttered approach; this style also suited the company's needs when touring regional theatres, for which flexibility of staging was essential.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Emphasis was placed instead on quality acting and strikingly designed costumes, complemented by lighting and incidental music.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt; [[Carl Davis]] composed several scores for the company, including for a modern dress production of ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'' (1971), ''[[Pericles]]'' (1973), and ''Pilgrim's Progress'' (1974/5) which led directly to the musical ''War Music'' (1977) with words by [[Homer]] and [[Christopher Logue]] and music by Donald Fraser.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

From 1970 to 1976 four major productions were created each year. As the only major company touring nationally, the choice of repertoire tended to be drawn more from the classics at the expense of new work. But alongside several Shakespeare productions the company staged such plays as [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'', [[Charles Macklin]]'s ''The Man of the World'', [[Turgenev]]'s ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' (with Derek Jacobi, Timothy West and Dorothy Tutin, who won two major acting awards for her performance), Chekhov's ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', and [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Royal Hunt of the Sun]]''. A series of chamber works were commissioned, including Jane McCulloch's ''The Grand Tour'' for the Entry into Europe celebrations - an entertainment seen in London, Edinburgh, and the 1974 Brighton Festival.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

The strain of touring and meeting the increasingly high standards expected by theatre audiences throughout the country began to tell, and even with occasional London seasons either at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Round House]] or in the West end, it was felt increasingly desirable that Prospect should once again have a permanent and preferably metropolitan base to sustain its regional work.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowell157&gt;Rowell, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joining the Old Vic==
[[Image:Waterloo the old vic 1.jpg|thumb|alt=The Old Vic, London.|The Old Vic Theatre, London]]
Looking for a suitable London base, Robertson believed that the [[Old Vic]] would best meet the company's needs and would add lustre to its reputation. For two years he sustained a campaign for the Old Vic to make Prospect its resident company.&lt;ref name=rowell157/&gt; For the Old Vic, Robertson's overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged  by other companies at the theatre; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including ''Hamlet'' with Derek Jacobi,  ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' with [[Alec McCowen]] and Dorothy Tutin; and ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' with [[Eileen Atkins]].&lt;ref name=rowell158&gt;Rowell, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =History of the Old Vic, 1950-1999 | work = | publisher =The Old Vic | date = | url =http://www.oldvictheatre.com/about-us/history-of-the-old-vic-2/1950-1999/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 5 September 2014 | archiveurl = | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July the Governors of The Old Vic announced "a marriage that was all but a merger" between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of The Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of The Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

One major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect's funding by the Arts Council: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the Council - already funding the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in London - could not accept a case for a third major company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect's first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre's finances to breaking point.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. The company played a five-month season from January to May 1978, adding ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' to their repertory, and a four-month season from September to December presenting ''[[The Rivals]]'', ''[[The Lady's Not for Burning]]'' with Atkins, and ''[[King Lear]]'' with [[Anthony Quayle]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, pp. 159-60&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled "Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company".&lt;ref name=rowell160&gt;Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately Prospect's touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi's ''Hamlet'' (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country),&lt;ref name=Continuum/&gt; followed by ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' with [[Ian Richardson]].&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; The following season, however, proved controversial: the double bill of ''The Padlock'' and ''[[Miss in Her Teens]]'', to mark the bicentenary of [[David Garrick]]'s death, and a revival of ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]'' were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory.&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; An internal report by Prospect now questioned "whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the [Arts Council] Director of Touring's requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was in effect fired from the post of artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in China, Timothy West replacing him.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The following season, West's first as Robertson's successor, saw ''Macbeth'' with [[Peter O'Toole]], ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt; On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the Company, sealing its demise.&lt;ref name=Continuum&gt;{{cite book | last =Hunter | first =Adriana

Appeals to the Council for funding to be reinstated were denied. The company gave a final season at the Old Vic staging ''The Merchant of Venice'', then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt;

For decades in the U.S., there have been isolated incidents of '''removal of Confederate monuments and memorials''', although generally opposed in [[#Public opinion|public opinion]] polls, and [[#Laws hindering removals|several U.S. States]] have passed laws over 115 years to hinder or prohibit further removals.

In the wake of the [[Charleston church shooting]] in June 2015, several municipalities in the United States removed monuments and memorials on public property dedicated to the [[Confederate States of America]].

The vast majority of these Confederate monuments were built during the era of [[Jim Crow laws]] (1877–1954) and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] (1954–1968).

[[Dell Upton]], [[Society of American Historians]], 13 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments have thus become highly politicized; according to Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and a scholar of Civil War history: "If [[white nationalist]]s and [[neo-Nazi]]s are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again".&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

In some Southern states, [[state law (United States)|state law]] restricts or prohibits altogether the removal or alteration of public Confederate monuments. According to Stan Deaton, senior historian at the [[Georgia Historical Society]], "These laws are the [[Old South]] imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more. This is what led to the Civil War, and it still divides us as a country. We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In the South, Confederate monuments often protected, hard to remove thanks to state laws |last1=Bliss |first1=Jessica |last2=Meyer |first2=Holly |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=August 17, 2017 |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/08/17/south-confederate-monuments-often-protected-hard-remove-state-laws/573226001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Confederate monuments concerned were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when [[Jim Crow laws]] were being introduced in the late 19th century and at the start of the 20th century or during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.{{efn|Graham (2016) "Many of the treasured monuments that seem to offer a connection to the ''post-bellum'' South are actually much later, anachronistic constructions, and they tend to correlate closely with periods of fraught racial relations".&lt;ref name="graham-theatlantic-2016"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/the-stubborn-persistence-of-confederate-monuments/479751/ |title=Why Are There Still So Many Confederate Monuments? |last=Graham |first=David A. |date=April 26, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |access-date=August 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|Graham (2016) "A timeline of the genesis of the Confederate sites shows two notable spikes.

According to historian Jane Dailey from [[University of Chicago]], in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "[[white supremacy in the United States|white supremacist]] future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future' |website=npr.org |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian, Karyn Cox, from the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/16/the-whole-point-of-confederate-monuments-is-to-celebrate-white-supremacy/ |title=Analysis – The whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy |first=Karen L. |last=Cox |date=August 16, 2017 |accessdate=September 23, 2017|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historian from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], James Leloudis, stated that "The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article167619947.html |title=Durham Confederate statue: tribute to dying veterans or political tool of Jim Crow South? |website=heraldsun.com |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at [[Washington College]], stated in ''National Geographic'': "They're 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people."&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

==Academic commentary==
In an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy, the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) said that to remove a monument "is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history." The AHA noted that most monuments were erected "without anything resembling a democratic process," and recommended that it was "time to reconsider these decisions." According to the AHA, most Confederate monuments were erected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and this undertaking was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South." According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life." A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."&lt;ref&gt;American Historical Association, [https://www.historians.org/news-and-advocacy/statements-and-resolutions-of-support-and-protest/aha-statement-on-confederate-monuments AHA Statement on Confederate Monuments] (August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Adam Goodheart, the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/16/regime-change-in-charlottesville-215500 |title=Regime Change in Charlottesville|author= |date= |website=politico.com |accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elijah Anderson]], a professor of sociology at Yale University, said the statues "really impacts the psyche of black people."&lt;ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish"/&gt; [[Harold Holzer]], the director of the [[Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College]], agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaperstoilas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stoilas |first1=Helen|last2=Stapley-Brown|first2=Victoria |title=Charlottesville riot hastens removal of Confederate monuments throughout the US |url=https://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/charlottesville-riot-hastens-removal-of-confederate-monuments-throughout-the-us/ |accessdate=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Art Newspaper |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dell Upton]], chair of the Department of Art History at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], wrote that "the monuments were not intended as public art," but rather were installed "as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity," and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent, their removal from civic spaces was a matter "of justice, equity, and civic values."&lt;ref name=SAHUpton/&gt; In a 1993 book, author Frank McKenney argued otherwise; "These monuments were communal efforts, public art, and social history," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;McKenney, Frank M., The Standing Army: History of Georgia's County Confederate Monuments, WH Wolfe Associates, Alpharetta, Georgia, 1993 p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;  Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women, the "mothers widows, and orphans, the bereaved fiancees and sisters" of the soldiers who had lost their lives.{{sfn|McKenney|1993|p=1}}  Many ladies' memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War, most of them joining the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] following its inception in 1894.  The women were advised to "remember that they were buying art, not metal and stone;"{{sfn|McKenney|1993|p=5}} The history the monuments celebrated told only one side of the story, however—one that was "openly pro-Confederate," Upton argues. Furthermore, Confederate monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.&lt;ref name=SAHUpton/&gt; According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at [[Villanova University]], "White supremacy is really what these statues represent."&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;[https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0822/Confederate-monuments-What-to-do-with-them Confederate monuments: What to do with them?].

Robert Seigler in his study of Confederate monuments in South Carolina found that out of the over one hundred and seventy that he documented, only five monuments were found dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy working "on fortifications, and had served as musicians, teamsters, cooks, servants, and in other capacities," four of those were to slaves and one to a musician, Henry Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Seigler, Robert S., A Guide to Confederate Monuments in South Carolina: Passing the Cup, South Carolina Department of Archives and History, 1997 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheryl Benard, president of the Alliance for the Restoration of Cultural Heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archinternational.org/team/|title=Team - ARCH International|work=ARCH International|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued against the removal of Confederate war monuments in an op-ed for the [[The National Interest|National Interest]], writing, "From my vantage point, the idea that the way to deal with history is to destroy any relics that remind you of something you don't like, is highly alarming."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/destroying-confederate-monuments-hurts-us-all%E2%80%94-accomplishes-22142|title=Destroying Confederate Monuments Hurts Us All—and Accomplishes Nothing|last=Benard|first=Cheryl|work=The National Interest|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard compares the removal to "historic cleansing" in other countries, stating "Tour the archaeological ruins of any formerly great civilization, and you will invariably encounter inscriptions that have been chiseled away, faces that have been obliterated, heads that have been struck off the rumps of their statues. Someone overthrows or assassinates a predecessor and orders his or her name and image removed. ... What could have remained is their story, and any lessons later humans might draw from it."&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

[[Eric Foner]], a historian of the Civil War and biographer of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], argued that more statues of African-Americans like [[Nat Turner]] should be constructed.&lt;ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Munshi |first1=Neil |title=Trump says it is 'foolish' to remove Confederate symbols |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e7496854-82a1-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff |accessdate=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Brophy]], a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues "facilitates forgetting", although these statues were "re-inscribed images of white supremacy".

Civil War historian [[James I. Robertson Jr.]] referred to the current climate to dismantle or destroy Confederate monuments as an "age of idiocy" and motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of Americans have painfully constructed" and the monuments were not a "Jim Crow signal of defiance."&lt;ref&gt;Speech of James I.

The removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a 2/3 vote of both houses of the legislature, as would the removal of any other Confederate monument in South Carolina.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse |title=Confederate flag removed from South Carolina capitol in victory for activists |last=Holpuch |first=Amanda |date=2015-07-10 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2017-10-10 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate monuments are largely located in cities, which, like other American cities, in the twentieth century became more black and more liberal politically than the remainder of the states in which they are located.

In another legal impediment to removal, the Board of Trustees of the [[University of North Carolina]] prohibited for 16 years the renaming of any university memorials. This was triggered by the University's 2014 decision to rename Saunders Hall (see [[Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials#North Carolina|below]]).

==Public opinion==
A 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of American adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. The results were split along racial and political lines, with Republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, and Democrats and minorities preferring their removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-protests-poll/a-majority-of-americans-want-to-preserve-confederate-monuments-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1B12EG |title=A majority of Americans want to preserve Confederate monuments: Reuters/Ipsos poll |date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-confederate-monuments-2017-08-22 |title=Reuters/Ipsos Data: Confederate Monuments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2017 poll, by HuffPost/YouGov, found that 48% of respondents favored the "remain" option, 33% favored removal, and 18% were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/confederate-statues-removal-polls_us_599de056e4b05710aa59841c |title=Polls Find Little Support For Confederate Statue Removal -- But How You Ask Matters |first=Ariel |last=Edwards-Levy |date=August 23, 2017|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPConfederateFlag20170815.pdf |title=HuffPost: Confederate Flag, August 15 - 16, 2017 - 1000 US Adults|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What to do with the plinths (pedestals)==
In the case of many monuments, after they are removed the pedestals or plinths remain. What to do with them has been the subject of some discussion. In the case of the toppled ''Silent Sam'' monument at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, two scholars propose leaving the "empty pedestal — shorn all original images and inscriptions — [which] eliminates the offending tribute while still preserving a record of what these communities did and where they did it.... The most effective way to commemorate the rise and fall of white supremacist monument-building is to preserve unoccupied pedestals as the ruins that they are — broken tributes to a morally bankrupt cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ethan J. |last1=Kytle |first2=Blain |last2=Roberts |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 22, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/silent-sam-confederate-monument-north-carolina.html |title=Broken Tributes to a Morally Bankrupt Cause}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baltimore, one of the four empty plinths has been used, with eventual city tolerance though not approval, for a statue of a pregnant black woman, naked from the waist up, holding a baby in a brightly-covered sling on her back, with a raised golden fist: ''Madre Luz'' (''Mother Light''). The statue was first placed in front of the monument before its removal, then raised to the pedestal. According to the artist [[Pablo Machioli]], "his original idea was to construct a statue of [[Harriet Tubman]] throwing a brick, but he rejected that as too violent and chose instead a pregnant mother as a symbol of life. 'I feel like people would understand and respect that'". (The statue has been vandalized several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5033">The '''Romantic hero''' is a [[Archetypal literary criticism|literary archetype]] referring to a character that rejects established norms and conventions, has been rejected by society, and has himself (or herself) as the center of his or her own existence.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wilson | first = James D. | title = Tirso, hat, and Byron: The emergence of Don Juan as romantic hero | journal = The South Central Bulletin | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 246–248 | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of The South Central Modern Language Association | date = Winter 1972 | jstor = i359767  | issn = 0038-321X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic hero is often the [[protagonist]] in a literary work, and the primary focus is on the character's thoughts rather than his or her actions. 

==Characteristics==
Literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] noted that the Romantic hero is often "placed outside the structure of civilization and therefore represents the force of physical nature, amoral or ruthless, yet with a sense of power, and often leadership, that society has impoverished itself by rejecting".&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt; Other characteristics of the Romantic hero include [[introspection]], the triumph of the individual over the "restraints of theological and social conventions",&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt; [[wanderlust]], [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[misanthropy]], alienation, and isolation.&lt;ref name="knapp"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Knapp | first = Bettina L. | title = Review: The Romantic hero and his heirs in French literature | journal = The French Review | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 787–788 | publisher = American Association of Teachers of French | date = April 1986 | jstor = i216560  | issn = 0016-111X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another common trait of the Romantic hero is regret for his or her actions, and [[self-criticism]], often leading to [[philanthropy]], which stops the character from ending romantically. An example of this trait is [[Edmond Dantès]] in'' [[The Count of Monte Cristo]].''{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Usually estranged from his more grounded, realist biological family and leading a rural, solitary life, the Romantic hero may nevertheless have a long-suffering love interest, him or herself victimised by the hero's rebellious tendencies, with their fates intertwined for decades, sometimes from their youths to their deaths. (See [[Eugene Onegin#Main characters|Tatyana Larina]], [[Elizabeth Bennet]], [[Eugenie Grandet]], et al.)
==History==
The Romantic hero first began appearing in literature during the [[Romantic period]], in works by such authors as [[Byron]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Goethe]], and [[Pushkin]], and is seen in part as a response to the [[French Revolution]]. As [[Napoleon]], the "living model of a hero",&lt;ref name="furst"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Furst | first = Lilian R. | title = The romantic hero, or is he an anti-hero? | journal = Studies in the Literary Imagination | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–67 | date = Spring 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; became a disappointment to many, the typical notion of the hero as upholding social order began to be challenged.

==Examples==
Classic literary examples of the Romantic hero include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/art-literature/examples-romantic-hero-4e211e217849629e#|website=Reference.com|title=What are examples of a romantic hero?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''secondary color''' is a [[color]] made by [[color mixing|mixing]] of two [[primary color]]s in a given [[color space]].

==Additive secondaries==
{{Main|Additive color}}

===Light (RGB)===
{{Main|RGB color model}}

For the human eye, good primary colors of light are [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]].  Combining lights of these colors produces a large range of visible colors.

{| style="background-color:gray;border-width:8px;border-style:groove" cellpadding="2px"
|-
| rowspan=5 | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan=8 | &amp;nbsp;
| rowspan=5 | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
| align="center" | [[green]]
| {{color|lime|(●)}}
| +
| align="center" | [[red]]
| {{color|red|(●)}}
| =
| align="center" | [[yellow]]
| {{color|yellow|(●)}}
|-
| align="center" | [[red]]
| {{color|red|(●)}}

| {{color|blue|(●)}}
| =

| {{color|magenta|(●)}}
|-

| {{color|blue|(●)}}

| align="center" | [[green]]
| {{color|lime|(●)}}
| =
| align="center" | [[cyan]]
| {{color|cyan|(●)}}
|-
| colspan=9 | &amp;nbsp;
|}

That is, the primary and secondary RGB colors (with secondary colors in boldface) are: 
{|
|-
|width=10%|{{legend|lime|&lt;br&gt;green}}
|width=10%|{{legend|yellow|&lt;br&gt;'''yellow'''}}
|width=10%|{{legend|red|&lt;br&gt;red}}
|width=10%|{{legend|magenta|&lt;br&gt;'''magenta'''}}
|width=10%|{{legend|blue|&lt;br&gt;blue}}
|width=10%|{{legend|cyan|&lt;br&gt;'''cyan'''}}
|width=10%|{{legend|lime|&lt;br&gt;green}}
|}

Combining RGB colors means adding light (thus the term "additive color"), and the combinations are brighter.  When all three primaries are combined in equal amounts, the result is [[white]].

The RGB secondary colors produced by the addition of light turn out to be good primary colors for pigments, the mixing of which subtracts light.

==Subtractive secondaries==
{{Main|Subtractive color}}

Pigments, such as inks and paint, display color by absorbing some wavelengths of light and reflecting the remainder.  When pigments are combined, they absorb the combination of their colors, and reflect less.  Thus, combining pigments results in a darker color.  This is called subtractive color-mixing, as mixing pigments subtracts wavelengths from the light that is reflected.

===Printing (CMYK)===
{{Main|CMYK color model}}
The mixture of equal amounts of these colors produce the secondary colors [[red]], [[blue]], and [[lime (color)|"lime" green]] (the RGB primary colors of light), as follows:

{| style="background-color:gray;border-width:8px;border-style:groove" cellpadding="2px"
|-
| rowspan=5 | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan=8 | &amp;nbsp;

| {{color|red|(●)}}
|-
| align="center" | [[magenta]]
| {{color|magenta|(●)}}
| +
| align="center" | [[cyan]]
| {{color|cyan|(●)}}
| =
| align="center" | [[blue]]
| {{color|blue|(●)}}
|-
| align="center" | [[cyan]]
| {{color|cyan|(●)}}
| +
| align="center" | [[yellow]]
| {{color|yellow|(●)}}
| =
| align="center" | [[green]]
| {{color|lime|(●)}}
|-
| colspan=9 | &amp;nbsp;
|}

That is, the primary and secondary CMY colors (with secondary colors in boldface) are: 
{|
|-
|width=10%|{{legend|yellow|&lt;br&gt;yellow}}
|width=10%|{{legend|red|&lt;br&gt;'''red'''}}
|width=10%|{{legend|magenta|&lt;br&gt;magenta}}
|width=10%|{{legend|blue|&lt;br&gt;'''blue'''}}
|width=10%|{{legend|cyan|&lt;br&gt;cyan}}
|width=10%|{{legend|lime|&lt;br&gt;'''green'''}}
|width=10%|{{legend|yellow|&lt;br&gt;yellow}}
|}

Ideally, combining three perfect primary colors in equal amounts would produce [[black]], but this is impossible to achieve in practice. Therefore a "key" pigment, usually black, is added to printing to produce dark shades more efficiently. This combination is referred to as [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], where K stands for Key.

===Traditional painting (RYB)===
{{Main|RYB color model}}
Before the discovery of CMY, at least as far back as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], the best primary colors were thought to be [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]]. Mixing these pigments in equal amounts produces [[orange (colour)|orange]], [[green]], and [[purple]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called [[violet (color)|violet]]. This model is commonly used in painting today. &lt;/ref&gt;

| {{color|#FF8000|(●)}}
|-

| {{color|red|(●)}}

The '''Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp''' ({{lang-fa|شاهنامه شاه‌طهماسب}}) or '''Houghton Shahnameh''' is one of the most famous illustrated manuscripts of the [[Shahnameh]], the [[national epic]] of [[Greater Iran]], and a high point in the art of the [[Persian miniature]].  It is probably the most fully illustrated manuscript of the text ever produced.  As created, it had 759 pages, 258 with a miniature.  The page size is about 48 x 32&amp;nbsp;cm, and the text written in [[Nastaʿlīq script]] of the highest quality.  It was broken up in the 1970s and pages are now in a number of collections.&lt;ref name="Leoni"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leoni|first1=Francesca|title=The Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp: Heilbrunn Template of Art History|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/shnm/hd_shnm.htm|website=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was created in [[Tabriz]] at the order of Shah [[Ismail I]] by the most prominent artists of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persia]], either intended as a gift to [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], or perhaps to celebrate the return of his son Tahmasp from a period as governor of [[Herat]].&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky and Rogers, 112&lt;/ref&gt;  The work began in the 1520s, before the death of Ismail I in 1524, and was probably mostly complete by the mid-1530s,&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf, 424&lt;/ref&gt; in the reign of [[Tahmasp I]]. It was finally given to the then Ottoman Sultan, [[Selim II]], in 1568, presented by a delegation. It long remained in the [[Topkapı Palace]] library in [[Istanbul]], but appeared in the collection of [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] by 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf, 420&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript once contained 258 miniatures, but was split up by [[Houghton family|Arthur Houghton II]], who acquired it in 1959, and the miniatures sold individually.  Houghton donated 78 paintings to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1972, and others were sold individually. The Metropolitan's miniatures have been the subject of an exchange agreement with the [[National Museum of Iran]]. The dispersed miniatures are in several collections, including the [[Khalil collection]].&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky and Rogers, 112-117; Walther &amp; Wolf, 420&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2011, a page from this manuscript from the collection of the leading scholar of the manuscript, [[Stuart Cary Welch]], was sold for 7.4 million pounds ($12 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16th century folio sets Islamic art auction record|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sothebys-islamic-idUSTRE7353LZ20110406|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miniatures==
The huge scale of the work would have required help from all the leading artists of the royal workshop, including [[Mir Sayyid Ali]], [[Sultan Mohammad]], [[Aqa Mirak]], [[Mir Musavvir]], [[Dust Muhammad]], and probably [[Abd al-Samad]],&lt;ref&gt;Walther and Wolf, 420; for Abd al-Samad, see his biography; there is some controversy over his contributions&lt;/ref&gt; and the style of the miniatures varies considerably, though the quality is consistently high.  A number of artists have been identified from their style by scholars, but are not known by name.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky and Rogers, 112-117&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscript shows the fusion of the styles of the schools of Herat, where the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] royal workshops had developed a style of classical restraint and elegance, and the painters of Tabriz, whose style was more expressive and imaginative.  Tabriz was the former capital of the [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] rulers, successively of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ag Qoyunlu|Ağ Qoyunlu]], who had ruled much of Persia before Ismail I defeated them to begin the Safavid dynasty in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 80; Walther &amp; Wolf, 420-424&lt;/ref&gt;  Dust Muhammad wrote an account of Persian painting which mentions the manuscript, and is the first of many accounts to single out the ''Court of Guyumars'' (illustrated here), which he says is by Sultan Mohammad. Later scholars have called this miniature "matchless" and "probably the greatest picture in Iranian art".&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 83; Welch, 17, both quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous unfinished miniature showing [[Rustam]] asleep, while his horse [[Rakhsh]] fights off a lion, was probably made for the manuscript, but was never finished and bound in, perhaps because its vigorous Tabriz style did not please Tahmasp. It appears to be by Sultan Mohammad, whose later works in the manuscript show a style adapted to the court style of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]].  It is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Con Colleano on a slack-wire, circa 1920.jpg|thumb|Con Colleano on a slack-wire, circa 1920]]
'''Slackwire (Slack wire)''' is an [[acrobatic]] [[circus]] act, that involves the balancing skills of moving along a flexible/slack thin wire suspended in the air, connected to two anchor points. 
Not to be confused with [[Slackline|slacklining]].

==Description and setup ==

Usually "slack wire" utilizes a steel wire {{cvt|4|-|8|mm|frac=16}} in diameter fixed between two anchor points.
It can have two single stands with two extending wire pieces each to install the apparatus in an arena, 
or two "A" frames stands with one extending wire piece for each. It can also be mounted between two trees at an appropriate distance apart or fixed to a ceiling or any points which are strong enough to hold a performer's weight.

Wire walking artists usually use soft shoes made of leather.

===Slack Rope (Slackrope)===

A slack rope is very similar to a slack wire. The difference between a slack rope and a slackwire is in the characteristics of rope and wire. 
A slack rope usually utilizes a rope {{cvt|10|-|20|mm|frac=16}} in diameter. For both slack wire and slack rope, there are pluses and minuses to do stunts.
For example, it is easier and more comfortable to do "sliding" tricks on a wire than on a rope. On a Slack rope a performer can walk without shoes, but that is painful on a Slackwire. In addition, a Slack rope is very similar to a [[Cloud Swing]].

===Technique of Balance and Angle of Slackwire===
The technique of balance – a performer balances or moves on the wire while needing to control the wire beneath him from moving abruptly side to side, making continual adjustments. This skill is similar to balancing a stick on one’s head or on a finger. Each Slackwire performer usually uses his/her own preferred angle of slack and length of the wire.

The slack angle is the V-shaped angle created when a performer stands in the middle of the walking part of the wire. The angle depends on how long or short the wire is relative to the distance between two anchor points.  This also affects the swing amplitude of the wire side to side. Some slackwire artists change the angle of the wire during their act. See video in which a Chinese artist performs on the Slackwire, changing the angles of the wire with the help of a winch several times during the performance.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOWo56CmYrI  Video]

The degree of ease or difficulty for a performer to move the wire is dependent upon how thick the wire or rope is. The heavier the wire or rope, the more inertia is required to move it laterally, but also requires more force to contro; to movement or bring to bring it back to a place of rest.

===Skills===
The skills and stunts commonly performed on a slack Wire and slackrope include:

Beyond standing and walking artists can also do turns, lying own, knee stands, sliding, forward and backward rolls, splits, hand stands, including cartwheels, head stands. Props such as a ladder, chair, unicycle, bicycle, and even a rola-bola are incorporated into some acts.

Some more advanced Slackwire stunts are done while the wire is swinging, including standing, handstands, and walking. Slackwire balancing skills also can be combined with tricks as various kinds of juggling, balancing a stick on the performer’s head, playing a musical instrument, etc.
Some of the same skills can be seen in [[Cloud Swing]] or [[Trapeze]] acts as well.
		
====Jumping Rope on a Slack Wire====
[[Skipping rope|Jumping Rope]] is popular in many circus acts.
The skill has been performed on the ground in many variations, and on a [[Tightrope walking|Tightrope]], on a [[Slacklining|slackline]], but difficult on a slackwire because the wire moves when the performer jumps up and there is no way to control the swing and position of the wire when landing. This makes such stunts as somersaults and acrobatic tumbling virtually impossible.

Jumping rope on a slackwire was first accomplished in 1985. The only person to do the stunt is [[Sergey Alexandrovich Pavlov|Sergey Pavlov (the clown LALALA)]]
Sergey has even been able to complete up to 7 consecutive jumps.

*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYoqMWJNThA  Video - S. Pavlov - 4 skips and dancing]
*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URWheYZktVE Video - S. Pavlov - 5 skips]

==Similarities and Differences==

===Slackwire and Tightrope===
Slackwire and tightrope appear to be very similar skills to walking and balancing on a thin wire/rope. But actually the technique of balance is very different between them. 
[[File:Korea-Jeonju-Jultagi-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Tightrope performance (Korea)]]
The citation from [[Tightrope walking]]:
"Slackwire and tight wire/tightrope require different balancing techniques: tightrope performers keep their balance by shifting their weight over the rigid tight wire, while slackwire performers use a precise swinging motion to move the relaxed slackwire under their center of mass." Because of this, an artist who works on a tightrope cannot easily make a transition to the Slackwire. He/she needs to spend time to train himself/herself to balance in this different manner and vice versa for artists working first on a slackwire.


Some tight-wire artists demonstrate a stunt called “the swings”. 
An artist takes the position on the wire, then his assistant reduces the tightness/tension of the wire and the artist demonstrates “swings.” The tight wire is adjusted to a slightly less tight condition. This stunt involves multiple skills to maintain balance. After the demonstration the assistant adjusts the wire back to its original tightness/tension.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5znx0XY9jo video - Volzhansky family "Prometheus"/"Прометей", 1977" (timer: 4:55)]

The same stunt can also be demonstrated on a slackline.

===Slack Wire and [[Slacklining|Slackline]]===
[[File:Slackline in the sun.jpg|thumb|Slacklining in a park]]
There is confusion that Slackline means the same as Slackwire. They are not the same. They are different kinds of apparatuses that require different techniques of balancing.

The differences between Slackwire and Slackline:

* Slackwire utilizes a steel wire {{cvt|4|-|8|mm|frac=16}} in diameter, while Slackline utilizes a nylon webbing/strap approximately {{convert|2|in|-1|order=flip|abbr=in}} in width.
* Different Techniques of balancing: 
A slackwire has a loop and can be used like a swing, but a slackline has no loop. The line is stretched tight between two anchor points like a tightrope and can only swing within a very small amplitude.

* A slackline can be used like a trampoline, allowing for an easy landing on the line after a jump. In contrast, a Slackwire cannot be used like a trampoline, because when a performer jumps up from the loop of wire it will swing away with no way to anticipate its location upon landing.

'''St James' Church''', commonly known as '''St James', King Street''', is an [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] parish church in inner city [[Sydney, Australia]]. Consecrated in February 1824 and named in honour of [[St James the Great]], it became a parish church in 1835. Designed in the style of a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] town church by the [[Convicts in Australia|transported convict]] architect [[Francis Greenway]] during the governorship of [[Lachlan Macquarie]], St James' is part of the historical precinct of [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] which includes other early colonial era buildings such as the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]]. The church remains historically, socially and architecturally significant. The building is the oldest one extant in Sydney's inner city region. It is listed on the [[Register of the National Estate]], and [[Around the World in 80 Treasures|has been described as one of the world's 80 greatest man-made treasures]].

The church has maintained its special role in the city's religious, civic and musical life as well as its close associations with the city's legal and medical professions through its proximity to the law courts and [[Sydney Hospital]]. Its original ministry was to the convict population of Sydney and it has continued to serve the city's poor and needy in succeeding centuries.

Worship at St James' is in a style commonly found in the [[High Church]] and moderate [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a robed [[choir]] singing psalms, anthems and responses in contrast to the great majority of churches in the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]] where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with [[Low Church]] and [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical]] Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|ordination of women]].

===Foundation and consecration===
The building of St James' Church was commissioned by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] in 1819, designed by the convict architect [[Francis Greenway]] and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using [[convict labour#British Empire|convict labour]].&lt;ref name=Heritage /&gt; Governor Macquarie and [[John Bigge|Commissioner John Bigge]] laid the foundation stone on Thursday, 7 October 1819.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=5}}&lt;ref name=SundayTimes/&gt; The building was originally intended to serve as a [[courthouse]]&lt;ref name="SJKShistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sjks.org.au/welcome/church-history/|title=Church history|year=2014|publisher=St James' King Street|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Macquarie had plans for a large cathedral to be built on the present location of [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's Cathedral]] but they were put on hold by the intervention of Bigge who had been appointed to conduct a [[Royal Commission]] into the colonial government.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes/&gt;{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=3}} Bigge initially approved of the courthouse project but by February 1820, less than four months after his arrival, he strongly recommended its conversion into a church.

"The reason for Bigge's change of mind may be found in the appointment, three years later, of his brother-in-law [and secretary], Mr [[Thomas Hobbes Scott|TH Scott]], a wine merchant, as [[Archdeacon]]".&lt;ref name=lawlink&gt;{{cite web|title=King Street court complex|url=http://www.supremecourt.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/supremecourt/sco2_history/sco2_oldsupremecourt_building.html|work=About the Supreme Court|publisher=Supreme Court of New South Wales|accessdate=18 January 2014|year=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309030417/http://www.supremecourt.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/supremecourt/sco2_history/sco2_oldsupremecourt_building.html|archivedate=9 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the courthouse was modified before construction with the addition of a steeple at the western end, to serve as a church, while the adjacent school buildings were put into use as a courthouse.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=5}} The first service was held in the unfinished church on the Day of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], 6 January 1822, the text being from [[Isaiah]], Chapter 60: "Arise! Shine, for thy light has come. The glory of the Lord has risen upon thee". It was anticipated in the ''[[Sydney Gazette]]'s'' report of the event that the church, when fitted out with stalls and galleries, would hold 2,000 people.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes/&gt; The church was consecrated by the senior chaplain, the Reverend [[Samuel Marsden]], on 11 February 1824.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=5}}&lt;ref name=Heritage /&gt;

Before the building of St James', Sydney's growing population had been served by [[St Philip's Church, Sydney|St Philip's Church, York Street]]. However, as St James' was able to hold more people than St Philip's and clergy meetings as well as ordinations were held there, it quickly became the centre of official church activity.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=22}}

There was both official and general concern about the lack of morality within the predominantly male population, and the establishment of churches and of education was seen as a method of combatting this. The 19th-century church historian, Edward Symonds, credited a "better moral and spiritual tone" in the colony to "decent churches" and "the advent of additional clergy, headed by the Revd William Cowper, in 1808".{{sfn|Judd|Cable|2000|pp=6–18}}&lt;ref name=Symonds&gt;{{cite web|last=Symonds|first=Edwards|title=The Story of the Australian Church (with map)|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/aus/symonds1898/|publisher=Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge|accessdate=30 August 2013|location=London|year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rector of St James', the Reverend [[Richard Hill (priest)|Richard Hill]], was ordained specifically for colonial ministry and sent from London as assistant to [[William Cowper (Archdeacon of Cumberland)|William Cowper]] at St Philip's.&lt;ref name=ADBHill&gt;{{cite web|last=Cable|first=K.J.|title=Hill, Richard (1782–1836)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hill-richard-2182/text2805|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=21 December 2013|volume=1|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill was energetic and a good organiser, with progressive views on education. He instigated a number of projects to aid the community, including an infants' school in the [[crypt]] of the church and a [[Sunday School]].{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=8–11}}

The focus of the church's [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] at the time was on preaching and the church's interior reflected this.  The east end of the church had a triple-decker [[pulpit]] placed centrally, from which the service was led and the sermon preached. From this pulpit Bishops Broughton, Pattison, [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Selwyn]], [[Frederic Barker|Barker]] and [[Alfred Barry|Barry]] preached.&lt;ref name = T&amp;C1808/&gt; The parish clerk led the congregation in the responses from its lower level.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=8–11}} Between the three windows which at that time occupied the eastern wall, there were two large panels displaying the words of the [[Lord's Prayer]], the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Ten Commandments]].{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=8-11}} The church was full of [[box pew]]s which faced each other across a central aisle. The western end had a gallery, which is still in place, for the convicts. Pews were rented to provide a source of income for the church and the whole was arranged in "rigid social order" with the poor occupying the free seats.{{sfn|Judd|Cable|2000|pp=6–18}}{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=8–11}} Sunday services consisted of [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], with [[Holy Communion]] taking place only occasionally as an addition to the regular service. For this reason, there was no visual emphasis on the [[communion table]], which was a small portable one, and no [[reredos]].{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=8–11}}

St James' suffered from a major scandal in the late 1820s ("a period of personal quarrels and violent newspaper controversies"){{sfn|The Church|1963|p=7}} when Commissioner Bigge's secretary and brother-in-law, [[Thomas Hobbes Scott]], who had been made [[Archdeacon]] of [[New South Wales]] in 1825, came into conflict with a parishioner, [[Edward Smith Hall]].&lt;ref name=SundayTimes/&gt; Archdeacon Scott ordered that Hall should vacate the pew he rented at St James' for himself and his six daughters.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes/&gt; As Hall continued to occupy the pew, constables attended Sunday services to prevent his occupation of the pew by boarding it up and making it secure with iron bands.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=7}} Hall, critical of both the archdeacon and Governor [[Ralph Darling]], was also a partner with Arthur Hill in the ownership of newspaper [[The Monitor (Sydney, NSW)|''The Monitor'']]. He published an attack on the archdeacon, for which he was sued for libel. The courts fined him only [[Pound (currency)|£]]1 and placed him on a bond. Hall appealed to [[Reginald Heber]], [[Diocese of Calcutta of the Church of North India|Bishop of Calcutta]] (who was the relevant ecclesiastical authority at the time)&lt;ref name = T&amp;C1808/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Until Broughton returned from England in 1836 "with the title and authority of Bishop of Australia&amp;nbsp;...

The first major alteration to the church was the enclosing of the south portico to form a vestry.  In 1832 [[John Verge]] constructed another vestry at the eastern end of the church, in strict conformity with the architectural style of Greenway.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=11–19}} Growth of the congregation necessitated further changes. Galleries were added along the northern and eastern walls. As the three eastern windows had been blocked by Verge's vestry, the interior became increasingly badly lit with every change. Verge's solution was to pierce [[Rose window|ocular windows]] high in the walls to light the galleries.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=11–19}}

In 1836, the Reverend Richard Hill had a fit of [[apoplexy]] in the [[vestry]] and died.&lt;ref name=ADBHill/&gt; Soon after this dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, the Right Reverend [[William Grant Broughton]] was installed as [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney|Bishop of Australia]] during a service in St James' lasting five hours.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=19–21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17340959 |title=Broughton Centenary |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]])|date=18 May 1936 |accessdate=26 August 2013 |page=6 |author=Dr. Micklem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Macquarie's plans for a new cathedral on [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] had not come to fruition, Broughton acted as if St James' were a [[pro-cathedral]].{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=19–22}} Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard Hill at St James'.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=19–21}}{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=9}}

In 1839 the Reverend [[Robert Allwood]], educated at [[Eton College]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], arrived in Sydney{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=22}}&lt;ref name=ADBAllwood&gt;{{cite web|last=Cable|first=K.J.|title=Allwood, Robert (1803–1891)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/allwood-robert-1701/text1841|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|volume=1|accessdate=21 December 2013|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed to St James' by Bishop Broughton,{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=22}} in which parish he served for 44 years until his retirement in 1884. Allwood was an important patron of education in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Sydney. Under him, the parish school expanded and his teacher training college became a "model school".&lt;ref name=ADBAllwood/&gt; He was also the principal tutor at St James' College, which originally met in St James' parsonage (on the corner of King Street and Macquarie Street) until it was transferred to ''Lyndhurst'' at [[Glebe, New South Wales|The Glebe]].{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=36}}

In 1848, St James' was the venue for a full military funeral, "attended by 150 carriages"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/oconnell_maurice | title = O'Connell, Maurice | accessdate = 17 January 2014 | author = Samantha Frappell | year = 2012 | work = Dictionary of Sydney | publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1878 Allwood officiated at the [[wedding of Nora Robinson and Alexander Kirkman Finlay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13414065 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=8 August 1878 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the second [[vice-regal]] wedding in the colony this ceremony was attended by many dignitaries and attracted a "crushing" crowd of 10,000 cheering onlookers.&lt;ref name= QA1408&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30673943 |title=Marriage of Mr A.K.

Unlike Hill, Allwood advocated the principles of the [[Oxford Movement]] (also known as "Tractarianism" after its publication of [[Tracts for the Times]]), which stressed the historical continuity of the Church of England, and placed a high importance upon the sacraments and the liturgy.&lt;ref name=ADBAllwood/&gt;{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=25–28}} "The culmination" of a trend towards Tractarianism in the colony was the founding in 1845, of St James' College – "the first seminary for training local ordinands".{{sfn|Porter|1989|p=39}} However, many colonial Anglicans were unhappy with Tractarian trends because Roman Catholics "were equated with Irish",{{sfn|Porter|1989|p=39}} and with "Romanism". "Serious differences opinion in matters of doctrine" began to "escalate into public debate as the influences of the Oxford Movement began to be felt in the Australian colonies" in the 1840s.{{sfn|Frame|2007|p=57}}

Allwood's sermons were brief and Holy Communion was celebrated every Sunday. The [[Pipe organ|organ]], which had been installed in 1827, was moved to the space of the southern vestry, and the pulpit and reading desk place in front of it where they could be seen from all parts of the church. The holy table continued to be located at the eastern end of the building.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=25–28}} Bishop Broughton supported the Tractarian views of Allwood, but his successor, [[Frederic Barker]], who became bishop in 1855, was strongly Evangelical.&lt;ref name=ADBBarker&gt;{{cite web|last=Cable|first=K.J.|title=Barker, Frederic (1808–1882)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/barker-frederic-2934/text4247|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|volume=3|accessdate=21 December 2013|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division in style between St James' and the "low church" ethos that predominated in the Sydney Diocese began at this time.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=25–28}}

===Changes: 1884–1904===
During the 1880s Sydney became a prosperous city, commerce and industry flourished, and the suburbs expanded.  As more churches were built and fewer people lived in the heart of the city, the congregation of St James' Church shrank. The challenge that it faced was to minister effectively to city workers, rather than dwellers, to serve the poor of the city, and to attract those whose preference was for the style of worship and intellectual, topical preaching that distinguished St James' from many of the newly created parish churches.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=26–34}} The young Henry Latimer Jackson, from Cambridge, was appointed in 1885. He introduced weekday services and a magazine called ''The Kalendar'', one of Australia's first parish papers.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|page=9}} He also lectured at Sydney University, addressed conferences, spoke at synod and acted as secretary to the newly established [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School|Sydney Church of England Boys' Grammar School]].{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=10}} However, his sermons were described as "not so much opposed, as simply not understood".{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=11}} He resigned in 1895 after accepting a position in the [[Diocese of Ely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133225885 |title=Religious |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald|Newcastle Morning Herald &amp; Miners' Advocate]]|date=15 June 1895 |accessdate=20 December 2013 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a large gallery of dark wood with a curving balustrade across the back of the church.|The gallery at the western end of the church is the only one to remain]]
Although Sydney was prospering, St James' had an acute shortage of money and "the government considered resuming the site for a city railway".{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=11}}{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=26}} The trustees at this time leased the [[Clergy house|parsonage]] and, in 1894, used the money for urgent restoration to the exterior of the building. The architect [[Varney Parkes]] replaced the old [[spire]], using copper that was pre-weathered so that there was no radical change in its appearance.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=28}}  He removed infilling from the north portico and designed a new portico and entrance to the tower to match that of the eastern vestry. The result was to make the north face of the building its most significant aspect.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=26}}

Jackson's successor was [[William Carr Smith]], a man with socialist ideals and a commitment to social reform and spiritual outreach.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=34–41}} He preached long and engaging sermons inside the church and for a time in the open air in [[The Domain]] as well.{{sfn|St. James' Church (Sydney, NSW)|1919|p=25}} Carr Smith had brought with him from England the "most recent developments" in the restoration of ancient liturgy, so he was able to help St James' play a "notable part" in Sydney's revival of Anglo-Catholicism, setting "new standards of ceremonial".{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=12}} To serve these purposes the architect [[John H. Buckeridge]] was employed to transform the building's interior, completing the work in 1901.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=34–41}}
The most significant change was the new emphasis given to the [[altar]], which was made the focus of attention and "flanked by the pulpit, reading desks and lectern."{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=21}}  The "principal features" under the Carr Smith plan were the construction of the [[apse]], set into the eastern vestry to create a [[Sanctuary#Sanctuary as an altar|sanctuary]]; the raising of the [[chancel]] floor which created a platform, five steps above the nave for the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], framed by the organ divided into two sections; the making of a new, unobtrusive entrance to the tower and western gallery; and the removal of the box pews and the eastern and northern galleries.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=21–22}} The memorial plaques were also rearranged. The choir was ornamented with a [[mosaic]] floor and ornate brasswork which complemented the large brass eagle lectern by the English ecclesiastical suppliers, J. Wippell and Company, that commemorated Canon Robert Allwood.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=26–34}}{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=34–41}} The floor of the pulpit was made from parts of the old three-decker one.&lt;ref name = T&amp;C1808/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH4OCT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15850397 |title=The Churches&amp;nbsp;– Centenary of St. James' |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=4 October 1919 |accessdate=11 October 2013 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organ, refurbished and enlarged by Davidson of Sydney, was installed in 1903.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=34–41}} With the removal of the organ, the south vestry was made into a side chapel. Eight large [[stained glass]] windows were installed between 1903 and 1913, along with a new pulpit, altar and [[retable]], all of which were given as memorials.{{sfn|Australian Heritage Commission|1981|pp=2; 96}} Another improvement was "the placing of double windows on the King-street side to shut out the sound of the traffic, which hitherto has been a serious annoyance to both the officiating clergymen and the congregation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14367351 |title=St. James' Church |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=12 February 1901 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, St James' Hall was offered to Father Dorotheos Bakalliarios, a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] priest from [[Samos]] for Orthodox services in Sydney.{{sfn|Jupp|2001|p=409}} In 1904 the diocesan architect, [[Burcham Clamp|John Burcham Clamp]], was employed to design a new [[Church hall|parish hall]].{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=34–41}}

In the 21st century, St James' continues its work in the city centre via its ministry and engagement in the issues of the day. In the 19th century, there were controversies about tractarianism; in the 20th, there was the impact of the two world wars; in the 21st century, the church has confronted the difficult and topical issues of violence, euthanasia,&lt;ref name=DwD&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethics of Voluntary Assisted Dying|url=http://www.dwdnsw.org.au/ves/index.php/article/videos|work=The Videos from the Parliamentary Forum – 4 Nov 2013 Part 4: The Reverend Andrew Sempell – Rector St James Anglican Church Sydney (video)|publisher=Dying with Dignity NSW|accessdate=21 January 2014|date=14 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118232706/http://www.dwdnsw.org.au/ves/index.php/article/videos|archivedate=18 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  refugees,&lt;ref&gt;In February 2014, an information session about refugees and asylum seekers in Australia was chaired by the rector.

St James' commitment to [[social justice]] and education began in the 19th century with efforts to serve both convicts and settlers.

Separated from the Mint by the present-day [[Sydney Hospital]] is [[Parliament House, Sydney]], of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the [[New South Wales State Parliament]].{{sfn|Leary|Leary|1972|pages=34–40}}

The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the [[vestry|vestries]] at the eastern end.{{sfn|Freeland|1968|p=39}} Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains "fine Georgian"{{sfn|Judd|Cable|2000|p=12}} much as Greenway conceived it.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=21}}{{sfn|Apperly|Irving|Reynolds|1989|p=28}}  Relying on the "virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end",{{sfn|Freeland|1968|p=38}} Greenway maintained the [[Neoclassical architecture|classical]] tradition, unaffected by the [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony.{{sfn|Freeland|1968|p=37}} He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, [[pilaster]]s and [[gable]]s and together constitute an important example of [[town-planning]].{{sfn|Australian Heritage Commission|1981|pp=2; 95}} Before the advent of high-rise buildings, the 150 foot spire used to "serve as a guide for mariners coming up Port Jackson".&lt;ref name = SMH1893.06.24/&gt;

St James' originally took the form of a simple rectangular block, without transepts or [[chancel]], with a tower at the western end and a classical portico of the [[Doric order]] on either side. To this has been added Verge's vestry framed by two small [[portico]]s, and a similar portico as an entrance to the tower.  The church is built of local brick, its walls divided by brick pilasters into a series of bays. The walls are pierced by large windows with round arched heads in a colour that separates and defines them against the walls. The roof carries over the end walls with the gable forming triangular [[pediment]]s of classical proportions carrying a [[cornice]] across the eaves line. Thus the architectural treatment on the side walls is continued around the end walls.{{sfn|Freeland|1968|p=39}}

===Interior===
The original interior differed greatly in layout from that of the present.  There was no structural chancel, the focus of the church being a large pulpit. During the mid 19th century galleries overlooked the pulpit from three sides.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=26}} Of the original galleries, only the western one of [[Australian Red Cedar]] remains in place. The [[coffer]]ed ceiling (an addition from 1882 replacing the original [[lath]] and [[plaster]] ceiling), the low-backed pews (from shortly after) and the predominantly classical memorials all contribute to the present interior retaining the character of a Georgian church.&lt;ref name=Heritage /&gt;

At the eastern end, the communion table is set into a small apse with its semi-dome adorned with gold mosaic tiles that were added in 1960.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=22}} The altar is a commemorative gift from the Lloyd family, whose son was the first server appointed at St James'.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=22}} It generally has an [[altar frontal]] in the colour of the [[Liturgical year|liturgical season or festival]]. With no structural choir area, the chancel is built out and into the body of the church as a platform enclosed within gated [[wrought iron]] and brass railings and approached by steps.  The mosaic floor of the chancel is ornately with designs showing the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Ghostly Strength, Knowledge, Godliness and Holy Fear) along with symbols of St James the Great (the staff, scrip, palm, [[scallop#Shell of Saint James|scallop shell]] and hat of the [[pilgrim]]).{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=22}} The chancel is framed on either side by the organ pipes.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=24–25}}

There are five large stained glass windows on the northern and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by [[Percy Bacon Brothers]] and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass fanlight depicting [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], the sons of [[Zebedee]], was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=41}}&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindsay|first=Frances|title=Carter, Norman St Clair (1875–1963)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/carter-norman-st-clair-5525|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=20 December 2013|volume=7|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The window behind the [[baptismal font]], depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector in the presence of the then Primate, [[Peter Carnley]].{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=27}}

Previously enclosed and used as a vestry and then an organ chamber, the south porch became a chapel in 1903. In 1988, the side chapel was remodelled and dedicated as the Chapel of the Holy Spirit.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=38}} The parish and the [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentennial Council of New South Wales]] funded the redesign which saw the removal of the infilling from between the columns of the portico and its replacement with stained glass.

===Crypt and Children's Chapel===
{{main article|Children's Chapel, St James' Church, Sydney}}
Beneath the church is a large [[undercroft]], built of brick and [[groin vault]]ed.  It has been used for many purposes: as a residence by Revd Hill's widow and later by a verger; by Canon Allwood as a part-time bedroom; for the parish's schools; and as a shelter by Australian, American and British armed forces during the two world wars.&lt;ref name = SMH1893.06.24&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64033707 |title=A Historic Church |newspaper=[[Illustrated Sydney News]]|date=24 June 1893 |accessdate=6 December 2013 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rector Francis Wentworth-Sheilds gave the city parish "a big role as a drop-in centre for servicemen" during the First World War.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=12}} During the Second World War bed and bedding were provided to over 30,000 Allied servicemen.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=18}}

The western bay on the south side of the crypt is the Chapel of St Mary and the Angels, better known simply as the "[[Children's Chapel, St James' Church, Sydney|Children's Chapel]]". It was opened in 1929 as a chapel for younger children. A specially adapted form of [[Eucharist]] is celebrated there on the first Sunday of the month. All four walls of the chapel and its ceiling are decorated with [[mural]]s designed by the writer and artist [[Ethel Anderson]] and executed by the Turramurra Wall Painters Union, a group of [[Modernism|Modernist]] painters she founded in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sjks.org.au/childrens-chapel/|title=The Children's Chapel (of St Mary and the Angels)|year=2014|publisher=St James' King Street|accessdate=18 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214052911/http://sjks.org.au/childrens-chapel/|archivedate=14 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals underwent extensive conservation in 1992–1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=25 iconic projects |url=http://www.icssydney.com.au/index.php?id=435 |publisher=International Conservation Services |accessdate=28 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63AryAA2A?url=http://www.icssydney.com.au/index.php?id=435 |archivedate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crypt was restored by Geoffrey Danks in 1977–78.{{sfn|Cable|Clarke|1982|p=50}} In the 21st century, the bays on either side of the crypt's central corridor are used for a variety of purposes. At the eastern end they house a commercial kitchen. Some bays are used as offices; one (The Chapel of All Souls) contains a [[columbarium]]; another houses a [[lending library]] for parishioners.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=31}}

===Memorials, monuments, records===
St James' provides a record of important elements of Sydney's history in both physical and documentary form.&lt;ref name=BDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Church Registers: St James Church of England, Sydney, NSW|url=http://www.bda-online.org.au/files/CR17_ChurchRegister.pdf|publisher=Biographical Database of Australia|date=November 2012|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 300 memorials commemorating important members of 19th century colonial society, people who served the colony generally and parishioners from the 20th century. In addition, many of the stained glass windows and items of furniture have been donated as memorials. For example, the large stained glass window of [[Saint George]] on the northern wall is a memorial to Keith Kinnaird Mackellar, who died in the [[Second Boer War]] aged 20.&lt;ref&gt;The inscription reads: "To the Glory of God and in loving memory of Keith Kinnaird Mackellar Lieutenant 7th (Princess Royal) Dragoon Guards who was killed in action at [[Onderstepoort]] South Africa on the 11th July 1900 in the twentieth year of his age. 'Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and pure heart.'"&lt;/ref&gt; He was the brother of poet [[Dorothea Mackellar]].  These memorials are the reason the church was sometimes called "The [[Westminster Abbey]] of the South".{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=22}} As early as 1876, the wall tablets were described as "full of sad memories to the old inhabitants, interesting reminiscences to those who have studied Australian history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70602560 |title=St. James's Church, Sydney|newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]|date=8 July 1876 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |page=20 |publisher=}} It contains a detailed list of the memorials&lt;/ref&gt;

The first monument erected in the church was the memorial to Commodore Sir [[James Brisbane]], who died in Sydney on his way to serve in South America in command of [[HMS Warspite (1807)|HMS Warspite]]. It was sculpted by [[Francis Leggatt Chantrey|Sir Francis Chantrey]], sent to Sydney by Lady Brisbane and installed in the church in 1830.

Since its erection, the building has undergone significant repair, renovation and conservation, including work on the building fabric, the stained glass windows, the mosaic floors in the chancel and sanctuary and conservation of the Children's Chapel. Major work was done on the interior and the spire in the 1890s&lt;ref name="SMH1893.06.24"/&gt; and on the crypt in the 1970s.{{sfn|Cable|Clarke|1982|p=50}}

Restoration continued with work on the church's [[Slate#Slate in buildings|slate]] roof and sandstone perimeter fence. The Spanish slates, installed in the 1970s, proved not to be durable in Sydney's climate due to their high iron content and their poor fixing had resulted in further damage. The solution to the deterioration was to replace the slates using [[Slate industry in Wales|Welsh slates]]. The roof project was completed after a fund-raising effort supported by the National Trust of Australia. In 2013, the interior was repainted after preparation that involved "colour testing and selection, memorial protection and ceiling acoustic repairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Church Wardens' Report | date=March–September  2013 |author=Churchwardens of St James' Church|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a heritage-listed building, the church has a program of continual conservation.

St James' offers three [[Eucharist]]s on Sundays: a Said Eucharist, a Sung Eucharist and a Choral Eucharist. There is a regular [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral Evensong]] on Wednesdays and one Sunday each month.  The Eucharist and other services are also celebrated during the week&lt;ref name=Heritage /&gt; and the robed choir contributes to its "cathedral style worship".{{sfn|Whiteoak|Scott-Maxwell|2003|p=128}} Festival services are popular and known for their standard of liturgy and music, particularly those services which celebrate high points of the church year such as [[Holy Week]] and Easter, the [[Advent]] carols, the [[Nine Lessons and Carols]], the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass and the patronal festival of St James (son of Zebedee, also known as James the Great) in July. A series of orchestral Masses is held in January.&lt;ref name=FoM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fom.org.au/|title=Friends of Music at St James'|work=fom.org.au|year=2013|accessdate=21 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818021822/http://fom.org.au/|archivedate=18 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St James' continues to maintain a formal and sacramental liturgy and has weathered the storm of criticism from a diocese with increasingly "[[Low church]]" practices.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=34–41}} It is one of the few Sydney Anglican churches that has upheld the norms of mainstream Anglican tradition, including the use of the [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] by clergy during services, especially during sacraments such as [[baptism]]s and marriages; the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and sacred church music, including the singing of hymns from a [[hymnal]].{{sfn|Porter|2011|pp=10–12}}

===Theology===
The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia "commit[s] Anglicans to mainstream Christian orthodoxy", but its ruling principles direct it to that particular tradition within as "represented by the Church of England".{{sfn|Kaye|2002|p=171}} The Australian church had to work out the meaning of its common heritage "in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies"{{sfn|Kaye|2002|p=170}} but "the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted&amp;nbsp;... has highlighted differences."{{sfn|Kaye|2002|p=171}} Peter Carnley, former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has described Anglicanism's "unique or essential identity" as having "not so much a body of theological teaching, as a style of theological reflection"{{sfn|Carnley|2004|p=81}} that goes back to the Elizabethan theologian [[Richard Hooker]].{{sfn|Frame|2007|p=56}} St James' conforms to this Anglican tradition, part of which is a general dislike of what used to be referred to as 'Enthusiasm': that is, a dislike of "pious individualism and emotional exuberance".&lt;ref&gt;This third theological tradition (later called the 'Broad Church' or 'Liberal' tradition) is in addition to those created by the "tensions between Evangelicals and Tractarians". It is one which also "claimed its origins in Richard Hooker's appeal to human reason&amp;nbsp;... as a rational account of the universe." (Frame (2006) p.56)&lt;/ref&gt; St James' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley's explanation that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational]] reality "might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic, symbolic or sacramental aids to worship."{{sfn|Carnley|2004|pp=70}} Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese, which typically eschews beauty and holds to an "ultra-low ecclesiastical aesthetic" that is combined with "ultra-conservative social values".&lt;ref name=Sacredfeminine&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Elizabeth Farrelly|Farrelly, Elizabeth]]|title=Sydney Anglicans reject the sacred feminine|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/sydney-anglicans-reject-the-sacred-feminine-20140604-zrx3t.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=5 June 2014|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lindsay|Scarfe|2012|p=179}} Teaching at St James' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context.&lt;ref name=Pentecost11&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sempell |first1=Andrew |title=Sermon: "That we may Evermore Live in Him and He in Us" |url=http://sjks.org.au/wp-content/uploads/b-os19-sermon-15.pdf |publisher=St James' Church, Sydney |accessdate=9 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007010038/http://sjks.org.au/wp-content/uploads/b-os19-sermon-15.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sydney diocese, St James's differing view has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church towards and away from Anglo-Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16898980 |title=St. James' Church |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=NSW |date=1 August 1932 |accessdate=1 July 2014 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micklem, for example, renewed Anglo-Catholic churchmanship and Davidson "returned it firmly to a moderate position".{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=13,16}}

===Congregation===
In the beginning, convicts, soldiers, governors and civil authorities attended the church; in the 21st century, regular patronage by, and programs for, governors, politicians, the legal community and the homeless create a similarly diverse mix. In 1900, such a congregation was described by the sixth rector as representing "many types, many classes. Here we find rich and poor, old and new, the Governor and the Domain loafer, the passing visitor, and the grandchildren of those whose memorial tablets testify to a long connection with the church." William Carr Smith's observation was that "this makes the congregation a difficult one to handle."&lt;ref name = T&amp;C1808&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71384721 |title=Restoration of St. James's Church, Sydney|last = Wright| first= Clyde|newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]|date=18 August 1900 |accessdate=17 November 2013 |page=37 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the congregation provides volunteer labour and donates funds for many of church's activities, including laundry work, library administration, flower arrangements, bell ringing, singing in the parish choir and hospitality for the Sister Freda mission. Furnishings for the chapel in the Sydney Hospital were provided by the parishioners during Carr Smith's time, when he became chaplain to the hospital.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=17}}

St James' work for the poor, as well as for the city's legal and medical professions, has been continuous from the 19th century. Since early times work "for the poor of the parish"; the promotion of "overseas and inland missions"; liaison with "the city professions in law and medicine" and running "devotional and discussion groups" has been incorporated into the church's mission.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=11}} In the 20th century, the ninth and tenth rectors emphasised "the church's responsibility to society" and encouraged St James' role in the city.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=17}} In the 21st century, these activities have been supplemented by chaplaincy and professional counselling services directed at dealing with the problems associated with the stresses of city life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sjks.org.au/wp-content/uploads/OUTREACH_Further-information-about-Counselling-at-St-James.pdf|title=Counselling at St James|year=2013|publisher=St James' King Street|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "most direct part of St James' social welfare work" is the Sister Freda Mission, which began in 1899.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=17}} Among other things, this ministry provides weekly lunches to the needy and a full dinner at Christmas. Sister Freda (Emily Rich) was a member of the [[Community of the Sisters of the Church]], a religious order which started the Collegiate School in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] in 1895. Sister Freda and other members of the order took over the organisation of its mission to the homeless in 1899.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=30}} On Christmas Day in 1901 "about 60 men were entertained at dinner at St James' parish hall, and later in the afternoon 250 unemployed men were treated to tea in the same building by the sisters of the church."&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au nla"/&gt; After her death in 1936, Sister Freda's name was given to the mission and St James' took over responsibility for its organisation.{{sfn|The Church|1963|p=17}} Since 1954, this service has operated out of the church crypt, relying on donations, including food sourced by [[OzHarvest]], and the efforts of volunteer parishioners.&lt;ref name="Sister Freda" /&gt;

The church's ministry to Sydney's legal fraternity is facilitated by its proximity to buildings used by the profession, including the Law Courts, which is the main building of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] and houses the Sydney registry of the [[High Court of Australia]]; [[The College of Law (Australia)|the College of Law]] and the St James Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is the former home of [[Sydney Law School]], still mainly used for legal education by the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collaw.edu.au/about-us/our-campuses/new-south-wales-sydney-city/ |title= Map of the New South Wales&amp;nbsp;– Sydney City Campus |publisher= College of Law|year=2013|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phillip Street, Sydney|Phillip Street]], which runs north from the church, is home to a large number of [[barristers' chambers]] as well as the [[Law Society of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lawsociety.com.au/ |title=Homepage of the Law Society of NSW  |publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales|year=2013  |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, religious denominations made a major contribution to education at all levels before this was taken over by the state. From its beginnings, St James' was involved in education for both children and adults. Richard Hill, the first minister, "began Australia's first kindergarten and [[William Timothy Cape|William Cape]] managed a school based on new educational principles".{{sfn|Judd|Cable|2000|page=14}}&lt;ref name=ADBGoodin&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodin|first=V.

The Grammar School, presided over by the Revd C. Kemp was described as "of inestimable value to the then youth of the colony".&lt;ref name = T&amp;C1808/&gt; Bishop Broughton also set up St James' College to provide tertiary education for secular students as well as to prepare students for [[ordination]].

==Music==

St James' has had a strong musical and choral tradition "integral" to its liturgies since the 1820s and is known both for the high standard of the [[Church music|sacred music]] as well as for its regular public recitals and concerts.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14095369 |title=St. James' Church |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=26 July 1897 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; St James' has a choir, a fine three-manual [[pipe organ]] and a peal of bells hung for [[change ringing]].&lt;ref name= FoM/&gt; [[Isaac Nathan]], who "constituted himself musical laureate to the colony"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/nathan-isaac-2502/text3377|title = 'Nathan, Isaac (1790–1864)'|accessdate = 17 January 2014 | author = Catherine Mackerras | year = 1967|work = Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography| publisher = Australian National University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered "Australia's first composer", created a musical society at St James' in the 1840s.&lt;ref name = DoSNathan&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/nathan_isaac | title = Nathan, Isaac | accessdate = 17 January 2014 | author = Graeme Skinner | year = 2008 | work = Dictionary of Sydney | publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organ===
The original organ, installed in the west gallery, was built by John Gray of London and was played for the first time on 7 October 1827.  It received the following praise in the colonial newspaper [[The Australian (1824 newspaper)|''The Australian'']].

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"St. James's new organ pealed its notes of praise for the first time at noon service on Sunday, to an overflowing congregation, more numerous perhaps than any congregation St. James's had ever before witnessed. The organ was not in perfect harmony, owing, in a great measure, to its yet incomplete state. Its intonations, however, in many instances, was full, rich, and harmonious, and those of the congregation were not a few who felt its tones swell on the ear like the welcome voice of a long parted friend!"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37072595 |title=No title |newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=10 October 1827 |accessdate=31 August 2013 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organ was modernised and enlarged in the 1870s by William Davidson. After a number of moves around the galleries, it was placed in what had been intended as the south porch. At the time the church's interior was reconstructed at the turn of the 20th century, it was positioned on either side of the chancel platform at the eastern end where it remains.{{sfn|Cable|Annable|1999|pp=24–25}} Organ specialists Hill, Norman &amp; Beard (Aust) Pty Ltd gave the organ a major refurbishment and reconstruction between 1970 and 1971 at a cost of $35,000.&lt;ref name= DoS&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/st_james_anglican_church_queens_square | title = St James Anglican church Queens Square | accessdate = 17 January 2014 | author = Mark Dunn | year = 2008 | work = Dictionary of Sydney | publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current choir is composed of about a dozen semi-professional adults. They sing on Sundays at the 11.00 am Choral Eucharist, Wednesdays at the 6:15 pm Choral Evensong, monthly at the 3.00 pm Choral Evensong held on the last Sunday of the month, as well as at a number of midweek [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|feast days]] held during the year.&lt;ref name="SJKSchoir" /&gt; In January, during the summer holiday period, St James' presents three full orchestral Masses during which [[liturgical music]] by composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] is used for its original purpose and incorporated into the service.

Musical critique of the choir has appeared in the press from the beginning and continues to the present day. In 1827, one singer was criticised for her diction: "If her pronunciation were as pleasing as her notes, she would be entitled to unqualified praise" wrote a critic in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31758873 |title=Domestic Intelligence |newspaper=[[The Monitor (Sydney, NSW)|The Monitor]] |date=3 September 1827 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |page=3 Edition: Evening }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, St James' was being described as the "exception" to the prevailing low standard of church music in both England and New South Wales.{{sfn|Rushworth|1988|p=366}} In 2013, singers from the combined choirs of St James' and St Mary's Cathedral were appraised as creating "a clear, well-defined edge that swirled gloriously".&lt;ref name=McCallum&gt;{{cite news|last=McCallum|first=Peter|title=Brilliant compendium of Monteverdi's genius|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/brilliant-compendium-of-monteverdis-genius-20130816-2s1vr.html|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|location=Sydney, NSW|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castro Pretorio - teatro dell'Opera di Roma (Costanzi) facciata piacentini 1010030.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Facade of the Teatro dell'Opera.]]
The '''Teatro dell'Opera di Roma''' (''Rome Opera House'') is an [[opera house]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teatrionline.com/2017/05/teatro-dellopera-di-roma-toni-servillo-per-egmont/ "Teatro dell'Opera in Rome, Toni Servillo for "Egmont""] ''Teatrio Online''. Retrieved 2017-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally opened in November 1880 as the 2,212 seat ''Costanzi Theatre'', it has undergone several changes of name as well modifications and improvements.  The present house seats 1,600.

==The original Teatro Costanzi: 1880 to 1926==
The Teatro dell'Opera was originally known as the ''Teatro Costanzi'' after the contractor who built it, [[Domenico Costanzi]] (1810-1898). It was financed by Costanzi, who commissioned the Milanese architect [[Achille Sfondrini]] (1836-1900), a specialist in the building and renovation of theatres. The opera house was built in eighteen months, on the site where the house of Heliogabalus stood in ancient times, and was inaugurated on 27 November 1880 with a performance of ''[[Semiramide]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]].

Designing the theatre, Sfondrini paid particular attention to the acoustics, conceiving the interior structure as a "resonance chamber", as is evident from the horseshoe shape in particular. With a [[seating capacity]] of 2,212, the house had three tiers of boxes, an amphitheatre and two separate galleries, surmounted by a dome adorned with splendid frescoes by [[Annibale Brugnoli]].

Costanzi was obliged to manage the theater himself. Under his direction, and despite financial problems, the opera house held many world premieres of operas, including ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' by [[Pietro Mascagni]] on 17 May 1890. For a brief period the theatre was managed by Costanzi's son, Enrico, who gained renown by organizing another great premiere, that of ''[[Tosca]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini]] on 14 January 1900.

In 1907 the Teatro Costanzi was purchased by the impresario [[Walter Mocchi]] (1870-1955) on behalf of the ''Società Teatrale Internazionale e Nazionale'' (STIN).  In 1912 Mocchi's wife, [[Emma Carelli]], became the managing director of the new ''Impresa Costanzi'', as the theatre was later known, following various changes in the company structure. During the fourteen years of her tenure, major works which had not been performed before in Rome (or even in Italy) were staged. These included ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'', ''[[Turandot]]'' and ''[[Il trittico]]'' by Giacomo Puccini; ''[[Parsifal]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]]; ''[[Francesca da Rimini]]'' by [[Riccardo Zandonai]]; ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]]; ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and many others. [[Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] also performed.

==The restructured Teatro Reale dell'Opera: 1926 to 1946==
In November 1926 the Costanzi was bought by the Rome City Council and its name changed to ''Teatro Reale dell'Opera''. A partial rebuilding ensued, led by architect [[Marcello Piacentini]] and lasting fifteen months. The house re-opened on 27 February 1928 with the opera ''[[Nerone (Boito)|Nerone]]'' by [[Arrigo Boito]].

Chief among several major changes was the relocated entrance, from the street formerly known as Via del Teatro (where the garden of the Hotel Quirinale is now) to the opposite side, where Piazza Beniamino Gigli exists today. In addition, the amphitheatre inside the theatre was replaced by a fourth tier of boxes (now the third tier) and the balcony. The interior was embellished by new stuccowork, decorations, and furnishings, including a magnificent chandelier measuring six meters in diameter and composed of 27,000 crystal drops.

Above the proscenium arch is a plaque commemorating the rebuilding: "Vittorio Emanuele III Rege, Benito Mussolini Duce, Lodovicus Spada Potenziani, Romae Gubernator Restituit MCMXXVIII—VI”". Confusingly the dates appear to be back to front. (The VI refers to the sixth year after the Fascist's March on Rome of 1922.)

==The present Teatro dell'Opera di Roma: from 1946==
Following the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946| end of monarchy]], the name was simplified to ''Teatro dell'Opera'' and, in 1958, the building was again remodeled and modernized. Rome City Council again commissioned architect Marcello Piacentini, who radically altered the building's style, notably with regard to the facade, entrance and foyer, each of these taking the form we know today.

The theater's legendary acoustics still bear comparison with any other auditorium in the world. The seating capacity is about 1,600. The house was retrofitted with air-conditioning subsequent to a restoration, which provided improvements to the interior. The stucco work was completely restored, the great proscenium arch strengthened, and a parquet floor of solid oak blocks laid to replace the previous one.

On 2 January 1958 the theater was the venue for a controversial performance of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' starring [[Maria Callas]] in the presence of the President of Italy: for health reasons, Callas abandoned the performance after the first act (the opera company had not engaged an understudy). 

The post-war period saw celebrated productions, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' in 1964 and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlo]]'' in 1965, both conducted by [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] and directed by [[Luchino Visconti]]. 

From 2001 to 2010, the music director and chief conductor of the company was [[Gianluigi Gelmetti]]. He was due to be succeeded in these posts by [[Riccardo Muti]], as announced in August 2009, but Muti demurred, citing in La Repubblica in October 2010 "general difficulties that are plaguing the Italian opera houses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Matthew Westphal | title=Gianluigi Gelmetti to Step Down as Opera di Roma's Music Director - And Calls for Riccardo Muti to Succeed Him | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/4939.html | work=Playbill Arts | date=24 July 2006 | accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Muti assumed a role similar to that of music director but without title. Notable productions under Muti have included Gluck's "Iphigénie en Aulide" (2009), Verdi's "Nabucco" (2011), "Simon Boccanegra" (2012) and "Ernani" (2013).

The name "Teatro Costanzi" remains officially in use, to refer to the main auditorium.

==Opera company's summer venue==
The outdoor theatre at the [[Baths of Caracalla]], with the Roman ruins as the backdrop, is the venue for the opera company's summertime presentations in Rome.

==Title==
The original code-name for the project was ''Earthlings'', a rarely-used slang term for lesbians.&lt;ref name="curve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Detailed/296.html |title=Folk Like Us |accessdate=2006-09-03 |author=Schenden, Laurie K. |date= |work=Curve Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506071922/http://www.curvemag.com/Detailed/296.html |archivedate=May 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary use of the phrase "the L word" as an alias for ''lesbian'' dates to at least the 1981 play ''[[My Blue Heaven (play)|My Blue Heaven]]'' by [[Jane Chambers]], in which a character stammers out: "You're really...?

==Season synopsis==
{{see also|List of The L Word episodes}}

===Season 1===
{{main|The L Word (season 1)}}
Season 1 premiered in the United States on January 18, 2004, on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and featured 13 episodes presenting several entwined story lines.  Set in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], the series first introduces [[Bette Porter]] and [[Tina Kennard]], a couple with a seven-year relationship who want to have a child.  Tina eventually becomes pregnant through artificial insemination but has a miscarriage during episode 1.09: ''Luck, next time''.  Later in the series, Bette develops an affair with [[List of characters from The L Word#J|Candace Jewell]].

The pilot introduced a coming out/love triangle storyline involving Tina and Bette’s neighbor, [[Tim Haspel]], his new-in-town girlfriend, [[Jenny Schecter]], and [[Marina Ferrer]]. Marina is part of Tina and Bette’s circle of friends, and owns the neighborhood café, The Planet, which serves as the group's hang-out and focal point for the show. Marina relentlessly pursues Jenny and succeeds in destroying her relationship with Tim. The season also introduces [[Shane McCutcheon]], an androgynous, highly sexual hairstylist and serial heart-breaker; [[Alice Pieszecki]], a girly, bisexual journalist looking for love in any way she can, and [[Dana Fairbanks]], a professional tennis player who is still in the closet and torn between pursuing her career and finding love.  In the first season, Dana falls for a [[sous chef]] named [[Lara Perkins]] whose sexuality is questioned by the group until Lara has an unexpected meeting with Dana in the locker room.
At the end of the season, Tina sees Bette and Candace touching hands and speaking intimately and immediately guesses about their affair. Tina and Bette break up, with Tina living at Alice's and Bette stays in their home.

===Season 2===
{{main|The L Word (season 2)}}
Season 2 began airing on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on February 20, 2005 and featured thirteen episodes.  It starts by unveiling to the viewers a secret Tina is keeping from everyone: she successfully became impregnated after a second insemination. Tina and Bette are still apart. Bette doesn't deny the affair and begs Tina for forgiveness but later alienates herself from the group and continues the affair for a short while until realizing that it's Tina she wants to spend her life with not Candace and so ends their short affair. Tina begins seeing [[Helena Peabody|Helena]], while Bette’s life is portrayed as a wreck, with alcohol abuse, problems with her job, the death of her father in episode 2.12:''L'Chaim'', and being fired during the season finale.  Tina and Bette reconcile during the final episode.  The character of Marina was written out of the show, and the Planet was bought by [[Kit Porter]].&lt;ref name="Episode 2.02"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=123809| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309035929/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=123809| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Lap Dance| accessdate=2007-02-01| author=m| date=2005-02-27| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in the second season are [[Carmen de la Pica Morales]], a confident DJ who becomes part of a [[love triangle]] with Shane and Jenny; [[Helena Peabody]], the daughter of a wealthy supporter of the arts who later becomes Tina's love interest; and [[Mark Wayland]], a documentary filmmaker who moves in with Shane and Jenny.  Mark makes them part of his latest documentary by setting up hidden cameras in the house to videotape them.  During episode 2.09: ''Late, Later, Latent'', Jenny discovers Mark’s tapes and also discovers the truth about Carmen’s true love.

Season 2 introduces a developing affair between Alice and Dana, which becomes public in episode 2.07: ''Luminous''.  It also presents insights into Jenny’s past as an abused child in episode 2.11: ''Loud and Proud'', and reveals episodes of self-harm that reach their climax in the season finale.

===Season 3===
{{main|The L Word (season 3)}}
The television show set up  contest at the website FanLib.com where fans could submit a femme slash fanfic.  The winner's story was incorporated into a scene of a third-season episode.&lt;ref&gt;Hibberd, James (December 5, 2005), "Lights! Camera! 'L Word' Action!". ''Television Week''.

Season 3 first aired on January 8, 2006, with 12 episodes. It begins six months after the birth of Tina and Bette's daughter, Angelica. New characters in this season include [[Moira/Max Sweeney|Moira Sweeney]] (a working class butch portrayed by [[Daniela Sea]] who is Jenny’s girlfriend for most of the season) and Angus Partridge (portrayed by [[Dallas Roberts]]), Angelica’s male [[nanny]] who later becomes Kit's lover.&lt;ref name="Episode 3.06"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125210| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309001527/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125210| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Lifesize.| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-02-12| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeney starts the process of [[transgender|transitioning]] switching his name to Max.

Notable of this season is that each episode begins with a short pre-credits vignette of two individuals meeting romantically or sexually. As the season progresses, lines from Alice's chart (''[[The L Word#The Chart|see below]]'') connect one member of each vignette with a new individual in the next.

Helena's character storyline was switched from being Bette's rival into a new member of the circle of friends. Her story arc for the season involves the acquisition of a movie studio&lt;ref name="Episode 3.01"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125205| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309001518/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125205| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Labia Majora| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-01-08| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Tina later works,&lt;ref name="Episode 3.03"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125207| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308110910/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125207| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-08| title=Lobsters| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-01-22| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which further derives a [[sexual harassment]] [[lawsuit]]&lt;ref name="Episode 3.09"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125212| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309040131/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125212| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Lead, follow, or get out of the way| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-03-05| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; that triggers her mother to cut her off financially in the season finale.

===Season 6===
{{main|The L Word (season 6)}}
Showtime confirmed a sixth and final season for ''The L Word''. Unlike the show's previous seasons, it only lasted 8 episodes to conclude the show with 71 episodes in total. Studio executives commented on the longevity of the show, with the Showtime president of entertainment Robert Greenblatt saying that ''The L Word'' has "surpassed its niche as a gay show". The sixth season premiered on January 18, 2009 and ended its original run on March 8 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003722311 | title=Showtime will have last 'Word' }} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers and writers of ''The L Word'' took viewers' opinions regarding the final season’s episodes. The main story of the season is related to the death of [[Jennifer Schecter]] and the rest of the season is a flashback from that point.

Before airing the show, Creator Ilene Chaiken denied reports of socialite [[Paris Hilton]] guest starring on an interview on gaydarnation.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaydarnation.com/UserPortal/Article/Detail.aspx?ID=21447&amp;sid=64 Ilene Chaiken: L Word] gaydarnation.com, 20 Jun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Ilene Chaiken said in an interview with the [[New York Post]] Magazine that she had offered DJ [[Samantha Ronson]] a guest spot in Season 6 but Ronson declined as she was busy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20081005/Discuss+Must+Samantha+Ronson+Be+Lesbian+Role+Model Must Samantha Ronson Be A Lesbian Role Model?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402204603/http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20081005/Discuss+Must+Samantha+Ronson+Be+Lesbian+Role+Model |date=2009-04-02 }} NY Post Page Six Magazine Oct 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, it was confirmed that [[Elizabeth Berkley]] would star as Kelly Wentworth (née Freemont) in a [[story arc|multi-episode arc]] of the final season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828025307/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/07/exclusive-berkl.html Exclusive: Elizabeth Berkley Utters 'The L Word'] EW.com Jul 22, 2008 by Michael Ausiello&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meiling Melançon|Mei Melançon]] also made guest appearances for the last season as [[Jamie Chen]], a counselor from the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Youth Center who befriends Alice and Tasha and becomes their third-wheel crush.

===Interrogation tapes===
Shortly after airing the final episode, Showtime began releasing short videos in which characters revealed secrets that weren't revealed during the course of the show. Each video showed the interrogation of one character with a new video being released each Monday after the final episode via the Showtime website. At some point in time Showtime's website ceased carrying the videos, but they can be found on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=Interrogation&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22L+Word%22+interrogation&amp;aq=f Search for interrogation tapes.] ''[[YouTube]]''&lt;/ref&gt; All episodes feature [[Lucy Lawless]] as Sgt. Marybeth Duffy and [[Sean Tyson]] as Det. Sean Holden who are investigating the death of [[Jenny Schecter]].

Following the seven interrogation tapes (featuring Bette, Tina, Alice, Max, Helena, Niki &amp; Shane), the same URL offered an interview with series creator Ilene Chaiken in two weekly installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |title=Showtime : The L Word : Home |publisher=Sho.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629030202/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |archivedate=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaiken discussed several aspects of the show's history and plotlines, but would only consent to reiterating that Alice went to jail for Jenny's murder while not necessarily being guilty of the crime. Ilene Chaiken and the cast have commented on different theories about Jenny's death.&lt;ref name=death_theories&gt;{{YouTube|pqZT5lOx0IU|Executive Producer Ilene Chaiken and The Cast Comment on different Theories about Jenny's death}}.

==Unaired spin-off series and film proposals==
Series creator [[Ilene Chaiken]] wrote and produced a 20-minute presentation for a possible spin-off centering on another lesbian group in a women's prison where [[Leisha Hailey]]'s character [[Alice Pieszecki]] is detained. ''The Farm'' started shooting in December 2008, while the sixth and final season of ''The L Word'' premiered in January 2009. [[Famke Janssen]], [[Melissa Leo]] and [[Laurie Metcalf]] were part of the cast.

Showtime's CEO Matthew Blank announced plans for the new show at the [[Television Critics Association]] press tour in July 2008.&lt;ref name="BuddyTV The L-Word Sixth Season"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-l-word/the-l-word-set-to-come-back-in-23364.aspx| title='The L Word' Set to Come Back in January Next Year| accessdate=2009-02-26| author=Valerie Anne del Castillo| date=2008-10-06| work=Showtime| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226233919/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-l-word/the-l-word-set-to-come-back-in-23364.aspx| archive-date=2009-02-26| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in April that Showtime declined to pick up ''The Farm'' as a series, which may leave the open-ended element of the series finale as permanently unresolved.&lt;ref name="BuShowtime passes on ''L Word'' spinoff (whew!) and Matthew Perry series (sniff!)"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/04/l-word-spinoff.html| title=Showtime passes on ''L Word'' spinoff (whew!) and Matthew Perry series (sniff!)| accessdate=2009-04-03| author=Annie Barrett| date=2009-04-03| work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaiken has expressed interest in producing a film based on the series in an interview aired through ''The L Word'''s website, although according to her declarations, it probably would not emphasize any of the unresolved plot lines of the show and would simply continue the story of the characters' friendships.  No official proposals or green-lighting related to an ''L Word'' film have been publicized.

==''The Real L Word''==
Chaiken continued ''The L Word'' franchise with the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[The Real L Word]]'', debuting June 20, 2010.  The reality series followed the lives of six lesbians in Los Angeles.  In an interview for the new series, Chaiken revealed Alice did not kill Jenny in the original series.&lt;ref name="TVG"&gt;{{cite web

==Music==
{{main|List of The L Word soundtracks}}
As of March 2008, ''The L Word'' has released five compilation CDs with the show's soundtrack. The music composer of the show is [[EZgirl]]. The music supervisor is [[Natasha Duprey]].

All three of [[Leisha Hailey]]'s bands have been referenced in the series. A song by [[The Murmurs]], Hailey's first band, was used in a first-season episode and included on that season's soundtrack.   During the second season, the character Shane is sometimes seen wearing a T-shirt for [[Gush (band)|Gush]], Hailey's second band. Songs of Hailey's most recent band, [[Uh Huh Her (band)|Uh Huh Her]], were featured during the show's fifth and sixth seasons; the character Tasha Williams is seen wearing an Uh Huh Her T-shirt during the sixth season.

==The Chart==
{{see also|Six degrees of separation}}
[[File:The chart.png|thumb|250px|A small portion of The Chart, covering some of the relationships established along the series through Season 6. Pink represents main female characters, blue represents main male characters, purple and green minor characters featured in the series (female and male respectively), and grey signifies characters that are only alluded to.]]
"The Chart" is a graph of the affairs that occur among Alice's friends and acquaintances; it is an [[undirected graph|undirected labeled graph]] in which nodes are labeled with people's names and the lines represent affairs or hookups. 
Originally, ''The L Word'' was to be based around a lesbian [[Kit Porter]], and "The Chart" was tattooed on her back.&lt;ref name="curve"/&gt; When Kit Porter was changed into a straight character, The Chart was given to Alice instead.

The Chart is a recurrent element in the show's storylines, especially those related to its creator within the series.&lt;ref name = NYTimes&gt;Elizabeth Jensen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/technology/18chart.html "‘The L Word’ Spins Off Its Chart"], ''[[NY Times]]'', 2006-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; During Season 3, it also serves as a marginal storyline that advances through each episode and concludes in the season finale – as well as a way to track the characters and get to know how they interact within the lesbian community.

The Concept of The Chart was further exploited in Season Four. Within the series, The Chart evolves into an internet social network hosting profiles and provides the introduction for the character of Papi in Episode 4.01:''Legend in the Making''. At the same time, a real-world parallel project OurChart.com was launched.&lt;ref name = OurChart&gt;Pete Cashmore, [http://mashable.com/2006/12/18/ourchartcom-the-l-word-launching-lesbian-social-network/ "OurChart.com – The L-Word Launching Lesbian Social Network"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 2006-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The website, which allowed registered members to create their own profiles and also hosted several blogs on the show, was fully operational until the launch of the Sixth Season, after which Ilene Chaiken announced through an online statement that OurChart.com had merged with Showtime's website.&lt;ref name=OurChartMerge&gt;Ilene Chaiken, [http://www.sho.com/site/lword/popup.do?content=ourchart_info "A New Year A New OurChart"] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629024038/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/popup.do?content=ourchart_info |date=June 29, 2009 }}, ''[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The show's first season was "broadcast to critical acclaim and instant popularity"; as an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out:&lt;ref name="nyt2005"&gt;{{cite news| title=She Likes to Watch| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/arts/television/06gloc.html?pagewanted=all| date=February 6, 2005| author=[[Alison Glock]]| accessdate=2009-03-16| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Before "The L Word," lesbian characters barely existed in television. Interested viewers had to search and second-guess, playing parlor games to suss out a character's sexuality. [[Cagney &amp; Lacey|Cagney and Lacey]]? Jo on "[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|Facts of Life]]"? [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]]? Showtime's decision in January 2004 to air ''The L Word'', which follows the lives of a group of fashionable Los Angeles lesbians, was akin to ending a drought with a monsoon. Women who had rarely seen themselves on the small screen were suddenly able to watch lesbian characters not only living complex, exciting lives, but also making love in restaurant bathrooms and in swimming pools. There was no tentative audience courtship. Instead there was sex, raw and unbridled in that my-goodness way that only cable allows.

Co-creator and executive producer [[Ilene Chaiken]] had some issues with the reaction:&lt;ref name="nyt2005"/&gt;
:I do want to move people on some deep level. But I won't take on the mantle of social responsibility. That's not compatible with entertainment. I rail against the idea that pop television is a political medium. I am political in my life. But I am making serialized [[melodrama]]. I'm not a cultural missionary.

While the show is seen as fulfilling lesbians' "obvious and modest representational need"&lt;ref&gt;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, "Foreword: The Letter L." ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe. London: I. B. Tauris (2006): xix&lt;/ref&gt; or even the "ferocious desire not only to be seen in some literal sense... but to be seen with all the blood and angst and magic that you possess",&lt;ref&gt;Dana Heller, "How Does a Lesbian Look? Stendhal's Syndrome and the L Word." ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe. London: I. B. Tauris (2006): 57&lt;/ref&gt; the show has been criticized for various scenes which serve to "reify [[heteronormativity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, "Heteronormativity and ''The L Word'': From Politics of Representation to a Politics of Norms" ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe. London: I. B. Tauris (2006): 91&lt;/ref&gt; The show has also been praised for its nuanced consideration (in the first season) of how and in what ways lesbians should stand up to the religious right, with the "Provocations" art show storyline being "a fictionalized version of what happened when Cincinnati's Contemporary Art Center booked a controversial exhibition of Mapplethorpe photographs in 1990".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret McFadden, ""We cannot afford to keep being so high-minded": Fighting the Religious Right on ''The L Word''" ''The New Queer Aesthetic on Television: Essays on Recent Programming'', edited by James R. Keller and Leslie Stratyner. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers (2006): 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its network predecessor ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', praised critically for its ground-breaking material that was both well-written and well-acted, there have been complaints from critics regarding ''The L Word'''s watered-down, unrealistically glamorous characters and melodrama. Some reviewers (and fans) are put off by the theme song (introduced in the second season) and the "graceless, clunky dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;Heather Havrilesky, "[http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/review/2007/01/14/iltw/index2.html I Like to Watch]" salon.com, January 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Several shows have referenced ''The L Word'', including ''[[South of Nowhere]]'''s first season episode "Girls Guide to Dating"; ''[[According to Jim]]''; the medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''; the first season finale of ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', [[Jon Stewart]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' (July 24, 2006); ''[[Chappelle's Show#The "Lost Episodes"|Chappelle's Show: The "Lost Episodes"]]''; ''[[The Sopranos]]'' episode ''[[Live Free or Die (The Sopranos)|Live Free or Die]]''; the US version of ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]''; ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' fourth season episode ''Scene in a Mall''; ''[[The Big Gay Sketch Show]]''; ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]]''; and ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode ''[[Brian Sings and Swings]]''. Also, movies such as ''[[Puccini for Beginners]]'' and ''[[I Can't Think Straight]]'' have made mention of ''The L Word'' as to reference lesbians.

By the time the sixth and final season began, ''The New York Times'' was calling the show a "[[History of lesbianism|Sapphic]] ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]]" that has "shown little interest in variegating portrayals of gay experience. Instead it has seemed to work almost single-mindedly to counter the notion of "[[lesbian bed death]]" and repeatedly remind the viewer of the "limits and tortures of monogamy" while "never align[ing] itself with the traditionalist ambitions [for [[same-sex marriage]]] of a large faction of the gay rights movement".&lt;ref name="nyt2009"&gt;{{cite news| title=So Many Temptations to Succumb to, So Many Wandering Eyes to Track| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/arts/television/16word.html?fta=y| author=[[Ginia Bellafante]]| accessdate=2009-03-16| publisher=The New York Times | date=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2006, [[Laurel Holloman]] won a [[Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama]] for her portrayal of [[Tina Kennard]]; the [[International Press Academy]] also nominated the show for a [[Satellite Award for Best Television Series – Drama]].  In the second season, [[Ossie Davis]] received a posthumous [[57th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Actor in a drama series]] in recognition of his portrayal of the father of [[Bette Porter|Bette]] and [[Kit Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001115/awards?ref_=nm_awd "Ossie Davis - Awards," IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; The show received multiple nominations for [[GLAAD Media Awards]] and both [[Pam Grier]] and [[Jennifer Beals]] were repeatedly nominated for [[NAACP Image Awards]].

In 2008 ''The L Word'''s companion website was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]]s for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for Best Use of Commercial Advertising on Personal Computers.

'''''The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania''''' is an oil on canvas painting by the Scottish artist Sir [[Joseph Noel Paton]]. Painted in 1849, it depicts the scene from [[William Shakespeare]]'s comedy play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', when the fairy queen [[Titania]] and fairy king [[Oberon]] quarrel; Oberon was considered the King of the fairies in medieval and Renaissance literature.  When exhibited in Edinburgh during 1850, it was declared as the "painting of the season".{{r|National}} It was acquired by the [[National Galleries of Scotland]] in 1897, having initially been bought by the Royal Association for Promoting the Fine Arts in Scotland during 1850. An earlier version of this painting was Paton's diploma picture, which was submitted to the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] in 1846; they paid £700 for it.

==Description==
The overall dimensions of the oil on canvas painting are {{convert|99|by|152|cm}}.{{r|BBC}} Based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s comedy play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', it depicts a scene in which the fairy queen [[Titania]] and fairy king [[Oberon]] quarrel with each other. Oberon was considered the King of the fairies in medieval and Renaissance literature. The scene depicts Act II, scene i,{{r|Emory}} put into an enchanting imaginary landscape when Oberon is arguing with Titania,{{sfnp|Jacobson|2004|p=30|ps=}} just as nightfall descends.{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=92|ps=}} The setting is the couple's woodland home outside Athens and they are surrounded by a group of fairies.{{sfnp|Jacobson|2004|p=30|ps=}} According to [[Lewis Carroll]], the author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', 165 fairies are in the painting.{{r|National}} The subject of the couple's argument is the [[changeling]] boy,{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=89|ps=}} who is hiding behind Titania.{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=90|ps=}} A lily pond is at the front of the painting and the woodland setting is made up from leaves, flowers and aged twisted trees.{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=90|ps=}} Titania's head is encircled by a group of fairies forming a bright crown of light.{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=90|ps=}} A statue of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] with a set of pipes is placed to the right of the picture with several couples in a state of undress positioned beneath it.{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=90|ps=}} [[Goblin]]s mingle with [[elf|elves]] and [[imp]]s that all cavort among the nude fairies;{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=90|ps=}} some other little, ugly figures are scattered throughout together with moths, beetles, spiders and snails.{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=91|ps=}}

Paton's earlier work in 1847, ''The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania'', was considered by Paton to be "related yet self-contained".{{r|Victorian}}

==Exhibitions and provenance==
First exhibited at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] in 1850,{{r|Sothebys}} where it was declared to be the "painting of the season",{{r|National}} the picture was purchased by the Royal Association for Promoting the Fine Arts in Scotland during that year.{{r|National}} The ''Quarrel'' was later displayed at the Paris Exhibition in 1855,{{r|Western}} being listed as "Representative of British Art".{{r|Paisley}} It passed to the ownership of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]] in 1897.{{r|National}} An earlier study of this painting was completed in 1846 and featured as Paton's diploma picture{{r|Reconciliation}} at the Royal Scottish Academy that year.{{r|Victorian}} The Academy purchased the earlier work for £700.{{sfnp|Oxford University Press|2012|p=193|ps=}}

According to Richard Schindler, Associate Professor of Art at [[Allegheny College]],{{r|Allegheny}} the piece bears influences from the works of [[Henry Fuseli]], an opinion shared by Carole Silver, a professor with a particular interest in the [[Victorian era|19th-century]] fascination with fairies.{{sfnp|Silver|2000|p=215|ps=}}{{sfnp|Haase|2007|p=1158|ps=}} Christopher Wood, an expert in Victorian art,{{r|Telegraph}} described Paton's work as being "some of the most remarkable fairy pictures".{{sfnp|Wood|2008|p=86|ps=}}

'''''The straw hat''''' is an oil painting by [[Nikolaos Lytras]] created in 1925, and is considered as one of the most daring and impressive works of early Greek [[Modernism]]. It is exhibited at the [[National Gallery of Greece]].&lt;ref name="litras"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Αφροδίτη Κούρια|title=Νίκος Λύτρας: χτίζοντας με το χρώμα και το φως|chapter=|publisher=Εθνική Πινακοθήκη, Μουσείο Αλεξάνδρου Σούτζου|url=|year=2008|place=Αθήνα|pages=|isbn=978-960-201-191-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinak"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Λύτρας Νίκος (1883 - 1927) Το ψάθινο καπέλο|url=http://www.nationalgallery.gr/site/content.php?artwork_id=71942|publisher=Εθνική Πινακοθήκη|date=|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theme ==
The theme depicts a young girl with a straw hat in a whitened courtyard in an island landscape during a hot summer day.&lt;ref name="litras"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Αφροδίτη Κούρια|title=Νίκος Λύτρας: χτίζοντας με το χρώμα και το φως|chapter=|publisher=Εθνική Πινακοθήκη, Μουσείο Αλεξάνδρου Σούτζου|url=|year=2008|place=Αθήνα|pages=|isbn=978-960-201-191-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinak"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Λύτρας Νίκος (1883 - 1927) Το ψάθινο καπέλο|url=http://www.nationalgallery.gr/site/content.php?artwork_id=71942|publisher=Εθνική Πινακοθήκη|date=|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3140">'''Thomas Kershaw''' (1819&amp;ndash;1898) was a leading British pioneer of [[marbleizing]], the creation of imitation marble finishes.

He was born in Standish, Lancashire and from the age of 12 served his time as an apprentice to John Platt, a Bolton painter and decorator. During this time he bought graining tools with money earned from painting pictures and developed his skills in the art of wood graining. On completion of his apprenticeship he moved firstly to Manchester, then York and finally in 1845 to London. There he was employed by [[William Cubitt and Company]], becoming their leading wood grainer.

In the mid-1840s he left Cubitts to be independent and exhibited his imitation marble panels at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, which won him a prize. At the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle of 1855]] he won a gold medal, but felt obliged to carry out public demonstrations of his craft in the exhibition hall after accusations that he was using some type of fraudulent transfer technique. On his return he bought a house in Baker Street and set up his own specialist decorating company.

He was given several lucrative contracts, including one from the Royal family to marbleise the columns at [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Osborne House]], but turned down a request from the Russian Ambassador to marbleise the interior of the Imperial Palace in St Petersburg. In 1862 he won another gold medal at the London Exhibition and was elected a liveryman in the Painter-Stainers Company for thirty-eight years. In 1860 he was granted the [[Freedom of the City]] of London.

He died a rich man in 1898. He had married in 1857 and had a daughter.

A '''unit production manager''' ('''UPM''') is the [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]]–approved title for the top [[Below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]] staff position, responsible for the administration of a [[feature film]] or television production. Non-DGA productions might call it the '''production manager''' or '''production supervisor'''. They work closely with the [[line producer]]. Sometimes the line producer is the UPM. A senior producer may assign a UPM more than one production at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DGA 2011 Basic Agreement |year=2011 |publisher=Directors Guild of America |location=Los Angeles, California |pages=13 |url=http://www.dga.org/Contracts/~/link.aspx?_id=7D5BFF125CE044E6B049F7E2B1A4FD70&amp;_z=z|chapter=1-302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility to a senior producer==
A UPM is usually hired by a [[film producer]] or [[television producer]], and is responsible for managing the production and regulating the costs of delivering the expected film or television show on budget at the end of principal photography. Based on a shooting script, the UPM will create a working budget during [[pre-production]], prior to the start of [[principal photography]], thereby charting a recommended budgetary course. Typically, a producer will oversee all the cost-related decisions, including [[Above the line (film production)|above-the-line]] expenditures (especially during [[pre-production]]). However, the UPM is responsible for the more detailed planning and execution of the [[Below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]] costs (primarily for physical production). The film's [[Film director|director]] will select important department heads (keys) or support personnel related to his work, including the [[casting director]], [[cinematographer]], [[costume designer]], [[production designer]], and [[film editor]]. For below-the-line matters, the UPM often negotiates deals (for location, equipment, etc.) and hires the remaining crew, typically on the recommendation of the keys and/or based on prior experience with trusted individuals.

The UPM frequently does not have any direct responsibilities with the creative direction of the film's narrative, although in some cases he will and can be consulted.  Many budget decisions affect the creative direction of the project. He or she is to support the director's artistic vision on a daily physical production level.

Before principal photography begins both the producer and UPM work to secure as many of the production elements as possible, including a workable schedule and budget. Usually from a production office during pre-production, they may later divide their time between the office and the set while the film is being shot. An on-set trailer may also be used as a makeshift production office. Like nearly all members of a film crew, UPMs will typically remain on the shoot until the end of principal photography and can return if there are any reshoots. It is not atypical for a UPM to work 80-100 (or more) hours per week while a film is in production.

In the [[United States of America|US]], a union UPM is represented by [[The Directors Guild of America]]. Certain conditions must be adhered to on a union shoot in order to remain in good standing with the DGA. These include expected salary rates, working hours, overtime penalties, required meals and other related criteria.

Highly experienced UPMs bring great value to a project for their strategic and creative problem-solving skills. These individuals will positively affect the film's budget as well as the final outcome and quality of the film on multiple levels.

==Duties==
The UPM, under the supervision of the employer, is required to coordinate, facilitate and oversee the preparation of the production unit or units (to the extent herein provided) assigned to him or her, all off-set logistics, day-to-day production decisions, locations, budget schedules and personnel. Without limitation, among the duties which the Employer must assign to the UPM or First Assistant are the supervision of or participation in the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DGA 2011 Basic Agreement|year=2011|publisher=Directors Guild of America|location=Los Angeles, California|pages=13–15|url=http://www.dga.org/Contracts/~/link.aspx?_id=7D5BFF125CE044E6B049F7E2B1A4FD70&amp;_z=z}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prepare breakdown and preliminary shooting schedule.
* Prepare or coordinate the budget.
* Oversee preliminary search and survey of all locations and the completion of business arrangements for the same.
* Assist in the preparation of the production to ensure continuing efficiency.
* Supervise completion of the Production Report for each day's work, showing work covered and the status of the production, and arrange for the distribution of that report in line with the company's requirement.
* Coordinate arrangements for the transportation and housing of cast, crew and staff.
* Oversee the securing of releases and negotiate for locations and personnel.
* Maintain a liaison with local authorities regarding locations and the operation of the company.

The '''vagina and vulva have been depicted in art''' from [[prehistoric art|prehistory]] to the [[contemporary art]] era of the 21st century. [[Visual art]] forms representing the female genitals encompass two-dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g. statuettes). As long ago as 35,000 years ago, people sculpted [[Venus figurine]]s that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or [[vulva]].

In 1866, [[Gustave Courbet]] painted a picture of a nude woman which depicted the female genitals, entitled "[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]". In the 20th and 21st century, artists such as [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Megumi Igarashi]] and [[Anish Kapoor]] have created artworks that depict the [[vagina]] or [[vulva]]. Sometimes these are explicitly works of [[feminist art]]: [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' to celebrate 39 women of history and myth, many of whom had fallen into obscurity. Other artists deny that their works reference the vulva or vagina, although critics view them as such; the flower paintings of [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] are a case in point.

There have long been folklore traditions, such as the ''[[vagina loquens]]'' ("talking vagina") and the ''[[vagina dentata]]'' ("toothed vagina"). Playwright [[Eve Ensler]] wrote the ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'', a popular stage work about many aspects of [[human female sexuality|women's sexuality]]. In some cases, vagina- or vulva-themed art has attracted controversy and led to legal issues or official [[censorship]] pertaining to perceptions of [[obscenity]].

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Venus of Hohle Fels]] sculpture, which is at least 35,000 years old, is the oldest example of a vulva in art.]]

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations of the vulva, i.e. paintings and [[figurine]]s, exist from tens of millennia ago.  They are some of the earliest works of [[prehistoric art]].

The [[cave of Chufín]] located in the town of Riclones in [[Cantabria]] ([[Spain]]) has prehistoric rock art which may be a depiction of the vulva. The cave was occupied at different periods, the oldest being around 20,000 years ago. Aside from schematic engravings and paintings of animals, there are also many symbols, such as a those known as "sticks". There is also a large number of drawings using points (''puntillaje''), including one which has been interpreted as a representation of a vulva.

A [[Venus figurine]] is any [[Upper Paleolithic]] statuette portraying a woman. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, extending their distribution across much of Eurasia. Most of them date from the [[Gravettian]] period (28,000–22,000 years ago), but examples exist as early as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], which dates back at least 35,000 years to the [[Aurignacian]], and as late as the [[Venus of Monruz]], from about 11,000 years ago in the [[Magdalenian]].

These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as [[steatite]], [[calcite]] or [[limestone]]), bone or ivory, or formed of [[clay]] and fired. The latter are among the oldest [[ceramic]]s known. In total, over a hundred such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between 4&amp;nbsp;cm and 25&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Most of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless.

===Ancient times===
The ancient [[Sumer]]ians regarded the vulva as sacred&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dening|first=Sarah|date=1996|chapter=Chapter 3: Sex in Ancient Civilizations|title=The Mythology of Sex|url=http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm|location=London, England|publisher=Macmillian|isbn=978-0-02-861207-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leick2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|page=96|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a vast number of [[Sumerian poetry|Sumerian poems]] praising the vulva of the goddess [[Inanna]] have survived.&lt;ref name="Leick2013"/&gt; In [[Sumerian religion]], the goddess [[Nin-imma]] is the divine personification of female genitalia.&lt;ref name="Ceccarelli"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ceccarelli|first=Manuel|date=2016|title=Enki und Ninmah: Eine mythische Erzählung in sumerischer Sprache|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mI552wy2ccC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Nin-imma+personification+of+female+genitalia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxhcCyl_LaAhWZ2YMKHRQLDSIQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Nin-imma%20personification%20of%20female%20genitalia&amp;f=false|location=Tübingen, Germany|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|series=Orientalische Relionen in der Antik|volume=16|isbn=978-3-16-154278-7|page=21|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Launderville"&gt;{{cite book|last=Launderville|first=Dale|date=2010|title=Celibacy in the Ancient World: Its Ideal and Practice in Pre-Hellenistic Israel, Mesopotamia, and Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDe0gv9GJQcC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Nin-imma&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja8rDAmfLaAhWL8YMKHSTDDesQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Nin-imma&amp;f=false|series=A Michael Glazier Book|location=Collegeville, Maryland|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5734-8|page=184|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name literally means "lady female genitals".&lt;ref name="Launderville"/&gt; She appears in one version of the myth of ''[[Enki]] and Ninsikila'' in which she is the daughter of Enki and [[Ninkurra]].&lt;ref name="Launderville"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Thorkild|date=1987|title=The Harps that Once...: Sumerian Poetry in Translation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L-BI0h41yCEC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Uttu#v=onepage&amp;q=Uttu&amp;f=false|location=New Haven, Connecticut|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300072783|page=195|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enki rapes her and causes her to give birth to [[Uttu]], the goddess of weaving and vegetation.&lt;ref name="Launderville"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"/&gt; Vaginal fluid is always described in Sumerian texts as tasting "sweet"&lt;ref name="Leick2013"/&gt; and, in a Sumerian Bridal Hymn, a young maiden rejoices that her vulva has grown hair.&lt;ref name="Leick2013"/&gt; Clay models of vulvae were discovered in the temple of Inanna at [[Ashur]];&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=150–152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; these models likely served as some form of [[amulet]]s, possibly to protect against [[impotency]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;

===11th and 12th century===
[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 12th century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]
[[Sheela na gig]]s are 11th and 12th century figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated vulva. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found on churches, castles, and other buildings, particularly in Ireland and Great Britain, sometimes together with male figures. One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland. There is a replica of the round tower sheela na gig in the county museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

Such carvings are said to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other grotesques, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over Europe. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep evil spirits away through the use of [[apotropaic magic]]. They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

Weir and Jerman argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female lust as hideous and sinfully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian fertility or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J.

===Folklore traditions===
The [[vagina loquens]], or "talking vagina", is a significant tradition in literature and art, dating back to ancient [[Motif (folkloristics)|folklore motifs]].&lt;ref name=ozark&gt;{{cite book|title=Unprintable Ozark Folksongs and Folklore: Blow the candle out|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|author=Vance Randolph, Gershon Legman |year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S93LdPw2KP0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=1557282374|pages=819–820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zizek&gt;{{cite book|title=Organs without bodies: Deleuze and consequences|publisher=[[Routledge]]|author=Slavoj Zizek |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp6-1yQbgmgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0415969212|page=173|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tales usually involve vaginas talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity.&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt;

Another folk tale concerns the [[vagina dentata]] ("toothed vagina"). The implication of these tales is that sexual intercourse might result in injury, [[emasculation]], or [[castration]] for the man involved. These stories were frequently told as [[cautionary tale]]s warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage rape.&lt;ref name=WhatsUp&gt;{{cite book| isbn = 978-0-312-64436-9| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2ybaNhKqGmwC&amp;pg=PA59| title       = What's Up Down There?: Questions You'd Only Ask Your Gynecologist If She Was Your Best Friend| publisher  = [[St. Martin's Press]]| date = 2010| accessdate = 2012-02-11| quote = | page= 59| author = Rankin, Lissa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary art===
[[File:Blue-green.jpg|thumb|right|upright|While [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]'s paintings have been interpreted by some modern feminist artists as stylized depictions of the vulva, O'Keeffe herself consistently denied these Freudian interpretations of her paintings (pictured is "Blue and Green Music", 1921).]]

In 1966, the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] collaborated with [[Dadaist]] artist [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[:sv:Per Olof Ultvedt|Per Olof Ultvedt]] on a large sculpture installation entitled "hon-en katedral" (also spelled "Hon-en-Katedrall", which means "she-a cathedral") for Moderna Museet, in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

Museum patrons can go inside her body by entering a door-sized vaginal opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nikidesaintphalle.org/niki-de-saint-phalle/biography/#1965-1969 "Biography - 1965-69"], Niki de Saint Phalle Foundation, Retrieved 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Phalle stated that the sculpture represented a [[fertility goddess]] who was able to receive visitors into her body and then "give birth" to them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/4436238/_In_sorrow_she_created_delight_An_Appeal_for_a_Greater_Appraisal_of_the_Life_and_Art_of_Niki_de_Saint_Phalle |title="In sorrow, she created delight": An Appeal for a Greater Appraisal of the Life and Art of Niki de Saint Phalle |last1=Tripp |first1=Andrew |last2= |first2= |date=  |page=10 |website=www.academia.edu|publisher=Academia |access-date=24 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside her body is a screen showing [[Greta Garbo]] films, a goldfish pond and a soft drink vending machine.

From 1974 to 1979, [[Judy Chicago]], a [[feminist art]]ist, created the vulva-themed [[installation art]]work "[[The Dinner Party]]". It consists of 39 elaborate place settings arranged along a triangular table for 39 mythical and historical famous women. [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora of Byzantium]] are among those honoured. Each plate, except the one corresponding to Sojourner Truth (a Black woman), depicts a brightly-colored, elaborately styled butterfly-vulva form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Museum: Place Settings|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings/|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was produced, despite resistance from the art world, it toured to 16 venues in six countries to a viewing audience of 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Maura|title=founding curator|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/tour_and_home.php|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, it has been on permanent exhibition in [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art|the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York. Chicago gave [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] a prominent place in ''The Dinner Party'', because some modern feminists believe that O'Keeffe's detailed flower paintings such as ''Black Iris III'' (1926) evoke a veiled representation of female genitalia. O'Keeffe consistently denied the validity these Freudian interpretations of her art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/166103/Georgia_OKeeffe_Place_Setting/ |title=Georgia O'Keeffe Place Setting |publisher=[[Brooklyn Museum]] |accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', a 1996 episodic play by [[Eve Ensler]], has contributed to making female sexuality a topic of public discourse. It is made up of a varying number of monologues read by a number of women. Initially, Ensler performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses; latter versions feature a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the [[Femininity|feminine experience]], touching on matters such as sexual activity, love, [[rape]], menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the various common names for the vagina, or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the pieces is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Ensler, Eve (2001).

[[Lena Marquise]] is a [[Russians|Russian]]-born, American visual and performance artist. Her work often covers the subjects of [[sex work]] and censorship, eliciting critical response for its controversial eroticism. In 2014, at Art Basel Miami, Marquise performed in an [[installation art]]work, "Body As Commodity", at VECTOR Gallery. In this artwork, she charged cellphones with her vagina.

It was the top story generated during Art Basel. VECTOR Gallery is curated and operated by [[JJ Brine]], who is an American [[visual artist]] and [[Contemporary art gallery|gallerist]].

In Japan, artist [[Megumi Igarashi]] has drawn attention for her work featuring vaginas and vulvas, which she considers "overly hidden" in Japan compared to male genitalia. In July 2014, Igarashi was arrested by Japanese authorities for distributing 3D data of her vulva to contributors of her crowdsource campaign. She has also made vagina-themed sculptures.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCurry|first1=Justin|title=Vagina selfie for 3D printers lands Japanese artist in trouble|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/15/vagina-selfie-for-3d-printers-lands-japanese-artist-in-trouble|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While police charged Igarashi for her vulva- and vagina-themed artworks, there are several phallus festivals in Japan in which participants parade with massive penis sculptures, a practice which is deemed acceptable by authorities.

In 2015 [[Anish Kapoor]], a [[Turner Prize]]-winning artist, created controversy with his sculpture entitled "Dirty Corner", a "massive steel funnel set in broken stone, placed in the garden of the...[[Palace of Versailles]]", which he claims is a depiction of the vagina of the former Queen of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frank |first=Priscilla|date=6 August 2015 |title=Anish Kapoor Put A Vagina Sculpture In Versailles' Garden, And People Are Unimpressed |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/anish-kapoor-vagina-sculpture_n_7537204 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |location= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wading in the Water''''' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist [[India Cruse-Griffin]] located on the [[Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital|Eskenazi Health]] campus, near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], and is part of the [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection]].

== Description ==
''Wading in the Water'' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist India Cruse-Griffin, which depicts a young woman in a pink dress in front of a tree-lined bank, waist deep in a body of water, reaching down to grab a fish. The work, which measures 37.25" x 49.25", framed, is made from collaged paper gathered from magazines, upon which Cruse-Griffin then paints, often allowing the underlying magazine paper to show through.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/wading-water|title=Wading in the Water {{!}} Public Art Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publicartarchive.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiacg.wix.com/artist#!artist-spotlight|title=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST {{!}} Wix.com|work=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her subjects are often clear and straightforward, this collage technique serves as a reminder of the accumulation of lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ziegler &amp; Co.''' was a [[Manchester]]-based Anglo-Swiss producer and distributor of [[Persian carpet]]s in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The company had workshops in [[Tabriz]] and [[Arak, Iran|Sultanabad]] (now Arak), and it supplied retailers such as [[Liberty &amp; Company]] and [[Harvey Nichols]]. 

The company's designs were modified (often substantially so) versions of more traditional Persian designs, and it used the latest dying techniques and employed the best artisans from the area. The company's carpets tended to have bolder all-over patterns and softer palettes than the livelier traditional Persian carpets. 

"Ziegler carpets" long ago became a term used to refer to this style of carpet. Modern-day Ziegler-style carpets are being produced in many countries. Original Ziegler carpets and old carpets with similar designs are often highly valued by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Ittig, Annette (1992) Ziegler's Sultanabad carpet enterprise.
