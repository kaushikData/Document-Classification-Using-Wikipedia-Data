He was apprenticed in 1789 to his uncle John Miller. They later went into business together as Miller and Adie, Mathematical Instrument Makers, which continued until 1822.

His shop was at 58 [[Princes Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://digital.nls.uk/directories/browse/pageturner.cfm?id=83399607&amp;mode=transcription| title= Post-Office Annual directory for Edinburgh and its environs 1832–33|page= 37 |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adie lived at 10 [[Regent Terrace]], Edinburgh, from 1832 to 1838.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;Mitchell, Anne (1993), ''The People of Calton Hill'', Mercat Press, James Thin, Edinburgh, {{ISBN|1-873644-18-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He died at Caanan Lodge, in the [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]] district of Edinburgh (now demolished) in December 1858, and was interred in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The grave lies to the south-west of the church, just to the north-east of the [[William Adam (architect)|Adam]] mausoleum.

His daughter married [[Thomas Henderson (astronomer)|Thomas Henderson]] (1798–1844). Henderson is buried with Adie but is not listed on the memorial.

[[File:Kolkata BBD Bagh2.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Writers' Building from across [[Lal Dighi]] in B.B.D. Bagh]]
'''B.B.D. Bagh''', formerly called '''Dalhousie Square''', is the shortened version for Benoy-Badal-Dinesh Bagh. It is the seat of power of the state government, as well as the [[central business district]] in [[Kolkata]] in [[Kolkata district]] in the [[India]]n  [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]].

==Origin of name==
[[File:Memory_of_martyrdom.jpg|thumb|Memory of martyrdom]]
{{Benoy Badal Dinesh}}
B.B.D. stands for three young [[Indian independence freedom fighters]] — [[Benoy Basu|Benoy]], [[Badal Gupta|Badal]] and [[Dinesh Gupta|Dinesh]] — who on 8 December 1930 shot dead the Inspector General of Prisons, N.S. Simpson, in the balconies of the [[Writers' Building]] of the then Dalhousie Square. The square had been named after [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], [[Governor General of India]] from 1847 to 1856. At different times it has been called ‘The Green before the Fort’ or Tank Square.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, H.E.A., ''Calcutta Old and New'', 1909/1980, p 268-9, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=300px|quote=As we enter the town, very expansive square opens before us, with a large expanse of water in the middle, for public use… the square itself is composed of magnificent houses which render Calcutta not only the handsomest town in Asia but one of the finest in the world. One side of the square consists of a range of buildings occupied by persons in civil employments under the Company, such as writers in public offices.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi, ''Traders and Trades in Old Calcutta'', in ''Calcutta, the Living City'', Vol I, pp. 156-160, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-563696-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|source= [[Louis de Grandpré|L. de Grandpre]], ''A Voyage in the Indian Ocean and to Bengal'' (1803)}}

==Geography==
The B.B.D. Bagh area is near the [[Hooghly River]] in the western part of central [[Kolkata]] and is a square built around the old [[Lal Dighi]] tank. The old fort built by the British was near where the General Post Office now is. The area was in the heart of [[Kalikata]] or the White Town in old Calcutta.

==History==

[[File:Dalhousie 1870s.jpg|thumbnail|left|A picture of Dalhousie Square looking northeast in the 1870s ]]
[[File:General Post Office (GPO), Calcutta (c. 1880s).jpg|thumbnail|right|A view of the General Post Office in the 1880s]]
B.B.D. Bagh (or Dalhousie Square as it was formerly known) was created as the center of the [[British East India Company|British East India Company's]] trading post along the banks of the Hooghly River. Between the river and the tank (now known as [[Lal Dighi]]), lay the original Fort William. In the summer of 1756, [[Siraj ud-Daulah|Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah]] of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa launched an attack on the British town for the company's decision to strengthen the fortifications around it. The survivors of the attack were sent to a garrison within the fort which spurred an incident infamously known as the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]. The British soon retook the city after the Nawab retreated from the forces of [[Robert Clive]]. Within a year, the British East India Company's forces had taken all of Bengal and Calcutta, along with the square, was established as the commercial and political center of [[British India]]. 

Over the next one and a half centuries, the square grew in importance and influence. It was named after [[Lord Dalhousie]], the Governor-General of India. After the fall of company rule in India, the Writers' Building became the secretariat of the Viceroy of India. A number of corporations and institutions opened offices and headquarters in and around the square, giving it its role as the central business district of the city. In 1912, the capital of British India was officially moved to [[New Delhi]], but the majority of the financial and political institutions in the area remained. 

During the first half of the 20th century, the [[Indian Independence Movement]] began to reach its peak and took a violent turn in Bengal. On the eighth of December 1930, three revolutionaries, Benoy, Badal, and Dinesh, stormed the building and fatally shot the Inspector General of Prisons, N.S. Simpson. The three committed suicide and the square was renamed B.B.D. Bagh in their honor after Indian independence. In 1947, the political establishments were officially handed over to the government of India and the government of the newly formed state of [[West Bengal]]. Over the next few decades, Calcutta (as it was known) would go through rapid economic decline, but B.B.D. Bagh would remain the heart of East India.

==Modern significance==

[[File:KolkataHSBC.JPG|thumbnail|right|Hong Kong House which has and still houses the offices of HSBC in Kolkata.]]
B.B.D. Bagh is still the commercial and political center of all of East India and many of the business and political institutions from the colonial era still exist. The centerpiece is the [[Writers' Building]] which is the secretariat of the Government of the State of West Bengal and houses the office of the [[Chief Minister of West Bengal]]. To the west lie the [[General Post Office, Kolkata|General Post Office]], the Royal Insurance Building, the eastern office of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], the headquarters of the [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railway]], head office of the [[Kolkata Port Trust]], and a number of other government offices. The native name of the area is '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Office Para'''. To the north lie the Royal Exchange Building which houses the [[Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry]], the [[Calcutta Stock Exchange]], the [[Standard Chartered]] Building, and many financial establishments. The eastern end also houses a number of offices till [[Chittaranjan Avenue]]. The area south of the square is home to the [[Raj Bhavan (West Bengal)|Raj Bhavan]], which is now the residence of the governor and the former residence of the viceroy and governor-general of India. A number of former British colonial administrative offices, including the former foreign and military secretariats, the Treasury Office, the Telegraph Office, and the [[Kolkata Town Hall]] can be found here. This area is also a major commercial district with the offices of [[HSBC]] at Hong Kong House and the [[Great Eastern Hotel (Kolkata)|Great Eastern Hotel]].  

B.B.D. Bagh can still be considered as one of the best remnants and concentrated zones of British colonial architecture in the world. The square is also characterized by other historical landmarks including [[St. John's Church, Kolkata|St. John's Church]], which was one of the first buildings in Calcutta and is modeled on [[St. Martin-in-the-Fields]] in London's Trafalgar Square. The church is home to beautiful stained glass windows and paintings as well as the mausoleum of [[Job Charnock]], the man who founded modern Calcutta. B.B.D. Bagh also has a statue of famous philanthropist [[Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh]] of [[Raj Darbhanga|Darbhanga]] (1858–1898), sculpted by [[Edward Onslow Ford]].

Overall, the square sees thousands of people arriving from all over the [[Kolkata metropolitan area]] to the offices and businesses that have characterized the area for the last three centuries since the establishment of Calcutta.

==Preservation==

Dalhousie Square was included in the [[2004 World Monuments Watch|2004]] and [[2006 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]] due to "decades of neglect".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/project/dalhousie-square World Monuments Fund - Dalhousie Square]&lt;/ref&gt; After this listing the international financial services company [[American Express]] provided funding through WMF for the square's preservation. A number of buildings in the area have also been listed as heritage buildings and have gone through extensive restorations to bring back the charm of the square. The centerpiece, the Writers' Building, has been temporarily vacated to give way for a massive restoration of the building, which has fallen into disrepair in many areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1876">A '''Court of Assistants''' is a council of members belonging to professional, trade, craft or livery organisations. The term originated among the London [[Livery Company|Livery companies]], as 'certain senior members who manage the affairs of the City of London Companies',&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Onions (ed. and rev.), ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' 3rd Edition (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1964 revision): the term is capitalized.&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be used by other trade associations. The Court of Assistants is usually the governing body of these organisations and may include the officials, as in the case of the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] founded in 1631: "The governing body of the Company is the Court of Assistants, comprising the Master, three Wardens and not less than ten Assistants."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clockmakers.org/about/the-court-committees-panels/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Another example is the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], which has an annual general court open to all members. It meets in March to elect 20 Assistants. The Company is governed in its civil and financial affairs by the court of assistants, which was first established in 1633.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.hac.org.uk/html/about-the-hac/court-of-assistants/?PHPSESSID=9ed42c54191317cd20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330161537/http://www.hac.org.uk/html/about-the-hac/court-of-assistants/?PHPSESSID=9ed42c54191317cd20 |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Culpa in contrahendo''''' is a [[Latin]] expression meaning "fault in conclusion of a contract". It is an important concept in [[contract law]] for many civil law countries, which recognize a clear duty to negotiate with care, and not to lead a negotiating partner to act to his detriment before a firm contract is concluded. In [[German contract law]], §311 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] lists a number of steps by which an obligation to pay damages may be created.

By contrast, in [[English contract law]], and many other common law jurisdictions, there has been stulted judicial acceptance of this concept. The doctrine of [[estoppel]] has been mooted by academics as a good model, but judges have refused to let it be a sidestep of the doctrine of [[consideration]], saying estoppel must be a shield not a sword, and calling instead for Parliamentary intervention.&lt;ref&gt;The English and Scottish Law Commissions invited [[Harvey McGregor]] to draw up a "Contract Code" (being a codification and fusion of English and Scots contract law), but neither country has adopted his 1993 recommendations.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the case of land, [[proprietary estoppel]] effectively created obligations regardless of any pre-existing contract. In the [[United States]], however, courts have allowed [[promissory estoppel]] to function as a substitute for the consideration doctrine. This movement was stimulated by the acceptance of the concept in section 90 of the first ''[[Restatement of Contracts]]''.

==''Culpa in contrahendo'' under German law==
Rudolf von Jhering is credited with developing the ''culpa in contrahendo'' doctrine. Originally, according to the prevailing interpretation of the German Civil Code, there was no such legal doctrine. The courts saw a gap in the law and used the ''culpa in contrahendo'' doctrine to fill it.

Since the 2001 reform of the law of obligations, ''culpa in contrahendo'' is provided for by statute. (§311(2) in connection with §§280(1) and 241(2) of the German Civil Code).

Jhering argued that the "reliance measure" ought to be the proper one in "not quite" contracts, e.g. where there is a misunderstanding as to the terms of the contract.

'''Denis O'Brien''' (born 19 April 1958) is an Irish businessman and the founder and owner of [[Digicel]] and [[Communicorp]]. He was listed among the World's Top 200 Billionaires in 2015 and is also Ireland's richest native-born citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moriarty-tribunal.ie/|title=Moriarty Tribunal – Inquiry into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters|website=moriarty-tribunal.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes_world_billionaires&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/14|title=The World's Billionaires|magazine=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32936667|title=Denis O'Brien: High court injunction prevents Irish media reporting on businessman's finances|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His business interests also extend to aircraft leasing ([[Aergo Capital]]), utilities support ([[Actavo]]), petroleum ([[Topaz Energy]], until 2016), and football (soccer), being a minority shareholder of [[Celtic F.C.]]. O'Brien was implicated by the [[Moriarty Tribunal]] as having improperly influenced the decision to award a mobile phone license to the [[Esat Digifone]] consortium, which he chaired.

== Early life ==
O'Brien was born in the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and grew up in the [[Ballsbridge]] area of [[Dublin]]. His father was a salesperson for a veterinary pharmaceutical company, and he often accompanied his father on business trips, where he learned how to "sell and to present". He attended [[The High School, Dublin|The High School]] in [[Rathgar]], and although he was suspended for disciplinary problems, his talent for [[rugby football|rugby]] was such that he was asked to return so that he could participate in a championship for the school.&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;

He studied politics, history and logic at [[University College Dublin]], graduating in 1977. After winning a scholarship from [[Boston College]] while attending UCD, he completed an MBA in corporate finance there in 1982. Upon his return to Dublin, he was employed as an assistant manager in a local bank, but left that job and became a [[personal assistant]] to [[Tony Ryan]], owner of an aircraft leasing company.&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;

== Career ==
O'Brien owns [[Communicorp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/denis-o-brien-s-communicorp-sells-latvian-radio-group-1.2365092|title=Denis O’Brien’s Communicorp sells Latvian radio group|language=en-US|access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a media holding company which operates across Europe,  particularly in Ireland where it dominates national radio (apart from RTÉ) including stations like [[Newstalk]] and [[Today FM]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as "the biggest player in Ireland's media landscape" and notes that "his Independent News &amp; Media group controls the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' as well as the ''[[Irish Daily Star]]'', the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', the ''[[Sunday World]]'', Dublin's ''[[Evening Herald]]'' and regional newspapers,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/world/europe/ireland-rte-denis-obrien.html|title=Irish Media, Fearing Lawsuits, Steers Clear of a Billionaire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; through his minority shareholding in the group. According to [[Fintan O'Toole]], O'Brien has "been allowed to take effective control of the largest Irish newspaper group and of two of [Ireland's] three national talk radio stations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jun/02/democracy-in-danger-when-one-man-exercises-excessive-private-power|title=Democracy in danger when one man exercises excessive private power|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien also owns telecoms provider [[Digicel]], which operates in 31 markets across the Caribbean, Central America and Oceania.

===Communicorp===
O'Brien established Communicorp in 1989, with the company currently owning 42 radio stations in eight European countries. 

===Esat Digifone===
O'Brien set up and chaired the [[Esat Digifone]] consortium which acquired a mobile phone licence in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy|last=Gaffney|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/news-features/we-won-because-ours-was-simply-the-best-bid-55323.html|title=We won because our was simply the best bid|newspaper=The Sunday Business Post|date=27 March 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Esat Digifone's bid defeated five other applicants, some of whom included major international operators, in controversial circumstances that became the subject of investigation by the Moriarty Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Court action on the awarding of the license by the Persona grouping has been signaled.&lt;/ref&gt; The Esat Digifone consortium was 40% owned by O'Brien's interests, 40% owned by [[Telenor]], the Norwegian state telecoms operator, with the balance being owned by International Investment and Underwriting (IIU), an investment vehicle owned by [[Dermot Desmond]].

On 7 November 1997, Esat Telecom Group plc held an initial public offering and was listed on the [[Irish Stock Exchange]], [[London Stock Exchange]], and [[NASDAQ]] Stock Markets. There were differences between O'Brien and Telenor, however, ESAT Digifone boomed. Telenor made a bid for control of the company, but O'Brien chose to sell to BT in 2000.&lt;ref name=telegraph_northedge_splash/&gt; Esat became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[BT Group plc|BT]] and was delisted from the stock market. O'Brien personally netted €317 million from the sale.&lt;ref name="TelegraphOBrien"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Russell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8399790/Denis-OBrien-paid-minister-to-help-secure-Irish-phone-licence.html|title=Denis O'Brien 'paid minister to help secure Irish phone licence'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305152931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8399790/Denis-OBrien-paid-minister-to-help-secure-Irish-phone-licence.html|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Moriarty Tribunal]] found almost beyond doubt that O'Brien's was awarded this contract due to payments he made to [[Michael Lowry]], the then communications minister, who unduly influenced the bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/cab-seeks-to-question-denis-o-brien-on-tribunal-findings-1.2490189|title=Cab seeks to question Denis O’Brien on tribunal findings|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=9 January 2016|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Esat===
After the sale of Esat, O'Brien moved to Portugal where he owns the Quinta do Lago golf complex. He later took up residency in [[Sliema]], [[Malta]].&lt;ref name="telegraph_northedge_splash"&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Northedge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2815836/Denis-OBrien-The-man-who-wants-to-make-a-splash-at-Independent-News-and-Media.html|title=Denis O'Brien: The man who wants to make a splash at Independent News &amp; Media – Telegraph|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]]|location=[[London, UK|London]]|issn=0307-1235|oclc=49632006|date=16 September 2007|accessdate=21 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305152450/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2815836/Denis-OBrien-The-man-who-wants-to-make-a-splash-at-Independent-News-and-Media.html|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His spokesperson is [[James Morrissey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/29/its-important-people-stand-up-for-democracy/|title='It's Important People Stand Up For Democracy'|date=29 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531230355/http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/29/its-important-people-stand-up-for-democracy/|archivedate=31 May 2015|quote=Denis O'Brien's tireless spokesman James Morrissey went on RTÉ Radio One's Today with Sean O'Rourke [hosted by Keelin Shanley] this morning to put forward his client's case for wishing to prevent media outlets reporting Catherine Murphy's speech to the dáil yesterday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/31/morrissey-and-mar/|title=Morrissey And Mar'|date=31 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531225937/http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/31/morrissey-and-mar/|archivedate=31 May 2015|quote=Denis O’Brien's spokesman James Morrissey and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin engaged in a pre-recorded debate with Richard Crowley for RTÉ's This Week on the ongoing constitutional brouhaha.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aergo Capital===
In 1999, O'Brien co-founded aircraft leasing company [[Aergo Capital]], registered in Dublin, with offices in Johannesburg, Nairobi, Santiago and Singapore. It owns and operates a fleet of 103 commercial aircraft. The company is valued at US$250 million and has debts in the region of US$166 million.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} O'Brien controls about 83 per cent of Aergo and, along with his father, sits on the company's six-member board. Aergo's clients include [[Alitalia]], [[Jet Airways]], [[South African Airways]], [[KLM]] and [[DHL Aviation|DHL]]. In July 2008, Aergo acquired the [[Safair]] aircraft-leasing division of Imperial Holdings for €110 million, taking over the division's 33 planes and leasing a further nine aircraft from the parent company.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} In November 2010, Aergo sold Safair, netting $35 million. Accounts filed in late-2011 showed pre-tax profits increased to $29.4 million over the previous 12 months from $2.68 million in 2009, with the number of employees decreasing from 166 to 15 over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/profits-soar-at-obriens-aircraft-leasing-firm-175764.html|title=Profits soar at O'Brien's aircraft leasing firm|work=Irish Examiner|date=2 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601175806/http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/profits-soar-at-obriens-aircraft-leasing-firm-175764.html|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digicel===
After exiting the Irish mobile phone market, O'Brien started to compete for mobile phone licenses in the Caribbean through his company [[Digicel]].&lt;ref name="pirate"&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0710/1224274381817.html|title=Plucky David or pirate of the Caribbean?|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=10 July 2010|accessdate=25 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305153108/http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/plucky-david-or-pirate-of-the-caribbean-1.620228|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Brien is involved in the Pacific with operations in Samoa, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Nauru and Papua New Guinea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digicelpacific.com/en/about/our-locations|title=Our locations|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305153738/http://www.digicelpacific.com/en/about/our-locations|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien is the owner of [[Haiti]]'s largest telecom company, Digicel. O'Brien pledged an immediate €3.5 million of his money to assist desperate Haitians within hours of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Patricia|last1=McDonagh|first2=Jason|last2=O'Brien|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/americas/obrien-pledges-836435m-as-charities-plead-for-money-2013043.html|title=O'Brien pledges €3.5m as charities plead for money|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Denis O'Brien|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Digicel's 900 staff members in Haiti died in the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=Smyth|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0114/1224262303582.html|title=All Irish citizens in area alive and well, says Foreign Affairs|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305154006/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/all-irish-citizens-in-area-alive-and-well-says-foreign-affairs-1.1268285|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digicel is Haiti's largest single investor.&lt;ref name="19022010 Silicon Republic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/15316/comms/haiti-names-obrien-goodwill-ambassador |title=Haiti names Denis O'Brien goodwill ambassador |date=19 February 2010 |publisher=''Silicon Republic'' |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224233933/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/15316/comms/haiti-names-obrien-goodwill-ambassador |archivedate=24 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digicel was involved in an extensive court battle with the Jamaican Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) throughout the 2000s. The issue originally arose after [[Phillip Paulwell]], the then Jamaican minister of industry, commerce and technology, instructed the OUR to refrain from interfering with the pricing policies of Digicel, after the regulator had itself instructed Digicel to amend its interconnectivity fees.&lt;ref name=JO&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Privy-Council-hits-Digicel_7347055|title=Blow to Digicel|newspaper=Jamaica Observer|date=22 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305151436/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Privy-Council-hits-Digicel_7347055|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Paulwell was ruled to have had no power to issue the instruction to the OUR, Digicel unsuccessfully appealed the ruling first at the Jamaican Supreme Court, which overturned the ruling, though it was subsequently upheld by Court of Appeal after a counter-appeal by OUR, and then at Jamaica's Privy Council.&lt;ref name=JO /&gt;

In January 2014, the ''[[Financial Times]]''{{'}}s Telecoms Correspondent wrote of O'Brien's intention to expand Digicel into next-generation mobile and fixed line services, with O'Brien quoted as being excited by the prospect of a "world order [that] is changing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Thomas|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a74c6b44-80fb-11e3-95aa-00144feab7de.html#axzz3bx5AjUJH|title=Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien plans ‘massive’ telecoms push|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=20 January 2014|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actavo===
Siteserv, a utilities support company sold by [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation|IBRC]] to Denis O’Brien for €45m in 2012, was renamed [[Actavo]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/siteserv-rebrands-in-euro1bn-sales-drive-rpqmd7t79l0|title=Siteserv rebrands in €1bn sales drive|first=Gavin|last=Daly|date=18 October 2015|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the renaming, Actavo had three divisions — industrial services, networks and structural — and was forecasting revenues of €400m in the same year.

===Topaz Energy===
O'Brien owned [[Topaz Energy]] until early 2016, having bought €300 million of its loans from [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]] (IBRC) in 2013. In May 2014, O'Brien appointed former [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] to the board of Topaz to join himself, his nephew (who was also CEO of Smiles Dental), Sean Corkey (CEO of O'Brien's SiteServ), Lucy Gaffney (chairperson of O'Brien's Communicorp) and Colm Doherty (former managing director of [[Allied Irish Banks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-brian-cowen-1445910-May2014/|title=Denis O'Brien owned Topaz appoints Brian Cowen as director: A number of O'Brien's other close associates have also been appointed to the board|work=TheJournal.ie|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=2 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602230141/http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-brian-cowen-1445910-May2014/|archivedate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Topaz's parent company Kendrick Investments announced it would buy all of [[Esso]]'s Irish operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/esso-topaz-denis-obrien-buy-out-1832019-Dec2014/|title=Denis O'Brien-owned Topaz to take control of 38 Esso stations|work=TheJournal.ie|date=12 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225719/http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/esso-topaz-denis-obrien-buy-out-1832019-Dec2014/|archivedate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profits at Topaz increased between April 2013 and March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-energy-record-profits-14-million-denis-obrien-1945518-Feb2015/|title=Denis O'Brien is making more money from his petrol stations|work=TheJournal.ie|date=18 February 2015|accessdate=18 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602225550/http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/topaz-energy-record-profits-14-million-denis-obrien-1945518-Feb2015/|archivedate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of Topaz was announced in January 2016. It is estimated that O’Brien sold the network of 444 filling stations for about €450 million, more than double what he paid to gain control of it from the special liquidators of the state-owned Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) in 2013. The sale also included a commercial fuels operation, with over 30 depots and two owned terminals.

In February 2016, [[Alimentation Couche-Tard]], a Canadian company that operates more than 15,000 convenience stores worldwide confirmed that it completed the acquisition of Topaz after European competition regulators approved the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpo.couche-tard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2016-02-01-Press-Release-Closing-Topaz.pdf |title=COUCHE-TARD COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF TOPAZ IN IRELAND| publisher=Alimentation Couche-Tard |date=1 February 2016| accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmet O’Neill, a nephew of O’Brien and formerly chief executive of Smiles Dental, stepped down as managing director of Topaz following completion of the transaction. 

Topaz had more than 2,000 employees and close to 35 per cent of the consumer market in Ireland at the time of the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/topaz-sale-to-couche-tard-completed-new-md-named-1.2518090|title=Topaz sale to Couche-Tard completed, new MD named|website=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, O'Brien is listed as having a "significant interest" in AIM-listed Sterling Energy.&lt;ref name=sterling_energy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlingenergyuk.com/html/investor/capita.html|title=Share Capital|publisher=Sterling Energy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601174350/http://www.sterlingenergyuk.com/html/investor/capita.html|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has production in the United States and a wide portfolio of exploration interests, mostly in West Africa.

==Family==
O'Brien married Catherine Walsh, who helped Communicorp expand into the Czech Republic, in August 1997. The couple have four children.&lt;ref name="carlos_slim" /&gt;

== Moriarty Tribunal ==
{{main article|Moriarty Tribunal}}
The Moriarty Tribunal's second and final report found that [[Michael Lowry]], Ireland's then energy and communications minister, assisted O'Brien in his bid to secure a mobile phone contract for Esat Digifone, a key foundation of O'Brien's personal wealth. The tribunal found that this happened after Lowry received a $50,000 payment from O'Brien via a circuitous route involving a complex arrangement of third parties and offshore accounts. It said that it was "beyond doubt" that Lowry gave "substantive information to Denis O'Brien, of significant value and assistance to him in securing the [mobile] licence" during at least two meetings between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie|title=Honourable Justice Michael Moriarty|publisher=[[Moriarty Tribunal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0322/breaking17.html|title=Moriarty says Lowry helped O'Brien win mobile licence|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=22 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305154503/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/moriarty-says-lowry-helped-o-brien-win-mobile-licence-1.873588|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tribunal was not a court of law; its findings were "legally sterile".

On 15 October 2011, Today FM confirmed Sam Smyth's Sunday radio show was being dropped. He had been presenting it for 14 years. Smyth had previously offended his bosses by commenting in a newspaper and on television about Today FM's owner O'Brien's involvement in the Moriarty Tribunal. Smyth said on air the next morning that he had been told not to talk about the end of his show and stopped one of his guests from talking about it too "before someone comes downstairs and pulls a wire we better move onto something else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/today-fms-sam-smyth-changes-topic-during-discussion-about-his-own-sacking-255216-Oct2011/|title=Today FM's Smyth changes topic during discussion about his own sacking|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=16 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305151315/http://www.thejournal.ie/today-fms-sam-smyth-changes-topic-during-discussion-about-his-own-sacking-255216-Oct2011/|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said it was concerned at the development, but Today FM stated that "the decision was made to address a decline in listenership and was part of an initiative to improve programming quality."

===Independent News &amp; Media===
{{main article|Independent News &amp; Media}}
In January 2006, O'Brien took a stake in [[Tony O'Reilly]]'s Independent News &amp; Media (INM). At the beginning of June 2007, O'Reilly tabled a resolution to strengthen rules on the disclosure of beneficial interests. This was regarded as a defensive measure that would empower IN&amp;M to monitor any additional accumulation of shares in the company. The resolution passed and empowers IN&amp;M to withhold dividends from investors who do not comply with a request for information on the ownership of a holding of shares. O'Brien, speaking on [[RTÉ Radio]], described the resolution as a "retrograde" measure, saying that the resolution was designed to protect the interests of O'Reilly's family against a hostile bidder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=McEnanaey|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/obrien-branded-a-dissident-and-accused-of-destabilising-company-1329206.html|title=O'Brien branded a 'dissident' and accused of destabilising company|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Denis O'Brien|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, at the same time as completing the purchase of [[Today FM]] (then Ireland's last national radio station independent of O'Brien and state broadcaster RTÉ), O'Brien increased his INM shareholding to become that company's second-biggest shareholder behind Tony O'Reilly.&lt;ref name=times_12012008/&gt;

In 2012, O'Brien seized control of INM from O'Reilly, bringing to an end four decades of that family's ownership. Brett Chenoweth, the chief executive of APN News and Media (INM's Australian arm), was forced to resign in 2013. Its Chairman Peter Hunt and three independent directors – Melinda Conrad, John Harvey and John Maasland – also resigned in a dispute with INM. Shortly before this, INM announced it would sell South African arm of its business for £146 million to a consortium fronted by [[Iqbal Survé]], a former doctor of [[Nelson Mandela]]. This followed the 2010 sale of ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' to Russian billionaire [[Alexander Lebedev]] for £1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/18/independent-news-media-resignation-australia|title=Irish publishing group ousts Australian chief executive|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2012, O'Brien holds a 29.9% stake in INM, making him the largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/media/denis-obrien-ups-stake-in-independent-news-and-media-to-299pc-3100593.html|title=Denis O'Brien ups stake in Independent News &amp; Media to 29.9pc|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Denis O'Brien|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to the O'Reilly's family stake of around 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Sweney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/08/inm-oust-chairman-finance-chief|title=INM investors oust chairman and finance chief|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|issn=0261-3077|oclc=60623878|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305151707/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/08/inm-oust-chairman-finance-chief|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of Friday 7 December 2012, O'Brien's friend and solicitor Paul Meagher contacted the ''Sunday Independent'' with orders from O'Brien to 'kill' a story concerning environment minister [[Phil Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Tighe|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIiTxqmWwAAkOlM.jpg|title=INM was asked to 'kill' Phil coverage|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 19 July 2014, group editor of INM [[Stephen Rae (editor)|Stephen Rae]] ordered the presses to be stopped to amend a column written by ''Sunday Independent'' editor [[Anne Harris (journalist)|Anne Harris]] which featured references to O'Brien. Copies of the original article did however appear, allowing comparisons between the two. Harris originally wrote: "Denis O'Brien is the major shareholder in INM. In theory, with 29% of the shares, he does not control it. ''In practice, he does''." Rae had the last sentence deleted. Harris also wrote: "The question is whether he understands newspapers. In order to confront the truths in our society, we must have a free press. ''With the restrictive charter for journalists proposed last year, and some garrotive (sic) new structures, Denis O'Brien does not make this easy.''" This was changed to: "The question is whether he understands newspapers. In order to confront the truths in our society, we must have a free press. ''If the restrictive charter for journalists proposed last year, along with some other structural changes, are anything to go by, it might be instructive for him to listen to journalists, troublesome and all as they are.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/28/irish-independent-denis-o-brien|title=Irish newspaper editor's column was changed after going to press|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2018 the [[Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement]] (ODCE) in Ireland said it would apply to the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] of Ireland to appoint inspectors to Independent News and Media to investigate an alleged data breach. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2018/0324/949882-corporate-watchdog-inm/&lt;/ref&gt; According to an affidavit filed by the ODCE, invoices associated with the data interrogation were discharged by Blaydon Limited, a company owned by Denis O'Brien, INM's largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/inm-to-pursue-wrongdoers-for-cost-of-odce-inquiry-into-corporate-governance-36805525.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media lawsuits===
O'Brien has threatened to sue the journalist and broadcaster [[Vincent Browne]]; as the ''Sunday Independent'' wrote at the time: "Suing the individual journalist is a tactic usually designed to instill a fear of financial ruin into the writer of the allegedly offending article, especially when the potential litigant is somebody of Mr O'Brien's means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/denis-obrien-makes-personal-libel-threat-to-vincent-browne-26883578.html|title=Denis O'Brien makes personal libel threat to Vincent Browne|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2013, O'Brien sued the ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' for defamation over his numerous appearances in RTÉ news reports on the relief effort after the Haiti earthquake in an attempt to use the publicity to deflect attention from the Moriarty Tribunal. The court awarded O'Brien €150,000. The case was a landmark one as it was the first time a journalist had attempted to use the honest opinion defence. The newspaper's solicitor said it was a sad day for [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|freedom of expression in Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0214/367770-defamation-denis-obrien/|title=Denis O'Brien wins defamation case against Irish Daily Mail|work=RTÉ News|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=14 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305161225/http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0214/367770-defamation-denis-obrien/|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Fiona|last=Gartland|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0214/breaking46.html|title=O'Brien awarded €150k in Daily Mail defamation case|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=14 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305161526/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/o-brien-awarded-150k-in-daily-mail-defamation-case-1.1255054|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2015, [[Waterford Whispers News]] (a satirical website similar to America's The Onion) editor-in-chief Colm Williamson received a cease and desist order from a solicitor acting on O'Brien's behalf, for a satirical article published on the website regarding O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colm Williamson on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/ColmWhispers/status/629345366585016321|accessdate = 6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after lawyers for O'Brien also demanded that a report of the Waterford Whispers News story also be removed from [http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/08/06/meanwhile-in-a-parallel-universe-2/ www.broadsheet.ie] under a threat of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Denis O’Brien lawyers demand removal of  broadsheet.ie  article|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/denis-o-brien-lawyers-demand-removal-of-broadsheet-ie-article-1.2310440|accessdate = 8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; . 

However this demand was not complied with and the article is still carried on Broadsheet.ie 3 years later in July 2018.

In response to such actions - in particular those relating to the threat of legal proceedings against satirical websites - the comments sections of various Irish related social media outlet featured many negative comments chastising O'Brien for his constant issuing of threats of legal proceedings.

===IBRC controversy and RTÉ injunction===
In 2015, arguing that revelation of his relationship with his bank was an invasion of his privacy, O'Brien successfully applied for an injunction against RTÉ preventing the state broadcaster from airing a report on how O'Brien was allegedly receiving, on foot of a claimed but disputed&lt;ref name=IBRC-RTE20150617a/&gt; verbal agreement with a former CEO of the [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]] (IBRC)&amp;mdash;the former [[Anglo Irish Bank]], and another senior executive, a rate of approximately 1.25% when IBRC "could, and arguably should" have been charging 7.5%.&lt;ref name=greenslade_29052015/&gt; This alleged rate applied to "outstanding sums of upwards of €500 million",&lt;ref name=greenslade_29052015/&gt; or "over €300 million" according to the RTÉ producer's court affidavit.&lt;ref name=IBRC-RTE20150617a/&gt;&lt;ref name=DOB-RTE-Binchy20150605b&gt;{{cite book |url=https://static.rasset.ie/documents/news/dob-v-rte-redacted-judgement.pdf |title=Denis O'Brien-v-RTÉ redacted judgment|author=Mr Justice Donald Binchy|publisher=[[High Court (Ireland)|The High Court]]|page=11|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=18 June 2015|quote=paragraph 20 (e) ...over €300 million}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien then allegedly wrote to IBRC's special liquidator Kieran Wallace to demand that these same favourable terms that were granted him by way of verbal agreement be continued.&lt;ref name=greenslade_29052015/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBRC-IT01a/&gt; The Irish government later appointed Kieran Wallace to conduct a review into various IBRC transactions, including the sale of Siteserv by IBRC to Denis O'Brien.&lt;ref name=IBRC-IT01a&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/catherine-murphy-makes-denis-o-brien-claims-in-d%C3%A1il-1.2229946|title=Catherine Murphy makes Denis O’Brien claims in Dáil|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author1=Barry O'Keeffe|author2=Cliff Taylor|authorlink2=Cliff Taylor (journalist)|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=3 June 2015|quote=O’Brien says information was false and claims were an abuse of Dáil privilege ...

The sale of Siteserv to Mr O’Brien has become embroiled in controversy and is the subject of a formal review by the IBRC’s liquidator. The terms under which the company, which carries out a wide variety of services, including water meter installation, was sold are part of that review. Separately, Mike Aynsley, the former chief executive of IBRC, released a lengthy statement, taking issue with other comments by Ms Murphy, who was moving a Private Members’ Bill through the Dáil. The Bill’s aim is to permit the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General to investigate the Siteserv sale and other IBRC transactions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as IBRC special liquidator, and in order to protect the confidentiality of IBRC's relations with its customers and of any legal advice given to it,&lt;ref name=DOB-RTE-Binchy20150605a&gt;{{cite book |url=https://static.rasset.ie/documents/news/dob-v-rte-redacted-judgement.pdf |title=Denis O'Brien-v-RTÉ redacted judgment|author=Mr Justice Donald Binchy|publisher=[[High Court (Ireland)|The High Court]]|pages=18–19|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=18 June 2015|quote=38.

When giving written reasons for the injunction (with "fairly minimal" redactions) a few days later, Judge Binchy said "there was no allegation whatsoever of any misconduct or wrongdoing on the part of Mr O'Brien".&lt;ref name=IBRC-RTE20150605aa&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0603/705504-denis-obrien-media/ |title=Court issues written judgment on O'Brien injunction|publisher=[[RTÉ]]|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=18 June 2015|quote=Mr Justice Donald Binchy said he had made some redactions to the judgment but he said they were "fairly minimal". ...

Mr Murphy said such assertions were made against a backdrop of recorded concern by the Department of Finance in relation to management by senior IBRC management of relationships with major IBRC borrowers. The judge said there was no allegation whatsoever of any misconduct or wrongdoing on the part of Mr O'Brien.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier O'Brien had defended himself in an Irish Times article, stating that he had been shocked that somebody took confidential files from a bank, tampered with them, and then leaked them, that he had done much to try to help the Irish economy and the stability of its banking system in recent years, that the 'throwing to the wolves' of decent Irish borrowers by institutions like [[National Asset Management Agency|NAMA]] had ruined many lives and led to suicides, and that he was being vilified to an unprecedented degree by enemies, competitors, publicity-seeking politicians, and social media cowards, for trying to defend his privacy.&lt;ref name=OBrien-IT03a&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/denis-o-brien-i-have-never-experienced-this-level-of-hatred-1.2233858|title=Denis O’Brien: ‘I have never experienced this level of hatred’|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=Denis O'Brien|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=3 June 2015|quote=What shocked me most of all was that someone would take files from a major Irish bank, tamper with them and leak them to RTÉ. ...  Many decent people who had loans transferred to Nama, or had loans with Anglo Irish Bank/IBRC were thrown to the wolves. ...I have known people who took their own lives, people who lost everything including their homes and their marriages. Also many people who have had nervous breakdowns. The toll all this has taken on the “community” that makes up our country is quite shocking.  I think it is regrettable that there is such a feeding frenzy to spread rumours and selectively leak information to point- score, challenge a competitor or simply do somebody down. It is done behind the cloak of secrecy and anonymity and the principle that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. Social media being used for this purpose is crowded with cowards.  At a particular point in time when foreign multinationals were at their most nervous about their deposits in Irish banks I decided to be contrarian. I took a decision that Digicel would repatriate its cash deposits from US banks amounting to more than $600 million and place them with two Irish banks as a vote of confidence. Both banks asked my permission to tell a small number of foreign clients of this decision to help stop further outflows and this was granted. At that time, and subsequently, I was talking up Ireland internationally as a recovery story. I wanted to make a significant financial gesture of support at home. This was to show solidarity with Ireland but also to support the efforts of Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in stabilising the Irish banks and slow future outflow of deposits. ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I have been dragged into a media frenzy because of RTÉ’s attempts to publish my private bank details and Deputy Murphy’s desire to distort them. I have never experienced the level of abuse, venom and hatred resulting from taking a stand to protect privacy in relation to my financial affairs.

On 10 June 2015, a [[Commission of investigation (Ireland)|Commission of Investigation]] ([[O'Keeffe Commission]]) was established to inquire into the wider issue of certain transactions of IBRC under the Commission of Investigation (Irish Bank Resolution Corporation) Order 2015 passed by [[Dáil Éireann]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061000036?opendocument|title=Draft Commission of Investigation (Certain matters concerning transactions entered into by IBRC) Order 2015: Motion|date=10 June 2015|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Seanad Éireann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061000002?opendocument#BBB00100|title=Draft Commission of Investigation (Certain matters concerning transactions entered into by IBRC) Order 2015: Motion|date=10 June 2015|work=Seanad Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly as a result of controversy over the sale by IBRC of Siteserv to a company controlled by Denis O'Brien, and of complaints by Deputy Catherine Murphy that IBRC special liquidator Kieran Wallace, who had originally been asked to conduct an inquiry into such matters, could no longer credibly do so after he had joined with O'Brien in his [[#IBRC Controversy and RTÉ injunction|above lawsuit against RTÉ]].&lt;ref name=greenslade_29052015/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBRC-IT01a/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBRC-COI-IT20150610a&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/changes-in-terms-of-reference-for-ibrc-commission-of-investigation-1.2243440 |title=Changes in terms of reference for IBRC Commission of Investigation|author=[[Harry McGee]]|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===O'Brien and the Clintons===
O'Brien and the Clintons were prominent investors of time and money in [[Haiti]] following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]].&lt;ref name=cements_close_working_relationship/&gt; U.S. government agency [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], overseen by the State Department and headed at the time by [[Hillary Clinton]], donated millions of U.S. tax dollars to O'Brien's Digicel company. USAID's "[[Food for Peace]]" scheme transferred money over Digicel's mobile network, with citizens of the stricken country being given mobile phones and free Digicel accounts, which led Digicel to "significantly expand" its customer numbers. [[Bill Clinton]] also oversaw the building and then opened a luxury Marriott Hotel in Haiti; this hotel was owned by Digicel, which made a $45 million contribution (compared to a $26.5 million contribution from the [[World Bank]]-affiliated [[International Finance Corporation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://freebeacon.com/blog/oh-denny-boy-how-the-clintons-helped-an-irish-telecom-tycoon-makes-millions-in-earthquake-ravaged-haiti/|title=Oh, Denny Boy: How The Clintons Helped an Irish Telecom Tycoon Makes Millions in Earthquake Ravaged Haiti|work=[[The Washington Free Beacon]]|date=7 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601143227/http://freebeacon.com/blog/oh-denny-boy-how-the-clintons-helped-an-irish-telecom-tycoon-makes-millions-in-earthquake-ravaged-haiti/|archivedate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Irish Times'', Clinton's 2013 speaking engagement at Dublin's [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad Hotel]] was "facilitated largely by his friend" Denis O'Brien.

==Wealth and residences in Portugal and Malta==
''[[Forbes]]'' estimates O'Brien's wealth as approximately $6.8 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes_world_billionaires"/&gt;

O'Brien took up residency in [[Portugal]] some time before Esat Telecom's sale to BT in 2000. He netted more than €300 million from that sale but paid no capital gains tax due to a then-existing provision in the Irish-Portuguese tax treaty. While considering the flotation of Digicel on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 2006, it emerged in public that O'Brien had taken up residence in Malta. O'Brien's move to Malta was revealed in a March 2006 filing to the [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]] (CRO), which listed O'Brien's residential address in Malta. Malta charges no tax on worldwide assets or income brought in by permanent residents. Residence, for tax purposes, means renting or buying a property with a minimum value and visiting Malta at least once within one year of becoming a resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keena|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2006/0915/1158271559252.html|title=O'Brien makes pre-flotation move to Malta|work=The Irish Times|date=15 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305152237/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/o-brien-makes-pre-flotation-move-to-malta-1.1002741|archivedate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First National Bank Omaha''' is a subsidiary of [[First National of Nebraska]]. It is the largest privately held bank in the United States with $17 billion in assets and 5,000 employees.&lt;ref name="Szmrecsanyi 1996 61"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Szmrecsanyi|first=Dr. Stephen|title=The First National Bank Story|publisher=First National Bank|year=1996|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chartered and headquartered in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[United States]], First National provides corporate banking, [[investment banking]], [[retail banking]], [[wealth management]] and [[consumer lending]] services at locations in [[Nebraska]], [[Iowa]], [[Colorado]], [[Texas]], [[Kansas]] and [[Illinois]].  The bank operates a total of 101 branches throughout the midwest.

==History==
In 1856, a group of settlers from [[Kanesville, Iowa]] crossed the [[Missouri River]] to picnic in the newly named [[Nebraska Territory]].  One of the visitors, Thomas Davis, helped found Omaha when he donated $600 in gold dust for an official charter. He eventually served on First National Bank's board of directors. Two immigrant brothers from [[Ohio]], [[Herman Kountze|Herman]] and [[Augustus Kountze]] opened Kountze Brothers Bank in 1857. Omaha's first bank opened its doors and started trading primarily in [[gold|gold dust]] and [[buffalo hides]]. Kountze Brothers Bank received national charter #209 in 1863. Today, theirs is the oldest national bank west of the [[Missouri River]]. In 1863, they also began doing business as First National Bank of Omaha and brought in additional investors, including [[Edward Creighton]], who served as president.

In 1883, Herman Kountze speculated on land in [[North Omaha]], eventually developing an affluent Omaha suburb called [[Kountze Place]] in the former town of [[Saratoga, Nebraska|Saratoga]]. The [[panic of 1893]] sparked the worst depression of the 19th century. In 1895, twelve businessmen from Omaha, including Herman Kountze, started the [[Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben]]. Their mission, "to build a more prosperous Heartland, where communities can flourish and every child can succeed," carries on to this day. In 1898, Herman Kountze donated the use of {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of his Kountze Place development for the [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition]], one of the crowning events in Omaha's history.  Featuring a lagoon filled with Venetian gondolas, it attracted 2.6 million visitors at a time when Omaha's population was roughly 100,000.

===1900 to 1949===
In 1913, First National Bank became one of the first banks to specifically target women with a Ladies' Department. Staffed with female tellers in a comfortable and accommodating setting, it helped make banking a mainstream activity for women. During a five-year span ending in 1933, the [[Great Depression]] caused more than 750 Nebraska banks to close. On one Saturday in August, skittish depositors begin withdrawing their funds ''en masse'' from Omaha banks. When their requests were met, the banks proved their solvency; if not, the banks faced almost certain collapse. During this period First National Bank extended their hours, honored every withdrawal and proved their financial strength once and for all.

===1950 to 1999===
In 1953, under the leadership of John Lauritzen, First National Bank became the first bank in the region and the fifth in the nation to issue its own credit card. Also in 1953, [http://www.firstnationalmerchants.com First National Merchant Solutions] began processing for 125 merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstnationalmerchants.com/ms/html/en/about_us/about_parent_company.html|title=About First National, SPC d/b/a First National Merchant Solutions|accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971, employees started moving into the 22-story [[First National Center (Omaha)|First National Center]]. Attached to a 420-room hotel and a 550-stall parking garage, it became one of the most modern and attractive buildings in the region, providing economic development in downtown Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laserone.net|title=Laser One - A First National Company|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 to present===
[[File:FNBWilderness.jpg|thumb|right|150px|First National Park&lt;br&gt;Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness]]
In 2000 First National Bank designated two parcels of green space for the city of Omaha. They are the current sites of two sculpture parks called "Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness" and "Pioneer Courage".  Working in tandem, the two sculptures join to make one of the largest bronze sculptures in the world. In 2002, First National Bank completed construction on the [[First National Bank Tower|First National Tower]], the tallest building between [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].  With almost a million square feet of office space, it dramatically changed Omaha's skyline.

It was announced on February 8, 2008, that Mills County Bank in [[Glenwood, Iowa]] and [[Silver City, Iowa]] will be First National Bank of Omaha, effective February 9, 2008.  The full transition to First National Bank was completed on June 20, 2008. In March 2008, First National Bank opened a new branch with their new partnership with Scooter's Coffeehouse, started in [[Bellevue, Nebraska]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scooterscoffeehouse.com/Franchisee_Brochure_Web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Franchise Brochure - Scooter's Coffeehouse|accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have their operations based out of Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scooterscoffeehouse.com/contact|title=Contact Information - Scooter's Coffeehouse|accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new branch is located in the [[Old Market (Omaha, Nebraska)|Old Market]] in [[Downtown Omaha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lundco.com/pdf/Bankers%20and%20Baristas%20Businesses%20to%20combine%20at%20Old%20Market%20site.pdf|format=PDF|title=Bankers and Baristas: Businesses to combine at Old Market site|accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning September 30, 2010, it was announced that [[First National of Nebraska]] consolidated its bank charters of [[First National Bank of Colorado]], in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]; [[First National Bank of Kansas]], in [[Overland Park, Kansas]]; and Castle Bank, in [[DeKalb, Illinois]], with its First National Bank of Omaha charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1stnationalbank.com/004/html/en/personal/faqs/charter_consolidation.html|title=Charter Consolidation|accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2018 the bank announced it would no longer renew its contract with the [[National Rifle Association]] as a result of customer feedback after a recent [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|school shooting]] controversy in [[Florida]]. The bank had offered special branded Visa cards to NRA members to support the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/omaha-private-bank-enterprise-rental-company-cut-ties-nra-article-1.3837432|title=Prominent Omaha bank, Enterprise and Symantec cut ties with NRA|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Branches in Kansas: [[Fairway, Kansas|Fairway]], [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]], [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], and [[Shawnee, Kansas|Shawnee]]
'''First National Bank of Kansas (FNBK)''' was chartered in 1993 when FNNI purchased approximately $80 million deposits from a failed financial institution.  The bank purchased additional deposits approximating $220 million from another financial institution in 1994. To profitably invest this large deposit base, FNBK purchased credit card receivables from an affiliated bank.  Most of the receivables originated outside the bank's assessment area.  While credit card receivables still represent a large percentage of bank assets, credit card lending is not a strategic goal for the bank.&lt;ref name="FDIC"&gt;[http://www.fdic.gov FDIC] Retrieved 9/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FNBK"&gt;[http://www.fnbk.com About Us] Retrieved 2/9/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==FNBO Direct==
FNBO Direct, a division of First National Bank of Omaha, started operations in November 2006 at a 5.25% [[annual percentage yield]] (APY). FNBO Direct launched a nationwide campaign to promote their online savings account on May 1, 2007.  In honor of the bank's 150th anniversary, the APY was placed at 6.0% for 150 days from May 1 through September 28, 2007. In an e-mail sent to customers at the end of August, it was announced that the FNBO Direct Credit Card will give a competitive interest rate and cash back rewards that would be deposited directly into the online savings account.  The credit card product launched to a selected number of customers that currently have an [[online savings account]] on September 26, 2007. On November 28, 2007, FNBO Direct launched an Online Billpay account as well as offering a [[certificate of deposit]] available, at first, for four different terms (9 month, 12 month, 18 month, and 24 month).  Currently, customers are able to choose from a six-month term as well.

==First National Merchant Solutions==
In addition to being a top-10 payment processor, '''First National Merchant Solutions''' is also the 4th largest bank processor in the United States and is the 6th largest in-house processor of credit cards{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. In 1967, First National Bank of Omaha automated many of its manual credit card processes and was the first credit card processing center in the nation to offer descriptive billing statements.  In 1988, First National Bank of Omaha became the first processor to develop authorization slips for restaurants with a blank area for including tip. A couple of years later, FNBO's acquiring division was renamed to First of Omaha Merchant Processing.  First of Omaha Merchant Processing received the 1994 Member Service Quality Performance Award for Best Copy Performance by an acquirer with Visa sales over $1.5 billion. In 2002, First of Omaha Merchant Processing changed its name to First National Merchant Solutions.  A year later, FNMS celebrated its 50th year of processing payments.  First National Merchant Solutions became one of the first processors to offer merchants ACH and credit card transactions in the same batch file in 2004.  The following year, First National Merchant Solutions introduced First Resolution OnlineTM, the first chargeback management tool in the market to allow merchants to resolve chargebacks online.

FNBO also underwrites for two large [[ISO 8583|ISO]]'s, '''International Merchant Services''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ims.com&lt;/ref&gt; located in [[Westmont, Illinois]], and '''Merchant Services, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merchantservices.com&lt;/ref&gt;''' of [[Farmingdale, New Jersey]]. On April 1, 2010, [[TSYS]] announced that they would be acquiring 51% of the merchant division, and the remaining 49% would remain under the ownership of FNBO.  The new name of the company is First National Merchant Solutions, LLC (FNMS). [http://www.tsys.com/news/Releases/20100401FNMSClosing.cfm Joint Venture with TSYS]

It was announced&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsys.com/news/Releases/20110104FMNSacquisition.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  on January 4, 2011, that TSYS would acquire the remaining 49% of the company, thus changing their name to TSYS Merchant Solutions.

==First Bankcard==
In 1953, First National's consumer finance operation launched its "First Charge" card which remains to this day the most profitable innovation in First National's long history.&lt;ref name="Szmrecsanyi 1996 61"/&gt; The bank issued a simple little card, which was nothing more than a white piece of plasticized paper, complete with a green logo, and an inscription which spelled "First Charge Account Service" and a red number which served to identify the cardholder.&lt;ref name="Szmrecsanyi 1996 61"/&gt; First Bankcard is one of the top three banks serving the credit card needs of other financial institutions, including [[Union Bank of California]] and [[People's United Bank|People's Bank]]. First Bankcard also services credit cards for [[Major League Lacrosse]], [[World of Warcraft]], [[Scheels All Sports]], just to name a few. [[SunTrust Bank]] announced on December 12, 2006, that it has signed an agreement with Atlanta-based InfiCorp Holdings, Inc. (subsidiary of First National of Nebraska) for issuing consumer credit cards.  Under terms of the agreement, InfiCorp will market, originate and service SunTrust-branded cards starting in the first quarter of 2007, focusing on SunTrust clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.suntrust.com/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_224_866_0_43/http%3B/phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=82273&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=941461&amp;highlight=|title=SunTrust Signs Agreement with InfiCorp for Consumer Credit Cards|date=2006-12-12|publisher=SunTrust Banks, Inc.|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest Rate Battles===
{{Main|Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp.}}
An Iowa resident by the name of Fred Fisher received an unsolicited BankAmericard from First National Bank Omaha, in February 1969.  Fisher filed a complaint against the Omaha bank on September 3, 1971, for exporting Nebraska's higher interest rates to his state.  He told the [[U.S. District Court]] that since the Iowa legislature had fixed the usury ceiling at nine percent, First National was breaking the law by charging him 18 percent for advance of up to $500. Marquette threatened by taking the Omaha bank to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] if necessary if their practice continued.  The Marquette bank offered credit cards for a $10 fee at a flat rate of 12 percent interest on outstanding credit.  First National required no fee and it charged 18 percent interest for credit up to $500 and 12 percent on all additional balances.

Marquette began to lobby for the passage of a state law designed to put a 12 percent ceiling on all bank credit card outstandings.  In May 1976, about one month after that measure was signed into law, Marquette filed a suit to make its Omaha rival conform to the 12 percent limit. The decision maintained that the 115-year-old [[National Bank Act]] takes precedence over usury statues in individual states.  Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] wrote that the 1863 law permitted a national bank to charge interest at the rate allowed by the regulations of the state in which the lending institution is located. On July 25, 1979, the Iowa Supreme Court overturned their decision that was made on August 30, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Szmrecsanyi|first=Dr. Stephen|title=The First National Bank Story|publisher=First National Bank|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing of the Kearney Call Center===
It was announced on the [[Kearney Hub]]'s website that the Kearney call center will be closing, effective February 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kearneyhub.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20135998&amp;BRD=268&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=577608&amp;rfi=6|title=First National Credit Card Center in Kearney closing; 89 jobs affected|publisher=[[Kearney Hub]]|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FNBO plans to move its customer service operations in Kearney to its locations in Bloomfield, Omaha and Wayne, Nebraska, after formal approval by its board of directors. "First National Credit Card Center has been growing profitably over the past three years. This consolidation plan is designed to fully utilize our call center facilities to support future growth, while allowing us to be more efficient." President Stephen Eulie said in a press release. "It will result in a significant increase in the number of employees at our other sites and improved career options for those individuals."  He said the decision to close the Kearney call center and move those positions will enable the company to more effectively centralize operations functions while reducing the expense of managing its overall business. Operations at the call centers include inbound customer service, credit card collections, account activity alert and fraud prevention, credit analysis, credit account processing, specialized customer contact and technology support. First National has operated the call center in Kearney since 1992.

'''Gianni Mattioli''' (1903 – 1977) was an Italian businessman, a cotton trader in Milan, and art collector, particularly of the work of the Italian [[Futurist]]s.

Mattioli was born in [[Milan]] in 1903, and started collecting in the early 1920s, but most of his collection was built in the late 1930s and 1940s, and in 1949, he acquired 87 works from fellow Italian collector [[Pietro Feroldi]] (1881–1958).&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/leonard-lauder-research-center/programs-and-resources/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/mattioli|title=Mattioli, Gianni : Milan, 1903–Milan, 1977|website=Metmuseum.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mattioli died in Milan in 1977, and his daughter the art historian, [[Laura Mattioli Rossi]], inherited the collection.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;

26 works from the Gianni Mattioli Collection have been on loan to the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] in Venice since September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/collection2.php?id_cat=14 |title=Guggenheim |website=Guggenheim-venice.it |date= |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, ''[[Nu couché]]'' a 1917 [[Amedeo Modigliani]] oil on canvas from the collection, was sold by his daughter at Christie's, New York for $170.4 million to [[Liu Yiqian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everett |first=Christopher |url=https://www.tharawat-magazine.com/facts/most-expensive-art-sales-in-history/ |title=10 Most Expensive Art Sales in History |publisher=Tharawat Magazine |date= |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-commitment management''' emphasizes personal responsibility, independence, and [[empowerment]] of employees across all levels instead of focusing on one higher power; it always intended to keep commitment at high level  “calling all the shots”.&lt;ref name="WesenbergSean"&gt;Wesenberg, Sean. Phone Interview. 18 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

A high commitment system is unusual in its job design and cultural structure. These practices emphasize getting the tasks complete, but do it in a way that their employees enjoy doing it. According to Harvard Business School Professor Michael Beer, “leaders develop an organizational design, business processes, goals and measures, and capabilities that are aligned with a focused, winning strategy.”&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Michael and Russell A. Eisenstat. ''High Commitment, High Performance: How to Build a Resilient Organization for Sustained Advantage''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of environment allows employees to approach tasks at ease, wearing jeans instead of suits and staying home to watch their children get on the bus for school before coming to work. Technology also plays a role in this system. Recently,{{When|date=November 2012}} technology has slaughtered barriers of communication, which makes this high-commitment model fit that much better. That father waiting for the bus can still answer phone calls and check emails for work, so is he working or is he spending time with his daughter? He can be doing both.&lt;ref name="WesenbergSean" /&gt; As long as the job gets done, this system is casual on how it gets done, relieving employees of constant stress.

A flat organizational structure is one of the biggest success factors. Individuals are responsible for their own decision-making and these decisions, their skill, and their performance is how they get paid. Instead of putting too much weight on the individual, “people are likely to see the locus of the control coming from ‘within’ through the adoption of self-created demands and pressures as opposed to external and making them feel subordinate.” &lt;ref name="LoweJim" /&gt; While these companies allow each employee to be a manager in their own way and try not to distinguish its structure by higher levels of employment, it doesn’t mean that they lack these higher powers entirely. It's that under this system people aren’t relying on the general managers, CEOs, or other employees to do their work for them. This personal discipline is what drives the employees to help the company be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Jim, and Nick Oliver. "The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a Hi-Tech Industry." ''Work, Employment &amp; Society'' 5.3 (1991): 437-50. Print&lt;/ref&gt; and eliminates the chance at a thought like, “Why would I want to help my company become better if I know I’m just going to get yelled at?” &lt;ref&gt;Wesenberg, Sean. Phone Interview. 18 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus of high commitment practices is their employee relationships. They only hire people who are flexible, determined, and are willing to handle challenges. Because this system relies on individual performance, there is a big emphasis on hiring the right people for the job. The detailed recruitment process can consist of many interviews with different members of the company, an induction course, and in some cases, team-building exercises.&lt;ref name="LoweJim" /&gt; Once found, the right employees help create a strong bond and high trust throughout the entire company.

High commitment workplaces are successful through their importance on an individual’s responsibility in order to help the team prosper. By creating a culture that motivates individuals to want to succeed while sustaining high commitment, “these firms stand out by having achieved long periods of excellence.” &lt;ref&gt;Beer, Michael and Russell A. Eisenstat. ''High Commitment, High Performance: How to Build a Resilient Organization for Sustained Advantage''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

High-commitment management firms are designed by their founders or transformational chief executives to achieve sustained high [[Organizational commitment|commitment]] from employees. The application of high-commitment management in firms today originated from an alignment of the employees’ and the firm’s mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beer|first=Michael|title=High Commitment, High Performance|year=2009|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|Sociologist]]s{{Who|date=November 2012}} attribute this congruence as a product of [[job performance|performance]] and psychological collaboration between the firm and its employees. Since its initial developments, high commitment management has been driven by self-regulated behavior and performance-driven group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, Nathaniel. "High Commitment, High Performance Management” HBS Working Knowledge. Harvard Business School, 10 August 2009. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6119.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the top-down leadership practices, high-commitment management took form as leaders engaged and listened to people, allowing ideas from different levels of the organization to push the firm forward.

===Self-directed work teams===
In a study of illumination in the workplace of [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne]] and the [[Western Electric Company]], a sociologist from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Elton Mayo]], concluded that when the organization established experimental work groups, “the individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation.”&lt;ref name="MayoElton"&gt;Mayo, Elton 1984 [1949]. ― Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.‖ Pp. 279-292 in ''Organization Theory: Selected Readings''. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a natural system{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} of collaboration, the teams are not only responsible for the work but also the management of their group. Mayo’s research uncovered that teams under their own direction established a capacity for self-motivated learning and change.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Elton 1984 [1949]. ―Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.‖ Pp. 279-292 in Organization Theory: Selected Readings. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of designing the work system with the full participation of the people proved to be a breakthrough for organizations during the 1990s. During that time, employees closest to the product and customer began to have increasing decision making capacities and capabilities.&lt;ref name="fic.wharton.upenn"&gt;Hunter, Larry W., and Lorin M. Hitt. "What Makes a Committed Workplace?" Wharton Business School. University of Pennsylvania, 24 July 2002. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/papers/00/0030.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview programs===
The Hawthorne Experiments sought to determine a correlation between light levels and productivity. Researchers had divided the employees into teams of six and interviewed the individuals to determine the effect of the lighting. Mayo discovered that the interview program set up by the study inherently gave the employees a sense of higher purpose.&lt;ref name="MayoElton" /&gt; Exposure of employee thoughts and concerns to managers appeared to be a fundamental aspect of the relation between managers and employees. Evidently, by having the ability to speak to their managers, the employees at Western Electric exhibited a dramatic improvement in their attitudes towards work.&lt;ref&gt;Mifflin, Jeffrey. "Western Electric Company. Hawthorne Studies Collection, 1924-1961 (inclusive): A Finding Aid." Western Electric Company. Hawthorne Studies Collection, 1924-1961 (inclusive): A Finding Aid. Harvard Business School, 04 Jan. 1998. Web. 16 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00047&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Essential to a highly committed work force, the interview program formally developed and sustained cooperation with management.

===Problem-solving teams===
The Hawthorne experiment further highlighted that teams working without coercion from above or limitation from below could astonish even their own expectations of themselves. Sociologist [[Fritz Roethlisberger]] argued that this informal organization left the team responsible for addressing the myriad of problems that continuously arose. Roethlisberger noted by studying the chemistry of informal groups that human interactions and collaboration have the potential to set when teams have to face problems on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Roethlisberger, Fritz J. and William J. Dickson. 1981 [1939]. ―Human Relations.‖ Pp. 67-83 in The Sociology of Organizations: Basic Studies. Second Edition. Edited by O. Grusky and G. A. Miller. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Together the individuals of the team strive to improve the processes of the team by adapting to different demands and learning from each other.

===Cross training===
Cross training began to be heavily examined through the scope of modern Japanese management in the automobile industry in the 1970s. Sociologists examined the way in which the Japanese automobile firms cross-trained its employees through a company wide orientation and training program. As Japanese firms trained their employees in a multitude of aspects in the production process, sociologists discovered that the training brought the employees together and formed a connection in which all the employees were dedicated to the company’s mission.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Laurie 1993. ―Inside a Japanese Transplant: A Critical Perspective.‖ Work and Occupations. 20(2):147-173.&lt;/ref&gt; These established connections appeared to solicit cooperation among the work force.&lt;ref name="fic.wharton.upenn" /&gt; The Japanese auto plants revealed that flexibility within the production teams allowed employees to work on their own tasks while keeping others efficient.

==Difference from other management strategies==

High-commitment practices are spin-offs from the natural system of managements.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin"&gt;Frank Dobbin, “From Incentives to Teamwork: Rational and Natural Management Systems” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 1 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Like other management strategies in the natural system of management,&lt;ref&gt;E. Mayo.'Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company'.The Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization. Routledge, 1949. chapter 4. pp. 60-76.&lt;/ref&gt; High-commitment practices assume natural theories of motivation &lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt; rather than the considerably different rational theories of motivation.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt;
[[File:Rational and Natural Theories of Motivation.jpg|thumb|Differences between rational and natural management systems &lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt;]] Because most management strategies before High Commitment practices assumed rational theories of motivation, high-commitment practices differ from these strategies in three primary aspects.

===Employee motivation===
In terms of methods of motivating workers, differences between High Commitment Practices and strategies from the rational system of management are extreme. The rational system of management focuses on either punishments or incentives.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt; For example, the earliest form of rational management, ''direct control'', encourages employee productivity by having supervisors oversee the production process and punish workers who are not producing enough outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Managing the Workforce” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 17 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of rational management, ''bureaucratic control'', encourages productivity through career incentives like bonuses and promotions. However, High Commitment Practices, unlike any rational management, aim to stimulate productivity by encouraging employee commitment to the institution.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a"&gt;Frank Dobbin, “High Commitment Practices” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 10 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Data General, a corporation which advocates High Commitment Practices, manages to make employees love their tasks and grow attached to the corporation so much that many employees elect to work twelve hours, four more than Data General prescribes.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Kidder, The Soul of a New Machine, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to rational management, High Commitment Practices attempt to create scenarios in which employees aspire to deliver their best efforts.

===Employee control===
High Commitment Practices also differ from practices in the rational management system with regards to employee control. The rational system of management discourages job autonomy, believing that such freedom will only lower productivity because employees will elect not to work. For example, in ''[[scientific management]]'' and ''Fordism'',&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Federick W. "Scientific Management." CLASSICAL THEORETICAL PERSPECTlVES : 54-66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; employees are micro-managed- they are given specific instructions  on how to perform certain tasks. However, High Commitment Practices encourage job autonomy, creativity, and innovation,&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a" /&gt; all of which institutions with High Commitment Practices believe will increase job satisfaction and commitment leading to increased outputs. While the rational system of management attempts to micro-manage employees, High Commitment Practices greatly encourage independence.

===Influence on corporate structure===
With respect to corporate structure, institutions employing rational management and institutions employing high commitment practices also differ. Institutions with rational management tend to have a steep hierarchy with many ranks between floor-workers and executives.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Internal Labor Market” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 14 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, institutions employing bureaucratic control often have one entry level at the bottom of the hierarchy, and new recruits slowly work their ways up the seemingly endless ladder. Because these institutions have a steep hierarchy, those near the bottom of the chain are often alienated from higher ups&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Alienation” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 19 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, relationship between executives and workers are minimal. However, institutions which employ High Commitment Practices have fairly flat hierarchy and intra-firm networking is easy. As a result, most employees readily develop attachment to their on-job peers, bosses, and the institution, increasing their commitment. While the rational system of management maintains distance between executive and lower employees, High Commitment Practices foster good relationship between the two.

===Other natural managements===
While high-commitment practices are similar to other strategies in the system, particularly the Human Relations School, in terms of the three aspects previously discussed, their goals are different. Although both attempt to increase job satisfaction and make employees feel valued, High Commitment Practices seek to make employees feel attached to their institutions while the Human Relations School simply seek to make employees aspire to work because of the satisfaction gained from contributing outputs.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a" /&gt;

With the significant shift in the way firms are motivating their employees in recent years,{{When|date=November 2012}} many companies are beginning to realize that having a “strong [[corporate culture]]” is an important ingredient in organizational success.  Employee commitment is “replacing traditional controls such as direct supervision and bureaucratic arrangements.” &lt;ref name="LoweJim"&gt;Lowe, Jim, and Nick Oliver. "The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a Hi-Tech Industry." Work, Employment &amp; Society 5.3 (1991): 437-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; No longer do these high commitment workplaces rely on their CEOs to force the workers to produce, but instead, these workers are self-motivated to bring their best to the company.

One company that follows this high commitment model is [[Google]].  A little over a decade ago,{{When|date=November 2012}} Google was an unknown. Today, Google not only refers to the multinational corporation which provides Internet-related products and services, but it has also become a common verb many use every day—“just Google it.”  What sets Google apart from many companies, however, is its unique{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} corporate culture.  Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the two men wanted Google to be a place where people would enjoy work.  The company’s philosophies, which include principles such as “work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun” and “you can be serious without a suit”, are consistent with its innovative and informal environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Things We Know to Be True." Google Company. Google, n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2012. &lt;https://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of organization, Google maintains “a casual and democratic atmosphere, resulting in its distinction as a ‘Flat’ company.”&lt;ref name="JohanssonGreg"&gt;Johansson, Greg. "Google: The World's Most Successful Corporate Culture." Weblog post.Suite 101. N.p., 29 May 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earlier years, Google had a fairly informal product-development system.  Ideas moved upwards from “Googlers” without any formal review process from senior managers, and teams working on innovative projects were kept small.  However, with the continuing expansion of the company, Google now holds weekly, all-hands (‘TGIF’) meetings at which employees ask questions directly to Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and other executives about any number of company issues.  This is consistent with the idea that high commitment work systems “typically involve practices that enhance communication across organizational levels.” &lt;ref&gt;Burton, M. Diane, and Charles O'Reilly. Walking the Talk: The Impact of High Commitment Values and Practices on Technology Start-ups. Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, employees are encouraged to propose wild, ambitious ideas, and supervisors are assigned small teams to test if these ideas will work.  Teams are made up of members with equal authority—“there is no top-down hierarchy”—and nearly everyone at Google carries a generic job title, such as “product manager.” &lt;ref name="JohanssonGreg" /&gt;

Google hires those who are “smart and determined,” and it favors “ability over experience.” &lt;ref&gt;"Our Culture." Google Company. Google, n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2012. &lt;https://www.google.com/ about/company/facts/culture/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview on the company’s corporate culture and hiring, Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, stressed the importance of evaluating potential hires’ passions and commitments in addition to their technical qualifications.  He said that “people are going to do what they’re going to do, and you (company, leader) just assist them.” &lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Eric. "Corporate Culture Example: Google’s Eric Schmidt On Culture &amp; Hiring." Interview. Weblog post. Culture Matters: Corporate Culture Pros Blog. Corporate Culture Pros, 6 July 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.corporateculturepros.com/2011/07/corporate-culture-example-google-hiring/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Google does not believe that its job is to manage the company; instead, it believes that its greatest task is to hire the right people.  And once the company has those people, it “will see a building of ‘self-initiative’ behavior”—one of the important characteristics of people working in high commitment workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Eric. "Corporate Culture Example: Google’s Eric Schmidt On Culture &amp; Hiring." Interview. Weblog post. Culture Matters: Corporate Culture Pros Blog. Corporate Culture Pros, 6 July 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.corporateculturepros.com/2011/07/corporate-culture-example-google-hiring/&gt;.).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, all engineers at Google are allotted 20 percent of their time to work on their own ideas—some of which yield public offerings, such as [[Google News]] and [[Orkut]], a [[social networking]] website.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}


==Implementation difficulties and disadvantages==

While there is substantial evidence that high commitment management practices have many benefits to the efficiency and well-being of the workplace as seen above, there are some disadvantages and difficulties found in the system.

Much of the research presenting strong evidence of success with high commitment management practices may actually be due to confounding variables. An example of this can be seen in research by Burton and O’Reilly &lt;ref name="BurtonDiane"&gt;Burton, Diane O’Reilly, Charles. “Walking the Talk: The Impact of High Commitment Values and Practices on Technology Start-ups”, 14 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that the benefits seen from high commitment practices may not be due to the practices themselves, but may result from on overarching system architecture or organizational logic. Another possibility they suggested was that good managers themselves pick this form of managing practice &lt;ref name="BurtonDiane" /&gt; and therefore good managers may be a confounding variable. Thus it is possible that the relative success of these practices is in fact a result of reasons other than the practices themselves.

In the process of becoming a workplace with high commitment management practices, the transition &lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Walton, Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zuZ3HEi4dXIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=difficulty+implementing+high+commitment+management+practices&amp;ots=vCvhLn2uKL&amp;sig=7ogbuhmp2Syqoofx-DxG17te-cM#v=onepage&amp;q=difficulty%20implementing%20high%20commitment%20management%20practices&amp;f=false “From Control to Commitment in the Workplace”], Chapter 10. September 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; can be difficult and in order to gain the full benefits of such practices full implementation is required.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Sue Purcell, John Kinnie, Nick. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9pzmzba&amp;s=229f7c2b19333a8c5ffdde32dceee06d1cdb9cf2 “Evolving High Commitment Management and Experience of the RAC Calling Centre”], ‘’[[Human Resource Management Journal]]’’, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; All companies must go through a transitioning stage from their previous form of management to high commitment management practices, however not all of the changes can be made at once. This transition can often be difficult for managers to find the right balance between enough and too much worker influence &lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; and change the management philosophy along with the practices.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b"&gt;Guest, David. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.1999.tb00200.x/asset/j.1748-8583.1999.tb00200.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9onltqr&amp;s=2c3caa172d412fdfb8492d663f574f38ff2bd31c “Human Resource Management – The Workers’ Verdict”], ‘’[[Human Resource Management Journal]]’’, July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Full implementation of high commitment management practices is required in order to receive the full benefits of the system,&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley"&gt;Hutchinson, Sue Purcell, John Kinnie, Nick. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9pzmzba&amp;s=229f7c2b19333a8c5ffdde32dceee06d1cdb9cf2 “Evolving High Commitment Management and Experience of the RAC Calling Centre”], ''[[Human Resource Management Journal]]'', January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore during the transition period firms may not experience positive changes right away, which may provide disincentives for continuing the transition. This may explain why very few firms in the US have comprehensive commitment practices.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

High-commitment management practices are currently considered a universal approach &lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_a"&gt;Kinnie, Nicholas et al. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2005.tb00293.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2005.tb00293.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9oopqht&amp;s=1ecc68cf20ac62f41211644da8d74baa49492042 “Satisfaction with HR Practices and Commitment to the Organisation: Why one size does not fit all”], ''[[Human Resource Management Journal]]''. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; seen to be effective in all firms, however the best form of management for a firm with a price-sensitive, high-volume commodity market will differ from a firm with a high-quality, low-volume market.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley" /&gt; This has been seen within the private and public sectors, where only some high-commitment management practices in the private sector have the same benefits in the public sector and the entire program cannot be transported.&lt;ref&gt;Gould-Williams, Julian. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.0033-3298.2004.00383.x/asset/j.0033-3298.2004.00383.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9ookh58&amp;s=3a667459d7c3ef22f27834e079cc4538fd9e470f “The Effects of ‘High Commitment’ HRM Practices on Employee Attitude: The Views of Public  Sector Workers”], ‘’[[Public Administration]]’’, March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Managers may also face difficulty when implementing high commitment management practices as they face a tension between a consistent approach using the same practices throughout the entire workforce or adjusting their practices based on specific needs of different groups.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_a" /&gt; As workforces become more diverse, this tension may become more pronounced.

While it has been proven that workers feel positively towards high commitment management practices, it is also admitted that these practices portray workers as a resource or commodity that will be exploited by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, David Shields, John. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/1472-9296.00052/asset/1472-9296.00052.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9oo3t4y&amp;s=f9138b30fb74c34e15f4600805a88b424433ea8d “In Search of the Subject: Researching Employee Reactions to Human Resource Management”], ‘’[[The Journal of Industrial Relations]]’’, September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even though positive effects have been shown, these practices are also seen as another management initiative to try to gain greater control and efficiency from employees.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b" /&gt; Therefore, these practices are still exploiting the worker. Workers do express excessive pressure &lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b" /&gt; and high insecurity &lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Jim Oliver, Nick [http://wes.sagepub.com/content/5/3/437 “The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a High-Tech Industry”], ‘’[[Work, Employment and Society]]’’, September 1, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; when high commitment management practices are implemented. However, even though companies may have high commitment practices, which in itself mean companies will have little employee flexibility, if the nature of the company is such that they embrace change, then it is possible for these to coexist.

Therefore, while there are many benefits proven to exist as a result of high commitment management practices, there are also disadvantages and difficulties incurred by management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">[[File:Jean-Baptiste Moens.jpg|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Moens, 1887]]
'''Jean-Baptiste Philippe Constant Moens''' (27 May 1833, [[Tournai]] – 28 April 1908) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[philatelist]] recognized as the first [[stamp dealer|dealer in stamps for collectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helenmorgan.net/bm/biogs/E000073b.htm |title=Helen Morgan, "Moens, Jean-Baptiste (1833-1908)", Blue Mauritius Research Companion |publisher=Helenmorgan.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the original [[philatelic literature|philatelic journalists]].

== Youth ==
Moens began [[stamp collecting|collecting stamps]] from his family's mail as a boy in [[Tournai]]. He was the son of Colette Blangenois and Phillipe Moens, a soldier. He began with a small business in coins. By 1853, at age nineteen, he was buying and selling new and second-hand books, and [[Postage stamp|stamps]], from the [[Galerie Borthier]], a covered walkway in central [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://student.ulb.ac.be/~charveng/moens/biograph.htm |title=Christelle Harvengt, "Jean-Baptiste Moens (1833-1908)" Université Libre de Bruxelles (Fr) |accessdate=2008-04-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213135143/http://student.ulb.ac.be/~charveng/moens/biograph.htm |archivedate=13 February 2005 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade he was putting out a [[stamp catalog]] with illustrated supplements.

== First catalogue ==
In March 1862, with [[Louis Hanciau]], Moens published a catalog of stamps, the ''Manuel des collectionneurs de timbres-poste'' (Handbook for Stamp Collectors). This work is the first of its kind in Belgium and the second in the French language, following that of the Parisian, [[Alfred Potiquet]]. Also in 1862, he published ''De la falsification des timbres-poste'' (On the falsification of postage stamps) to alert stamp enthusiasts to the abundance of [[Philatelic fakes and forgeries|forgeries]]. He began the first French language philatelic monthly, ''[[Le Timbre-Poste]]'', which ran from 1863 until 1900, as well as a series on [[revenue stamp|fiscal stamps]] from 1874 until 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Jean-Baptiste Moens|Jean Baptiste Moens, French Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Mauritius "Post Office" stamps ==
Moens became the owner of eight of the [[Mauritius "Post Office"|"Post Office" Mauritius stamps]]. In 1878 Moens published the first of his works on the early stamps of Mauritius, ''Les Timbres de Maurice depuis leur origine jusqu'à nos jours,'' (The Stamps of Mauritius from their Origin until Today), benefiting from the studies of [[Edward B. Evans]], the [[Royal Philatelic Society London|Philatelic Society of London]], and Judge [[Frederick Philbrick]]. Helen Morgan noted, "All that is known of the discovery of the first specimens of the Post Office issue, indeed of much of the history of the handful of those stamps eventually found, came from his pen in the late 1890s. He handled most of the Post Office stamps discovered by Madame Borchard in the late 1860s."

== Organised philately ==
Moens was an Honorary Member of the [[Fiscal Philatelic Society]] until his death.&lt;ref name=fiscal&gt;''The Bulletin'', Fiscal Philatelic Society, Vol.I, No.1, October 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement ==
As Moens' business prospered, he assembled a large stock of collectibles of all kinds and a library devoted to music and antiquities, as well as stamps. By 1 November 1899, to preserve his health, Jean-Baptiste announced in ''Le Timbre-poste'' that the time had come to free himself from the duties of publication and to liquidate most of his stock in trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://student.ulb.ac.be/~charveng/moens/biograph.htm |title=Christelle Harvengt, "Biography" |accessdate=2008-04-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828172529/http://student.ulb.ac.be/~charveng/moens/biograph.htm |archivedate=28 August 2005 |df= }}, (Retrieved 2008-04-02)&lt;/ref&gt; After selling his rarities, the residue of Moens' stock, with a catalogue value of £196,000 (1882 catalogue), was sold the following year to M Rubens, a stamp dealer of Copenhagen for an undisclosed figure.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Philatelic Record]]'', June 1900, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Philatelic literature|philatelic publications]] were eventually sold to [[H. Edgar Weston]], in London, in 1907.

== Death ==
Jean-Baptiste Moens died in [[Ixelles]] in 1908 and was interred there in the [[Ixelles Cemetery]]. His passing was noted by the philatelic press, many referring to him as ''The Father of Philately''.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Growing up, Zeltner wanted to study [[veterinary medicine]], but ended up doing an internship at [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] which later merged with [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] to form his current employer [[UBS]]. &lt;ref name="UBS Seen Winning as Wealth Management Emulates Pimco"&gt;{{cite web|title=UBS Seen Winning|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-16/ubs-seen-winning-as-wealth-management-emulates-pimco|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeltner holds a diploma in Business Administration from the College of Higher Vocational Education in [[Bern]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is a graduate of the Advanced Management Program at [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==

===Career progression in UBS===
Zeltner joined the Corporate Client division of the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC) in 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between 1987 and 1998, Zeltner occupied numerous roles at [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC) within the Private and Corporate Client division in [[Bern]], [[New York City]], and [[Zurich]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Amongst other roles, Zeltner was Credit Risk Officer for Corporate and Institutional clients.

Following the merger of SBC with the [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] (SBG/UBS) to become [[UBS]] in 1998, Zeltner was appointed as head of Portfolio Management for Risk Transformation and Capital Management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 2005 to 2007 he occupied the position of [[CEO]] at UBS Deutschland, [[Frankfurt]]. In November 2007, he was appointed as Head of Wealth Management North, East &amp; Central Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From February 2009 to January 2012 he was co-CEO of Wealth Management and Swiss Bank.&lt;ref name="Follow Jürg Zeltner"/&gt;

He was the President of [[UBS]] Wealth Management from November 2014 to December 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 14 December 2017, UBS announced that Zeltner will step down from GEB at the end of the year. He has retired from the firm as of 2018. The Board of Directors has appointed [[Martin Blessing]], former President of Human Resources &amp; Corporate Banking and President of UBS Switzerland, to succeed him as President Wealth Management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/ubs-wealth-chief-zeltner-is-said-to-be-close-to-stepping-down|title=UBS Wealth Chief to Be Replaced in Reshuffle|date=2017-12-13|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business strategy===
On 17 November 2011, UBS held their annual Investor Day in New York. Jürg Zeltner gave a presentation on the UBS Wealth Management Division in which he outlined how the business is positioned in the financial markets and in view of future growth. He pointed out that [[UBS]]'s strategy is centered around its wealth management business.&lt;ref name="UBS Wealth Management Euromoney" /&gt;

In February 2015, Jürg Zeltner was awarded second position among the ten best global private banking CEOs of 2015 and he revealed the strategies behind the [[Wealth Management]] division.&lt;ref name="Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey 2015: Best Global Private Banking CEOs" /&gt; According to him, there has been a shift from asset gathering and product manufacturing to clients advisory and, with the markets moving so rapidly, portfolio diversification. According to Zeltner the focus of wealth management must be on advising clients on how to position their portfolio and on carrying research on asset allocation and on investment management. With regard to the move of the [[Swiss National Bank]] to unpeg the [[Swiss franc]] from the [[euro]], he affirmed that "the sharp fall in the Swiss [[stock market|equity markets]] and the currency turmoil highlight the importance of [[Diversification (finance)|portfolio diversification]]. Anyone who follows this principle and holds securities in all the world's major markets, hedging their currency risks, is financially better equipped to cope with this decision, giving [[UBS]] the opportunity to demonstrate to clients why they need us."&lt;ref name="UBS Wealth Management Euromoney"&gt;{{cite web|title=UBS Turns a Corner: Future Looks Bright for Swiss Bank |url=https://www.euromoney.com/Article/3421655/UBS-WM-chief-says-tougher-times-for-advisory-model.html|publisher=Euromoney|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, his work to improve private banking is appreciated even by his competitor. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/follow_ubs/juerg_zeltner/2016/2/11/zeltner-s-zeal-for-private-banking.html|title=Zeltner's Zeal for Private Banking|website=global|language=en|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities and functions===

==Philanthropy==
Zeltner was Chairman of the UBS Optimus Foundation until he retired from the UBS at end of 2017.

At the [[World Economic Forum]] of 2015, [[UBS]] presented the Davos Challenge, Walk for Education, encouraging 1000 delegates to walk for bicycles for children in [[South Africa]]. Zeltner took the challenge together with [[Axel A. Weber]] and other UBS participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Davos Attendees To Wear Fitbits, Raise Money To Buy Bikes For Needy Kids|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/20/davos-challenge-education_n_6489232.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Oswald was born in [[Dundee]] and grew up in [[Carnoustie]] where she attended [[Carnoustie High School]].&lt;ref name="GG 30Apr2015"&gt;{{cite news | work = The Guide and Gazette | date = 30 April 2015 | title = Carnoustie Lady Aims for Westminster | url =http://www.guideandgazette.co.uk/news/local-headlines/carnoustie-lady-aims-for-westminster-1-3759498 | accessdate = 8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow University]] where she read History. She moved to East Renfrewshire with her husband and two sons in 2008.

On 30 January 2015, it was announced that Oswald was selected as the SNP candidate for the [[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]] constituency at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|legislator|legislatrix|lawmaker}}
{{Legislature}}
{{Politics}}

A '''legislator''' (or '''lawmaker''') is a person who writes and passes [[law]]s, especially someone who is a member of a [[legislature]]. Legislators are usually [[politician]]s and are often elected by the people of the state. Legislatures may be supra-national (for example, the [[European Parliament]]), national (for example, the [[United States Congress]]), regional (for example, the [[National Assembly for Wales]]), or local (for example, [[Local government|local authorities]]).

==Overview==
The [[political theory]] of the [[separation of powers]] requires legislators to be different individuals from the members of the [[executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]]. Certain political systems adhere to this principle, others do not. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, the executive is formed almost exclusively from legislators (members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]) although the judiciary is mostly independent (until reforms in 2005, the [[Lord Chancellor]] uniquely was a legislator, a member of the executive (indeed, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]), and a [[judge]], while until 2009 the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] were both [[judge]]s and legislators as members of the [[House of Lords]], though by convention they did not vote in the House until retirement).

In continental European [[jurisprudence]] and legal discussion, "the legislator" (''le législateur'') is the [[abstract entity]] that has produced the laws. When there is room for [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], the intent of the legislator will be questioned, and the court is supposed to rule in the direction it judges to best fit the legislative intent, which can be difficult in the case of conflicting laws or constitutional provisions.

==Terminology==
The local term for a legislator is usually a derivation of the local term for the relevant legislature. Typical examples include
* Parliament: [[Member of Parliament]]
* Assembly: Member of the Assembly
* Senate: Senator
* House of Representatives: Representative
* Congress: [[Member of Congress]]
The generic term "deputy" may also be used, deriving from the concept that the legislator is "deputising" for the electorate of his [[electoral district]].

==Substitute legislator==
Some legislatures provide each legislator with an official "substitute legislator" who deputises for the legislator in the legislature if he or she is unavailable. [[Venezuela]], for example, provides for substitute legislators (''diputado suplente'') to be elected under Article 186 of its [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsj.gov.ve/legislacion/constitucion1999.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417173551/http://www.tsj.gov.ve/legislacion/constitucion1999.htm |archivedate=2014-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecuador]] and [[Panama]] also have substitute legislators.

The '''life sciences''' or '''biological sciences''' comprise the [[branches of science]] that involve the scientific study of [[life]] and [[organism]]s – such as [[microorganism]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s including [[human being]]s. 

Life science is one of the two major branches of [[natural science]], the other being [[physical Science|physical science]], which is concerned with non-living matter. 

By definition, [[biology]] is the [[natural science]] that studies life and living organisms, with the other life sciences being its sub-disciplines. 

Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, [[zoology]] is the study of [[animals]], while [[botany]] is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as [[anatomy]] and [[genetics]]. Some focus on the micro scale (e.g. [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]]) other on larger scales (e.g. [[Cell biology|cytology]], [[immunology]], [[ethology]], [[ecology]]). Another major, branch of life sciences involves understanding the [[mind]]{{spaced ndash}}[[neuroscience]].

Life sciences discoveries are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life, and have applications in health, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries.

==Basic life science branches==
{{Main|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}

[[Biology]] &amp;ndash; burst and eclectic field, composed of many branches and sub-disciplines. However, despite the complexity and the broad scope of the science, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into a single, coherent field. Here are some of biology's major branches:
* [[Anatomy]] – study of form and function, in plants, animals, and other organisms, or specifically in humans
* [[Astrobiology]] – the study of the formation and presence of life in the universe
* [[Biochemistry]] – study of the chemical reactions required for life to exist and function, usually a focus on the cellular level

*[[Bioinformatics]] &amp;ndash; developing of methods or software tools for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data to generate useful biological knowledge

* [[Biolinguistics]] – study of the biology and evolution of language
*[[Biological Anthropology|Biological anthropology]] – the study of humans, non-human primates, and hominids. Also known as physical anthropology
*[[Biomechanics]] – the study of the mechanics of living beings
*[[Biophysics]] – study of biological processes by applying the theories and methods that have been traditionally used in the physical sciences
*[[Botany]] – study of plants
*[[Cell biology]] – study of the cell as a complete unit, and the molecular and chemical interactions that occur within a living cell. Also known as cytology
*[[Developmental biology]] – study of the processes through which an organism forms, from zygote to full structure
*[[Ecology]] – study of the interactions of living organisms with one another and with the non-living elements of their environment

'''Louis Victor Gerverot''' (8 December 1747 – 6 January 1829) was a French [[porcelain painter]] and businessman.

==Life==
===Early life===
Gerverot was born in [[Lunéville]]. His father was a "musicus" (singer) at the court of [[Stanisław Leszczyński]], former king of Poland, who became in 1737 the [[duke of Lotharingen]]. His mother, Barbe Oubert, sent him to the porcelain factory in [[Sèvres porcelain|Sèvres]] in 1764, to learn his trade. Possibly he had himself already asked to specialize in the painting of porcelain with flowers and (fantastical) birds. Gerverot became extremely able in the preparation of colour, clay mixtures, and (since his stay in [[Niderviller]]) in other trade secrets.&lt;!---Are we sure "in other trade secrets" or "in the secrets of the arcanum" is the best translation for "op de hoogte van het productieproces"?---&gt;  His urge to travel and to turn his knowledge into money (or his inability to stay in any one place for long) resulted in his short periods in various porcelain factories. In succession, he was active in [[Ludwigsburg]], [[Ansbach]], [[Höchst Porzellanmanufaktur|Höchst]], [[Fürstenberg China|Fürstenberg]] and [[Frankenthal]].

===Weesp and Loosdrecht===
In 1767, Gerverot won a large sum in the city lottery of [[Mainz]]. In 1769, he came to [[Weesp]], and worked in the porcelain factory of [[Bertrand Philip, count of Gronsveld]], former envoy in Berlin, and now [[landdrost|drost]] of [[Muiden]] and president of the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]]. Production and activity did not take off and thus this enterprise, Holland's first porcelain factory, closed in 1771. Gerverot left for the [[faience]]- or porcelain factory of [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Höchst Porzellanmanufaktur|Höchst]] and [[Ellwangen]]. In nearby Schrezheim, Gerverot worked at his own expense.  

Minister [[Joannes de Mol]] sent Gerverot a portrait of a minister-colleague in 1774 from which he made a bust, and in return de Mol brought Gerverot up to [[Oud-Loosdrecht]] as a manager, painter and pigment-maker. The designing of new models was not his strongest suit, but nevertheless Gerverot deserved his new salary, of 150 guilder per month.

===Amsterdam===
Gerverot possibly lived an unconventional life, as may be seen from the fact that in 1776 he witnessed the christening of a child in the French Roman Catholic chapel. The child was named Louis Victor George d' Onis, with his father noted as George Alexander d' Onis and his mother a black woman, named Coba. The legality of their marriage was called into doubt by the authorities.  

Gerverot in 1777 married Modesta Johanna Salomons, from Hamburg. In Amsterdam, they had three children:  Louis Victor (born 1778), Johannes Victor (born 1780) and Georg Samuel (born in 1783, but buried in Amsterdam in 1784). L.V. Gerverot lived in the Plantage ([[plantation]]), then a large park with inns, speelhuizen (playhouses, where billiards was played) and brothels, now [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]] and its surroundings. All his children were baptized at home, since he did not belong to a particular church.  

On 1 March 1779, Gerverot was dismissed in [[Loosdrecht]], having lent De Mol 28,000 guilder. Cooperation seemed to be impossible. Gerverot opened a porcelain store in Amsterdam, but early in 1788 had to declare bankruptcy.  (This period in the life of Gerverot is unclear. It may be that he also worked in [[Cologne]], [[Münster]] and [[Hanover]]).  

Gerverot traveled to England and took employment with [[Turner (potters)|John Turner]], one of [[Wedgwood]]'s most significant competitors. In 1795, his purse again empty, he arrived in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and was taken on once more at the Fürstenberg factory. Two years later he was its manager. Under his leadership the factory became commercially successful for the first time in its existence. In 1814, Gerverot was dismissed for collaboration with the French. He died at [[Bevern, Lower Saxony|Bevern]].

[[Malay titles|Dato' Seri]] [[Hajji|Haji]] '''Mukhriz bin Mahathir''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: مخريز بن محضير; born 25 November 1964) is a Malaysian politician who is the current [[List of Menteris Besar of Kedah|Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) of the State of [[Kedah]]. From 2008 to 2013 he was the federal Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry. He is the third son of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], the current [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]].

He is a former member of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) in Malaysia's ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition. Like his father, he left UMNO in 2016. Mukhriz is currently the Deputy President of [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party|Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia]] (PPBM, Malaysian United Indigenous Party) and the chairman of the [[Pakatan Harapan]] coalition in Kedah.

==Political career==

===Pre-parliamentary career===
In 2004, he won election to the executive council of UMNO's youth wing, by garnering the highest number of votes of any candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.188.124.45/umno2004/foto.php?cat=2004&amp;page=1 PHOTO GALLERY]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atimes01.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FI24Ae05.html UMNO elections a time for reinvention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622033859/http://atimes01.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FI24Ae05.html |date=22 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also seen as a potential candidate for being the deputy chief of UMNO Youth, but he later withdrew his candidacy.&lt;ref name="malaysia-today.net"&gt;[http://www.malaysia-today.net/loonyMY/2005/06/sabah-battleground-for-umno-deputy.htm Sabah: the battleground for the Umno Deputy Presidency (part 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211004615/http://www.malaysia-today.net/loonyMY/2005/06/sabah-battleground-for-umno-deputy.htm |date=11 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhriz was noted for his continuous efforts in speaking for his father in the events of the rift between Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi|Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] and his father.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013161828/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/baptism-of-fire-for-mukhriz.htm Baptism of fire for Mukhriz?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ytlcommunity.com/commnews/shownews.asp?newsid=23547 Remarks unfair, unwarranted: Umno Youth]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, his father lost a bid to be elected as one of seven delegates from [[Kubang Pasu District|Kubang Pasu]] to UMNO's general assembly; Mukhriz was elected as one of the seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44345 Mukhriz shocked; claims move well-planned] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234502/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44345 |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukhriz drew flak from sections of UMNO after he commented on Prime Minister Abdullah's speech at the assembly that he was a "little bit" disappointed and that it had offered nothing new.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/16/nation/16036138&amp;sec=nation Mukhriz: Nothing new in speech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117120105/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F16%2Fnation%2F16036138&amp;sec=nation |date=17 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologised for his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/25/nation/16129084&amp;sec=nation Mukhriz to face Youth exco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521092409/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F25%2Fnation%2F16129084&amp;sec=nation |date=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal parliamenterian (2008–2013)===
In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 Malaysian general election]], Mukhriz won the [[Jerlun (federal constituency)|Jerlun]] Parliament Seat with the sum of the DUN differing markedly from Parlimen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=0222&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Muka_Hadapan&amp;pg=mh_05.htm Mukhriz ke Parlimen Jerlun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/78398 Kedah: Mukhriz to fight Jerlun, Badruddin stays in Jerai]&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, he offered himself to contest in [[Langkawi (federal constituency)|Langkawi]] Parliament Seat but was rejected by 85 out of 91 UMNO branches in Langkawi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/2/20/north/20380904&amp;sec=north8 Mukhriz ‘the right man to contest in Langkawi’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521095539/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F2%2F20%2Fnorth%2F20380904&amp;sec=north8 |date=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many [[Langkawi]] leaders backed him later. The Jerlun UMNO division welcomed Mukhriz to contest in their Parliament seat and promised to give him full support in the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobisha.blogspot.com/2008/02/mukhriz-selamat-datang-ke-jerlun.html Mukhriz, Selamat Datang ke Jerlun!].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mukhriz contested as a candidate for the new [[UMNO]] Youth Chief after the wing's predecessor, Datuk Seri [[Hishamuddin Hussein]] released his position. He was rivalled by [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] and [[Khir Toyo]]. Nominations for the posts coincided with division meetings which took place between October and November 2008. Mukhriz was initially seen as leading in nominations compared to Khairy but eventually lost in the final vote count.

However, a controversy was sparked when Khairy was allowed to contest for the post even though he was found guilty for being involved with [[bribery|money politics]] by the UMNO Disciplinary Board,&lt;ref name="kj-rasuah"&gt;[http://www.harakahdaily.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=020051&amp;Itemid=99 Pilih Khairy, Pemuda Umno hilang hala tuju] – from harakahdaily.net. Accessed on 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; while others who were found guilty for the same offence, such as [[Mohd Ali Rustam]] who was supposed to contest for the [[UMNO]] Vice-President post, were not allowed to contest for their respective posts. However, Khairy denied the allegation, as stated in his blog.&lt;ref name="kj-tak-rasuah"&gt;[http://www.rembau.net.my/news_list.asp?uid=436 Penjelasan Mengenai Keputusan Lembaga Disiplin UMNO]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{ms icon}} – from Khairy's official blog, Rembau.net. Accessed on 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First term as Menteri Besar Kedah (2013–2016)===
In the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]], Mukhriz gave up his seat in federal parliament to contest the Kedah State Assembly seat of Ayer Hitam. The move was taken with a view to becoming the Chief Minister of Kedah if the Barisan Nasional coalition could defeat the [[Pakatan Rakyat]] state government led by [[Azizan Abdul Razak]]. Mukhriz won Ayer Hitam (defeating the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) incumbent), Barisan Nasional reclaimed the state government, and Mukhriz was sworn in as Chief Minister on 6 May, the day after the election, in the presence of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/5/7/nation/13076403&amp;sec=nation|title=GE13: Mukhriz sworn in as Kedah MB|date=7 May 2013|work=The Star|accessdate=12 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529031755/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F5%2F7%2Fnation%2F13076403&amp;sec=nation|archive-date=29 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2013 Mukhriz attempted to charge Penang for the use of water from a river located in Penang state, on the basis that the source of the water was in Kedah. In return the Chief Minister for Penang, [[Lim Guan Eng]], requested the Kedah government to pay rent for the land which the river occupies in Penang state.

In January 2016, UMNO Kedah leaders, led by [[Ahmad Bashah Md Hanipah]], declare the loss of confidence towards Mukhriz due to "his inability to maintain a united party leadership".&lt;ref name="hilangpercaya"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghazali|first1=Adha|title=UMNO Kedah hilang kepercayaan terhadap Mukhriz|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/116315|accessdate=3 February 2016|agency=Berita Harian|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move is widely believed to be a reprisal orchestrated by the Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]]'s camp in UMNO, which was increasingly infuriated by Mahathir's and Mukhriz's criticisms against Najib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-03/mahathir-s-son-ousted-as-malaysia-premier-tightens-grip-on-power|title=Mahathir's Son Ousted as Malaysia Premier Tightens Grip on Power|date=3 February 2016|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned on 3 February 2016 after losing the majority of support among the assemblymen.&lt;ref name="mbk-resign"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mukhriz Mahathir letak jawatan MB Kedah|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/120683|accessdate=3 February 2016|agency=Berita Harian|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Bashah, who is also the Bakar Bata assemblyman, succeeded him as the 12th Chief Minister of Kedah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ahmad-bashah-is-new-kedah-mb|title=Ahmad Bashah is new Kedah MB|date=3 February 2016|work=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=3 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203134349/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ahmad-bashah-is-new-kedah-mb|archive-date=3 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhriz was expelled from UMNO together with Muhyiddin Yassin in June 2016.

'''Murtuza Mukhtarov''' ({{lang-az|Murtuza Muxtarov}}) (1857 &amp;ndash; 1920) was an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] oil industrialist and millionaire who built the [[Mukhtarov Palace]] in [[Baku]] and the [[Mukhtarov Mosque]] in [[Vladikavkaz]].

Mukhtarov was born into a poor family in a village of Amirajan near [[Baku]].  Mukhtarov managed to become one of the most reputable drilling experts in Baku through his ability and many years of experience. He set up his own drilling company in 1890 and then diversified into oil production. The company specialized in manufacturing machinery for derricks and  in drilling oil wells. He was the author of several [[patents]] on drilling equipment - unique feat amongst oil [[industrialists]] of the time. 

Business and enterprising millionaire built for himself magnificent mansion, which is now Wedding Palace in Baku. Another interesting fact from his life: with his wife they funded young singer [[Fatma Mukhtarova]] who would later go on to become a star of the Baku opera stage. 

Mukhtarov sponsored schools and build mosques in Baku and surrounding areas. His [[Mukhtarov Palace|fanciful Gothic Revival residence]] built for his wife Liza Mukhtarova by architect [[Józef Plośko]] in 1911-1912 is a celebrated example of the Baku oil boom architecture.

Mukhtarov committed suicide in his own residence after killing several [[Red Army]] soldiers on April 28, 1920 after [[Bolshevik]] takeover of Baku.

== Early life ==
Murtuza Mukhtarov was born in 1857 in the village of Amirjan (around Baku) in a poor family. During his childhood, Murtuza and his brother Bala Ahmed transported cargoes from Baku to Tiflis. In 1874, after selling his car Murtuza started working in one of the mines around Zabrat and Balakhani villages (near to Baku). An entrepreneur Martov discovered the will of M. Mukhtarov and instructed him about the use of drilling equipment, and in a short time, he was appointed to a foreman. After a while, sold the mining workshop drilling rig to him. Murtuza Mukhtarov made several changes in the machinery that he took over. At that time, all the people of Amircan village helped him by collecting money. Because of his dedication, Murtuza became to be known to more people. During this period, he got more technical knowledge from different engineers who worked for him relevant to the demands of the century. Business and enterprising millionaire also learned a lot about technical drawing. When signing documents, he rarely wrote his entire surname, typically his signature consisting of three letters "Mux". Like the other oil millionaires, Murtuza Mukhtarov has grown from the usual laborer to a million millionaire. After a long period of working as a plasterer, he transported oil by using carts and finally engaged in small contracts and started to drill oil wells in Baku and other cities within Russian empire such as Maykop and Grozny. Despite being born into a poor family and not having access to formal education, he managed to become a highly-qualified, self-taught engineer and one of the best boring specialists in Baku. His enormous experience and shrewdness propelled him into his own business in 1890 when he founded what became a substantially sized oil company with two divisions, employing 2,500 workers to manufacture machinery for derricks and bore new oil wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.finansist.az/upload-files/Jurnal-4-Murtuza_Muxtarov.pdf|title=“DİPLOMSUZ MÜHƏNDİS: Murtuza Muxtarov|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Mukhtarov has actively participated in the development of oil extraction technology in Baku. Without any high technical education, he was able to become an expert on oil drilling technologies. The "Podrat drilling" rig established in 1890 played a major role in drilling oil wells in Balakhani, Surakhani, Ramana and Sabunchu oil districts of Baku. Most of the wells in these areas are drilled by the "Podrat Drill" rig.

At that time he owned all oil wells around Baku-Buzovna railway. Thus the first station after Sabunchu is called "Mukhtarovka". In 1895 (for the first time in the world), he built a drilling rig with metal sticks and received copyright from the state. He then called his invention "Baku Drilling System". At the end of the 19th century, Mukhtarov opened a drilling equipment plant in Bibiheybat, which was considered the first oil equipment enterprise at that time. He also built three-storeyed residential buildings for the workers near the plant, thereby created new sources of labor and additional source of income. Oil millionaire invented wood chamfering machine in 1917. The equipment is being kept at the Mining Institute in St. Petersburg.

M. Mukhtarov was selling the products of his plant to foreign countries and bought most of the equipment from abroad, especially from America. 

He was not only involved in oil drilling process in Baku, but also signed contracts with the local oil barons in Maykop and Grozny, and had technical and business relationships with the owners' factories and oil mines in the North Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elibrary.az/docs/JURNAL/jrn2012_518.pdf|title=The Edison of Baku|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enter.news/az/news/interesting/54149/milyonchu-murtuza-muxtarovun-heyat-hekayeti-onu-dunyada-meshhur-eden-hansi-ixtirasi-oldu#.W_L5AGdR3IV|title=Milyonçu Murtuza Muxtarovun həyat hekayəti - Onu dünyada məşhur edən hansı ixtirası oldu?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropic works ==
M. Mukhtarov was involved in many philanthropic works. A mosque and school in Amirjan village (built in 1910) and 17 buildings in Absheron, a dome on the grave of Akhund Mirza Abu Turab in Pirhasan (Mardakan, Baku) a mosque in Vladikavkaz was built under patronage of him. The Amirjan mosque with the minarets and their double balconies and decorations are very distinct as they rise 46 meters high. The workmanship in stone carving far exceeds that of any other mosque in Baku, the surrounding suburban areas or, for that matter, in the entire country. Many mosques were destroyed during the Soviet Period or were converted to other uses such as museums, but the Amirjan Mosque still stands today and is used as a place of worship. Murtuza Mukhtarov was the patron of Baku Realni College and Temirxan-Shura Gymnasium of Women, and the member of the Society for the spread of literacy and knowledge among the mountain-dwellers. He was also the member of the St. Petersburg Muslim Charitable Society and the founder of 40 scholarships for the students of high and vocational schools. Murtuza Mukhtarov, who was well-known as a benevolent and kind person, earnest entrepreneur, left many magnificent buildings as a legacy. A number of buildings that are preserved up to this day in Baku and its suburbs, in many cities of Russia, and in several European countries are connected with his name. The mosque in Vladivostok city, beautiful and magnificent buildings in Kislovodks, and Florence, Italy are built with his money. Murtuza Mukhtarov actively participated in nearly all charity societies and gave financial assistance. Together with his wife Liza-Khanum, known for her philanthropy, arranged a boarding school for poor and orphan girls inside the palace. In 1914, the Mukhtarovs' Palace became the residence of the first Female Moslem Philanthropic Society founded by Liza-Khanum. They financially supported many of these girls so they could continue their education in Moscow and St. Petersburg. She was also an active member of the Society to Combat Mortality among Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aztc.gov.az/en/posts/id:760|title=Mukhtarov Mosque as a Visit Card of Vladikafkaz|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijans.com/content_760_en.html|title=Philanthropist millionaires.

== Familiy ==
While visiting Vladikavkaz, a town in southern Russia Mukhtarov fell in love with an Ossetian noble lady, Liza-Khanum Taganova. But when Mukhtarov proposed, her parents refused. It didn't matter that he was extremely rich. To them, he had not been born into nobility and did not come up to their social standing. Then, he undertook to build a magnificent mosque on the bank of Terek River. Of course, afterwards, it was impossible for the Taganovs to refuse him. As the couple did not have any children they dedicated themselves to the philanthropic works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vestnikkavkaza.net/articles/Murtuza-and-Liza-Mukhtarovs-a-great-love-story-in-stone.html|title=Murtuza and Liza Mukhtarovs: a great love story in stone|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mukhtarov's Manison ==
The Mukhtarov's Mansion is located in the centre of Istiglaliyyat Avenue (Independence Avenue). Built in the early 1910s by Azerbaijan oil millionaire Murtuza Mukhtarov, it was inspired by the magnate’s travels to Venice. Notable architect Jozef Ploshko designed this French Gothic edifice among a number of great buildings in the city. it housed a boarding school for poverty-stricken or orphaned girls (about 1914-1920) organized by the first Female Muslim Philanthropic Society, which Liza (Mukhtarov’s wife) established (1914). During the Soviet period, the Residence took on a new life and character of its own, somehow reminiscent of its past, when it was converted into Baku's Wedding Palace. To this day, it continues to serve that purpose and couples come to register their vows and make public their commitment of loyalty to one another in this majestic architectural landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/mukhtarovs-mansion-36401.html|title=Mukhtarov's Mansion|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/culture/63195.html|title=Mysteries of Baku millionaires' houses - Murtuza Mukhtarov.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Edward Owen Cox''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|GBE}} (21 January 1866 &amp;ndash; 30 July 1932), known as '''Owen Cox''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]]-born  [[Australia]]n businessman and politician.

Cox was born in [[South Wales]], was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]], and went to sea at the age of fourteen. He left his first ship at [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], however, and went into the [[banking]] business.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radi|first1=Heather|title=Cox, Sir Edward John Owen (1866–1932)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cox-sir-edward-john-owen-5798|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few years he returned to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], but then sailed to Australia and settled in [[Sydney]]. He became chairman of Birt &amp; Co and a [[board of directors|director]] of the [[New Zealand Shipping Company|Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Edward Owen Cox (1866-1932)|work=Members of Parliament|publisher =[[Parliament of New South Wales]]|url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/members/Pages/member-details.aspx?pk=1165|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his war services, Cox was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in  the [[1918 New Year Honours]] and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in the Dominion war honours of 1920.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Cox died in [[Monte Carlo]], aged 66, after an illness lasting several months.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

'''Pantone LLC''' is a U.S. corporation headquartered in [[Carlstadt, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Horyn, Cathy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/fashion/20COLOR.html "Pantone's Color of the Year Is..."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 20, 2007.  Accessed September 8, 2008. "Nonetheless, Pantone's choice of blue iris, or No. 18-3943, got some news media attention last week, which seemed to be partly the objective of the company, which is based in Carlstadt, NJ."&lt;/ref&gt; The company is best known for its '''Pantone Matching System''' ('''PMS'''), a [[patent|proprietary]] [[color space]] used in a variety of industries, primarily printing, though sometimes in the manufacture of colored paint, fabric, and plastics.

[[X-Rite]] Inc., a supplier of color measurement instruments and software, purchased Pantone Inc. for $180 million in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Printing talk | url = http://www.printingtalk.com/news/xri/xri117.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202181819/http://www.printingtalk.com/news/xri/xri117.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-12-02 | title = Pantone US$180m Acquisition Completion For X-Rite: News from X-Rite }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Pantone began in New York City in the 1950s as the commercial [[printer (publishing)|printing]] company of M &amp; J Levine Advertising.  In 1956, its founders, advertising executives brothers Mervin and Jesse Levine, hired recent [[Hofstra University]] graduate [[Lawrence Herbert]] as a part-time employee. Herbert used his chemistry knowledge to systematize and simplify the company's stock of [[pigment]]s and production of colored [[ink]]s; by 1962, Herbert was running the ink and printing division at a profit, while the commercial-display division was $50,000 in debt; he subsequently purchased the company's technological assets from the Levine Brothers for $90,000 ({{Inflation|USD|710,000|1962|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) and renamed them "Pantone".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Funding universe | contribution-url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Pantone-Inc-Company-History.html | title = Company histories | contribution = Pantone Inc. History}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's primary products include the Pantone Guides, which consist of a large number of small (approximately 6×2&amp;nbsp;inches or 15×5&amp;nbsp;cm) thin [[Paperboard|cardboard]] sheets, printed on one side with a series of related [[Color chart#Color selection chart|color swatches]] and then bound into a small "fan deck".  For instance, a particular "page" might contain a number of yellows of varying [[tint]]s.

The idea behind the PMS is to allow designers to "color match" specific colors when a design enters production stage, regardless of the equipment used to produce the color. This system has been widely adopted by graphic designers and reproduction and printing houses. Pantone recommends that PMS Color Guides be purchased annually, as their inks become yellowish over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://inksystemsinc.com/ | title = Senior Staff | type = interview | date = October 27, 2006 | publisher = Ink Systems, Inc}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Color variance also occurs within editions based on the paper stock used (coated, matte or uncoated), while interedition color variance occurs when there are changes to the specific paper stock used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=588&amp;idPressRelease=190 | archive-url= https://archive.is/20130131020005/http://pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=588&amp;idPressRelease=190 | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2013-01-31 |accessdate = 2007-02-23 | title=Pantone Press Release, 6 May 2004 | quote = Colors in the new formula guide and chips books have changed due to a shift to coated paper that is brighter and whiter}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantone Color Matching System==

The Pantone Color Matching System is largely a standardized color reproduction system.  By standardizing the colors, different manufacturers in different locations can all refer to the Pantone system to make sure colors match without direct contact with one another.

One such use is standardizing colors in the [[CMYK]] process.  The CMYK process is a method of printing color by using four inks—cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. A majority of the world's printed material is produced using the CMYK process, and there is a special subset of Pantone colors that can be reproduced using CMYK.{{Citation needed| date = January 2011}}  Those that are possible to simulate through the CMYK process are labeled as such within the company's guides.

However, most of the Pantone system's 1,114 [[spot color]]s cannot be simulated with CMYK but with 13 base pigments (14 including black) mixed in specified amounts.&lt;ref name = patone2 /&gt;

[[File:SG50 logo.jpg|thumb|A logo commissioned by the [[Government of Singapore]] to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the nation's independence. The usage instructions for the logo described it as being in Pantone Red 032 and White.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Celebrating the Little Red Dot|url=https://www.singapore50.sg/SG50/About|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318200600/https://www.singapore50.sg/SG50/About|archivedate=18 March 2015|publisher=SG50 Programme Office|year=2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Pantone system also allows for many special colors to be produced, such as metallics and fluorescents. While most of the Pantone system colors are beyond the printed CMYK gamut, it was only in 2001 that Pantone began providing translations of their existing system with screen-based colors.  Screen-based colors use the [[RGB color model]]—red, green, blue—system to create various colors.&lt;ref name = patoneRGB&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/pantone.aspx?pg=20136&amp;ca=10 | title = Pantone announces RGB conversions for Pantone system | type = press release | quote = Providing Designers with simple and accurate methods for recreating Pantone Matching System colors in Web designs}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The (discontinued)&lt;ref name="pantone.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pantone.com/goe|title=Graphics - Pantone Goe System|publisher=Pantone|website=www.pantone.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goe system has RGB and [[Lab color space|LAB]] values with each color.

Pantone colors are described by their allocated number (typically referred to as, for example, "PMS 130").  PMS colors are almost always used in branding and have even found their way into government legislation and military standards (to describe the colors of [[flag]]s and [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s).&lt;ref name=USCGHeraldry&gt;{{Citation | title = Directive | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | publisher = USCG | url = http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5200_14A.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, the [[Scottish Parliament]] debated a petition (reference PE512) to refer to the blue in the [[Flag of Scotland|Scottish flag]] as "Pantone 300". Countries such as [[Flag of Canada|Canada]] and [[Flag of South Korea|South Korea]] and organizations such as the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] have also chosen to refer to specific Pantone colors to use when producing flags. US states including [[Texas]] have set legislated PMS colors of their flags.&lt;ref name=texascolors&gt;{{Citation | chapter-url = http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/GV/content/htm/gv.011.00.003100.00.htm#3100.001.00 | place = [[Texas|TX]], US | title = Statute | chapter = 3100.

==Pantone Goe System==
On September 5, 2007, Pantone introduced the Goe System.&lt;ref name=goesystem&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/Pantone.aspx?pg=20494&amp;ca=10 | title = Pantone Unveils Goe System | type = press release | quote = Over 2,000 new Pantone colors to inspire, explore and express the color of ideas | accessdate = September 5, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Goe consisted of over 2,000 new colors in a new matching and numbering system. In addition to the standard swatch books (now called the GoeGuide), the new system also included adhesive-backed GoeSticks, interactive software, tools, and an online community where users were able to share color swatches and information.

The Goe system was streamlined to use fewer base colors (ten, plus clear coating for reflections) and accommodate many technical challenges in reproducing colors on a press.&lt;ref name= patone2&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Creative Pro | url = http://www.creativepro.com/article/pantone-2-0-after-45-years-the-sequel-to-pms- | title = Pantone 2.0: After 45 Years, the Sequel to PMS}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pantone Goe system was discontinued in November 2013.&lt;ref name="pantone.com"/&gt;

==Other products==
In mid-2006 Pantone, partnering with Vermont-based [[Fine Paints of Europe]], introduced a new line of interior and exterior paints. The color palette uses Pantone's color research and trending and has more than 3,000 colors.
In November 2015, Pantone partnered with Redland London to create a collection of bags inspired from Pantone's authority on color.

Pantone also produced [[Hexachrome]], a patented six-color printing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,734,800.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5,734,800&amp;RS=PN/5,734,800 | publisher = PTO | place = US | title = Patent | id = 5734800}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = About us | type = press release | url = http://www.pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=64&amp;idPressRelease=38 | publisher = Pantone}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to custom CMYK inks, Hexachrome added orange and green inks to expand the color gamut, for better color reproduction. It was therefore also known as a CMYKOG process.  Hexachrome was discontinued by Pantone in 2008 when Adobe Systems stopped supporting their HexWare plugin software.

Pantone Color Manager allows for users of the Adobe Creative Suite as well as other software to import the most up to date information inclusive of [[L*a*b*]] numbers as well as CMYK and RGB representations of all the various palettes. L*a*b* numbers allow for the most accurate representation of color in a device independent manner.

==Color of the Year==
Since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pantone.com/|title=Trend Forecasting - Celebrate Color: Color by Decade Infographic from Pantone.com|last=PANTONE|website=PANTONE|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pantone Color Institute declares a particular color "Color of the Year". Twice a year the company hosts, in a European capital, a secret meeting of representatives from various nations' color standards groups. After two days of presentations and debate, they choose a color for the following year; for example, the color for summer 2013 was chosen in London in the spring of 2012.{{Sfn | Vanderbilt | 2012}}  The color purportedly connects with the [[zeitgeist]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}; for example, the press release declaring Honeysuckle the color of 2011 said "In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going&amp;nbsp;– perfect to ward off the blues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Pantone | url = http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/pantone.aspx?pg=20824&amp;ca=10 |title= Pantone Reveals Color of the Year for 2011: Pantone 18-2120 Honeysuckle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of the meeting are published in ''Pantone View'', which fashion designers, florists, and many other consumer-oriented companies purchase to help guide their designs and planning for future products.{{Sfn | Vanderbilt | 2012}}

In 2012, the color of the year, Tangerine Tango, was used to create a [[cosmetics|makeup]] line, in partnership with [[Sephora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.psfk.com/2012/03/pantone-sephora.html | title=Pantone Teams Up With Sephora to Create A Color-Saturated Makeup Line | first=Emma| last= Hutchings| work = PSFK | date= 2012-03-23 | accessdate= March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product line, named Sephora + Pantone Universe collection, features Tangerine Tango–embellished false lashes; nail lacquers, cream, glitters, and high-pigment lip glosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/orange-crush-sephora-and-pantone-team-up-for-an-nyc-pop-up-shop/ | title= Orange Crush: Sephora and Pantone Team Up for an NYC Pop-Up Shop | first =Ana| last=Sragovic| work = [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]| date=2012-03-21| accessdate =March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person behind Pantone's Color of the Year, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute [[Leatrice Eiseman]], explains in an interview how 2014's Color of the Year, Radiant Orchid, was chosen:
{{Quote | I look for ascending color trends, colors that are being used in broader ways and broader context than before...  In this case, Radiant Orchid descends from the purple family, which is kind of a magical color that denotes creativity and innovation. Purple is just that kind of a complex, interesting, attracting kind of color...  [The] back-story to purple is that it inspires confidence in your creativity, and we're living in a world where that kind of creative innovation is greatly admired. In the world of color, purple is an attention-getter, and it has a meaning. It speaks to people, and we felt that it was time for the purple family to be celebrated.  That's why we chose the particular shade called Radiant Orchid. | [[Leatrice Eiseman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Eiseman | first = Leatrice |title= Lee Eiseman, Executive Director, Pantone Color Institute | url= http://www.signazon.com/spotlight-lee-eiseman-part-1.aspx |work= Spotlight |publisher = Signazon |accessdate= 24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10945">'''Payment by Results''' (PbR) is a type of [[public policy]] instrument whereby payments are contingent on the independent verification of results. It is being actively promoted by a number of governments{{Which|date=September 2017}} for more effective implementation of domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/OpenPublicServices-WhitePaper.pdf UK Cabinet Office, "Open Public Services - White Paper"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet/paying-for-success White House Office of Management and Budget, "Paying for Success"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104222124/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet/paying-for-success |date=2012-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also increasing interest in the field of [[international development]], where PBR is often referred to either as 'results-based aid' (where the funding relationship is between a donor and a recipient country) or 'results-based financing' (where the funding relationship is between a developing country government or a [[development agency]], and public or private sector providers). There are also a number of other terms in use which can often lead to confusion and a lack of clarity.&lt;ref name="ESMAP"&gt;[[ESMAP]] (2013).[http://www.esmap.org/node/2866, "Results-Based Financing in the Energy Sector: An Analytical Guide"], p.45. [[The World Bank]], Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

PbR instruments have three key features:
* Payments for pre-agreed results
* Recipient discretion over how the results are achieved
* Independent verification as the trigger for disbursement

== Domestic policy ==
There are many cases of PbR models being used to achieve domestic policy goals, in particular the delivery of social or community services, with payments linked to the results a provider achieves, rather than its inputs and processes. The use of PbR models is often promoted as a way to drive service improvements and achieve increased value for money by aligning incentives to desired outcomes.

In practice, a diverse range of PbR models have been implemented by Governments, varying by the degree to which:  

# payments can be based on the achievement of pure outcomes; and
# risk can be transferred away from Government and towards providers. 

The purest form of PbR is '''Payment by Outcomes''', which seeks to maximise payments linked to outcomes. This is where the commissioner (central or local Government) is fully able to contract in terms of the outcomes it wants and to transfer the financial risk of non-delivery to providers. However, commissioners may face a number of challenges that may make a pure Payment by Outcomes approach either impractical or sub-optimal in terms of achieving the aims of PbR models. These challenges largely stem from commissioners’ ability to manage different risks and responsibilities, especially in relation to their understanding of desired outcomes and their measurement. 

Challenges can include outcomes only being delivered beyond the provider or investor’s return horizon, meaning an earlier payment or proxy outcome must be used; having sufficient confidence that the cash savings used to fund the payment of outcomes will ultimately be realised (e.g. that a reduction in re-offending translates to a reduction in prison capacity); finding a contractual solution that ensures transactional costs are reasonable; and determining how far the delivery of outcomes is attributable to the actual intervention rather than other services or background factors. Commissioners may also find providers are reluctant to accept all of the delivery risk (e.g. where there is a dependency on future Government actions or policies) or where Government cannot truly transfer all of the delivery risk.

There are no known cases where all Government services are commissioned out. Furthermore, PbR will not always be the optimal contracting model, especially where in-house delivery is more appropriate, or where greater control is required over the service to be delivered.

===Education===
Payment by results was introduced in the management of British schools in June 1862. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=George|last=Berry|title=Discovering Schools|location=Tring|publisher=Shire Publications|year=1970|isbn=0-85263-091-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=1862-09-30|page=6|issue=24364}}&lt;/ref&gt;   National funding for individual schools, eventually rising to about half, depended in part on the outcomes of examinations of the pupils conducted by school inspectors. The system was deeply unpopular with teachers and led to increased unionisation.  The system was abandoned in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Payment by results: what a great Victorian idea!|url=https://www.tes.com/article.aspx?storycode=6041160|accessdate=4 May 2016|publisher=Times Educational Supplement|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Health Service===
A national tariff was introduced to the British [[NHS]] in 1990 and is still in operation in the English NHS.  It is now prescribed in the National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2996/contents/made|website=Legislation. gov UK|publisher=HMG|accessdate=4 January 2017|ref=SI 2012 No. 2996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s, and [[NHS England]] are required to enter into standard “Payment by Results” contracts with providers. Such a contract between an NHS commissioner and a hospital trust is compulsory for all services provided to NHS patients.  [[NHS Improvement]] is required by section 116 of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]] to produce a National Tariff, which trusts must be paid for all the specified services.  There is provision for an increase to the tariff.  University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust was the first, and so far only one, in July 2015, to get an increase for its services agreed by [[Monitor (NHS)]] because of its "increased costs associated with this trust running health services across multiple sites in rural locations". It is paid more per episode for accident and emergency, surgery, trauma and orthopaedics, paediatrics, women’s health, and non-elective medical conditions. This is expected to increase the trust's income by more than £20 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First ever tariff hike agreed for troubled trust|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/acute-trusts/university-hospitals-of-morecambe-bay-nhs-foundation-trust/first-ever-tariff-hike-agreed-for-troubled-trust/5088163.article#.VgPu1OjkJv4|accessdate=24 September 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International development ==
A range of different instruments in the field of international development can be characterized as Payment by Results, many of which seek to provide incentives for the achievement of both outcomes and outputs by [[developing country]] governments, public agencies, commercial operators and [[civil society]] organizations. By linking disbursement to results PBR is an alternative to the majority [[official development assistance]] (ODA), which is generally provided as grants, loans and guarantees, and is therefore disbursed in advance of delivery.

Proponents of PbR argue that this approach is more likely to deliver the desired development objective, with less scope for waste and greater freedom and incentive for the beneficiary to innovate or achieve the desired objective at least cost. Possible criticisms include the need for recipients to obtain pre-financing, the risk of [[unintended consequences]], higher monitoring and verification costs, and the difficulty of setting the incentive at the optimum level (thereby leading to the risk of [[rent-seeking]] behavior).

'''Results-based aid''' is concerned with incentivizing national-level outcomes and involves the linking of ODA (e.g. from bilateral or multilateral development agencies to developing country governments) to verifiable results, such as performance against one or more outcome indicators, or the successful implementation of a government program. Possible outcomes might include number of children passing an exam, an improvement in the infant mortality rate, or the number of people with a defined improvement in access to energy. 

'''[https://energypedia.info/wiki/Results-Based_Financing Results-based financing]''' is concerned with the delivery of national or sub-national outputs, and could be used by developing country governments (national or local), public agencies, or development agencies as incentive for the provision of goods or services, create or expand markets, or stimulate innovation. Possible target outputs might include the number of vaccines administered, the number of teachers that are trained, the number of new electricity connections that are provided in a defined area. Results-based financing includes approaches such as [[Output-Based Aid]] (OBA).

Existing examples of PbR programs include the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid and Results-Based Financing for Health. However, interest in PBR in the international development sector is growing.&lt;ref name="ESMAP" /&gt; The UK [[Department for International Development]] is piloting Cash on Delivery Aid&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/codaid Center for Global Development, "Cash on Delivery: A New Approach to Foreign Aid"]&lt;/ref&gt; (a form of results-based aid) and results-based financing programs in a number of countries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120608130958/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/pilots-payments-results.pdf DFID, "DFID Pilots on Payment by Results"]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Bank]] has recently launched Program-for-Results (PforR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/12/15590386/new-instrument-advance-development-effectiveness-program-for-results-financing World Bank, "A new instrument to advance development effectiveness: program-for-results financing"]&lt;/ref&gt; a new results-based lending instrument, and the [[European Union|EU]] is exploring results-based approaches for the aid component of the [[Budget of the European Union|multi-annual financial framework]] from 2014.

'''"Putin. War"''' ({{lang-ru|Путин. Война}}) is a report based on materials prepared by the Russian opposition politician [[Boris Nemtsov]] about the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]]. Published on the website ''Putin. Itogi'' on 12 May 2015, it covers the preparations for the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] and the involvement of Russian troops in the [[war in Donbass]]. The report includes testimonials of Russian soldiers taken prisoner in Ukraine and photos of Russian military personnel who died in the hostilities.&lt;ref name=RFE-200/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT150512/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meduza150513/&gt;

==Authors==
[[Boris Nemtsov]] began working on the report at the end of January 2015. After [[Assassination of Boris Nemtsov|Nemtsov's assassination]], his close associate [[Ilya Yashin]] headed a team of opposition journalists and activists, who continued writing the report and prepared it for publication.&lt;ref name=RFE-friends/&gt;

[[File:2015-03-01 Шествие памяти Немцова L1520063 Путин — это война.jpg|300px|thumb|"Putin is war"]]

==Structure and content==
The [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of the report is a post by Boris Nemtsov in Facebook on 31 January 2015:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/boris.nemtsov/posts/758395224230080&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The task of the opposition today is education and truth.&lt;br /&gt;And the truth is that Putin is war and crisis.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The report consists of a preface, 11 chapters and a conclusion. It has 65 large-format pages with 46 color photographs and 8 charts.

Chapters:
#Why [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] needs this war
#Lies and propaganda
#How they took Crimea
#The Russian military in the east of Ukraine
#Volunteers or mercenaries?
#[[Cargo 200 (code name)|Cargo 200]]
#Vladimir Putin's Army Depot
#Who shot down the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Boeing]]
#Who rules the Donbass
#The humanitarian disaster
#What does the war with Ukraine cost?
Chapters cover the events from the beginning of [[Euromaidan]] when the [[Kremlin]] developed plans for the "annexation of Crimea" up to the start of 2015. The report includes information from relatives of Russian servicemen who died in Ukraine. The authors write that Putin's "[[Hybrid warfare|hybrid war]]" involves [[doublethink]], falsehoods and сowardliness, concluding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cowardly and despicable war unleashed by Putin will cost the country a lot. We will be paying for this adventure with the lives of our soldiers, economic crisis and political isolation.

We will pay with enmity from our long-time allies. No people are closer and more like kin to the Russians than the Ukrainians. These are our brothers - without any pathos -- and the war between [[Russians in Ukraine|Russians]] and Ukrainians in Donbass is impossible to characterize in any other way except as fratricide.

This war is the shame of our country. But the problem will not go away by itself. Putin must be stopped. And this can only be done by the Russian people themselves.

Let us stop this war together.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==English version==

Another key program is the annual Reaching Out LGBTQ MBA Club Leadership Summit, which brings together rising LGBTQ MBA club leaders from business schools around the globe to network, discuss issues they are facing and ideate on solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reachingoutmba.org/leadership-summit-2/2012-summit&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, the organization announced that it would be operating the Friendfactor MBA Challenge program and integrate it into its existing on-campus LGBT MBA club program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reachingoutmba.org/friendfactor-mba-ally-challenge-is-now-part-of-reaching-out/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual Reaching Out LGBT MBA &amp; Business Graduate Conference ==
Each year since 1999, the Reaching Out LGBTQ MBA &amp; Graduate Conference (referred to as the ROMBA Conference) has been held in a major American city, and has been organized by a team of current MBA students from institutions all over the USA.  The conference is planned and executed solely by unpaid volunteers each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2e6026aa-c1f4-11d9-866a-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1OYAmiZYg |title= Recruitment - Sexual orientation: Students reaches out to foster change |publisher=Ft.com |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the years, the conference size has grown dramatically, with recent years' attendance approaching or exceeding 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kitroeff |first=Natalie |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-03/some-openly-gay-mbas-go-back-into-the-closet-as-professionals |title=The Effort to Get Gay Professionals Out of the Closet, and Keep Them Out |publisher=Businesswekk.com |date=2014-10-03 |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference includes opportunities for attendees to network with peers, learn by attending the panel sessions and guest lectures, and explore career opportunities by connecting with sponsor companies in the career expo.  Each year over 90 companies, generally [[Fortune 500]] companies, return to sponsor the conference each year, and use the conference as an opportunity to recruit LGBTQ MBA talent in the career expo portion of the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/aug2006/bs2006089_3298_bs001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jia Lynn Yang, Fortune reporter |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/04/magazines/fortune/ReachingOut_conference.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2006120507 |title=Gay-friendly companies Reach Out to MBAs - Dec. 5, 2006 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2006-12-05 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;The 2018 Conference will be hosted in Minneapolis, Minnesota with special guest-speaker, RuPaul Andre Charles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21418">The '''right to disconnect''' is a proposed [[human right]] regarding the ability of people to disconnect from work and primarily not to engage in work-related electronic communications such as e-mails or messages during non-work hours.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staufenberg|first1=Jess|title=France may pass a law on the 'right to disconnect' from work emails at home|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-may-pass-a-law-on-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails-at-home-a6878571.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schofield|first1=Hugh|title=The plan to ban work emails out of hours|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36249647|website=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern working environment has been drastically changed by new communication and information technologies. The boundary between work life and home life has shrunk with the introduction of digital tools into employment. While digital tools bring flexibility and freedom to employees they also can create an absence of limits, leading to excessive interference in the private lives of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soulier-avocats.com/en/is-the-right-to-disconnect-about-to-become-an-effective-right-for-employees-in-france/|title=Is the right to disconnect about to become an effective right for employees in France? - Soulier AARPI|last=Ducorops-Prouvost|first=Emilie|date=December 2016|website=www.soulier-avocats.com|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason such a right is beneficial. Several countries, primarily in [[Europe]], have some form of the right to disconnect included in their law, while in some cases it is present in the policy of many large companies. On July 24, 2018, the Petition 1057 called for introduction of the right to disconnect or as it is called in French “Le droit à la déconnexion” in the Labour Law in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chd.lu/wps/portal/public/Accueil/TravailALaChambre/Petitions/RoleDesPetitions?action=doPetitionDetail&amp;id=1249|title=Petition 1057|last=|first=|date=|website=Chambre des députés du Grand Duché du Luxembourg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==

=== Origins ===
The right to disconnect emerged in [[France]] in a decision in the Labour Chamber of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]]. The decision on 2 October 2001 held that "the employee is under no obligation either to accept working at home or to bring there his files and working tools".&lt;ref&gt;Labor Chamber of the Cour de Cassation, October 2, 2001 n°99-42.727&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Supreme Court affirmed this decision and ruled that "the fact that [the employee] was not reachable on his cell phone outside working hours cannot be considered as misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;Labor Chamber of the Cour de Cassation, February 17, 2004 n°01-45.889&lt;/ref&gt;

=== El Khomri Law ===
The [[government of France]] passed the [[El Khomri law]] to reform working conditions for French people. Article 55 under Chapter II "Adapting the Labour Law to the Digital Age" (&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;''Adaptation du droit du travail à l'ère du numérique''&lt;/span&gt;) included a provision to amend the [[French labour law|French Labour Code]] to include the right to disconnect (''&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;le droit de la déconnexion&lt;/span&gt;)''. Article 55(1) amended Article L. 2242-8 of the Labour Code by adding a paragraph (7);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2016/8/8/ETSX1604461L/jo#JORFSCTA000032983228|title=LOI n° 2016-1088 du 8 août 2016 relative au travail, à la modernisation du dialogue social et à la sécurisation des parcours professionnels {{!}} Legifrance|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"(7) The procedures for the full exercise by the employee of his right to disconnect and the establishment by the company of mechanisms for regulating the use of digital tools, with a view to ensuring respect for rest periods and leave as well as personal and family life. Failing agreement, the employer shall draw up a charter, after consultation with the works council or, failing that, with the staff delegates. This charter defines these procedures for the exercise of the right to disconnect and furthermore provides for the implementation, for employees and management and management personnel, of training and awareness-raising activities on the reasonable use of digital tools."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;"7° Les modalités du plein exercice par le salarié de son droit à la déconnexion et la mise en place par l'entreprise de dispositifs de régulation de l'utilisation des outils numériques, en vue d'assurer le respect des temps de repos et de congé ainsi que de la vie personnelle et familiale. A défaut d'accord, l'employeur élabore une charte, après avis du comité d'entreprise ou, à défaut, des délégués du personnel. Cette charte définit ces modalités de l'exercice du droit à la déconnexion et prévoit en outre la mise en œuvre, à destination des salariés et du personnel d'encadrement et de direction, d'actions de formation et de sensibilisation à un usage raisonnable des outils numériques"&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt; As prescribed in Article 55(2), Article 55(1) entered into force on January 1, 2017.

=== Context ===
The government of France adopted the right into its Labour Code in response to a September 2015 report on the impact of digital technologies on labour which supported a right to "professional disconnection".&lt;ref name="Droit à la déconnexion"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/archives/archives-courantes/loi-travail-2016/les-principales-mesures-de-la-loi-travail/article/droit-a-la-deconnexion|title=Droit à la déconnexion|date=2017-05-31|work=Ministère du Travail|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was presented to the French Minister of Labour [[Myriam El Khomri]] after the previous minister sought information on the effect of digital transformation on Labour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/154000646.pdf|title=Report on Digital Transformation and Work Life|last=Mettling|first=Bruno|date=September 2015|website=|page=52|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended such a measure stating that a correct balance between work and private life is essential to allow digital transformation to have a positive effect on workers' quality of life and that knowing how to disconnect was a skill which needs to be supported by employers. The report identified cognitive and emotional overload which can lead to a sense of fatigue as a psycho-social risk of being constantly connected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The government viewed it necessary to adopt such a law to adapt to the changing nature of the workplace, recognizing that digital technologies have blurred the line between work and private lives. It viewed the introduction of the right to disconnect necessary for the health of French employees.&lt;ref name="Droit à la déconnexion"/&gt;

The introduction of this law followed a 2016 study that discovered that 37% of workers were using professional digital tools (e.g. work mobile phones) outside of work hours and that 62% of workers wanted more controls and rules to regulate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleas.fr/app/uploads/2016/10/CP-Eleas-Enqu%C3%AAte-Pratiques-num%C3%A9riques-2016.pdf|title=Digital Asset Practices in France in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===
The right to disconnect is applied to each company in its own way. The El Khomri Law introduces the right but does not define it, allowing companies to choose the most practical ways to implement the right taking into consideration the nature of the business (for example, whether it operates with countries in foreign time zones, or whether the employees work nights or in the weekend).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bersay-associes.com/en/2017-01/the-right-to-disconnect/|title=The right to disconnect {{!}} Bersay Associés|website=www.bersay-associes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For companies with more than 50 employees the right is to be included in their Mandatory Annual Negotiation (MAN) on gender equality and the nature of quality of life at work, that is already required by the El Khomri Law, by considering ways in which the use of digital tools can be regulated and the means to do this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the absence of this a "charter of good conduct" is to be negotiated with union representatives detailing the times that employees can disconnect from their digital tools, when they would not be expected to connected to their smartphones or laptops.  Companies with less than 50 employees are expected to release a document to their employees outlining the rules for their company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/key-measures-in-france-s-contested-labour-reform-1.2900757|title=Key measures in France's contested labour reform|date=2016-05-13|work=CTVNews|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right as it exists in the El Khomri Law does not extend to those independent workers who are part of online [[Crowdsourcing|crowdworking]] regimes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donini Forlivesi Rota Tullini|first=Annamaria Michele Anna Patrizia|date=2017|title=Janus and the trade union challenge of digital technology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1024258916688863#_i11|journal=Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research|volume=23 |issue=2|pages=207–223|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not provide any guidance on possible ways to manage the use of digital tools or ways to train or raise awareness among workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, while the new law imposes an obligation for large companies to negotiate there is no obligation to reach an agreement, therefore if no agreement is reached between company and employees the right cannot be applied and enforced. It is assumed that the obligation that applies to small companies, for employers to draw up a charter, would then apply. Again there is no penalty for companies who do not do this. Furthermore, such a charter has no legal value in France, unless it contains terms providing or sanctions against employees which allow it to be considered as an appendix to the internal rules of a company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soulier-avocats.com/en/is-the-right-to-disconnect-about-to-become-an-effective-right-for-employees-in-france/|title=Is the right to disconnect about to become an effective right for employees in France? - Soulier AARPI|last=Ducorps-Prouvost|first=Emilie|date=|website=www.soulier-avocats.com|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers who fail to include the right to disconnect in the MAN are liable to criminal prosecution for obstructing the exercise of union rights, punishable by 1 year in prison and a €3,750 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Article L.2243-2 of the French Labor Code&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As an example for other countries ===
It is likely that other [[European Union]] nations will follow the example of France and enact a similar law themselves. Outside of a formalized right it is likely that employees and unions could negotiate for similar provisions to apply the right to disconnect to their own workplace, resulting in the right becoming commonplace by human resource management best practice, industry practice, or contractual norms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Germany ==
While not having actual laws relating to the right to disconnect, [[Germany|German]] companies have a history of implementing policies to the same effect.

[[Volkswagen]] implemented a policy in 2011 stating that it would stop email servers from sending emails to the mobile phones of employees between 6pm and 7am. Other German companies such as [[Allianz]], Telekom, [[Bayer]] and [[Henkel]] all have similar policies in place to limit the amount of digital connection employees have after work hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalhrlaw.com/resources/anti-stress-legislation-in-germany--how-realistic-is-the-prospect|title=Anti-stress legislation in Germany – how realistic is the prospect? - Ius Laboris Knowledge Base|last=Verhoek|first=Corinna|date=30 September 2014|website=www.globalhrlaw.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Germany's employment ministry banned its managers from contacting staff after hours as part of a wider agreement on remote working. It was done in order to protect the mental health of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10276815/Out-of-hours-working-banned-by-German-labour-ministry.html|title=Out of hours working banned by German labour ministry|last=Vasagar|first=Jeevan|date=30 August 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, automobile company [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] introduced a software called "Mail on Holiday" that its employees could use to automatically delete incoming emails while they were on vacation. This was done to allow Daimler's employees the opportunity to get a break and come back to work refreshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3116424/daimler-vacation-email-out-of-office/|title=The most radical way to end vacation email overload ever|last=Gibson|first=Megan|website=Time|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German employment minister in 2014, [[Andrea Nahles]], sought to introduce "anti-stress legislation" in response to the rising levels of stress and mental health issues in Germany. Such legislation would ban companies from making contact with employees out of work hours. Nahles commissioned the [[Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to produce a report researching mental health in the work place and the viability of legislation to target it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/29/germany-anti-stress-law-ban-on-emails-out-of-office-hours|title=German minister calls for anti-stress law ban on emails out of office hours|last=Stuart|first=Keith|date=2014-08-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was completed and published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baua.de/EN/Service/Publications/Report/Mental-Health.html|title=BAuA  -  Publications - Mental Health in the Working World - Determining the current state of scientific evidence|last=publisher|website=www.baua.de|language=en|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==
The right to disconnect has recently entered [[Italy|Italian]] law through Senate Act no 2233-B "Measures to safeguard non-entrepreneurial self-employment and measures to facilitate flexible articulation in times and places of subordinate employment". Article 19(1) of the Act governs the implementation for an Agreement on Aggregate Work and includes some form of the right to disconnect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/17/DDLMESS/1022243/index.html|title=senato.it - Legislatura 17ª - Disegno di legge n. 2233-B|website=www.senato.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Agreement on Aggregate Work shall be stipulated in writing for the purpose of administrative and probative regularity and shall govern the performance of the work performed outside the premises of the company, including with regard to the forms of exercise of the executive power the employer and the tools used by the worker. ''The agreement also identifies the worker's rest periods as well as the technical and organizational measures necessary to ensure that the worker is disconnected from the technological equipment''." [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span lang="it" dir="ltr"&gt;''"L'accordo relativo alla modalità di lavoro agile è stipulato per iscritto ai fini della regolarità amministrativa e della prova, e disciplina l'esecuzione della prestazione lavorativa svolta all'esterno dei locali aziendali, anche con riguardo alle forme di esercizio del potere direttivo del datore di lavoro ed agli strumenti utilizzati dal lavoratore. L'accordo individua altresì i tempi di riposo del lavoratore nonché le misure tecniche e organizzative necessarie per assicurare la disconnessione del lavoratore dalle strumentazioni tecnologiche di lavoro."''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Philippines ==
House Bill 4721 was introduced to the [[Congress of the Philippines|Seventeenth Congress]] of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB04721.pdf|title=H.B 4721|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long title of the proposed Act is "An act granting employees the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications after work hours" and seeks to amend the Labour Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No.442).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1974/pd_442_1974.html|title=P.D. No. 442|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly it aims to make time spent engaging with work-related electronic tools outside of work hours come under the definition of 'hours worked' under Article 48, secondly it would insert Articles 48-A and 48-B which read;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Right to disconnect -- An employee shall not be reprimanded, punished, or otherwise subjected to disciplinary action if he or she disregards a work-related communication sent after work-hours, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy to be established by the employer as required in Article 84-B hereof"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Policy on after-hours use of technology -- It shall be the duty of every employer to establish the hours when employees are not supposed to send or answer work-related e-mails, texts, or calls. The employer shall determine the conditions and exemptions therefrom, subject to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of Labor and Employment may provide"&lt;/blockquote&gt;This bill has already begun to take effect. In February 2017 the Department of Labour and Employment in the Philippines stated that employees have a right to disconnect from work after hours by disregarding work-related communications without facing discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/workers-right-disconnect-dole/310057/|title=Workers have right to ‘disconnect’ - DOLE - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill has received the support of the General Alliance of Workers Association (GAWA), a labour group in the Philippines. GAWA particularly supports the amendment to Article 48 calling it undeclared labour. GAWA cited the dangers of constant connection as a reason why the bill should pass, referring to the risk of burning or physical and mental stress caused by inability to rest. Additionally they pointed out that employers would see benefits as their employees would be more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/business/2017/02/03/labor-group-supports-workers-right-disconnect-523687|title=Labor group supports workers’ ‘right to disconnect’|last=Nicavera|first=Erwin P.|date=2017-02-03|work=SunStar|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Links to existing international human rights ==
The right to disconnect shares similarities with several preexisting human rights. The most notable of these is the right to rest and leisure found in article 24 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ichrp.org/en/article_24_udhr|title=Article 24|website=www.ichrp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right explicitly places limitations on the amount of time people can work for, something that the right to disconnect takes further and places into the modern age. The right to disconnect also crosses into the article 23 of the UDHR, that everyone has the right to work and receive fair remuneration and to join trade unions to protect their interests.

The [[International Labour Organization]] is also a relevant source of measures and rights supplementary to the right to disconnect. A recent study endorsed by the ILO has affirmed the need for workers to be able to disconnect from technology in order to avoid the blurring of the lines between work life and personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_544108/lang--en/index.htm|title=New report highlights opportunities and challenges of expanding telework|date=2017-02-15|access-date=2017-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Duvall was born January 5, 1931, in [[San Diego, California]],&lt;ref name=people1984 /&gt; the son of Mildred Virginia ({{nee|Hart}}; 1901–c. 1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikitree.com/genealogy/Hart-Family-Tree-22|title=Mildred Virginia (Hart) Duvall|publisher=WikiTree|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amateur actress, and William Howard Duvall (1904–1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uboat.net/allies/commanders/4015.html|title=Allied Warship Commanders – William Howard Duvall, USN|publisher=UBoat|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Virginia]]-born [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] admiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roberts, Gary Boyd|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society | url = http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/special_guests/gary_boyd_roberts/gbr83.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121110802/http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/special_guests/gary_boyd_roberts/gbr83.asp | archivedate=2008-01-21 | title = A Third Set of Ten Hollywood Figures (or Groups Thereof), with a Coda on Two Directors|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | series = Saturday Morning News | network =[[CNN]] | title = The Novak Zone: Interview With Robert Duvall | airdate=2003-02-15 | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0302/15/smn.18.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has [[English people|English]], and smaller amounts of [[Belgian People|Belgian]], [[French Huguenot]], [[German People|German]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[German-speaking Swiss|Swiss-German]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000380/bio&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a relative of [[American Civil War]] General [[Robert E.

He recalled: "I was a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Navy brat]]. My father started at the Academy when he was 16, made [[Captain (naval)|captain]] at 39 and retired as a [[rear admiral]]." He attended [[Severn School]] in [[Severna Park, Maryland]], and [[The Principia]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He graduated, in 1953, from [[Principia College]] in [[Elsah, Illinois]], with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Drama]].&lt;ref name=people1984 /&gt;&lt;ref name=people1977 /&gt;

Duvall served in the [[United States Army]] for a brief period shortly after the [[Korean War]] (from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954) leaving the Army as [[private first class]].&lt;ref name=MilitaryRankDuvall/&gt; "That's led to some confusion in the press," he explained in 1984, "Some stories have me shooting it out with the [[Commies]] from a [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] over in Frozen Chosin. [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill|Pork Chop Hill]] stuff. Hell, I barely qualified with the [[M-1 rifle]] in [[basic training]]".&lt;ref name=people1984 /&gt; While stationed at [[Camp Gordon]] (later renamed [[Fort Gordon]]) in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedy ''[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]'' in nearby [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=people1977 /&gt;

In the winter of 1955, Duvall began studies at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=people1984 /&gt; under [[Sanford Meisner]], on the [[G.I. Bill]]. During his two years there, [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Gene Hackman]], and [[James Caan]] were among his classmates.&lt;ref name=people1984 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Current Biography July 1977 (The H.W.

==Career==

===Early career in theatre, television and film: 1952–1969===
Duvall began his professional acting career with the [[Gateway Playhouse]], an [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] summer theatre based in [[Bellport]], [[Long Island, New York]]. Arguably his stage debut was in its 1952 season when he played the Pilot in ''Laughter In The Stars'', an adaptation of ''[[The Little Prince]]'', at what was then the Gateway Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Program booklet for {{cite web | url = http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1952/1952_Playbill_LaughterInTheStars.pdf' | title = ''Laughter in the Stars'' | date = 1952 | publisher = [[Gateway Playhouse|Gateway Theatre]] | accessdate = December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year's absence when he was with the [[U.S. Army]] (1953–1954), he returned to Gateway in its 1955 summer season, playing: Eddie Davis in [[Ronald Alexander (playwright)|Ronald Alexander]]'s ''Time Out For Ginger'' (July 1955), Hal Carter in [[William Inge]]'s ''Picnic'' (July 1955), Charles Wilder in [[John Willard]]'s ''The Cat And The Canary'' (August 1955), Paris in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''The Crucible'' (August 1955), and John the Witchboy in William Berney and [[Howard Richardson (playwright)|Howard Richardson]]'s ''Dark of the Moon'' (September 1955). The playbill of ''Dark of the Moon'' indicated that he had portrayed the Witchboy before and that he will "repeat his famous portrayal" of this character for the 1955 season's revival of this play. For Gateway's 1956 season (his third season with the Gateway Players), he played the role of Max Halliday in [[Frederick Knott]]'s ''Dial M for Murder'' (July 1956), Virgil Blessing in Inge's ''Bus Stop'' (August 1956), and Clive Mortimer in [[John van Druten]]'s ''I Am a Camera'' (August 1956). The playbills for the 1956 season described him as "an audience favorite" in the last season and as having "appeared at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and studied acting with Sandy Meisner this past winter."

In its 1957 season, he appeared as Mr. Mayher in [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''Witness For The Prosecution'' (July 1957), as Hector in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Thieves' Carnival]]l'' (July 1957), and the role which he once described as the "catalyst of his career": Eddie Carbone in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''A View from the Bridge'' (from July 30 to August 3, 1957, and directed by [[Ulu Grosbard]], who was by then a regular director at the Gateway Theatre).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1952/1955/1956/1957. Retrieved January 2–3, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself attended one of Duvall's performances as Eddie and also during this performance he met important people that allowed him to, in two months, land a "spectacular lead" in the ''Naked City'' television series.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While appearing at the Gateway Theatre in the second half of the 1950s, he was also appearing at the Augusta Civic Theatre, the McLean Theatre in [[Virginia]] and the [[Arena Theatre]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The 1957 playbills also described him as "a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse" (indicating that he had completed his studies there by the summer of 1957), "a member of Sanford Meisner's professional workshop" and as having worked with Alvin Epstein, a [[mime]] and a member of [[Marcel Marceau]]'s company. By this time (also July 1957), his theatrical credits included performances as Jimmy in ''The Rainmaker'' and as Harvey Weems in [[Horton Foote]]'s ''The Midnight Caller''.&lt;ref name="Playbill_ThievesCarnival 1957"&gt;Duvall biography at program booklet for {{cite web |title = ''Thieves' Carnival'' | url = http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1957/1957_Playbill_ThievesCarnival.pdf | date = July 23–27, 1957| publisher = [[Gateway Playhouse|Gateway Theatre]] | accessdate = January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Playbill_WitnessFortheProsecution 1957"&gt;1957_Playbill_WitnessFortheProsecution.pdf at gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1957.

At the Neighborhood Playhouse, Meisner cast him in Tennessee Williams' ''Camino Real'' and the title role of Harvey Weems in Foote's [[one-act play]] ''The Midnight Caller''. The latter was already part of Duvall's performance credits by mid-July 1957.&lt;ref name="Playbill_ThievesCarnival 1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Playbill_WitnessFortheProsecution 1957"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horton Foote, ''Genesis of an American Playwright'' (Longview, Texas: Markham Press Fund of Baylor University Press, 2004): p. 103.

He made his [[off-Broadway]] debut at the [[Gate Theatre (New York City)|Gate Theater]] as Frank Gardner in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'' on June 25, 1958. This play closed three days later (June 28) after five performances. His other early off-Broadway credits include the role of Doug in the premiere of [[Michael Shurtleff]]'s ''[[Call Me By My Rightful Name]]'' on January 31, 1961, at One Sheridan Square and the role of Bob Smith in the premiere of [[William Snyder (playwright)|William Snyder]]'s ''[[The Days and Nights of BeeBee Fenstermaker]]'' on September 17, 1962, until June 9, 1963, at the [[Sheridan Square Playhouse]]. His most notable off-Broadway performance, for which he won an [[Obie Award]] in 1965 and which he considers his "[[Othello]]", was as Eddie Carbone (again) in Miller's ''[[A View From the Bridge]]'' at the [[Sheridan Square Playhouse]] from January 28, 1965, to December 11, 1966. It was directed again by Ulu Grosbard with Dustin Hoffman. On February 2, 1966, he made his [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] debut as Harry Roat, Jr in [[Frederick Knott]]'s ''[[Wait Until Dark]]'' at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]]. This played at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]] and [[George Abbott Theatre]] and closed on December 31, 1966, at the [[Music Box Theatre]].

In 1959, Duvall made his first television appearance on ''[[Armstrong Circle Theater]]'' in the episode "The Jailbreak". He appeared regularly on television as a guest actor during the 1960s, often in action, suspense, detective, or crime dramas. His appearances during this time include performances on ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[T.H.E. Cat]]'', ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'', ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'', and ''[[The Mod Squad]]''.

Duvall's screen debut was as [[Boo Radley]] in the critically acclaimed ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1962). He was cast in the film on the recommendation of [[screenwriter]] [[Horton Foote]], who met Duvall at Neighborhood Playhouse during a 1957 production of Foote's play, ''The Midnight Caller''. Foote, who collaborated with Duvall many more times over the course of their careers, said he believed Duvall had a particular love of common people and ability to infuse fascinating revelations into his roles. Foote has described Duvall as "our number one actor."&lt;ref name="Miracles"&gt;{{cite video |people = [[Bruce Beresford]] (actor), Robert Duvall (actor), [[Horton Foote]] (actor), Gary Hertz (director), [[Tess Harper]] (actress) |date = 2002-04-16 |title = Miracles &amp; Mercies |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium = Documentary |publisher = [[Blue Underground]] |location = [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]] |accessdate = 2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', Duvall appeared in a number of films during the 1960s, mostly in midsized parts, but also in a few larger supporting roles. Some of his more notable appearances include the role of Capt. Paul Cabot Winston in ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' (1963), Chiz in ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'' (1968), and Gordon in ''[[The Rain People]]''. Duvall had a small part as a cab driver who ferries McQueen around just before the chase scene in the film ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968). He was the notorious malefactor "Lucky" Ned Pepper in ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969), in which he engaged in a climactic shootout with [[John Wayne]]'s [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]] on horseback.

===Mid career: 1970–1989===
[[File:Robert Duvall Diane Lane 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|Duvall with [[Diane Lane]] at the 41st [[Emmy Awards]] in September 1989]]
Duvall became an important presence in American films beginning in the 1970s. He drew a considerable amount of attention in 1970 for his portrayal of the dastardly Major [[Frank Burns]] in the film ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' and for his portrayal of the title role in ''[[THX 1138]]'' in 1971 where he plays a fugitive trying to escape a society controlled by robots. His first major critical success came portraying [[Tom Hagen]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), the 1972 film earning him an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. In 1976, Duvall played supporting roles in ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (film)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' and as Dr. Watson in ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' opposite [[Nicol Williamson]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], and [[Laurence Olivier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0075194|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duvall received another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and won both a BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for his role as Lt. Colonel Kilgore in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979). His line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" from ''Apocalypse Now'' is regarded as [[cultural icon|iconic]] in cinema history. The full text is:

{{quote|You smell that? Do you smell that? [[Napalm]], son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. But the smell! You know – that gasoline smell... the whole hill! Smelled like... victory. (Pause) Some day this war is going to end...}}

Duvall received a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of detestable television executive Frank Hackett in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'' (1976) and garnered an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] in ''[[The Great Santini]]'' (1979) as the hard-boiled [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Lt. Col. "Bull" Meechum. The latter role was based on a Marine [[Naval aviator|aviator]], Colonel [[Donald Conroy]], the father of the book's author [[Pat Conroy]]. He also co-starred with Laurence Olivier and [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in ''[[The Betsy]]'' (1978) and portrayed United States President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the television miniseries ''[[Ike (TV miniseries)|Ike]]'' (1979).

Duvall continued to appear in films during the 1980s, including the roles of cynical sportswriter Max Mercy in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges in ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'' (1988). He won an Oscar for [[Academy award for best actor|Best Actor]] as [[country music|country western singer]] Mac Sledge in ''[[Tender Mercies]]'' (1983). Duvall was said{{by whom|date=December 2012}} to have written the music, but the actor said he wrote only a few "background, secondary songs." Duvall did do his own singing, insisting it be added to his contract that he sing the songs himself; Duvall said, "What's the point if you're not going to do your own [singing]? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that."&lt;ref name="Miracles" /&gt;

Actress [[Tess Harper]], who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director [[Bruce Beresford]], too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny."&lt;ref name="Miracles" /&gt; Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.&lt;ref name="Miracles" /&gt;

In 1989, Duvall appeared in the miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'' in the role of Captain [[Augustus "Gus" McCrae]], Texas Rangers (retired). He has considered this particular role to be his personal favorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Appleford|first=Steve|title=Robert Duvall goes back to Texas for his latest role|date=20 March 2014|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/20/entertainment/la-et-mn-robert-duvall-20140320|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a Golden Globe Award and earned an Emmy Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/robert-duvall|title=Robert Duvall|work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; nomination.

Shonibare was chairman of Amalgamated Press Ltd, [[Ikeja]], publishers of the now-defunct Daily Express and Daily Service. Prior to his death, he founded Shonny Investments which was in the process of developing Maryland Estate, he was also involved in a mobile film unit and a printing business.

'''''Salsola soda''''', more commonly known in English as '''opposite-leaved [[Salsola|saltwort]]''', '''oppositeleaf Russian thistle,''' or '''barilla plant,''' is a small (to 0.7 m tall), annual, succulent shrub that is native to the [[Mediterranean Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS |id=504989 |taxon=''Salsola soda'' L. |accessdate=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[halophyte]] (a salt-tolerant plant) that typically grows in coastal regions and can be irrigated with salt water.

The plant has great historical importance as a source of [[soda ash]], which was extracted from the ashes of ''Salsola soda'' and other [[saltwort]] plants.&lt;ref name="Clow52"&gt;
Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65–90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Soda ash is one of the [[alkali]] substances that are crucial in glassmaking and soapmaking. The famed clarity of 16th century [[cristallo|''cristallo'' glass]] from [[Venetian glass|Murano and Venice]] depended upon the purity of "[[Levant]]ine soda ash,"&lt;ref&gt;

Spain had an enormous 18th century industry that produced soda ash from the saltworts ([[:es:barrilla|''barrilla'']] in Spanish).&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;

Archived at WebCite from [http://www.ucm.es/info/antilia/revista/vol4-en/ant4-1-en.htm this original URL] on 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Soda ash is now known to be predominantly [[sodium carbonate]]. In 1807, Sir [[Humphry Davy]] isolated a metallic element from [[caustic soda]]; he named the new element "[[sodium]]" to indicate its relationship to "soda." Before soda was somewhat synonymous (in U.S. English) with soft drinks, the word referred to ''Salsola soda'' and other [[saltwort]] plants, and to "sodas" derived from soda ash.

While the era of farming for soda ash is long past, ''S. soda'' is still cultivated as a vegetable that enjoys considerable popularity in Italy and with gourmets around the world. Its common names in Italian include ''barba di frate'', ''agretti'', and ''liscari sativa'' (short: '''lischi''' or '''lischeri'''). Of its culinary value, [[Frances Mayes]] has written that "Spinach is the closest taste, but while ''agretti'' has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy of spring."&lt;ref&gt;

== Description ==
This annual, succulent plant can grow into small shrubs up to 0.7 m tall (sometimes called subshrubs). It has fleshy green leaves with either green or red stems. The tiny flowers develop from [[inflorescence]]s that grow out of the base of the leaves near the stem.&lt;ref&gt;

== Soda ash and the biology of sodium accumulation ==
{{see also|Soda ash|Halophyte}}
The ashes obtained by the burning of ''S. soda'' can be refined to make a product called soda ash,&lt;ref name="Clow52" /&gt; which is one of the [[alkali]] materials essential to making [[soda-lime glass]], [[soap]], and many other products. The principal active ingredient is [[sodium carbonate]], with which the term "soda ash" is now nearly synonymous. The processed ashes of ''S. soda'' contain as much as 30% sodium carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;
Barker, T. C., Dickinson, R., and Hardie, D. W. F. (1956).
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550954 "The Origins of the Synthetic Alkali Industry in Britain,"] ''[[Economica]], New Series'', Vol. 23, No. 90. (May, 1956), pp. 158–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

A high concentration of sodium carbonate in the ashes of ''S. soda'' occurs if the plant is grown in highly saline soils (i.e. in soils with a high concentration of sodium chloride), so that the plant's tissues contain a fairly high concentration of sodium ions. ''S. soda'' can be irrigated with sea water, which contains about 40 g/l of dissolved sodium chloride and other salts. When these sodium-rich plants are burned, the carbon dioxide that is produced presumably reacts with this sodium to form sodium carbonate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

It is surprising to find a higher concentration of sodium than of potassium in plant tissues; the former element is usually toxic, and the latter element is essential, to the metabolic processes of plants. Thus, most plants, and especially most crop plants, are "[[glycophyte]]s", and suffer damage when planted in saline soils.&lt;ref&gt;
Glenn, Edward P., Brown, J. Jed, and Blumwald, Eduardo (1999). "Salt Tolerance and Crop Potential of Halophytes," ''Critical Review in Plant Sciences,'' Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 227–255. {{doi|10.1080/07352689991309207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Xiong, Liming and Zhu, Jian-Kang (2002). (September 30, 2002) "[http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1199%2Ftab.0048 Salt Tolerance]," in Somerville, C. R. and Meyerowitz, E. M., eds, ''The Arabidopsis Book.'' American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD. {{doi|10.1199/tab.0048}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''S. soda'', and the other plants that were cultivated for soda ash, are "[[halophytes]]" that tolerate much more saline soils than do glycophytes, and that can thrive with much larger densities of sodium in their tissues than can glycophytes.

The biochemical processes within the cells of halophytes are typically as sensitive to sodium as are the processes in glycophytes. Sodium ions from a plant's soil or irrigation water are toxic primarily because they interfere with biochemical processes within a plant's cells that require [[potassium]], which is a chemically similar [[alkali metal]] element.&lt;ref name="Tester"&gt;
Tester, Mark and Davenport, Romola (2003). "Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tolerance and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Transport in Higher Plants," [http://www.aob.oupjournals.org ''Annals of Botany''] '''91''': 503-527. {{doi|10.1093/aob/mcg058}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cell of a [[halophyte]] such as ''S. soda'' has a molecular transport mechanism that sequesters sodium ions into a compartment within the [[plant cell]] called a "[[Vacuole#Plants|vacuole]]." The vacuole of a plant cell can occupy 80% of the cell's volume; most of a halophyte plant cell's sodium can be sequestered in the vacuole, leaving the rest of the cell with a tolerable ratio of sodium to potassium ions.

In addition to ''S. soda'', soda ash has also been produced from the ashes of ''[[Salsola kali]]'' (another [[saltwort]] plant), of [[glasswort]] plants, and of [[kelp]], a type of seaweed. The sodium carbonate, which is water-soluble, is "[[wikt:lixiviate|lixiviated]]" from the ashes (extracted with water), and the resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished soda ash product. A very similar process is used to obtain [[potash]] (mainly [[potassium carbonate]]) from the ashes of hardwood trees. Because halophytes must also have potassium ions in their tissues, even the best soda ash derived from them also contains some potash (potassium carbonate), as was known by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Clow52" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Porcher, Francis Peyre (1863). ''Resources of the Southern Fields and Forests, Medical, Economical, and Agricultural. Being also a Medical Botany of the Confederate States; with Practical Information on the Useful Properties of the Trees, Plants, and Shrubs,'' (Evans and Cogswell, Charleston), p. 133. Online version at http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/porcher/porcher.html (retrieved November 28, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants were a very important source of soda ash until the early 19th century. In the 18th century, Spain had an enormous industry producing ''[[barilla]]'' (one type of plant-derived soda ash) from saltwort plants.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt; Similarly, [[Scotland]] had a large 18th-century industry producing soda ash from kelp; this industry was so lucrative that it led to overpopulation in the [[Western Isles]] of Scotland, and one estimate is that 100,000 people were occupied with "kelping" during the summer months.&lt;ref name="Clow52" /&gt; The commercialization of the [[Leblanc process]] for synthesizing sodium carbonate (from salt, [[limestone]], and [[sulfuric acid]]) brought an end to the era of farming for soda ash in the first half of the 19th century.

== Cultivation and culinary uses ==
The Italian name ''agretti'' is commonly used in English to refer to the edible leaves of ''S. soda''; ''barba di frate'' (or friar's beard) is the most common of the Italian names. This plant is not a summer green and should be started early indoors or in autumn. The seed is notorious for poor [[germination]] at about 30 to 40% standard, much like [[rosemary]]. Though the plant is often grown in saltwater-irrigated land in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], it will grow without salt water. ''S. soda'' is harvested in bunches when small, or cropped regularly to encourage new growth when mature. It is most commonly boiled and eaten as a [[leafy vegetable]]; the recommendation is to cook it in boiling water until the leaves soften, and to serve while some bite (crunch) remains (much like [[Glasswort#Culinary|samphire]]). It can also be eaten raw; it is said to "taste grassy and slightly salty with a pleasant, crunchy texture." &lt;ref&gt;Lennartson, Margi (2005). ''Organic Vegetable Production'' (The Crowood Press, Ltd, ), p. 247. {{ISBN|1-86126-788-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''S. soda'' is sometimes confused with a plant known in Japan as ''okahijiki'' (land seaweed), which is actually the species ''S. komarovi''. The harvested leaves of the two species have a similar appearance.

== Phytoremediation ==
''S. soda'' has also been studied as a [[bioremediation]] "biodesalinating companion plant" for crops such as tomatoes and peppers when they are grown in saline soils.&lt;ref&gt;
Colla, G., Rouphael, Y., Fallovo, C., and Cardarelli, M. (2006). "Use of ''Salsola soda'' as a companion plant to improve greenhouse pepper (''Capsicum annuum'') performance under saline conditions," ''New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science'', Vol. 34: 283 - 290. Online abstract at http://www.rsnz.org/publish/nzjchs/2006/039.php (retrieved November 28, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Salsola soda'' extracts enough sodium from the soil to improve the growth of the crop plant, and better crop yields result despite the competition of the two plants for the remaining minerals from the soil.

The '''Singer Building''' or '''Singer Tower''', at [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]'s [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], was a 47-story office building completed in 1908 as the headquarters of the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ripley |first=Charles M. |date=October 1907 |title=A Building Forty-Seven Stories High |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIV |issue= |pages=9459–9461 |accessdate=2009-07-10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sojNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA9459}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the [[Skyscraper#History of the tallest skyscrapers|tallest building in the world]] from 1908 to 1909. It was torn down in 1968, together with the adjacent [[City Investing Building]], and is now the site of [[One Liberty Plaza]]. When it was razed, it became the [[List of tallest voluntarily demolished buildings|tallest building ever to be demolished]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20535821 |title = How do you demolish a skyscraper? |author = Jon Kelly |publisher = BBC |date = 6 December 2012 |work = BBC News Magazine |accessdate= 12 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the third-tallest building ever to be destroyed (after the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers) and the tallest to be purposely demolished by its owner.

==History==
===Construction and design===
The building was commissioned by [[Frederick Gilbert Bourne|Frederick Bourne]], the head of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. He hired architect [[Ernest Flagg]], who was an early exponent of the [[Beaux arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architectural style.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2005/01/02/realestate/02scap.html|title=Streetscapes: Once the Tallest Building, but Since 1967 a Ghost|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=2 January 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flagg had also designed the company's previous headquarters at 561 Broadway between Prince and [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring]] Streets—in what is now the [[SoHo]] neighborhood—which was referred to as the "Little Singer Building" after the new building was erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-97"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/29/realestate/style-standard-for-early-steel-framed-skyscraper.html?scp=896&amp;sq=corning&amp;st=nyt|title=Style Standard for Early Steel-Framed Skyscraper|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=29 June 1997|work=The New York Times|page=7|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans and working drawings were prepared by [[George W. Conable]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7335|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Jamaica Chamber of Commerce Building|date=April 1983|accessdate=2011-01-16|author=Larry E. Gobrecht|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GpIFGIXR?url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7335|archivedate=2013-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagg believed that buildings more than 10 or 15 stories high should be set back from the street, with the tower occupying only a quarter of the lot.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; The 12-story base of the building filled an entire blockfront, while the tower above was relatively narrow.  The tower floors were squares 65&amp;nbsp;feet (20&amp;nbsp;m) on a side.

''[[New York Times]]'' architectural critic [[Christopher Gray]] wrote in 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The lobby had the quality of "celestial radiance" seen in world's-fair and exposition architecture of the period, as the author Mardges Bacon described it in her 1986 monograph "Ernest Flagg" (Architectural History Foundation, MIT Press). A forest of marble columns rose high to a series of multiple small domes of delicate plasterwork, and Flagg trimmed the columns with bronze beading. A series of large bronze medallions placed at the top of the columns were alternately rendered in the monogram of the Singer company and, quite inventively, as a huge needle, thread and bobbin.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At {{Convert|612|ft|m}} tall, the Singer Building was the tallest office building in the world from its completion in 1908 until the completion in 1909 of the {{convert|700|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower]] at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and [[Madison Avenue]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

===Early history and tenants===
As of November 1921, [[Catham and Phenix National Bank]] had its main office in the Singer Building.&lt;ref name=co-merger&gt;{{Citation

===Later history and demolition===
In 1961, Singer sold the building and subsequently moved to [[Rockefeller Center]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fried"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10710F6345F1A718DDDAB0A94D0405B878AF1D3|title=Landmark on Lower Broadway to Go|last=Fried|first=Joseph P.|date=Aug 22, 1967|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was then acquired by real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]], who sought unsuccessfully for the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to move there. In 1964, [[United States Steel]] acquired the building, along with the neighboring [[City Investing Building]], for demolition. By the 1960s, the building was uneconomical because of its small interior dimensions. The tower portion of the building contained only {{convert|4200|sqft|m2}} per floor, compared with {{convert|37000|sqft|m2}} per floor of the building that replaced it, the U.S. Steel Building (currently known as [[One Liberty Plaza]]).&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

Although New York had a newly created [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|Landmarks Preservation Commission]] by the time demolition commenced in 1967, and the Singer Building was considered to be one of the most iconic buildings in the city, it did not receive landmark designation, which would have prevented it from being torn down. Alan Burnham, executive director of the commission, said in August 1967 that if the building were to have been made a landmark, the city would have to either find a buyer for it or acquire it. Demolition commenced in August 1967 and was completed the following year. At the time, it was the tallest building ever to be destroyed until the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], when the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] one block over collapsed. The Singer Building is currently the third-tallest building to be destroyed but is still the tallest building whose razing was anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">'''Sorin Ovidiu Vîntu''' ({{IPA-ro|soˈrin oˈvidju ˈvɨntu}}; 23 November 1955, [[Bucharest]]) is a Romanian businessman and owner of the [[Realitatea-Caţavencu]] media company. In 2008 he was considered the 5th richest man in [[Romania]] with an estimated [[net worth]] between 800 and 850 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.wall-street.ro/articol/Marketing-PR/50406/Cum-arata-topul-celor-mai-bogati-miliardari-din-Romania.html Cum arata topul celor mai bogati miliardari din Romania]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2009, during a TV interview on [[B1 TV]], president [[Traian Băsescu]] accused Vântu of tax evasion by allegedly not paying 60 million euros worth of [[Value Added Tax]]. Vântu later denied the accusation, and sued Băsescu for [[libel]], asking for 1 million euros in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/social/sorin-ovidiu-vantu-l-a-dat-in-judecata-pe-traian-basescu-4627565 Sorin Ovidiu Vântu l-a dat în judecată pe Traian Băsescu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vântu was sentenced to two years in prison in 2005 for using some false documents to gain majority shares in the Investment and Development Bank (BID), which went bankrupt in 2002. Later the [[Bucharest Court of Appeals]] ordered by final decision the discontinuation of the trial finding that the charges passed their [[statute of limitations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/english/statute-of-limitations-rids-romanian-businessman-s-o-vantu-of-forgery-charges-5017600 |title=Statute Of Limitations Rids Romanian Businessman S.O.

In September 2010 he was briefly arrested, being accused of having helped [[Nicolae Popa (businessman)|Nicolae Popa]], the former CEO of BID.

On February 21, 2016, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for a ponzi scheme. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-review.eu/news/sorin-ovidiu-vintu-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-prison-for-ponzi-scheme-fund-fni-130993 Home » News » Sorin Ovidiu Vintu sentenced to eight years in prison for ponzi scheme fund FNI Sorin Ovidiu Vintu sentenced to eight years in prison for ponzi scheme fund FNI], Georgiana Bendre, ''Business Review''.

'''Spring Street''' is a street in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], which runs west–east, through the neighborhoods of [[Hudson Square]], [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]], and [[Nolita]].  It runs parallel to and between Dominick, [[Broome Street|Broome]], and [[Kenmare Street]]s (to the south), and Vandam and Prince Streets (to the north).&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Spring+Street,+New+York,+NY&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.72225,-73.996654&amp;spn=0.017498,0.042272&amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;sspn=0.560155,1.352692&amp;oq=Spring+S&amp;hnear=Spring+St,+New+York&amp;t=m&amp;z=15 "Spring Street"] on [[Google Maps]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nsrosfxk90C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22spring+street%22+%22manhattan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=37kOUanEH8m20QHE8YD4CA&amp;ved=0CMEBEOgBMBo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spring%20street%22%20%22manhattan%22&amp;f=false |title=The Feder Guide to Where to Park Your Car in Manhattan (and Where Not to Park It!) |author=Feder, Erik |publisher=Rhythmo Productions |year=2005 |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The street's addresses begin from the [[Bowery]] and run ascending to Spring Street's end at [[West Street]], which runs along the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/?z=8&amp;p=985889,202030&amp;c=GISBasic&amp;s=a:1,SPRING+STREET,MANHATTAN "1 Spring Street"] on the New York City Geographic Information System map&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/?z=8&amp;p=981349,203707&amp;c=GISBasic&amp;s=a:350,SPRING+STREET,MANHATTAN "350 Spring Street"] on the New York City Geographic Information System map&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lispenards meadow Broadway and Spring A Anderson 1785.gif|thumb|left|375px|Lispenard's Meadow in 1785, viewed from what is now the northeast corner of Spring Street and Broadway]]

[[Aaron Burr]]'s estate, Richmond Hill, was located in the area in the 1790s. Burr dammed [[Minetta Creek]] to create an ornamental pool by his estate's main gate, which was located near where Spring Street, [[MacDougal Street]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] come together.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.325&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, what would become Spring Street was the only street through the area, which was still rural, hilly and wooded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/arch_reports/1139.pdf |author=Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York |title=ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE SPRING STREET PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CEMETERY; Appendix A: New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner – Report of Findings|publisher= |date=February 14, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1805, the street was ordered widened to 65 feet by the [[New York City Council|Common Council]] of the City of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/minutesofcommonc04newy/minutesofcommonc04newy_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Minutes of the Common Council of the City of New York, 1784–1831" |author=Common Council of the City of New York |publisher=Archive.org |date=May 27, 1805 |accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, anti-black [[Race riot#Nativist Period 1700s-1860|race rioters]], primarily [[Irish American#18th to mid-19th century|Irish immigrants]], broke into the Spring Street Presbyterian Church, the home church of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Henry G. Ludlow|Dr. Henry G. Ludlow]].  It was at the time located at 250 Spring Street between [[Varick Street]] and Sixth Avenue, where it had been established in 1811. The rioters caused extensive damage to the church's organ, pews and galleries. Two years after the riot, in 1836, a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] structure was completed, replacing the old church. It stood on the site until the 1960s.  In the early 20th century, the church served an impoverished community in which, according to the pastor, "Much of the neighborhood was lost in a kind of sodden apathy to which drunken quarrels brought release."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.558&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite fromatoz}}, p.264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite fednyc}}, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The corner of Spring Street and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] was the location of the [[St. Nicholas Hotel (New York City)|St. Nicholas Hotel]], a six-story, marble-faced, 600-room luxury establishment that was designed by either [[J. B. Snook]] or [[Griffith Thomas]],&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt; and was completed in 1853. It was equipped with the newest technological conveniences, such as [[central heating]], hot running water, and a [[telegraph]] office in the lobby.  The interior of the hotel featured [[frescoes]] on the ceiling, [[gas light]] [[chandelier]]s and walnut [[wainscotting]]. The opulence of the hotel was such that one visitor described a stay there as: "like an introduction to the palace of some Eastern prince."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.671&lt;/ref&gt;  The building took up the full block between Spring and Broome Streets; only two small segments survive.&lt;ref name=desrep&gt;[[New York Landmarks Preservation Commission]] [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/SoHo_HD.pdf "NYCLPC SoHo – Cast-Iron Historic District Designation Report"] (August 14, 1873) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White et al., p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:521-523 Broadway St. Nicholas Hotel.jpg|"521–523 Broadway St. Nicholas Hotel"]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

*'''[[Wooster on Spring|11 Spring Street]]''', a former stable and [[carriage house]] built in 1888, was once a noted magnet for [[graffiti]] artists, who covered the exterior of the building with their artwork.  When the building was purchased for conversion into condominiums, the developers, in collaboration with the [[Wooster Collective]], mounted a show inside the building, inviting well-known graffitists – many of whom had work on the outside – to cover the entire five floors of the building's interior.  The show opened in December 2006 for a few days, before work on the conversion began and the artwork was covered over or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/arts/design/14graf.html?_r=0 "Last Hurrah for Street Art, as Canvas Goes Condo"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (December 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its days as a canvas for graffiti, the stable had been the home of [[IBM]] employee John Simpson for 30 years.

'''''The Strangest Secret''''' was a 1957 spoken word record by [[Earl Nightingale]] which sold over one million copies and received the first Gold Record for the spoken word,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Earl+Nightingale|title=Earl Nightingale — Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=Last.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped launch the fields of business motivation and audio publishing. It was later adapted into print and video forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awaken.com/2013/01/earl-nightingale/|title=Earl Nightingale - Awaken|website=www.awaken.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Earl-Nightingale-The-Strangest-Secret/release/10831837|title=Earl Nightingale - The Strangest Secret|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In 1950 [[Earl Nightingale]] was inspired by the words "we become what we think about" in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book [[Think and Grow Rich]] around the same time he bought an insurance agency. He provided weekly motivational speeches to the agency's sales staff. In 1956, he recorded a motivational speech to be played while he was on vacation. Nightingale's employees spread word of the speech, and demand for the recording grew so large that he and friend Lloyd Conant formed the Nightingale-Conant Corporation to manage sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.success.com/article/earl-nightingales-greatest-discovery|title=Earl Nightingale's Greatest Discovery|date=30 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nightingale.com/authors/earl-nightingale.html|title=Earl Nightingale|website=www.nightingale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3402848/mod_resource/content/1/16Earl_Nightingale_The+Strangest+Secret-Nightingale.pdf|title=Moodle USP: e-Disciplinas|first=Codely|last=Tecnologia|website=edisciplinas.usp.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlnightingale.com/EarlNightingale___Audio.html|title=About Earl Nightingale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wall Street Journal''''' is a U.S. business-focused, English-language international [[daily newspaper]] based in New York City. The ''Journal'', along with its [[The Wall Street Journal Asia|Asia]]n and [[The Wall Street Journal Europe|Europe]]an editions, is published six days a week by [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], a division of [[News Corp]]. The newspaper is published in the [[broadsheet]] format and online. The ''Journal'' has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889, by [[Charles Dow]], [[Edward Jones (statistician)|Edward Jones]], and [[Charles Bergstresser]].

''The Wall Street Journal'' is the largest [[List of newspapers in the United States by circulation|newspaper in the United States by circulation]]. According to News Corp, in its June 2017 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the ''Journal'' had a circulation of about 2.277{{nbsp}}million copies (including nearly 1,270,000 digital subscriptions) {{as of|2017|06|lc=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564708/000119312517257248/d412501d10k.htm|title=Form 10-K|website=www.sec.gov|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s 1.7{{nbsp}}million. The newspaper, which has won 37 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s through 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dowjones.com/products/wsj/|title=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=dowjones.com|accessdate=August 28, 2018|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/|title=The Pulitzer Prizes – What's New|publisher=pulitzer.org|accessdate=April 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224184433/http://www.pulitzer.org/|archivedate=February 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; derives its name from [[Wall Street]] in the heart of the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]]. 

The ''Journal'' also publishes the luxury news and lifestyle magazine ''[[WSJ.|WSJ]],'' which was originally launched as a quarterly but expanded to 12 issues as of 2014. An online version was launched in 1996, which has been accessible only to subscribers since it began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=XnORAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=The+Wall+Street+Journal+online+version+since+1996&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c5tYGsy-51&amp;sig=NXUJnAvvZ93PvHlPdxxQhcVKFv4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi05-WtlerZAhWI_aQKHXNdBcMQ6AEIjgEwEQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal%20online%20version%20since%201996&amp;f=false|title=Online News and the Public|last=Salwen|first=Michael B.|last2=Garrison|first2=Bruce|last3=Driscoll|first3=Paul D.|date=2004-12-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135616793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:The Wall Street Journal first issue.jpg|thumb|left|Front page of the first issue of ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 8, 1889]]

The first products of Dow Jones &amp; Company, the publisher of the ''Journal'', were brief news bulletins, nick-named "flimsies", hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the [[stock exchange]] in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the ''Customers' Afternoon Letter''. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into ''The Wall Street Journal'', which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones News Service via telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., [http://www.dowjones.com/TheCompany/History/History.htm "Dow Jones History – The Late 1800s"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807214105/http://www.dowjones.com/TheCompany/History/History.htm |date=August 7, 2006 }}, Retrieved July 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, The "[[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]" was officially launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In 1899, the ''Journal''{{'s}} Review &amp; Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.

Journalist [[Clarence Barron]] purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of [[business journalism]]. In 1921, [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]], the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.&lt;ref name="Crossen"&gt;Crossen, Cynthia. "[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118591182345183718.html It All Began in the Basement of a Candy Store] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007033228/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118591182345183718.html |date=October 7, 2008 }}", ''The Wall Street Journal'' (New York), p. B1, August 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron died in 1928, a year before [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]], the stock market crash that greatly affected the [[Great Depression]] in the United States. Barron's descendants, the [[Bancroft family]], would continue to control the company until 2007.&lt;ref name="Crossen"/&gt;

The ''Journal'' took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. [[Bernard Kilgore]] was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the ''Journal''. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its "What's News" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1{{nbsp}}million at the time of Kilgore's death in 1967. Under Kilgore, in [[1947 Pulitzer Prize|1947]], the paper won its first [[Pulitzer Prize]] for William Henry Grimes's [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing|editorials]].&lt;ref name="Crossen"/&gt;

In 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States that ultimately put journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to "Dow Jones Local Media Group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowjoneslmg.com/|title=Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.|publisher=Local Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including "[[Factiva]]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]'', the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, [[MarketWatch]], and "WSJ Weekend Edition". In 2007, [[News Corp.]] acquired Dow Jones. ''[[WSJ.]]'', a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto090320082104328499|title=WSJ magazine targets upscale market|date=September 3, 2008|work=[[Financial Times]]|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929154941/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto090320082104328499|archivedate=September 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet expansion===
{{Further|OpinionJournal.com}}
A complement to the print newspaper, ''The Wall Street Journal Online'', was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stulberg|first1=Ariel|title=Testing news paywalls: Which are leaky, and which are airtight?|url=https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/news-paywalls-new-york-times-wall-street-journal.php|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the ''Journal''{{'s}} print and online subscribers together in [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]] statements.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wall Street Journal Announces New Integrated Print and Online Sales and Marketing Initiatives". Press release. November 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers.&lt;ref name="Crossen"/&gt; Since then, online subscribership has fallen, due in part to rising subscription costs, and was reported at 400,000 in March 2010.&lt;ref name="Plambeck"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|last=Plambeck|first=Joseph|date=April 26, 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224052255/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html|archivedate=February 24, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, an annual subscription to the online edition of ''The Wall Street Journal'' cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://subscribe.wsj.com |title=Subscribing to the Wall Street Journal |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 17, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114212045/https://subscribe.wsj.com/ |archivedate=November 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vladimir Putin 11 February 2002-1.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] with ''Journal'' correspondent [[Karen Elliott House]] in 2002]]

On November 30, 2004, [[Oasys Mobile]] and ''The Wall Street Journal'' released an app that would allow users to access content from the ''Wall Street Journal Online'' via their mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=131111&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=807942&amp;highlight=|title=Oasys Mobile, Inc.

Many of ''The Wall Street Journal'' news stories are available through free online newspapers that subscribe to the Dow Jones [[syndicate]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Pulitzer Prize–winning stories from 1995 are available free on the Pulitzer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzer.org/|title=The Pulitzer Prizes – What's New|publisher=pulitzer.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309223152/http://pulitzer.org/|archivedate=March 9, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; web site.

In September 2005, the ''Journal'' launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.&lt;ref name="Crossen"/&gt;

In 2005, the ''Journal'' reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1{{nbsp}}million, and an average age of 55.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Bill. "[http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=89351 The Wall Street Journal Weekend Edition: Expectations, Surprises, Disappointments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816134815/http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=89351 |date=August 16, 2006 }}". [[Poynter Institute|Poynter Online]], September 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the ''Journal'' launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wray|first=Richard|title=How the word on Wall Street will spread around the world|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=UK|date=February 1, 2007|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2003063,00.html|accessdate=February 3, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203082414/http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0%2C%2C2003063%2C00.html|archivedate=February 3, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design changes===
The nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Punctuation Nerds Stopped by Obama Slogan, 'Forward.'|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444840104577553020326811222.html|accessdate=October 30, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 31, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030102036/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444840104577553020326811222.html|archivedate=October 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2006, the ''Journal'' included advertising on its front page for the first time. This followed the introduction of front-page advertising on the European and Asian editions in late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/060718/102326.html Wall Street Journal Introduces New Front Page Advertising Opportunity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814030343/http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/060718/102326.html |date=August 14, 2006 }}". Press release, July 18, 2006. Retrieved August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century—always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, "What's News" digest in the second and third, the "A-hed" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for [[headline]]) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.wsj.com/college/guidedtour/pageone.html WSJ.com Guided Tour: Page One], accessed August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; – the paper in 2007 decreased its [[broadsheet]] width from 15 to 12{{nbsp}}inches while keeping the length at 22{{frac|3|4}}{{nbsp}}inches, to save [[newsprint]] costs. News design consultant [[Mario García (designer)|Mario Garcia]] collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18{{nbsp}}million a year in newsprint costs across all ''The Wall Street Journal'' papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahrens |first=Frank |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101551.html |title=Wall Street Journal To Narrow Its Pages |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 12, 2005 |accessdate=August 19, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724120700/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101551.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the "A-hed" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).

The paper still{{when|date=January 2018}} uses ink dot drawings called [[hedcut]]s, introduced in 1979 and originally created by [[Kevin Sprouls]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/journal/ "Picturing Business in America"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105024706/http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/journal/ |date=November 5, 2005 }}, [[Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery]], Retrieved August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. The ''Journal'' still heavily employs the use of [[caricatures]], notably those of [[Ken Fallin]], such as when [[Peggy Noonan]] memorialized then-recently deceased newsman [[Tim Russert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noonan|first=Peggy|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121390975307189781.html|title=Tim Russert WSJ drawing|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926050219/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121390975307189781.html|archivedate=September 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Biz&gt;[http://www.bizbash.com/orlando/content/editorial/12186_caricaturist_captures_the_corporate_market.php Caricaturist Captures the Corporate Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924092509/http://www.bizbash.com/orlando/content/editorial/12186_caricaturist_captures_the_corporate_market.php |date=September 24, 2009 }}, Biz Bash Orlando, August 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more "lifestyle" sections.

===News Corporation and News Corp===
On May 2, 2007, [[News Corporation]] made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The [[Bancroft family]], which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.&lt;ref&gt;For background and sequel, see: Ellison, Sarah, ''War at the Wall Street Journal: Inside the Struggle To Control an American Business Empire'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-547-15243-1}} (Also published as: ''War at The Wall Street Journal: How Rupert Murdoch Bought an American Icon", Sydney, Text Publishing, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6923474.stm|title=Murdoch wins Control of Dow Jones|publisher=BBC|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=August 1, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805015221/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6923474.stm|archivedate=August 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US$5{{nbsp}}billion sale added ''The Wall Street Journal'' to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s news empire, which already included [[Fox News Channel]], [[Fox Business Network|financial network unit]] and London's ''[[The Times]]'', and locally within New York, the ''[[New York Post]]'', along with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[flagship station]] [[WNYW]] (Channel 5) and [[MyNetworkTV]] flagship [[WWOR-TV|WWOR]] (Channel 9).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20032918/|title=Murdoch clinches deal for publisher of Journal|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=August 9, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825172305/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20032918/|archivedate=August 25, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial page column, publisher [[L.&amp;nbsp;Gordon Crovitz]] said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the ''Journal''{{'}}s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent:&lt;ref name="Crovitz"&gt;[[L.&amp;nbsp;Gordon Crovitz]], "A Report to Our Readers". ''The Wall Street Journal'' (New York), page A14, August 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor [[Marcus Brauchli]] resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120949530982953531.html |title=WSJ Editor's Resignation Is Criticized By Committee |author=Steve Stecklow |date=April 30, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=September 27, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918015011/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120949530982953531.html |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 ''Journal'' article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long "expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations". Former ''[[The Times|Times]]'' assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when "Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor [[Harold Evans]]. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery." Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stecklow, Aaron O. Patrick, Martin Peers, and Andrew Higgins, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118100557923424501.html "Calling the shots: In Murdoch's career, a hand in the news; his aggressive style can blur boundaries; 'Buck stops with me'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213115324/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118100557923424501.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}, ''Wall Street Journal'', June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'' found evidence that the ''Journal'' had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the ''Journal'' to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the ''Journal'' agreed to run "articles" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.&lt;ref name="guardian_circulation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/12/wall-street-journal-andrew-langhoff|title=Wall Street Journal circulation scam claims senior Murdoch executive|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=October 13, 2011|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Nick|last=Davies|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114091242/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/12/wall-street-journal-andrew-langhoff|archivedate=November 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case came to light after a Belgian ''Wall Street Journal'' employee, [[Gert Van Mol]], informed Dow Jones CEO [[Les Hinton]] about the questionable practice.&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/news-corp-wall-street-journal-phone-hacking-250764|title=News Corp Ignored Wall Street Journal Circulation Inflation (Report)|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=October 13, 2011|location=US|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=THR|last=Staff|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411230654/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/news-corp-wall-street-journal-phone-hacking-250764|archivedate=April 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the then ''Wall Street Journal Europe'' CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue.&lt;ref name="Pointer."&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/149205/wall-street-journal-europe-publisher-resigns-after-deal-suggested-outside-influence-over-editorial-content/|title=WSJ Europe publisher resigns after reports he 'personally pressured' journalists into covering paper's business partner|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=October 13, 2011|location=US|publisher=[[Poynter Institute]]|first=Steve|last=Meyers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114094516/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/149205/wall-street-journal-europe-publisher-resigns-after-deal-suggested-outside-influence-over-editorial-content/|archivedate=November 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ Online "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203499704576625162816696954.html|title=Publisher of WSJ Europe Resigns After Ethics Inquiry|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=October 13, 2011|location=London|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Paul|last=Sonne|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013062055/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203499704576625162816696954.html|archivedate=October 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 2011 all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.

In November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the ''Journal''{{'s}} editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced that layoffs and consolidation to its sections would take place.

==Editorial page and political stance==
{{Further|The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board}}
The ''Journal'' won its first two Pulitzer Prizes for editorial writing in 1947 and 1953. Subsequent Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to [[Robert L. Bartley]] in 1980 and [[Joseph Rago]] in 2011; for criticism to [[Manuela Hoelterhoff]] in 1983 and [[Joe Morgenstern]] in 2005; and for commentary to [[Vermont Royster]] in 1984, [[Paul Gigot]] in 2000, [[Dorothy Rabinowitz]] in 2001, [[Bret Stephens]] in 2013, and [[Peggy Noonan]] in 2017.

Two summaries published in 1995 by the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] blog [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]], and in 1996 by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naureckas|first=Jim|last2=Rendall|first2=Steve|title=20 Reasons Not to Trust the Journal Editorial Page|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1325|work=[[Extra!]]|publisher=Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|date=September–October 1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107135516/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1325|archivedate=November 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}{{cite web|last=Lieberman|first=Trudy|title=Bartley's Believe It Or Not!|url=http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/96/4/wsj.asp|work=Columbia Journalism Review|date=July–August 1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129014101/http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/96/4/wsj.asp|archivedate=January 29, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the ''Journal''{{'s}} editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s.

The Journal describes the history of its editorials:
{{quote|They are united by the mantra "free markets and free people", the principles, if you will, marked in the watershed year of 1776 by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[American Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]''. So over the past century and into the next, the ''Journal'' stands for [[free trade]] and [[sound money]]; against confiscatory taxation and the [[ukase]]s of kings and other [[collectivism|collectivists]]; and for individual autonomy against dictators, bullies and even the tempers of momentary majorities. If these principles sound unexceptionable in theory, applying them to current issues is often unfashionable and controversial.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}}}

Its historical position was much the same. As former editor [[William H. Grimes]] wrote in 1951:
{{quote|On our editorial page we make no pretense of walking down the middle of the road. Our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view. We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. People will say we are conservative or even reactionary. We are not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one, we would say we are radical. Just as radical as the Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name=grimesphil&gt;{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William H.|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 2, 1951|location=New York, NY}} seen in {{cite web|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy |url=http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |accessdate=August 26, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716005137/http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2007|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] the editorial page prints two famous articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled ''The Desolate Wilderness'', and describes what the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] saw when they arrived at the [[Plymouth Colony]]. The second is titled ''And the Fair Land'', and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, [[Vermont C. Royster]], whose Christmas article ''In Hoc Anno Domini'' has appeared every December 25 since 1949.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Economic views===

On September 12, 2018, the [[Census Bureau]] released data showing improvement in household income and the poverty rate during 2017, Trump's first year in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/12/us/census-median-income-poverty/index.html|title=Middle class income rises again — now up to $61,400|first=Tami|last=Luhby|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Journal'' published an editorial that day attributing the improvement to Trump's purportedly superior economic policies, compared to Obama's.&lt;ref&gt;Full access to article via Twitter: https://twitter.com/WSJopinion/status/1040254976319258624&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Journal'''s news division reported that both figures also showed improvement in 2015 and 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/median-household-income-rose-1-8-in-2017-census-bureau-figures-show-1536762535|title=Incomes Rose and Poverty Rate Fell for Third Straight Year, Census Data Show|first1=Janet|last1=Adamy|first2=Paul|last2=Overberg|date=September 13, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2018|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they improved to a greater degree in both those years than they did in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Table 2: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=lczW|title=Real Median Household Income in the United States|date=September 12, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Reagan administration]], the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for [[supply-side economics]]. Under the editorship of [[Robert L. Bartley|Robert Bartley]], it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the [[Laffer curve]], and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the [[capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]] could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.

In the economic argument of [[exchange rate regime]]s (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the ''Journal'' has a tendency to support [[fixed exchange rate]]s over [[floating exchange rate]]s. For example, the ''Journal'' was a major supporter of the [[Chinese yuan]]'s peg to the dollar, and strongly disagreed with American politicians who criticized the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] about the peg. It opposed China's move to let the yuan gradually float, arguing that the fixed rate benefited both the United States and China.

The ''Journal''{{'s}} views compare with those of the British publication ''[[The Economist]]'', with its emphasis on free markets{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. However, the ''Journal'' demonstrates important distinctions from European business newspapers, most particularly in regard to the relative significance of, and causes of, the American [[budget deficit]].

[[The Wall Street Journal editorial board|The ''Journal''{{'s}} editorial pages and columns]], run separately from the news pages, are highly influential in American conservative circles. As editors of the editorial page, [[Vermont C. Royster]] (served 1958–1971) and [[Robert L.

The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy. In a July 3, 1984, editorial, the board wrote: "If Washington still wants to 'do something' about immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment: There shall be [[open borders]]." This stand on [[immigration reform]] places the ''Journal'' in contrast to most conservative activists, politicians, and media publications for example ''[[National Review]]'' and ''[[The Washington Times]]'', who favor heightened restrictions on immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rutenberg |first=Jim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/washington/03immig.html |title=The editorial page commonly publishes pieces by U.S. and world leaders in academia, business, government and politics |work=The New York Times |date=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=June 5, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210559/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/washington/03immig.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1180807796-2rtP%2FypH5CxbIhLG9%2FDQjg&amp;oref=slogin |archivedate=May 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in news pages===
The ''Journal''{{'}}s editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters.&lt;ref name="Crovitz" /&gt;

In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and [[Jeffrey Milyo|Jeff Milyo]] argue the ''Journal''{{'s}} news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular [[think tank]]s and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of ''The Journal'' was the most liberal (more liberal than [[NPR]] or ''[[The New York Times]]''). The study did not factor in editorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Groseclose | first1 = T. | last2 = Milyo | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1162/003355305775097542 | title = A Measure of Media Bias | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 120 | issue = 4 | page = 1191 | year = 2005 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Liberman]] criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that "..the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite."

==Notable stories and Pulitzer Prizes==
The ''Journal'' has won more than 30 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.

===1987: RJR Nabisco buyout===
In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant [[RJR Nabisco]]. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen ''Journal'' articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, ''[[Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco]]'', which was turned into a [[Barbarians at the Gate (film)|film]] for HBO.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0106356|title=Barbarians at the Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's [[South Brunswick Township, New Jersey|South Brunswick, N.J.]], corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey,&lt;ref name="The Eye of the Storm"/&gt; who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to [[CNBC]] as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the ''Journal''{{'s}} offices and filling them with dust and debris.
