The '''1951 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference''' was the fifth [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference|Meeting]] of the [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[British Commonwealth]]. It was held in the [[United Kingdom]] in January 1951, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Clement Attlee]].

The principal topic of the conference was the [[Korean War]] with the summit issuing a declaration, proposed by [[Australia]]n prime minister [[Robert Menzies]], stating that the Commonwealth prime ministers "would welcome any feasible arrangement for a frank exchange of views with [[Stalin]] and [[Mao Tse-tung]]."&lt;ref name=kw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18491625 |title=14 Jan 1951 - 10-Day Commonwealth Conference Ends PRIME MINISTERS URGE BIG FOUR PEACE TALKS - Trove |website=Nla.gov.au |date=1951-01-14 |accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth leaders also called for [[peace treaty]] negotiations with [[Japan]] to be concluded as soon as possible (see [[Treaty of San Francisco]]).&lt;ref name=kw/&gt;

==Academic Career and Achievements==
From 1970 to 1976 Angela Friederici studied linguistics at the [[University of Bonn]] (Germany) and the [[University of Lausanne]] (Switzerland), graduating with Ph.D. in linguistics in 1976.  In 1975 she also began studying psychology at the University of Bonn and graduated with a degree in psychology (German: Dipl.-Psych.) in 1980. In 1986 she completed her professorial degree ([[Habilitation]]) at the [[University of Giessen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbs.mpg.de/staff/angelafr-203 Max Planck Institute staff page&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}}
After a post-doctoral scholarship at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and work as a research fellow in the Netherlands and France, Angela Friederici was awarded a professorship in [[cognitive psychology]] by the [[Free University of Berlin]] in 1989. In 1994 she became a Founding Director and Scientific Member of the Max Planck Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience in Leipzig,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpg.de/cgi-bin/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}/person.cgi?nav=vita&amp;persId=123415&amp;lang=en&amp;inst=kognition_neuro&amp;from= Max Planck Society&lt;/ref&gt; which became the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in 2004.

Friederici also holds honorary professorships ([[Honorary title (academic)|Honorarprofessor]]) from the [[University of Leipzig]] (since 1995) for [[cognitive psychology]], the [[University of Potsdam]] for [[Linguistics]] in the Faculty of [[Philosophy]] (since 1997) and for [[Medicine]] at the [[CharitÃ©]], [[Humboldt-University]] Berlin (since 2004).

Friederici's research centres on how the human brain processes language, examining both first and [[second language acquisition]] and use. She was the first to report the [[early left anterior negativity]] (ELAN), an [[EEG]] response to syntactic violations in sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Friederici A.D. |author2=Pfeifer E. |author3=Hahne A. | year = 1993 | title = Event related potentials during natural speech processing | url = | journal = Cognitive Brain Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 183â192 | doi=10.1016/0926-6410(93)90026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Friederici A.D. | year = 2004 | title = Event-related brain potential studies in language | doi = 10.1007/s11910-004-0070-0 | journal = Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports | volume = 4 | issue = 6| pages = 466â70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ballycorus''' ({{lga|Baile Mhic Fheorais|Town of the Pearse Family}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logainm.ie/16668.aspx |title=Ballycorus |work=Placenames Database of Ireland |publisher=[[Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs]] |accessdate=2010-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''leadmines''' is a former [[lead]] mining and [[smelting]] centre located in the [[townland]] of the same name, near [[Kilternan]] in [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The mine opened around 1807 and was taken over by the Mining Company of Ireland (MCI) in 1826 who owned and operated the site up until closure in 1913. After the mine was exhausted in the 1860s, Ballycorus continued to operate as a [[lead smelter|smelting facility]] receiving ore from other MCI sites such as the mines in [[Glendalough]], [[County Wicklow]]. The most distinctive surviving remnant of the site is the ruin of the [[flue]] chimney that lies close to the summit of [[Carrickgollogan]] hill. Further down the slopes of the hill, many other former buildings and structures from the leadworks can also be found.

==History==
[[Open-pit mining|Open-cast mining]] began at Ballycorus around 1807 on the western side of Carrickgollogan hill, close to the later site of the flue chimney.&lt;ref name="EPA_2"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was taken over by the Mining Company of Ireland (MCI) in 1826 who undertook [[underground mining]] in the area up until 1863.&lt;ref name="EPA_2" /&gt; This activity was carried out on an intermittent basis on account of the discontinuous nature of the vein and depending on lead prices.&lt;ref name="EPA_2" /&gt; A vein of [[silver]] was discovered in 1843 but production was limited.&lt;ref name="EPA_2" /&gt;

Most of the activity at Ballycorus occurred at the smelting and rolling facility constructed by MCI in the valley below the mine workings.&lt;ref name="EPA_2" /&gt; This facility received ore not only from Ballycorus but also from MCI's mine at Luganure, in [[Glendalough]], [[County Wicklow]] for processing.&lt;ref name="Joyce_71"&gt;Joyce, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The ore from Luganure was carried by horse and cart to the railway station at [[Rathdrum, County Wicklow|Rathdrum]] where it was transferred to a train and brought to [[Shankill, Dublin|Shankill]].&lt;ref name="MacAongusa_19"&gt;Mac Aoungusa, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[siding (rail)|siding]] on the [[Harcourt Street railway line]] was built near Shankill station to receive the trains.&lt;ref name="MacAongusa_19" /&gt; From Shankill the ore was carted to Ballycorus.&lt;ref name="MacAongusa_19" /&gt; Lead ore was also received from MCI mines in counties [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Wexford|Wexford]].&lt;ref name="Rynne_145" /&gt; By the 1880s it was no longer commercially viable to process Irish ores and the smelter was put to work processing ore from the [[Laxey|Great Laxey]] mine in the [[Isle of Man]] up until closure in 1913.&lt;ref name="Rynne_145"&gt;Rynne, P. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballycorus Lead Works 1857 Shot Tower.jpg|thumb|left|The 1857 [[shot tower]] surrounded by some of the surviving buildings from the leadworks]]
The lead ore was processed using a [[reverberatory furnace]], the bed of which was dished so that the molten lead would trickle down the sides to the centre from which it was run off into moulds.&lt;ref name="Rynne_145" /&gt; Silver was also extracted during processing by means of a process known as [[cupellation]].&lt;ref name="Rynne_145" /&gt; The lead, which was used to manufacture pipes and roofing, found a ready market in the Dublin building trade as the city's [[suburb]]s began to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Corlett, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lead shot]] was also manufactured: the first [[shot tower]] was built in 1829 and was described by Weston St. John Joyce in ''The Neighbourhood of Dublin'' (1912) as âa handsome and substantial structure, having a spiral stairs within, terminating in an artistic iron veranda on the outsideâ.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; A second shot tower was built in 1857.&lt;ref name="EPA_2" /&gt; A [[watermill|mill stream]] was used to power much of the machinery in the smelter.&lt;ref name="EPA_4"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A process had been discovered in the 1770s whereby additional quantities of lead could be extracted from the fumes emitted by reverberatory furnaces if the vapours could be trapped long enough to [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] the lead.&lt;ref name="Rynne_145" /&gt; To this end a flue {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} long running from the lead works and terminating at a chimney near the summit of Carrickgollogan was constructed in 1836.&lt;ref name="Pearson_315"&gt;Pearson, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; The precipitated lead deposits were scraped out of the flue by hand and many of the workers subsequently died of [[lead poisoning]], giving the surrounding area the nickname âDeath Valleyâ.&lt;ref&gt;DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive granite flue chimney with its external spiral staircase and viewing platform quickly became a noted landmark and was marked on [[Admiralty]] charts as a point of reference for mariners.&lt;ref name="Pearson_315" /&gt; Photographic records show that the flue chimney was originally much taller with an extra brick section, now dismantled, rising above the viewing platform.&lt;ref name="Pearson_315" /&gt; It is the only example of such a flue and chimney to have been built in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Rynne_145" /&gt; Weston St. John Joyce noted that the flue was âstated to be one of the best constructed in the United Kingdomâ.&lt;ref name="Joyce_71" /&gt;

==Present day==
[[File:Ballycorus LeadMines Flue.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the Flue]]
The most prominent surviving remnant of the leadworks is that of the flue chimney. The land around the chimney is owned by the State [[forestry]] company [[Coillte]] and managed by the Dublin Mountains Partnership. A [[waymarking|waymarked]] walking trail around the forest, called âThe Lead Mines Wayâ, leads to the ruin of the chimney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coillteoutdoors.ie/index.php?id=53&amp;rec_site=15&amp;no_cache=1 |title=Carrickgollogan |accessdate=2010-09-19 |work=Coillte Outdoors }}&lt;/ref&gt; The top third of the chimney has been removed as it was deemed unsafe as has the lower section of the external stairs.&lt;ref name="Kilternan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kilternan.info/History/chimney.asp |title=Lead Mines Chimmey |accessdate=2010-09-19 |work=Kilternan.info }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the flue, along with many of its inspection hatches still exists and can be explored.&lt;ref name="Pearson_316"&gt;Pearson, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a number of buildings from the smelting works situated in the valley below also survive to the present day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2952">The '''Church of Our lady of Muxima''' (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Igreja da Nossa Senhora da ConceiÃ§Ã£o da Muxima'') is located in the [[Muxirna|Muxirna District]] of [[Bengo Province]], western [[Angola]].  &lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/twhs.php?id=928 UNESCO World Heritage Centre.org: Tentative list â Church of Nossa Senhora da ConceiÃ§Ã£o da Muxima]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 16th century [[Portuguese colonial architecture|Portuguese Colonial style]] church was an important center in the [[Slavery in Angola|
Portuguese slave trade in Angola]].&lt;ref&gt;Valdez, F. T. (1861), Six Years of a Traveller's Life in Western Africa, Vol. II, Hurst and Blackett.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The church stands on the left bank of the [[Kwanza River]], and is a contemporary of the Fortress of C`Muxima' 7. The village of Muxirna was occupied by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1589 and ten years later (1599), the Fortress was founded and the church was built with a prayer invoking divine blessing from "Nossa Senhora da Muxirna". &lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

Muxima was an important empire of slave traffic, protected by the Fortress, and the church played an important role in the materialization of the traffic, because it was in this religious local, where the slaves were baptized before being deported. 

===Architecture===
It is spacious and strong building, with a stern, typically Portuguese architecture, built above the Kwanza River. It was set on fire by the colonial Dutch in 1641, when they captured Muxima. Later, it was modified. 

The sanctuary, with a Virgin image, has been a place of great devotion for [[Christian]] pilgrims for generations. &lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

It was classified as National Monument by Portuguese Provincial Decree No. 2, on 12  January 1924. It is relatively in good order and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The responsibility for its maintenance and preservation concerns the Ministry of Culture. &lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;


== World Heritage Status ==
This site was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List]] on November 22, 1996 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/928/ Church of Nossa Senhora da ConceiÃ§Ã o da Muxima - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]

{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}
'''Contrastive analysis''' is the systematic study of a pair of [[language]]s with a view to identifying their structural differences and similarities.  Historically it has been used to establish [[Language family|language genealogies]].

==Second language acquisition==
Contrastive analysis was used extensively in the field of [[second language acquisition]] (SLA) in the 1960s and early 1970s, as a method of explaining why some features of a [[Second language|target language]] were more difficult to acquire than others. According to the [[behaviourism|behaviourist]] theories prevailing at the time, language learning was a question of [[habituation|habit formation]], and this could be reinforced or impeded by existing habits. Therefore, the difficulty in mastering certain structures in a [[second language]] (L2) depended on the difference between the learners' mother language (L1) and the language they were trying to learn.

===History===
The theoretical foundations for what became known as the contrastive analysis hypothesis were formulated in [[Robert Lado]]'s ''Linguistics Across Cultures'' (1957). In this book, Lado claimed that "those elements which are similar to [the learner's] native language will be simple for him, and those elements that are different will be difficult". While it was not a novel suggestion, Lado was the first to provide a comprehensive theoretical treatment and to suggest a systematic set of technical procedures for the contrastive study of languages. That involved describing the languages (using [[structuralism|structuralist]] linguistics), comparing them and predicting learning difficulties.

During the 1960s, there was a widespread enthusiasm with this technique, manifested in the contrastive descriptions of several European languages, many of which were sponsored by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]] in [[Washington, DC]]. It was expected that once the areas of potential difficulty had been mapped out through contrastive analysis, it would be possible to design language courses more efficiently. Contrastive analysis, along with behaviourism and [[structuralism]] exerted a profound effect on SLA curriculum design and language teacher education, and provided the theoretical pillars of the [[audio-lingual method]].

===Criticism and its response===
In its strongest formulation, the contrastive analysis hypothesis claimed that all the errors made in learning the L2 could be attributed to 'interference' by the L1. However, this claim could not be sustained by empirical evidence that was accumulated in the mid- and late 1970s. It was soon pointed out that many errors predicted by Contrastive Analysis were inexplicably not observed in learners' language. Even more confusingly, some uniform errors were made by learners irrespective of their L1. It thus became clear that contrastive analysis could not predict all learning difficulties, but was certainly useful in the retrospective explanation of errors.

In response to the above criticisms, a moderate version of the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) has developed which paradoxically contradicts Lado's original claim. The new CAH hypothesizes that the more different the L2 is with one's L1, the easier it is for one to learn the target language. The prediction is based on the premise that similarities in languages create confusion for learners. 
 
With the help of technological advancement, contrastive analysis has adopted a more efficient method in obtaining language data, a corpus-based approach, which generates vast amount of juxtapositions of language differences in various fields of linguistics, for example [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] and [[syntax]].

==Applications==
There are multiple fields in the realms of linguistics to which Contrastive Analysis (CA) is applicable:
* [[Historical linguistics]], a former application of CA, which is subsumed under the name [[comparative linguistics]], a branch in linguistics not to be confused with CA.
* [[Second language teaching]]: Despite CA's limitation in the prediction of L2 learners' errors, it provides insights to at least some of the major mistakes that are frequently made by L2 learners irrespective of their L1. Hence, more tailor-made language design can be adopted; examples include awareness raising teaching method and hierarchical learning teaching curriculum.
* [[Second language learning]]: Awareness raising is the major contribution of CA in second language learning. This includes CA's abilities to explain observed errors and to outline the differences between two languages; upon language learners' realization of these aspects, they can work to adopt a viable way to learn instead of rote learning, and correct fossilized language errors.
* [[Sociolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[bilingualism]], [[pragmatics]] and others cultural-related areas: CA is, in itself, a cross-linguistic/cross-cultural study, and its applicability on both linguistics and non-linguistics features is one of its major merits. This permits a better understanding linguistic-cultural understanding, which is essential for learning a language in its entirety. 
* [[Translation]]: CA provides better understanding of linguistic difference between two languages and therefore may be applied to the field of translation. Primarily, CA certainly lays a foundation for translation as it is an integral element for interpreters to have a thorough understanding of not only the two languages, but the differences between them. Also, it might balance the [[word-for-word]] vs. [[sense-for-sense translation|sense-for sense]] debate by developing strategies to overcome the linguistic hindrance. Moreover, it may avoid awkward translations such as [[translationese]] and [[Europeanization]]. 
* [[Language therapy]]: Distinguishing the difference between language disorder patients from non-standard dialect speakers. This is essential in identifying speech pathology and their corresponding treatment.
* Criminal investigation: CA research offers insight to subtle differences among languages. Language patterns can be used as clues to investigate criminal activities, for example analyzing [[phishing]] texts designed to deceive users into giving away confidential information.

II, pp 240-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The original may have been commissioned some time between 230 and 220 BC by [[Attalus I]] of [[Pergamon]] to celebrate his victory over the [[Galatians (People)|Galatians]], the [[Celts|Celtic]] or [[Gaul]]ish people of parts of [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]).  The identity of the sculptor of the original is unknown, but it has been suggested that [[Epigonus]], a court sculptor of the [[Attalid dynasty]] of Pergamon, may have been the creator.

The copy was most commonly known as ''The Dying Gladiator'' until the 20th century on the assumption that it depicted a wounded gladiator in a Roman amphitheatre.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Beauchamp Walters, ''The Art of the Greeks'', The Macmillan Company, 1906, p.130 notes that it is still most commonly called that because of the popularity of Byron's description.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars had identified it as a Gaul or Galatian by the mid-19th century, but it took many decades for the new title to achieve popular acceptance.

==Description==
The white marble statue which may have originally been painted depicts a wounded, slumping [[Celt]] with remarkable realism and [[pathos]], particularly as regards the face. A bleeding sword puncture is visible in his lower right chest. The figure is represented as a Celtic warrior with characteristic hairstyle and moustache and has a [[torc]] around his neck. He lies on his fallen shield while his sword, belt, and a curved trumpet lie beside him. The sword hilt bears a lion head. The present base was added after its 17th-century rediscovery.

==Discovery and expatriation==
[[File:Dying Gaul-Musei CapitoliniI-2.jpg|thumb|right|Back of the sculpture.]]
''The Dying Galatian'' is thought to have been rediscovered in the early 17th century during some excavations for the foundations of the [[Villa Ludovisi]], then a suburban villa in [[Rome]]. It was first recorded in a 1623 inventory of the collections of the powerful [[Ludovisi (family)|Ludovisi family]]. The villa was built in the area of the ancient [[Gardens of Sallust]] where, when the Ludovisi property was built over in the late 19th century, many other antiquities were discovered,&lt;ref&gt;Haskell and Penny 1981:224 provide the history of this sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the "[[Ludovisi Throne]]". By 1633 it was in the Ludovisi Palazzo Grande on the [[Pincio]]. [[Pope Clement XII]] acquired it for the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitoline collections]]. It was then taken by Napoleon's forces under the terms of the [[Treaty of Tolentino]], and displayed with other Italian works of art in the [[Louvre Museum]] until 1816, when it was returned to Rome.

==Portrayal of Celts==
[[File:Dying Gaul Musei Capitolini MC747.jpg|thumb|left|Detail showing his [[torc|neck torc]].]]

The statue serves both as a reminder of the Celts' defeat, thus demonstrating the might of the people who defeated them, and a memorial to their bravery as worthy adversaries. The statue may also provide evidence to corroborate ancient accounts of the fighting styleâ[[Diodorus Siculus]] reported that "Some of them have iron breastplates or chainmail while others fight naked".&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus in Stephen Allen (Author), Wayne Reynolds (Illustrator), ''Celtic Warrior: 300 BCE â 100 CE'' (Osprey: 25 April 2001), {{ISBN|1-84176-143-5}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M1RopeW8XQ4C&amp;pg=PA22 p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] wrote an evocative account of Galatian tactics against a Roman army at the [[Battle of Telamon]] of 225 BC:

{{blockquote|The [[Insubres]] and the [[Boii]] wore trousers and light cloaks, but the [[Gaesatae]], in their love of glory and defiant spirit, had thrown off their garments and taken up their position in front of the whole army naked and wearing nothing but their arms... The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.|Polybius, ''Histories'' II.28}}

The Roman historian [[Livy]] recorded that the Celts of [[Asia Minor]] fought naked and their wounds were plain to see on the whiteness of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History'' XXII.46 and XXXVIII.21&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] regarded this as a foolish tactic:{{blockquote|Our enemies fight naked. What injury could their long hair, their fierce looks, their clashing arms do us? These are mere symbols of barbarian boastfulness.|Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''History of Rome'' XIV.9}}
[[File:Dying GaulDSCF6738.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail showing the face, hair style and torc of the sculpture.]]
The depiction of this particular Galatian as naked may also have been intended to lend him the dignity of [[heroic nudity]] or [[pathos|pathetic]] nudity. It was not infrequent for Greek warriors to be likewise depicted as heroic nudes, as exemplified by the [[Temple of Aphaea#Pedimental sculptures|pedimental sculptures of the Temple of Aphaea]] at [[Aegina]]. The message conveyed by the sculpture, as [[H. W. Janson]] comments, is that "they knew how to die, barbarians that they were".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Janson, "History of Art: A survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day", p. 141. H. N. Abrams, 1977. {{ISBN|0-13-389296-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Dying Galatian'' became one of the most celebrated works to have survived from antiquity and was engraved&lt;ref&gt;First by FranÃ§ois Perrier, ''Segmenta nobilium signorum et statuarum que temporis dentem invidium evase'' (Rome and Paris 1638) plate 91 (noted by Haskell and Penny 225 and note 15).&lt;/ref&gt; and endlessly copied by artists, for whom it was a classic model for depiction of strong emotion, and by sculptors.  It shows signs of having been repaired, with the head seemingly having been broken off at the neck, though it is unclear whether the repairs were carried out in Roman times or after the statue's 17th century rediscovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kim J. Hartswick, ''The Gardens of Sallust: a Changing Landscape'', p. 107. University of Texas Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  As discovered, the [[proper left]] leg was in three pieces.  They are now pinned together with the pin concealed by the left kneecap. The Gaul's "spiky" hair is a 17th-century reworking of longer hair found as broken upon discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grout|first=James|title=The Dying Gaul|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/museums/dyinggaul.html|work=EncyclopÃ¦dia Romana|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=16 December 2013|location=[[Chicago, IL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the statue was widely interpreted as representing a defeated [[gladiator]], rather than a Galatian warrior. Hence it was known as the 'Dying' or 'Wounded Gladiator', 'Roman Gladiator', and '[[Murmillo]] Dying'. It has also been called the 'Dying Trumpeter', because one of the scattered objects lying beside the figure is a horn.

The artistic quality and expressive [[pathos]] of the statue aroused great admiration among the educated classes in the 17th and 18th centuries and was a "must-see" sight on the [[Grand Tour]] of Europe undertaken by young men of the day.  [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] was one such visitor, commemorating the statue in his poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'':
 
{{quotation|
I see before me the gladiator lie&lt;br&gt;
He leans upon his handâhis manly brow&lt;br&gt;
Consents to death, but conquers agony,&lt;br&gt;
And his drooped head sinks gradually lowâ&lt;br&gt;
And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow&lt;br&gt;
From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one...&lt;ref&gt;Byron, ''Childe Harold'', Canto IV (1818), stanzas 140â141.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was widely copied, with kings,&lt;ref&gt;A plaster cast was made for the King of Spain in 1650, and a marble copy by [[Michel Monnier]] for Louis XIV remains at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] (Haskell and Penny 1981:22).&lt;/ref&gt; academics and wealthy landowners&lt;ref&gt;A black marble copy for the Duke of Northumberland is in the entrance hall of [[Syon House]], designed by [[Robert Adam]]; there are copies in several gardens in England, including [[Rousham]], Oxfordshire (by [[Peter Scheemakers]], 1743, according to [[Rupert Gunnis]], ''[[Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660â1851]]'', rev.ed. 1968, ''s.v.'' "Scheemakers, Peter") and [[Wilton House]], Wiltshire (Simon Vierpyl, before 1769).&lt;/ref&gt; commissioning their own reproductions of the ''Dying Gaul''. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wanted the original or a reproduction at [[Monticello]].&lt;ref name=Kennicott /&gt; The less well-off could purchase copies of the statue in miniature for use as ornaments and paperweights.  Full-size plaster copies were also studied by art students.

It was requisitioned by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] by terms of the [[Treaty of Campoformio]] (1797) during his [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1796#Italy|invasion of Italy]] and taken in triumph to [[Paris]], where it was put on display. The piece was returned to Rome in 1816.&lt;ref name=Kennicott&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|title=Dying Gaul on view at National Gallery of Art|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/dying-gaul-on-view-at-national-gallery-of-art/2013/12/12/90ea4760-6358-11e3-91b3-f2bb96304e34_story.html|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=12 December 2013|location=[[Washington, DC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 12, 2013 until March 16, 2014 the work was on display in the main rotunda of the west wing of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]].  This temporary tenure marked the first time the antiquity had left Italy since it was returned in the second decade of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Kennicott /&gt;&lt;!--in the [[Capitoline Museums]].--&gt;

==Copies==
[[File:Iford manor dying gladiator.JPG|thumb|''The Dying Gladiator'' at Iford Manor, Wiltshire, England]]
[[File:The Dying Gladiator Inn, Brigg.jpg|thumb|The Dying Gladiator Inn, [[Brigg]], England]]
Copies of the statue (itself a copy) can be seen in the [[Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge|Museum of Classical Archaeology]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland, as well as in [[Berlin]], [[Prague]], [[Stockholm]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], Warsaw ([[Royal Baths Park]]).

In the United States, copies are at the Washington State Historical Society in Tacoma, Washington, at the [[Redwood Library]], Newport, Rhode Island, and at [[Assumption College]] in Worcester, MA. 

A copy in bronze titled "Centurion" stands in front of the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], as a memorial to the lives of fallen police officers; this copy wears a [[pteruges]] but is otherwise identical.

The [[Royal Academy]] in London had one such copy, now at [[Courtauld Institute of Art#Courtauld Gallery|the Courtauld Gallery in London]]. It also had an [[Ã©corchÃ©]] in this pose, cast in the late 18th century from the body of an executed [[smuggler]] and hence nicknamed "[[Smugglerius]]".

There is an example in bronze over the gate of the walled garden at Iford Manor, Wiltshire, England. In the English [[market town]] of [[Brigg]] in [[Lincolnshire]], the long established [[coaching inn]] ''The Dying Gladiator'' displays a copy, using the old title.

The College of Fine Arts in the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] also has a copy, using the old title. There is also a copy at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St Petersburg, Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and one in the Telfair Museum of Art [[Savannah, Georgia]]

The Museum of Art and Circus Museum, Ringling Brother Estate, Sarasota, Florida has a full-size copy.

The [[William Humphreys Art Gallery]] in South Africa, situated in Kimberley also  has a copy.

'''Edgar Lee Hewett''' (November 23, 1865&amp;nbsp;â December 31, 1946) was an American [[archaeologist]] and [[anthropologist]] whose focus was the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities of [[New Mexico]] and the southwestern [[United States]].  He is best known for his role in gaining passage of the [[Antiquities Act]], a pioneering piece of legislation for the [[conservation movement]]; as the founder and first director of the [[Museum of New Mexico]]; and as the first president of the New Mexico Normal School, now [[New Mexico Highlands University]].

Hewett's dealings with [[Maria Martinez]], the great [[pottery|potter]] of [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]], were instrumental in establishing San Ildefonso as a center for Native American pottery. He helped stimulate the rebirth of pottery as a significant [[folk art]] form in the region.

Hewett also had a significant role in the formation of [[Bandelier National Monument]] and [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], established to preserve extensive prehistoric ruins of the [[Pueblo people]] whom he studied. The [[Antiquities Act]], which he had worked on, authorized the establishment by the executive branch of such [[U.S. National Monument|national monument]]s.

== Early years ==
Hewett was born in [[Warren County, Illinois]], on November 23, 1865. He was educated at [[Tarkio College]] in [[Missouri]] and thereafter settled in [[Florence, Colorado]], as a member of the school system. He eventually became superintendent of the Florence schools. In 1894 he became a member of the faculty of the Colorado State Normal School in [[Greeley, Colorado]] (today the [[University of Northern Colorado]]), where he received a master's degree in 1893.&lt;ref name="fisher-reginald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Reginald |title=Edgar Lee Hewett |journal=American Antiquity |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=78â79 |date=July 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewett's 1891 marriage to Cora Whitford proved eventful for his eventual career and prominence. Cora was described in contemporary accounts as "frail" -- frequently (and almost certainly in this case) a euphemism for a person suffering [[tuberculosis]] -- and at her doctors' advice, the Hewetts started to spend time in the warmer climate of northern [[New Mexico]]. Tuberculosis was considered incurable as antibiotics had not been discovered.&lt;ref name="thompson-ray"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson| first=Raymond Harris | title=Edgar Lee Hewett and the Political Process | journal=Journal of the Southwest | volume=42 | issue=2 | pages=271â318 | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Edgar Hewett was exposed to, and became fascinated by, the prehistoric ruins in Frijoles Canyon near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] -- a site that would eventually become the centerpiece attraction of [[Bandelier National Monument]].&lt;ref name="hoard-dorothy"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hoard, Dorothy | title=A Guide to Bandelier National Monument | publisher=Los Alamos Historical Society | year=1983 | isbn=0-941232-04-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewett's interest in Frijoles Canyon was timely, for ethnologist [[Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier|Adolph Bandelier]] had just started to describe, through both scientific papers and his novel ''The Delight Makers'' (1890), prehistoric life on the [[Pajarito Plateau]]. Hewett came to know Bandelier and consider him his mentor in his own studies. By 1896 Hewett himself was conducting field work on the Plateau, although he continued to defer to Bandelier's expertise on the region for many years.

Hewett rapidly came to believe that the Plateau's archaeological sites constituted a national resource that should be preserved, and in the 1890s he advocated creation of a "Pajarito National Park" that would protect essentially the entire Plateau. However, the time was not yet ripe for such a step. Contemporary [[agriculture]] on the Plateau was not exactly widespread, but such as it was, the [[ranching|ranchers]] relied upon it for sustenance, and perceived a threat to their economic well-being if the land was put off limits to ranching and farming. (Many years later, [[Valles Caldera National Preserve]] was established in the adjoining [[Jemez Mountains]] with language that explicitly mandated promoting the economic interests of the region in terms of agriculture and [[forestry]].)&lt;ref&gt;United States Public Law 106-248 (2000); text available at http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/laws/106/publ248.106.txt (last accessed November 29, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; These pressures, combined with opposition from [[Santa Clara Pueblo]], prevented Pajarito National Park from being approved at that time. 

== New Mexico Normal School ==
In 1893 the [[New Mexico]] territorial legislature, anticipating the day when the Territory would achieve statehood, authorized the founding of a [[normal school]] at [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. The New Mexico Normal School, as it was originally called (renamed New Mexico Normal University in 1902, later becoming [[New Mexico Highlands University]] as it is today), took some time to form, but was ready for its first class of students in 1898. By this time Hewett had achieved a modicum of fame, at least locally, and had become friendly with some of the power brokers who were behind the creation of the Normal School. He was appointed in 1897 as the first president of the New Mexico Normal School.&lt;ref name="fowler-don"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fowler |first=Don D. |title=E. L. Hewett, J. F. Zimmerman, and the Beginnings of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico, 1927-1946 |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=305â327 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewett's time at the head of the Normal School can be viewed as generally successful. The college was organized along conventional lines for normal colleges, and commenced with several areas of pedagogy directed to the production of degreed teachers, who were needed by the state-to-be. The enrollment increased rapidly and for a time exceeded that of the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque]]. However, Hewett fell afoul of some of the powerful figures of the region who disagreed with his increasingly vocal position that the archaeological resources of New Mexico Territory required preservation. He was also criticized for an "unconventional" approach to pedagogyâa euphemism for his enthusiasm for taking students into the field (at the Pajarito Plateau) at summer camps, a highly innovative practice at the time and one that reinforced the concerns that his critics had about his enthusiasm for preserving the sites there. Particularly contentious was the fact that he included women in his field camps.&lt;ref name="fowler-don"/&gt; By early 1903 he was pressured out of the president's office. Hewett is the namesake for buildings at today's New Mexico Highlands University.&lt;ref name="hewett-edgar"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hewett, Edgar Lee | title=Ancient Life in the American Southwest | publisher=Tudor Publishing Co. | year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewett's interest in the Pajarito Plateau intensified during his time at the Normal School. He enlisted students at the Normal School in the [[surveying]] of the Plateau, which gave him a basis for putting his studies there on a more scientific footing. He also learned the value of working "the [[smoke-filled room]]" to achieve support for his goals. This was one of the traits that set him apart from his contemporaries such as [[Richard Wetherill]], and his skills contributed to the next phase of his career.&lt;ref name="hewett-edgar"/&gt;

== Antiquities Act ==

Upon stepping down from his position at the Normal School, Hewett decided that he needed to improve his academic credentials in order to advance. He earned a [[doctorate]] in [[anthropology]] from the [[University of Geneva]] in 1904. He spent little time in residence at the university, developing his [[dissertation]] mainly by collating a number of papers which he had written previously (a practice that, in the eyes of Hewett's many critics, would characterize and compromise much of his later writing as well) and having them translated into the required [[French language|French]]. The resulting dissertation, bearing the title ''Les CommunautÃ©s anciennes dans le desert Americain'', was favorably received, and sufficed to earn Hewett his degree despite his inability to defend it in the customary French.

Meanwhile, the political landscape that had prevented the creation of the Pajarito National Park was starting to change. [[John F. Lacey]], a [[congressman]] from [[Iowa]], had visited northern New Mexico in 1902 to see the effects of pot hunting on ancient sites, and had enlisted Hewett as a guide. He was so impressed that he retained Hewett to report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the archaeological resources of the region.

By this time Hewett had become more adept at working the political system, and his skills were starting to show some results, frictions at the Normal School notwithstanding. He had traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1900 (no small journey at the time) and befriended the prominent anthropologist [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher]] among others. In 1902, he wrote a pointed complaint about the pot-hunting practices, which he believed were destroying resources at [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]]. Wetherill and the Hyde Expedition were forbidden to excavate there. 

This set the stage for Hewett to deliver a truly influential report to Congressâand he delivered. On September 3, 1904, freshly back from Geneva, Hewett submitted to the [[General Land Office]] (GLO), which at this time had jurisdiction over government lands in the Southwest, a "Memorandum concerning the historic and prehistoric ruins of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, and their preservation."&lt;ref&gt;General Land Office Circular Relating to Historic and Prehistoric Ruins of the Southwest and Their Preservation (Washington, 1904)&lt;/ref&gt; This report rapidly made its way to Congress and Lacey, who was moved by Hewett's declaration in the Memorandum that "it will be a lasting reproach upon our Government if it does not use its power to restrain" the destruction of the ruins.

Hewett spent most of late 1904 and 1905 shuttling between Washington and New Mexico, helping Lacey with a nascent [[Act of Congress]] at the one and continuing his archaeological fieldwork at the other. This was a time of personal misfortune for him, however, as Cora Hewett's illness had become terminal. While in Geneva, she had to use a [[wheelchair]] much of the time; after their return to the United States, she entered a [[sanatorium]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] for a time. She died in the fall of 1905. Hewett kept on working.

The result was the [[Antiquities Act]] of 1906, a towering piece of American legislation by any standards.&lt;ref&gt;Nation marks Lacey Act centennial, 100 years of federal wildlife law enforcement. [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] press release. May 30, 2000. [http://www.fws.gov/pacific/news/2000/2000-98.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Antiquities Act, it was now no longer necessary for Congress to authorize permanent withdrawal of land for the purpose of preservation of cultural or other resources; a presidential proclamation would now suffice. This apparent short-circuiting of [[separation of powers]] was controversial at the time, and has remained so for the 100 years since its passage, but Lacey's experienced hand guided the bill through Congress, meeting the objections of its critics and propelling it toward passage and presidential signature. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed the Antiquities Act into law on June 8, 1906, and Hewett's place in the history of the [[conservation movement]] was secured. Ironically, Roosevelt's first use of the Antiquities Act was ''not'' to protect one of the ruins that Hewett had made his life's passion, but rather to establish [[Devil's Tower National Monument]] in [[Wyoming]], a site of more geological and scenic interest than archaeological significance. However, the Act would soon be put, repeatedly and vigorously, to its (or at least Hewett's) intended purpose.&lt;ref name="hewett2-edgar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hewett |first=Edgar L. |title=Preservation of American Antiquities; Progress during the Last Year; Needed Legislation|journal=American Anthropologist |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=109â114 |year=1906 |doi=10.1525/aa.1906.8.1.02a00130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building the national monuments ==

The first archaeological site to be preserved under the Antiquities Act was the [[Arizona]] complex that would become the centerpiece of the eponymous [[Montezuma Castle National Monument]]. Hewett knew of Montezuma Castle from his work inventorying the Southwest for the GLO and Lacey, and he knew that it was not only archaeologically significant but also imperiled by aggressive pot hunting (sometimes using [[dynamite]] to knock down walls so that rooms within could be excavated). Hewett lent his support to the creation of this national monument, which came into being in 1907.

Montezuma Castle was a relatively uncontroversial site, being small, remote, and not heavily (or at least profitably) exploited by either the pot hunters or agriculture in the vicinity, some temporary ''de facto'' restrictions on the pot hunting having already come into being before the monument was created. It was therefore a good test case for Hewett's vision as embodied in the Antiquities Act, and creation of the national monument caused comparatively few complaints. Another site closer to home that Hewett had studied, at today's [[Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument]] in southwestern New Mexico, would soon follow, and by the end of 1907, Chaco Canyon itself had been made a [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|national monument]], thus preserving the most extensive site of ruins of the [[Pueblo people|Pueblo culture]]. However, Hewett was not satisfied; he had his eye on other extensive and significant candidates for preservation, notably his long-time favorites on the Pajarito Plateau, that promised to be more controversial. He therefore turned his attention to the problems of getting these sites preserved, as the number of national monuments created under the Antiquities Act began to climb.

In 1907 the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] gave Hewett an additional platform, by establishing the School of American Archaeology, later the [[School of American Research]], in Santa Fe. Hewett's friend [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher|Alice Fletcher]], by then the doyenne of American archaeology, was one of the prime backers of the School; Hewett became its first director, a position he would hold until his death in 1946. The School would provide Hewett not only with a mouthpiece, but also a base for his increasingly professional (if still controversial) research activities and students and collaborators to do the work.

The process of preserving the sites of the Pajarito Plateau proved difficult and time-consuming, partly because interactions among the affected parties were complex, and partly because when Roosevelt passed the reins of government to [[William Howard Taft]], enthusiasm in the White House for preserving such sites was diminished. Another factor had to do with Hewett's own personality. He had many supporters, but also many critics, and some of the latter complained that his real goal was to ensure that ''he'', Edgar L. Hewett, D.Sc., Director of the School of American Research, would have access to, and control of, the Plateau's sitesâwhile his rivals would not. Negotiations over a new monument were long and contentious, but finally, on February 11, 1916, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed the new [[Bandelier National Monument]], naming it for Adolph Bandelier who had died recently.&lt;ref name="hoard-dorothy"/&gt; The monument was rather smaller than Hewett had hoped, covering only Frijoles Canyon, some comparatively empty land to the southwest, and an outlier (now [[Tsankawi]]), and omitting among others the very significant [[Puye Cliff Dwellings]] near [[Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Clara Pueblo]]. However, even the most ardent preservationists had to admit that, from the standpoint of protecting Puebloan sites, Bandelier was much better than nothing.

== Native American art ==

Hewett continued to take an interest in the Pajarito Plateau and its environs, not merely from an archaeological perspective but also from a contemporary one. Many of the Plateau's excavations contained intriguing fragments, and sometimes intact pieces, of [[Native American pottery|pottery]], some of it of considerable beauty. Pottery of a more "modern" nature was produced at some of the pueblos of the region in the first part of the 20th century, but it was intended for the [[tourism|tourist trade]], and had little to do with the pottery of antiquity. The artifacts found during the excavations provided evidence that the Native Americans of the region could do better at making pottery.

Shortly after the first World War, an opportunity arose to revive the high-quality work of antiquity, driven as much by Hewett's curiosity about the potters of the past as anything else. He made the acquaintance of a potter at [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] named [[Maria Martinez]] -- a name that would become a watchword in Native American art. Hewett set Maria and her husband Julian, at that point proficient artisans in a polychrome style of pottery common at San Ildefonso, the task of trying to reproduce the colors and textures seen in the ancestral work of Frijoles Canyon and its vicinity. Almost serendipitously, the Martinezes developed a "black-on-black" style that not only evoked the ancient work but also produced pieces attractive to the modern collector. Hewett, in conjunction with the eccentric entrepreneurs and [[philanthropist]]s [[Vera von Blumenthal]] and [[Rose Dougan]], detected in this pottery a commercial opportunity that the puebleÃ±os would go on to develop into a major and economically significant [[cottage industry]] in the region. The [[Santa Fe Indian Market]], probably the world's leading exposition for Native American art, has an economic impact on northern New Mexico estimated at nearly $20,000,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2002/01/21/daily16.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070701072655/http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2002/01/21/daily16.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-01|title=''New Mexico Business Weekly'', 24 January 2002}} &lt;/ref&gt; San Ildefonso (and [[Santa Clara Pueblo|Santa Clara]]) black-on-black pottery, some of it by descendants of Maria and Julian Martinez, features prominently to this day among the "Best of Show" award winners at the Market, as well as more pedestrian but still high-quality work that has far transcended the tourist trinkets that were being produced in the pueblos at the beginning of the 20th century.

== Academic life ==

The School of American Archaeology (later School of American Research, and now the [[School for Advanced Research]], or SAR) lost little time in establishing itself not merely as a platform for its director, but also as a center for the development of professional archaeologists. Its first professional papers were published the year it opened. [[Neil Judd]], [[Alfred V. Kidder]], [[Sylvanus Morley]], and [[Earl Morris]] were among the prominent archaeologists who spent time there, Judd and Kidder in particular contributing to the excavations of many of the same sites that had interested Hewett.

These educational successes aside, Hewett's appointment at the School ruffled feathers among the old school of American archaeology, which was largely centered on the East Coast and took a decidedly condescending stance toward the "amateur" Hewett, Alice Fletcher's backing notwithstanding. One of his most vocal critics was [[Franz Boas]], who had started the first archaeology [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program in the United States at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Boas and several of his colleagues wanted to control the School and the education it afforded its students, and to have the "incompetent" Hewett sacked. Local pressures sufficed to keep him in the job, and eventually Boas and colleagues were placated through formation of a similar institute in [[Mexico City]].

In 1909 another action of the territorial legislature created the [[Museum of New Mexico]]. Hewett was a logical choice to be its first director, and was installed in the position. The enabling legislation mandated that the Museum be managed by the SAR, helping to solidify Hewett's grasp on both positions. Hewett staffed the Museum's administrative functions with several of his friends and supporters from the Normal School days, and persuaded Alice Fletcher to take a key advisory role as well. This of course exposed him to complaints from his critics about [[cronyism]], but ensured that he at least had a stable power base within the institution. The Museum was empowered by the legislature to acquire land containing some key archaeological sites in the state that were not yet protected by the Antiquities Act, and under Hewett, it did so.

Hewett was able to commingle public (Museum) and private (SAR) resources as he saw fit, but the arrangement was a matter of concern and in 1959 the two institutions were forced to separate. Today, the Museum of New Mexico is a subdivision of the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs.

Hewett remarried in 1911, to Donizetta Jones Wood, who would survive him. During this period he continued to do field work, his growing reputation ensuring that he would be invited to join expeditions ranging far beyond the Southwest. He also continued his politicking; not satisfied with Bandelier National Monument (even though it expanded beyond the land in the original proclamation), he continued to lobby for creation of a Pajarito National Park. Nothing came of this advocacy, however.&lt;ref name="thompson-ray"/&gt;

As time passed, Hewett's academic credentials came to be more recognized, and he spent time and effort building academic archaeology in the western United States. He organized archaeology and anthropology departments at the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[University of Southern California]]. The UNM department, where Hewett spent much of the latter part of his life, would eventually become one of the world's best known. While at UNM, Hewett founded the Museum of Anthropology of the University of New Mexico, which would later become the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]].&lt;!-- Statement about MNM passing to UNM control deleted. The Museum of NM is not, and never has been, a part of UNM. --Dave Phillips--&gt;

His collaborations with other archaeologists also increased with the passage of time. By 1910 he was collaborating with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] on work in Frijoles Canyon; [[Neil Judd]] was one of the students there. By 1915 he was director of exhibits for the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]] in [[San Diego]], responsible for assembling the central exhibit "The Story of Man through the Ages". This led in turn to his assuming directorship of the [[San Diego Museum of Man]], which was created as a permanent institution from the exposition's collections established by Hewett. This museum survives today as one of the institutions in San Diego's [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]] district.&lt;ref name="rothman-hal"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rothman, Hal K. | title=On Rims &amp; Ridges | publisher=University of Nebraska Press | year=1992 | isbn=0-8032-3901-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewett's increasing ties to university life exposed him to the "[[publish or perish]]" mindset of [[academia]], and here the results were less flattering to Hewett than many of his earlier activities. Much of his later work, or at least his publications, became somewhat repetitive. His 1943 book ''Ancient Life in the American Southwest'', cited below, amounts to a rehashing of a lifetime of archaeology without contributing anything new, and most of it could have been written at least 20 years earlier. Its tone also strikes the modern reader as annoyingly patronizing to (yet still respectful of) the people he studied, but Hewett was, after all, a product of his times.&lt;ref name="fowler-don"/&gt;

== Later years ==

Hewett continued to work as a field archaeologist practically until his death. However, by the 1930s his basically romantic approach to field work was looking like more and more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name="fowler-don"/&gt; His responsibilities at the University of New Mexico grew less demanding (and conspicuous) over time, although he retained directorship of the Chaco Canyon field school, a particular favorite of his, until 1937. He continued in his roles at the SAR and the Museum of New Mexico until the last year of his life, chairing the joint meeting of the managing board in August 1946.

Edgar Lee Hewett died on December 31, 1946. His ashes are interred at the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]] in [[Santa Fe (New Mexico)|Santa Fe]], one of the units of the Museum of New Mexico that he helped create, next to those of his long-time friend and supporter [[Alice Fletcher]].

'''Experimental phonetics''' is the branch of general [[phonetics]] that deals with the study of the [[sound]]s and other human [[speech]] units by applying the [[experimental method]]. This scientific field covers basic areas of phonetics - articulatory phonetics, acoustic phonetics and auditory phonetics. Moreover, experimental method used in study of the [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] phonetics and [[suprasegmental]] phonetics, in exploration of the typological phonetics.
Experimental phonetics is used to test theories or hypotheses in order to support or disprove them.

'''Expression''' (Lat. expressio) in [[architecture]] implies a clear and authentic displaying of the [[Character structure|character]] or personality of an individual ([[architect]]). The expression is often identified with the [[architectural]] movement of [[expressionism]], whose main starting point and aim is to present and express what has been âseenâ or [[experienced]] in the inner eye of the mind, heart and soul, i.e. to express the [[subjectivity|subjective]] moods and [[feelings]] without referring to conventional and âobjectiveâ values, judgments and truths. 

==Meaning==
The main problem in the [[critical analysis]] of the theoretical [[Aesthetic interpretation|interpretation]]s of the [[concept]] of expression in architecture, lies in the fact that the concept of expression is used in different ways in different fields of [[science]] and art. Regarding the [[concept]] of expression, the following interpretations can often be found:
*an activity or way of transforming an idea into words; 
*showing [[emotions]], [[feelings]] etc.;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J. (2007). Expression and expressiveness in art. ''[[Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics]]'', 4 (2), 19-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*conveying emotions by way of music, images etc.; 
*[[facial expression]] showing mood or emotion; 
*choice of words, [[phrases]], [[syntax]], [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] etc., in communication;&lt;ref&gt;ToÅ¡oviÄ, B. (2004). Ekspresivnost. Stil, 3, 25-61.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*a specific [[phrase]] commonly used to express something etc. 
In the widest sense, the [[concept]] of expression refers to the activity undertaken with a specific [[intention]]. However, what is the aim of expressing something will depend on the field in which the term is used.&lt;ref&gt;Alfirevic, Dj. (2011). Visual Expression in Architecture. Arhitektura i urbanizam, 31, 3-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this is mind, some authors emphasize the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] or spontaneous character of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood, R. G. The Principles of Art. New York: Oxford University Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wenninger, R. (2005). Individual Style after the End of Art. Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics, 2 (3), 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt; while others emphasize its [[cognitive]] aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Dilworth, J. (2004). Artistic Expression and Interpretation. [[British Journal of Aesthetics]], 44 (1), 10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
Expression can also be defined as part of the [[communication]] process which consists of two complementary components, expression (transmitted information) and impression (received information).&lt;ref&gt;Argan Ä.K., Oliva Akile B. (1970). Modern Art 1770-1970-2000. Belgrade: CLIO, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Robinson, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{slavery}}

The institution of [[slavery]] in North America existed from the earliest years of the colonial period until 1865 when the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] permanently abolished slavery throughout the entire United States. It was also abolished among the sovereign [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] in [[Indian Territory]] by new peace treaties which the US required after the war.

For most of the seventeenth and part of the eighteenth centuries, male slaves outnumbered female slaves, making the two groups' experiences in the colonies distinct. Living and working in a wide range of circumstances and regions, African-American women and men encountered diverse experiences of enslavement. With increasing numbers of kidnapped African women, as well as those born into slavery in the colonies, slave sex ratios leveled out between 1730 and 1750. "The uniqueness of the African-American female's situation is that she stands at the crossroads of two of the most well-developed ideologies in America, that regarding women and that regarding the Negro."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Deborah Gray|title=Arân't I a Woman (''sic'')|year=1999|location=New York City|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living both female and black identities, enslaved African women faced both racism and sexism.

{{main|History of slavery in Virginia}}
[[File:SlaveDanceand Music.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[The Old Plantation]]'', c. 1790. Enslaved Africans on a South Carolinan plantation.]]
From 1700 to 1740 an estimated number of 43,000 slaves were imported into Virginia, and almost all but 4,000 were imported directly from Africa.&lt;ref name="Saxton p. 121"&gt;Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 121&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship suggests that the number of women and men imported in this period was more or less equal and included a high number of children.&lt;ref name="Saxton p. 121" /&gt; As most were from West Africa, its cultures were central in mid- to late- eighteenth-century slave life in Virginia.  African values were prevalent and West African women's cultures had strong representations. Some prevalent cultural representations were the deep and powerful bonds between mother and child, and among women within the larger female community.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Martha, ''Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America,'' New York City, 2003, 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] ethnic group in particular (from present-day [[Nigeria]]), which comprised between one-third and one-half of incoming slaves in the early eighteenth century, female authority (the omu) "ruled on a wide variety of issues of important to women in particular and the community as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  The Igbo represented one group of people brought to the Chesapeake, but in general, Africans came from an extremely diverse range of cultural backgrounds. All came from worlds where women's communities were strong,&lt;ref&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  and were introduced into a patriarchal and violently racist and exploitative society; white men typically characterized all black women as passionately sexual, to justify their sexual abuse and miscegenation.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia girls, much less black girls, were not educated, and most were illiterate. African and African American female slaves occupied a broad range of positions. The southern colonies were majorly agrarian societies and enslaved women provided labor in the fields, planting and doing chores, but mostly in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], nursing, taking care of children, cooking, laundering, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutagarama |first=Naomi |title=Female Slavery In The South |url=http://prezi.com/v46ikdnnanma/female-slavery-in-the-south/ |publisher=Prezi |accessdate=12/09/13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211230611/http://prezi.com/v46ikdnnanma/female-slavery-in-the-south/ |archivedate=2013-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England ===
[[File:Jersey Negro (1748), John Greenwood.jpg|thumbnail|left|Jersey Negro (1748), [[John Greenwood (artist)|John Greenwood]]. This portrait of Ann Arnold was the first individual portrait of a black woman in North America. Ann Arnold was the wet nurse of a child whose parents were born in the English isle of [[Jersey]].  [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].]]
Historian [[Ira Berlin]] distinguished between "slave societies" and "societies with slaves." New England was considered to be a society with slaves, dependent on maritime trade and diversified agriculture, in contrast to the slave societies of the south, which were "socially, economically, and politically dependent on slave labor, had a large enslaved population, and allowed masters extensive power over their slaves unchecked by the law."&lt;ref name="Adams p. 29"&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. "The Uniqueness of New England," Love of Freedom, New York, City, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  New England had a small slave population and masters thought of themselves as patriarchs with the duty to protect, guide, and care for their slaves.&lt;ref name="Adams p. 29" /&gt; Enslaved women in New England had greater opportunity to seek freedom than in other regions because of "the New England legal system, the frequency of manumission by owners, and chances for hiring out, especially among enslaved men, who seized the opportunity to earn enough money to purchase a wife and children."&lt;ref name="Adams p. 30"&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. "The Uniqueness of New England," Love of Freedom, New York, City, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enslaved women largely occupied traditional "women's work" roles and were often hired out by the day. They worked mainly as maids, in the kitchen, the barn, and the garden. They did menial and servile tasks: polished family silver or furniture, helped with clothes and hair, drew baths, barbered the men, and completed menial domestic chores like sweeping, emptying chamber pots, carrying gallons of water a day, washing the dishes, brewing, looking after young children and the elderly, cooking and baking, milking the cows, feeding the chickens, spinning, knitting, carding, sewing, and laundering.&lt;ref name="Adams p. 30" /&gt;  Their daily work was less demanding than the field labor of enslaved women in other regions. Nonetheless enslaved women in New England worked hard, often under poor living conditions and malnutrition. "As a result of heavy work, poor housing conditions, and inadequate diet, the average black woman did not live past forty."&lt;ref name="Adams p. 35"&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. "The Uniqueness of New England," Love of Freedom, New York, City, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enslaved women were given to white women as gifts from their husbands, and as wedding and Christmas gifts.&lt;ref name="Adams p. 35" /&gt;  The idea that New England masters treated their slaves with greater kindness in comparison to southern slave-owners is a myth. They had little mobility freedom and lacked access to education and any training. "The record of slaves who were branded by their owners, had their ears nailed, fled, committed suicide, suffered the dissolution of their families, or were sold secretly to new owners in Barbados in the last days of the Revolutionary War before they become worthless seems sufficient to refute the myth of kindly masters. They lashed out at their slaves when they were angry, filled with rage, or had convenient access to horsewhip."&lt;ref name="Adams p. 36"&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. "The Uniqueness of New England," Love of Freedom, New York, City, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Female slaves were sometimes forced by their masters into sexual relationships with enslaved men for the purpose of [[Forced pregnancy|forced breeding]]. It was also not uncommon for enslaved women to be raped and in some cases impregnated by their masters.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Southern colonies ===
No matter where they lived, slaves endured hard and demeaning lives, but labor in the southern colonies was most severe. The southern colonies were slave societies; they were "socially, economically, and politically dependent on slave labor, had a large enslaved population, and allowed masters extensive power over their slaves unchecked by the law."&lt;ref name="Adams p. 29" /&gt;  Plantations were the economic power structure of the South, and male and female slave labor was its foundation. Early on, slaves in the South worked primarily in agriculture, on farms and plantations growing indigo, rice, and tobacco; cotton became a major crop after the 1790s. Female slaves worked in a wide variety of capacities. They were expected to do field work as well as have children, and in this way increase the slave population. In the years before the American Revolution, the female slave population grew mainly as a result of natural increase and not importation. "Once slaveholders realized that the reproductive function of the female slave could yield a profit, the manipulation of procreative sexual relations became an integral part of the sexual exploitation of female slaves."&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Ar'n't I a Woman, New York City,'' 1999, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many slave women raised their children without much assistance from males. Enslaved women were counted on not only to do their house and field work, but also to bear, nourish, and rear the children whom slaveholders sought to continually replenish their labor force.  As houseslaves, women were domestic servants: cooking, sewing, acting as maids, and rearing the planter's children. Later on they were used in many factories, instrumental in the development of the United States, where they were kept at lower maintenance costs.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Revolutionary Era==
{{main|African Americans in the Revolutionary War}}

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] (1775â83) enslaved women served on both sides, the Loyalist army as well as the Patriots', as nurses, laundresses, and cooks. But as historian Carol Berkin writes, "African American loyalties were to their own future, not to Congress or to king."&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enslaved women could be found in army camps and as [[camp followers]]. They worked building roads, constructing fortifications, and laundering uniforms, "but they remained slaves rather than refugees. Masters usually hired these women out to the military, sometimes hiring out their children as well."&lt;ref name="Berkin p. 131"&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enslaved women could also be found working in the shops, homes, fields, and plantations of every American colony. It is estimated that by 1770, there were more than 47,000 enslaved blacks in the northern colonies, almost 20,000 of them in New York. More than 320,000 slaves worked in the Chesapeake colonies, making 37 percent of the population of the region African or African American. Over 187,000 of these slaves were in Virginia. In the Lower South there were more than 92,000 slaves. South Carolina alone had over 75,000 slaves, and by 1770 planters there were importing 4,000 Africans a year. In many counties in the Lower South, the slave population outnumbered the white.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although service in the military did not guarantee enslaved people their freedom, black men had the opportunity to escape slavery by enlisting in the army. During the disruption of war, both men and women ran away. Men were more likely to escape, as pregnant women, mothers, and women who nursed their elderly parents or friends seldom abandoned those who depended on them.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;  So many slaves deserted their plantations in South Carolina, that there were not enough field hands to plant or harvest crops. As food grew scarce, the blacks who remained behind suffered from starvation or enemy attack. The British issued certificates of manumission to more than 914 women as reward for serving in the Loyalist army.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  But many women who had won their freedom lost it again "through violence and trickery and the venality of men entrusted with their care."&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others who managed to secure their freedom faced racial prejudice, discrimination, and poverty. When loyalist plantations were captured, enslaved women were often taken and sold for the soldiers' profit.&lt;ref name="Berkin p. 131" /&gt; The British did keep promises to black slaves, evacuating them along with troops in the closing days of the war, and resettling more than 3,000 [[Black Loyalists]] in [[Nova Scotia]], and others in the Caribbean, and England. In 1792 it established [[Freetown]], in what is now [[Sierra Leone]], as a colony for Poor Blacks from London, as well as Black Loyalists from Canada who wanted to relocate.

One of the most well-known voices for freedom around the Revolutionary era was [[Phillis Wheatley]] of Massachusetts. She was a slave for most of her life but was given freedom by her master. Educated in Latin, Greek, and English, Wheatley wrote a collection of poems which asserted that Africans, as children of God just like Europeans, deserved respect and freedom.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1777, Vermont drafted a state constitution that prohibited the institution of slavery. In 1780 Massachusetts a state judge declared slavery to be unconstitutional according to the state's new bill of rights, which declared "all men...free and equal." Slavery effectively ended in Massachusetts with this ruling in a [[freedom suit]] by [[Quock Walker]]. This led to an increase of enslaved men and women suing for their freedom in New England. Also in 1780 in Pennsylvania, the legislature enacted "a gradual emancipation law that directly connected the ideals of the Revolution with the rights of the African Americans to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the South, the immediate legacy of the Revolution was increased [[manumission]] by slaveholders in the first two decades after the war. But, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] enabled widespread cultivation of short-staple cotton, and with the opening up of southwestern lands to cotton and sugar production, demand for slaves increased. Legislatures made emancipation difficult to gain, and they passed harsher laws regulating African-American lives.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, "African American Women and the American Revolution," ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antebellum Period==
[[File:Crowe-Slaves Waiting for Sale - Richmond, Virginia.jpg|thumbnail|left|"Slaves Waiting for Sale." Women and children slaves wait to be sold in Richmond, Virginia in the 19th century. Painted upon the sketch of 1853.]]
As historian Deborah Gray White explains, "Black in a white society, slave in a free society, woman in a society ruled by men, female slaves had the least formal power and were perhaps the most vulnerable group of Americans."&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Arân't I a Woman, New York City,'' 1999, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother-daughter relationship was often the most enduring and cherished within the African-American complex of relations.&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Arân't I a Woman'', New York City, 1999, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatively few women were runaways, and when they did run, they sometimes escaped with their children.  Historian [[Martha Saxton]] writes about enslaved mothers' experiences in St. Louis in the antebellum period: "In Marion County, north of St. Louis, a slave trader bought three small children from an owner, but the children's mother killed them all and herself rather than let them be taken away. A St. Louis trader took a crying baby from its mother, both on their way to be sold, and made a gift of it to a white woman standing nearby because its noise was bothering him."&lt;ref name="Saxton p. 185"&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Another way these generational connections can be seen, is through song. Often songs about slavery and women's experiences during their enslavement were passed down through generations.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gale P., âRosy, Possum, Morning Star: African American Womenâs Work and Play Songsâ: An Excerpt From Put Your Hands on Your Hips and Act Like a Woman: Song, Dance, Black History and Poetics in Performance. Journal of Black Studies Vol. 46(8) 2015: 773-796.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African-American Women Work Songs]] are historical snapshots of lived experience and survival.&lt;ref&gt;Hill Collins, Patricia. Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment. New York: Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Songs speak of families being torn apart and the emotional turmoil that enslaved women were put through by slavery. Songs add the legacy of oral tradition that fosters generational knowledge about historical periods. 
Little girls as young as seven were frequently sold away from their mothers: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mary Bell was hired out by the year to take care of three children starting when she was seven. John Mullanphy noted that he had living with him a four-year-old mulatto girl, whom he willed to the Sisters of Charity in the event of his death. George Morton sold his daughter Ellen 'a certain Mulatto girl a slave about fourteen years of age named Sally, being the child of a certain Negro woman named Ann'."&lt;ref name="Saxton p. 185"/&gt; In 1854 Georgia was the first and only state to pass a law that put conditions of sales that separated mothers and their children. Children under five could not be sold away from their mothers, "unless such division cannot in any wise be [e]ffected without such separation.'"&lt;ref name="Saxton p. 185" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Ellen Craft escaped slave.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|In 1848 [[Ellen Craft]], of mixed-race, posed as a white man to escape from slavery.]]
Slave girls in North America often worked within the domestic sphere, providing household help. White families sought the help of a "girl", an "all-purpose tool" in family life.&lt;ref name="Saxton p. 186"&gt;Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 186&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the word "girl" applied to any working female without children, slaves were preferred because in the long run they cost less. These enslaved girls were usually very young, anywhere from nine years of age to their mid-teens. Heavy household work was assigned to the "girl" and was therefore stigmatized as "negroesâ" work. A "girl" was an essential source of help to white families, rural and urban, middle class and aspiring. She provided freedom for daughters to devote themselves to their self-development and relieved mothers from exhausting labor, while requiring no financial or emotional maintenance, "no empathy."&lt;ref name="Saxton p. 186" /&gt;

In antebellum America, as in the past (from the initial African-European contact in North America), black women were deemed to be governed by their libidos and portrayed as "Jezebel character[s]...in every way the counterimage of the mid-nineteenth-century ideal of the Victorian lady."&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Arân't I a Woman,'' New York City, 1999, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enslaved women in every state of the antebellum union considered freedom, but it was a livelier hope in the North than in most of the South. Many slaves sought their freedom through self-purchase, the legal system of [[freedom suits]], and as runaways, sometimes resulting in the separation of children and parents. "Unfinished childhoods and brutal separations punctuated the lives of most African American girls, and mothers dreamed of freedom that would not impose more losses on their daughters."&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Martha, ''Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America,'' New York City, 2003, 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antebellum South===
[[File:Eastman Johnson - Negro Life at the South - ejb - fig 67 - pg 120.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Eastman Johnson]]'s 1859 painting "[[Negro Life at the South]]" subtly portrays relationships of white male masters and their female slaves.]]

After the Revolution, Southern plantation owners imported a massive number of new slaves from Africa and the Caribbean until the United States [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|banned the import of slaves]] in 1808. More importantly, more than one million slaves were transported in a forced migration in the domestic slave trade, from the Upper South to the Deep South, most by slave tradersâeither overland where they were held for days in chained coffles, or by the [[coastwise trade]] and ships. The majority of slaves in the Deep South, men and women, worked on cotton plantations. Cotton was the leading cash crop during this time, but slaves also worked on rice, corn, sugarcane, and tobacco plantations, clearing new land, digging ditches, cutting and hauling wood, slaughtering livestock, and making repairs to buildings and tools. Black women also cared for their children and managed the bulk of the housework and domestic chores. Living with the dual burdens of racism and sexism, enslaved women in the South held roles within the family and community that contrasted sharply with more traditional or upper class American women's roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Debra|title=Ar'n't I a Woman ''(sic)''|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/arnt-i-a-woman-deborah-gray-white/1111826123?ean=9780393343526|accessdate=12/09/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young girls generally started working well before boys, with many working before age seven.&lt;ref&gt;Steckel, Richard, "Women, Work, and Health Under Plantation Slavery in the United States," ''More than Chattel''. Indiana University Press, 1996, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although field work was traditionally considered to be "men's work," different estimates conclude that between 63-80 percent of women worked in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;Steckel, Richard, "Women, Work, and Health Under Plantation Slavery in the United States," ''More than Chattel''. Indiana University Press, 1996, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adult female work depended greatly upon plantation size. On small farms, women and men performed similar tasks, while on larger plantations, males were given more physically demanding work. Few of the chores performed by enslaved women took them off the plantation. Therefore they were less mobile than enslaved men, who often assisted their masters in the transportation of crops, supplies, and other materials, and were often hired out as artisans and craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. [[Arân't I a Woman]], New York City, 1999, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Women also worked in the domestic sphere as servants, cooks, seamstresses, and nurses. Although a female slave's labor in the field superseded childrearing in importance, the responsibilities of childbearing and childcare greatly circumscribed the life of an enslaved woman. This also explains why female slaves were less likely to run away than men.&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. [[Arân't I a Woman]], New York City, 1999, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many female slaves were the object of severe [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]]; often bearing the children of their white masters, master's sons, or overseers. Black women were prohibited from defending themselves against any type of abuse, including sexual, at the hands of white men. If a slave attempted to defend herself, she was often subjected to further beatings by the master or even by the mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/05intersection/Gender/rape.htm |title=The Realities of Enslaved Female Africans in America |publisher=Academic.udayton.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The black female, woman or child, was forced into sexual relationships for the white slave master's pleasure and profit; attempting to keep the slave population growing by his own doing, and not by importing more slaves from Africa. Even Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, is believed to have fathered six mixed-race children (four survived to adulthood) with one of his female slaves, [[Sally Hemings]], a woman of three-quarters European ancestry and half-sister to his late wife, who served as the widower's [[concubine]] for more than two decades. In the case of [[Harriet Ann Jacobs]], author of ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]],'' her master, Dr. James Norcom, had sexually harassed her for years. Even after she had two children of her own, he threatened to sell them if she denied his sexual advances.{{citation needed|date= April 2013}}

==Emancipation and the ending of slavery==
{{main|Emancipation Proclamation}}

Slavery was abolished in the United States in 1865, with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]]. The decree offered enslaved men a path to freedom through military service. However it wasn't until the Act of 1861 where women found their freedom as they were no longer declared property of the Confederates in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Du Bois's Black Reconstruction and Slave Women's War for Freedom|last = Glymph|first = Thavolia|date = Summer 2013|journal = South Atlantic Quarterly|volume = 112|issue = 3|pages = 489|doi = 10.1215/00382876-2146431|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] extended citizenship rights to African Americans.{{cite web | url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/powers13th14th15th.htm | title= The Powers of Congress to Enforce the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments | publisher =University of Missouri - Kansas City, School of Law |date=April 27, 2013}}

* [[Lucy Terry]] (c. 1730â1821) is the author of the oldest known work of literature by an African American.
* [[Phillis Wheatley]] (May 8, 1753 â December 5, 1784) was the first African-American poet and first African-American woman to publish a book.
* [[Margaret Garner]] (called Peggy) was an enslaved African American woman in pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] United States who was notoriousâor celebratedâfor killing her own daughter after being captured following her escape, rather than allowing the child to be returned to slavery.
* [[Sojourner Truth]] (c.â1797 â November 26, 1883) was the self-given name, from 1843 onward, of Isabella Baumfree, an African-American [[abolitionist]] and women's rights activist. Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, [[Ulster County, New York]]. In 1826, she escaped with her infant daughter to freedom. After going to court to recover her son, she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. Her best-known extemporaneous speech on gender inequalities, "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]", was delivered in 1851 at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in [[Akron, Ohio]]. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves.
* [[Harriet Tubman]] (born Araminta Harriet Ross; 1820 â March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made more than thirteen missions to rescue more than 70 slaves; she guided refugees along the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the [[Underground Railroad]]. She later helped [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] recruit men for his [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid on Harpers Ferry]], and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage.
* [[Ellen Craft]] (1826â1897) was a slave from [[Macon, Georgia]] who posed as a white male planter to escape from slavery. She escaped to the North in December 1848 by travelling openly by train and steamboat with her husband, who acted as her slave servant; they reached Philadelphia and freedom on Christmas Day.

'''GLSEN''' (formerly the '''Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network''') is a [[United States]]-based education organization working to create safe and inclusive [[Kâ12 (education)|K-12]] schools. Founded in 1990 in Boston, Massachusetts, GLSEN's mission states the organization seeks to end [[discrimination]], [[harassment]], and [[bullying]] based on [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[gender expression]] in K-12 schools. In recognition that a more inclusive name was needed, the organization no longer uses its former full name and is commonly known today as GLSEN. The organization is headquartered in [[New York City]] and an office of public policy based in [[Washington, D.C.]] GLSEN focuses its efforts on the support and opportunities provided by the four pillars of safety, respect, health, and leadership. Through programs, research, policy, training, and resource development work, GLSEN has built a network of 39 GLSEN Chapters in 26 states, 20,000 educators, and more than 8,000 registered student clubs.

{{As of|2018|post=,}} there are 39 chapters across the 26 states that train 5,000 students, educators, and school personnel each year.&lt;ref name="GLSEN chapters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glsen.org/chapters |title=GLSEN chapters |date= |accessdate=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapters also support more than 4,000 registered school-based clubs, commonly known as [[gayâstraight alliance]]s (GSAs), which work to address anti-LGBTQ name-calling, bullying, and harassment in their schools.   GLSEN also sponsors and participates in a host of annual "Days of Action", including GLSEN's [[Day of Silence]] every April, GLSEN's [[Ally Week]] every September, and GLSEN's No Name-Calling Week every January.

Guided by research such as GLSEN's ''National School Climate Survey'', GLSEN has developed resources, [[lesson plans]], classroom materials, and [[professional development]] programs for teachers on how to support [[LGBTQ]] students, such as "Safe Schools" training.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.glsen.org/safespace GLSEN Safe Space Kit: Be an ALLY to LGBTQQ Youth!]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ready, Set, Respect!'', ''Safe Space kits'', and program guides for all the days of action. Safe Schools training and various other professional development opportunities have been facilitated by more than 200 GLSEN trainers to over 5,000 educators and school personnel each year.   ''Ready, Set, Respect!'' is an elementary school toolkit developed to help educators ensure that all students feel safe and respected.  ''GLSENâs Safe Space Kit'', which has been distributed to over 63,000 schools in the country, provides educators with a guide for supporting LGBTQ students, as well as Safe Space stickers and posters.

Many LGBTQ students, in response to victimization, avoid school altogether, which can strain their performance and lead to academic failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmer |first1=Neal A. |last2=Greytak |first2=Emily A. |title=LGBTQ Student Victimization and Its Relationship to School Discipline and Justice System Involvement |journal=[[Criminal Justice Review]] |date=17 May 2017 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=163â187 |doi=10.1177/0734016817704698 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GLSEN has advocated that one of the most effective ways for schools, districts and states to improve their school climates and to make their schools safer and more affirming is to enact LGBTQ-inclusive anti-bullying laws and policies. GLSEN has worked with the U.S. Departments of [[United States Department of Education|Education]], [[United States Department of Justice|Justice]], and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] to create model policies that support LGBTQ students and educators, including the first-ever Trans Model Policy, as well as implementation guides to ensure that these policies are considered, passed, and implemented. GLSEN has considered their signature legislation to be the Safe Schools Improvement Act and has been honored by the White House as a âChampion of Changeâ.

== History ==
=== 1990s ===
==== 1990 ====
* [[Kevin Jennings]], a high school history teacher in Massachusetts, leads a coalition of gay and lesbian educators to form what was then called the Gay and Lesbian Independent School Teacher Network (GLISTN). 
* The organization began as a local [[volunteering|volunteer]] group of 70 gay and lesbian educators. At that time, there were two gayâstraight alliances in the nation, only one state with policy in place to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students, and a general lack of awareness of the needs of LGBTQ students. There were few, if any, resources available for teachers to discuss LGBTQ issues. However, groups of concerned individuals began to establish chapters across the country, advocating locally and regionally for safe schools for students who were, or were perceived to be LGBTQ.

==== 1993 ====
* The Governor's Commission releases its report, ''Making Schools Safe for Gay and Lesbian Youth''. The report leads to the formation of a statewide program â the Safe Schools Program for Gay and Lesbian Students (now the Safe Schools Program for LGBTQ Students) â the first of its kind in the country.

==== 1994 ====
* GLSTN became a national organization with the founding of the first chapter&lt;ref name="GLSEN chapters"/&gt; outside Massachusetts in St. Louis.
* GLSTN launches the first [[LGBT History Month]] in October with official proclamations from the governors of [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]].

==== 1995 ====
* GLSTN hired its first full-time staff person, GLSEN's founder and Executive Director [[Kevin Jennings]]. 
* GLSTN accredits Chapters for the first time.&lt;ref name="GLSEN chapters"/&gt;

==== 1997 ====
* GLSTN staged its first national conference in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], in response to the legislature's effort to prevent the formation of GSAs in the state by banning all student groups. 
* GLSTN changed its name to GLSEN (the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network) in order to more reflect the importance of straight educators in shaping safe schools.
* Kevin Jennings meets with President [[Bill Clinton]] at the White House to discuss anti-LGBT bias in America's schoolsâthe first meeting of its kind in the Executive Office of the United States.

==== 1998 ====
* ''Out of the Past'', a GLSEN-sponsored documentary developed as a resource for high school history classes, wins the Audience Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and is broadcast nationally on [[PBS]]. [[Eliza Byard]], the film's co-producer, would become GLSEN's Deputy Executive Director in 2001.

==== 1999 ====
* GLSEN conducts the National School Climate Surveyâthe first and only national study regularly documenting the experiences of LGBT youth in schools.  The survey is conducted and published biennially.
* GLSEN, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and a coalition of national education, mental health, and religious organizations release ''Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts.pdf|title= Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides authoritative statements about how â[[conversion therapy]]â is harmful to youth. Sixteen years later, President [[Barack Obama]] would call for an end to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/08/obama-lgbt-conversion-therapy_n_7029648.html|title= Obama calls for an end to conversion therapy|date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
==== 2000 ====
* The Chicago chapter of GLSEN was inducted into the [[Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017032241/http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year |archivedate=2015-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2001 ====
* Students ask GLSEN to become the first national sponsor of the Day of Silence. Participation grows from hundreds of college students to thousands of middle and high school youth.

==== 2002 ====
* GLSEN begins a partnership with the [[National Education Association]], which asks school districts to protect LGBTQ students and staff by adopting policies that protect students from bullying and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.

==== 2003 ====
* U.S. Representative [[Linda SÃ¡nchez]] introduces the Safe Schools Improvement Act,&lt;ref name="SSIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glsen.org/article/safe-schools-improvement-act-s-311hr-2902 |title= SSIA|date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; an LGBT-inclusive federal anti-bullying bill that includes protections for sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.

==== 2004 ====
* GLSEN's No Name-Calling Week launches as an annual week of educational activities aimed at ending name-calling of all kinds. 
* Vermont becomes the first state to pass an LGBT-inclusive anti-bullying law that includes protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.

==== 2005 ====
* GLSEN and [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] release ''From Teasing to Torment: School Climate in America, A Survey of Students and Teachers,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glsenboston.org/GLSENFromTeasingToTorment.pdf |title=From Teasing to Torment: School Climate in America, A Survey of Students and Teachers |date=2005 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first national study of the general population of secondary students and teachers to address LGBT issues. This study documents disparities between LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ students and finds that LGBT students were more than three times as likely to not feel safe at school. 
* GLSEN's Jump-Start National Student Leadership Team develops an idea that turns into the first Ally Week that is now in schools nationwide every October.

==== 2006 ====
* GLSEN launches the âThink Before You Speakâ public service announcement initiative with the Ad Council, the nonprofit advertising company's first LGBT-focused campaign.

==== 2007 ====
* GLSEN helps develop the [[New York City Department of Education]]'s âRespect for Allâ initiative.

==== 2008 ====
* [[Murder of Larry King|Lawrence King is murdered]] by his eighth-grade classmate at E.O. Green Junior High in [[Oxnard, California]]. GLSEN's Day of Silence is held in Larry's honor as students from more than 8,000 schools participate. 
* Lance Bass films a public service announcement in the GLSEN office that is viewed more than 300,000 times on [[YouTube]].
* GLSEN releases, ''The Principalâs Perspective: School Safety, Bullying and Harassment,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/The%20Principals%20Perspective.pdf |date=2008 |title=The Principalâs Perspective: School Safety, Bullying and Harassment |accessdate=2015-11-11 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; a report conducted in collaboration with the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]]. This survey of K-12 public school principals reveals that a minority of principals believed LGBTQ students would feel very safe at their school, and yet very few reported that their school provided any sort of professional development or training for educators that addressed LGBTQ issues.

==== 2009 ====
* Eleven-year-old Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover takes his life after enduring anti-gay bullying at school. His mother, Sirdeaner Walker, becomes a GLSEN spokesperson and later joins GLSEN's National Board of Directors.
* GLSEN releases ''Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nationâs Schools,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/Harsh%20Realities.pdf|title= Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nationâs Schools|date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization's first report that focuses specifically on the experiences of transgender students. The study finds that transgender youth face much higher levels of harassment and violence than LGB cisgender students, and as a result, miss more school, receive lower grades and feel more isolated from their school community.
* GLSEN releases, ''Shared Differences: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Students of Color in our Nationâs Schools.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/Shared%20Differences.pdf|title= Shared Differences: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Students of Color in our Nationâs Schools.|date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study focuses specifically on the school experiences of LGBTQ students of color and provides insight into the ways in which LGBTQ studentsâ school experiences differ based on race or ethnicity. The report finds that the majority of LGBTQ students of color faced both LGBTQ-based harassment and race-based harassment at school.

The campaign goes on to place a Safe Space Kit in every school in the United States.

==== 2011 ====
* GLSEN's Executive Director Eliza Byard participates in the first-ever [[United Nations]] international consultation to address anti-LGBT bullying in schools.
* Several representatives from GLSEN attend the White House Conference on Bullying Prevention, pressing for effective federal action to address bullying, and highlighting bullying prevention programs and approaches that benefit all students.

* The White House names GLSEN a âChampion of Changeâ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=33519|title= White House honors GLSEN|date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; honoring the organization's two decades of work to fight bullying, violence, and stigma directed at LGBTQ people in K-12 schools and for GLSEN's efforts to prevent suicide among at-risk youth.
* GLSEN, the [[Anti-Defamation League]], and National Public Radio's [[StoryCorps]] launch âUnheard Voices,â an oral history and curriculum project that will help educators integrate LGBTQ history, people and issues into their instructional programs.

==== 2012 ====
* GLSEN releases ''Strengths and Silences: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Students in Rural and Small Town Schools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/Strengths%20%26%20Silences.pdf |title=Strengths and Silences: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Students in Rural and Small Town Schools |date=2012 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report documents the experiences of more than 2,300 LGBTQ students who attend secondary schools in rural areas. Findings demonstrate that compared to LGBTQ students in urban and suburban areas, LGBTQ students in rural schools are more likely to hear negative comments about gender expression and sexual orientation; feel unsafe at their schools due to their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, and experience verbal and physical harassment and assault due to these characteristics.
* A [[GuideStar]]/[[Philanthropedia]] survey of 110 experts on LGBTQ issues names GLSEN one of the country's top three LGBTQ nonprofits making significant contributions on a national level.
* GLSEN partners with the leading school mental health professional associations, the [[National Association of School Psychologists]], the [[American School Counselors Association]], the [[School Social Workers Association of America]], and the [[American Council for School Social Workers]], to conduct a national study of school mental health professionals on their preparation and practices related to LGBTQ youth in schools.

* The [[Office for Civil Rights]] in the [[U.S. Department of Education]] issues official guidance making clear that transgender students are protected from discrimination under [[Title IX]], stating that âTitle IXâs sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity.â
* The GLSEN National School Climate Survey finds that school climate for LGBTQ students has improved somewhat over the years, yet remains quite hostile for many. LGBTQ students in the survey experienced lower verbal and physical harassment based on sexual orientation than in all prior years, and the lowest physical assault based on sexual orientation since 2007. 
* The Safe Schools Improvement Act,&lt;ref name="SSIA"/&gt; federal legislation that would require schools to adopt LGBTQ-inclusive anti-bullying policies, garners its highest support yet, with 208 bipartisan co-sponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives and 46 in the U.S. Senate.

== Campaigns and programs ==
=== GLSEN's Day of Silence ===
{{Main|Day of Silence}}

GLSEN's [[Day of Silence]] is a national day of action that began at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1996 in which students vow to take a form of silence to call attention to the silencing effect of anti-LGBTQ bullying and harassment in schools. GLSEN's [[Day of Silence]] takes place in 8,000 U.S. schools every year and has spread to more than 60 countries.

=== GLSEN's No Name-Calling Week ===
Every January thousands of elementary and middle schools participate in GLSEN's No Name-Calling Week to end bullying and celebrate kindness. No Name-Calling Week was inspired by the popular young adult novel entitled ''The Misfits'' by popular author [[James Howe]], and is supported by over 60 national partner organizations.

=== GLSEN's Ally Week ===
{{Main|Ally Week}}

Every fall, GLSEN's [[Ally Week]] serves to educate allies about the role they play in creating safer and more inclusive spaces for LGBTQ youth. [[Ally Week]] was started in 2005 by GLSEN's Jump-Start National Student Leadership team.  [[Ally Week]] is supported by over 20 endorsers and provides allies and educators with resources to become stronger allies to LGBTQ youth.

=== Think Before You Speak campaign ===
{{Main|Think Before You Speak (campaign)}}

On October 8, 2008, GLSEN and [[Ad Council]] released the [[Think Before You Speak (campaign)|Think Before You Speak]] campaign, designed to end homophobic vocabulary and raise awareness about the prevalence and consequences of anti-LGBTQ bias and behavior in America's schools among youth, through the use of television, radio, print, and outdoor ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkb4youspeak.com/TheCampaign/ |title=The Campaign |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011074318/http://www.thinkb4youspeak.com/TheCampaign/ |archivedate=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/2008/10/think-before-you-speak/ |title=Think Before You Speak |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The campaign also aimed to raise awareness among adults, school personnel, and parents.  It includes three television [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs), six print PSAs and three radio PSAs. Television commercials for the campaign include singer [[Hilary Duff]] as well as comedian [[Wanda Sykes]]. In 2008 the campaign won the [[Ad Council]]'s Gold Bell award for "Best Public Service Advertising Campaign" from the [[Ad Council]].

=== GLSEN Research ===
GLSEN has been conducting research and evaluation on LGBTQ issues in K-12 education since 1999. GLSEN became the only organization to regularly document the school experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) middle and high school students in the U.S. using GLSEN's National School Climate Survey.  Other research reports GLSEN has put out include ''From Statehouse to Schoolhouse: Anti-Bullying Policies in U.S. States and School Districts'', ''Shared Differences: The Experiences of LGBTQ Students of Color in Our Nation's Schools'',  ''Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools'', as well as many other reports, articles, and book chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glsen.org/research |title=GLSEN Research |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GLSEN National Student Council ===
The GLSEN National Student Council, formerly known as the Student Ambassadors program, is one of GLSEN's student leadership teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glsen.org/participate/student-action/leadership-team|title=GLSEN National Student Council |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102010449/http://www.glsen.org/participate/student-action/leadership-team |archive-date=2015-11-02 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, GLSEN selects a small group of middle and high school students to serve as GLSEN youth representatives for the upcoming school year. Students of the National Student Council advise GLSEN on campaigns, bring GLSEN resources to their schools, represent GLSEN in the media, and have their own work published in local and national outlets. The students of the National Student Council receive interview coaching, media training, and attend workshops with GLSEN staff on public speaking, blogging, social media, policy, and understanding power and privilege.

===GLSEN Chapters===
GLSEN Chapters, with the support and guidance of the national office, work to bring GLSEN programs to their specific communities on a local level. Chapter board members and volunteers are students, educators, parents and community members who volunteer their time to support students and Gay-Straight Alliances, train educators and provide opportunities for everyone to make change in their local schools. GLSEN has 38 volunteer-led GLSEN Chapters in 26 states that work with student leaders, provide professional development for educators, and encourage policymakers to enact LGBTQ-inclusive policies.&lt;ref name="GLSEN chapters"/&gt;

==GLSEN Respect Awards==
GLSEN organizes the annual GLSEN Respect Awards to honor leaders, personalities, and organizations who have made significant contributions to LGBTQ youth. Awards are given to organizations, celebrities, students, educators and [[gayâstraight alliance]]s. Since 2004, there have been over four dozen honorees and over $15 million raised in all.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glsen.org/respect&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glsen.org/press&lt;/ref&gt; The first Respect Awards were in New York in 2004 and honored [[Andrew Tobias]], author and Treasurer of the [[Democratic National Committee]]; [[MTV]]; and student Marina Gatto.

== Fistgate controversy ==
{{main|Fistgate}}

In 2000, the leader of the conservative Parents' Rights Coalition of Massachusetts (now known as [[MassResistance]]) secretly taped one of the 50 workshops in "Teachout 2000", titled "What They Didn't Tell You About Queer Sex and Sexuality in Health Class: Workshop for Youth Only, Ages 14â21".&lt;ref name="Recorded"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fistgate Report |dead-url=yes |accessdate=June 8, 2008 |url=http://www.massnews.com/past_issues/2000/Schools/fistrep.htm |website=Massachusetts News |archive-date=April 7, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407022910/http://www.massnews.com/past_issues/2000/Schools/fistrep.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students discussed sex in a workshop "billed as a ''safe place'' for youths to get their questions about their sexuality answered" in the session's Q&amp;A section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4662">[[File:Giorgio ghisi, mantova, scudo da parata, 1554, 01.JPG|thumb|The Ghisi Shield, Waddesdon Bequest, British Museum, London]]

The '''Ghisi Shield''' is a piece of [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] [[parade armour]] made by the Italian goldsmith and engraver [[Giorgio Ghisi]], signed and dated 1554.  It is part of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]], held by the [[British Museum]] in London since 1898.

The shield is made from a single plate of hammered steel, with its rim turned over a wire.  The decoration on the outer face is [[damascening|damascened]] in gold and partially plated with silver.  It is {{convert|55.8|cm}} in diameter, {{convert|7|cm}} deep, and weighs {{convert|3.8|kg}}.  An inscription on the front of the shield reads, "GEORGIVS DE GHISYS MNTVANZ FA M.D.LIIII".  

Ghisi was an artisan from [[Mantua]], but he was in the Netherlands from about 1550 to about 1555, and the shield was probably made in [[Antwerp]], then under the rule of the [[Habsburg]]s.  It is one of only two surviving pieces of damascened metalwork known to have been made by Ghisi. (The other item is a damaged sword hilt, dated 1570, and now in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in Budapest.)

The intricately decorated shield, damascened with gold and silver, was intended for display, not for use in battle.  It is [[RepoussÃ© and chasing|embossed]] with [[repoussÃ©]] and [[chased]] work in [[high relief]], with a framed central circular scene of battling horseman, surrounded by four [[strapwork]] cartouches containing [[allegory|allegorical]] female figures ([[Victory]], Fame, [[Courage|Fortitude]], [[Prudence]]).  The frames around the five main scenes themselves incorporate detailed images on a much smaller scale, taken from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ancient mythology, inlaid in gold.  Further imagery of birds, foliage, [[putti]], [[satyr]]s and other figures, fills the field between the frames.

The shield may have been designed by a Netherlandish artist, not Ghisi himself: other shields made in the Netherlands in the late 16th century have survived with similar decoration, but none of them demonstrate the accomplished decorative skills of Ghisi.  For example, an iron shield held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna has similar strapwork and embossed imagery with scenes of [[Jason and the Golden Fleece]]; and a similar gilded shield or [[rondache]] at the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in St Petersburg has four allegorical figures (Prudence, Fortitude, Fame, [[Envy]]) arranged in circular cartouches around a circular image of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].   

The Ghisi Shield was sold for Â£1,000 at the AllÃ¨gre sale in Paris in 1863, and then sold in the sale of the [[Demidov Collection]] in Paris in 1870, shortly before the death of [[Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato]], for 1,600,000 francs (about Â£6,400).  It was bought at the Demidov sale by Baron [[Anselm von Rothschild]], and later inherited by his son Baron [[Ferdinand de Rothschild]], who left it to the [[British Museum]] after his death in 1898 as part of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]].

'''Harold Crouch''' (born 1940) is an Australian [[political science]] scholar and author. He has been described as "one of the pre-eminent scholars of Indonesian politics."&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt; Most of his books are published under "Harold Crouch".

==Early and personal life==
Harold Arthur Crouch was born on 18 July 1940 in [[Melbourne]], Australia at the [[Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne|Mercy Hospital]]. His parents, Marjorie Hilda Morris (Crouch) and Harold Crouch, were married in 1934 and lived in [[Elwood, Victoria]], a suburb of Melbourne, at the time of his birth.&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11327807 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=22 July 1940 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10986416 |title=CrouchâMorris. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=7 August 1934 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a sister named Marjorie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22803303 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=9 January 1950 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 he married [[Khasnor Johan]], a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] historian.&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;

==Education==
Crouch began his studies in political science at the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1958. [[William Macmahon Ball]], the "foremost pioneer of Australia's relations with the newly independent countries of Asia", led the department at that time. Crouch received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in political science from the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;

He studied for his master's degree at the [[University of Bombay]] in 1963-65 and in 1966 published his research on Indian trade unions. Crouch was one of the few Australian citizens studying in an Asian university at that time.&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;

Crouch studied for his PhD in Indonesian studies at [[Monash University]] in Melbourne under the supervision of [[Herbert Feith]] who was at that time Australia's "pre-eminent scholar of Indonesian politics".&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt; While teaching at the [[University of Indonesia]] from 1968 to 1971, Crouch gathered information that would be used for his dissertation, which was completed in 1975. The subject of his research was Indonesian politics and the Indonesian army. In 1978 a revised version, ''The Army and Politics in Indonesia'' was published by [[Cornell University Press]].&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;

==Career==
From 1968 until 1971, Crouch taught political science in [[Jakarta]] at the [[University of Indonesia]]. He was from 1976 to 1990 a lecturer in political science at the [[National University of Malaysia]]. For one semester in 1983â1984 he taught at the [[University of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PDGS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pdgs.org/experts/i-crouch.htm | title=Harold A. Crouch | publisher=Partnership for Democratic Governance and Security (PDGS) | accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 he joined the [[Australian National University]]'s Department of Political and Social Change, [[Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies]] in [[Canberra]]. His research as a senior research fellow centered on Southeast Asian politics.&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PDGS" /&gt; He was appointed as professor in 2002 and retired at the end of 2005.

Crouch founded the [[Jakarta]] office of the [[International Crisis Group]] in 2000â2001, after [[Soeharto]]'s resignation. This led to the accumulation of information for his 2010 book, ''Political Reform in Indonesia after [[Soeharto]]'' published by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch" /&gt;

==Legacy==
In the preface of their book ''Soeharto's New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch'', the authors write:
{{Quotation|Professor Crouch has been one of the pre-eminent scholars of Indonesian politics during the New Order period, and he wrote the definitive book on that regime's rise to power. His work did a great dealâperhaps more than that of any other scholarâto allow generations of students and scholars of Indonesian politics to understand the origins of the New Order, and the structures and patterns of political behaviour which sustained it. In the post-Soeharto period, Crouch has continued to be a leading analyst of Indonesian politics, and has recently published a masterful book, ''Political Reform in Indonesia after Soeharto'' on the successes and failures of political reform.|Jamie Mackie, Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy&lt;ref name="Honouring Harold Crouch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/preface.xhtml | title=Preface: Honouring Harold Crouch | publisher=Australian National University | accessdate=6 December 2013 | author=Jamie Mackie, Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Published works==
Crouch published works between 1964 and 2010 predominantly in English, but also in [[Indonesian language|Indonesia]] and [[Dutch language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81-144105 | title=Crouch, Harold A. | publisher=WorldCat | accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaan Kross''' (19 February 1920 â 27 December 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/27/europe/EU-GEN-Estonia-Obit-Kross.php International Herald Tribune: ''Jaan Kross, Estonia's best known writer, dies at 87'']&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Estonians|Estonian]] writer. He was nominated several times for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] during the early 1990s.

==Early life==
Born in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], son of a skilled metal-worker, Jaan Kross studied at Jakob Westholm Grammar School,&lt;ref&gt;Estonian Literature Information Centre article on Jaan Kross&lt;/ref&gt; and attended the [[University of Tartu]] (1938â1945) and graduated from its School of Law. He taught there as a lecturer until 1946, and again as Professor of ''Artes Liberales'' in 1998.

In 1940, when Kross was 20, the Soviet Union invaded and subsequently occupied the three Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, sending all their governments to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;Tannberg and others, pages 238â267&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1941, the Nazi Germans invaded and took over the country, which formed a brief respite for many of the population (except, of course, Estonian Jews) but Estonians soon realised that the German Nazis were as bad as the Soviet Communists. These two powers had after all even had a short-lived truce, when they both signed the [[MolotovâRibbentrop Pact]]. Hitler and Stalin divided up Eastern Europe in a secret protocol within this pact, and the Baltic countries became part of Stalin's share.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Kross was first arrested by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] for six months in 1944 during the German occupation of Estonia (1941â1944), suspected of what was termed "nationalism", i.e. promoting Estonian independence. Then, on 5 January 1946, when Estonia had once again become part of the Soviet Union, he was arrested by the Soviet occupation authorities who kept him a short while in the cellar of the NKVD headquarters, then kept him in prison in Tallinn, finally, in October 1947, deporting him to a [[Gulag]] camp in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], Russia. He spent a total of eight years in this part of North Russia, six working in the mines at the labour camp in [[Inta]], then doing easier jobs, plus two years still living as a deportee, but nevertheless not in a labour camp.&lt;ref&gt;ELIC article on Jaan Kross and ''The Conspiracy and Other Stories'', pages vii and viii, and pages 118â453 of the first volume of his memoirs (op. cit.)&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Estonia in 1954 he became a professional writer, not least because his law studies during Estonian independence were now of no value whatsoever, as Soviet law held sway.

At first Kross wrote poetry, alluding to a number of contemporary phenomena under the guise of writing about historical figures. But he soon moved over to writing prose, a genre that was to become his principal one.

==Career as a writer==

===Recognition and translation===
Kross was by far the most translated and nationally and internationally best-known Estonian writer. He was nominated several times for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] during the early 1990s, and was named a [[People's Writer]] of the [[Estonian SSR]] (1985); he received the [[State Prizes of the Soviet Republics|State Prize of the Estonian SSR]] (1977). He also held several honorary doctorates and international decorations, including the highest Estonian order and one of the highest German orders. In 1999 he was awarded the [[Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature, the Arts and Science|Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature]].

In 1990 Kross won the [[Amnesty International]] [[Golden Flame Prize]].&lt;ref name="International Herald Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Kross' status and visibility as a leading Estonian author, his works have been translated into many languages, but mostly into Finnish, Swedish, Russian, German, and Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;See Bibliografia op.cit.pages 100â139&lt;/ref&gt; This is on account of geographical proximity but also a common history (for example, Estonia was a Swedish colony in the 17th century and German was the language of the upper Ã©chelons of Estonian society for hundreds of years). As can be seen from the list below by the year 2015 there are five books of Kross' works that have been published in English translation with publishing houses in the United States and UK.&lt;ref&gt;See list of publications. The publishing houses are, Harvill (now Harvill Secker), London, and Northwestern University Press, Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; But a number of shorter novels, novellas, and short-stories were published during Soviet times (i.e. 1944â1991) in English translation and published in the Soviet Union.

Translations have mostly been from the Estonian original. Sometimes translations were however done, during Soviet times by first being translated into Russian and then from Russian into English, not infrequently by native-speakers of Russian or Estonian. Nowadays, Kross' works are translated into English either directly from the Estonian, or via the Finnish version. A reasonably complete list of translations of works by Jaan Kross into languages other than English can found on the ELIC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estlit.ee/?id=10992&amp;author=10878|title=ELIC website|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that Kross knew the German language from quite an early age as friends of the family spoke it as their mother-tongue, and Kross' mother had a good command of it. His Russian, however, was mainly learnt the hard way while working as a slave labourer out in the Gulag. But he also had some knowledge of Swedish and translated one crime novel by Christian Steen  (pseudonym of the exile Estonian novelist [[Karl Ristikivi]]) from that Swedish. He also translated works by [[Pierre-Jean de BÃ©ranger]], [[HonorÃ© de Balzac]], and [[Paul Ãluard]] from French, [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Rolf Hochhuth]] from German, [[Ivan Goncharov]] and [[David Samoilov]] from Russian, and ''Alice in Wonderland'', ''Macbeth'' and ''Othello'' from English.

===Content and style===
Kross' novels and short stories are almost universally historical; indeed, he is often credited with a significant rejuvenation of the [[genre]] of the historical novel. Most of his works take place in Estonia and deal, usually, with the relationship of Estonians and [[Baltic German]]s and [[Russians]]. Very often, Kross' description of the historical struggle of the Estonians against the Baltic Germans is actually a [[metaphor]] for the contemporary struggle against the Soviet [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupation]]. However, Kross' acclaim internationally (and nationally even after the regaining of Estonian independence) show that his novels also deal with topics beyond such concerns; rather, they deal with questions of mixed identities, loyalty, and belonging.

Generally, ''[[The Czar's Madman]]'' has been considered Kross' best novel; it is also the most translated one. Also well-translated is ''[[Professor Martens' Departure]]'', which because of its subject matter (academics, expertise, and national loyalty) is very popular in academe and an important "professorial novel". The later novel ''Excavations'', set in the mid-1950s, deals with the ''[[Khrushchev Thaw|thaw]]'' period after [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death as well as with the Danish conquest of Estonia in the [[Middle Ages]], and today considered by several critics as his finest, has not been translated into English yet; it is however available in German.&lt;ref&gt;''Ausgrabungen'', Dipa Verlag, 2002, translator: Cornelius Hasselblatt&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of the historical novel, Kross' novels can be divided up into two types: truly historical ones, and more contemporary narratives with an element of autobiography. In the list below, the truly historical ones, often set in previous centuries, include the ''Between Three Plagues'' tetralogy, set in the 16th century, ''A Rakvere Novel / Romance'' set in the 18th (the title is ambiguous), ''The Czar's Madman'' set in the 19th century, ''Professor Martens' Departure'' set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and ''Elusiveness / Evasion'' set around 1918. The semi-autobiographical novels include Kross' novel about the ultimate fates of his schoolmates, i.e. ''The Wikman Boys'' (Wikman being based on his alma mater the Westholm Grammar School â both names are of Swedish origin) a similar sort of novel about his university chums, ''Mesmer's Circle / Ring''; the novel ''Excavations'' which describes Kross' alter ego Peeter Mirk and his adventures with archaeology, conformism, revolt, compromise and skulduggery after he has returned from the Siberian labour camps and internal exile out there. And also the novel that has appeared in English translation entitled ''Treading Air'', and most of his short-stories belong to this subgenre.

A frequent stylistic leitmotif in Kross' novels is the use of the internal (or inner) monologue, usually when the protagonist is trying to think his way out of a thorny problem. The reader will note that every protagonist or narrator, from Timotheus von Bock in ''The Czar's Madman'' to Kross' two alter egos, Jaak Sirkel and Peeter Mirk in the semi-autobiographical novels, indulges in this. And especially Bernhard Schmidt, the luckless telescope inventor, in the novel that appeared in English as ''Sailing Against the Wind'' (2012).

Another common feature of Kross novels is a comparison, sometimes overt but usually covert, between various historical epochs and the present day, which for much of Kross' writing life consisted of Soviet reality, including censorship, an inability to travel freely abroad, a dearth of consumer goods, the ever-watchful eye of the KGB and informers, etc. Kross was always very skilful at always remaining just within the bounds of what the Soviet authorities could accept. Kross also enjoyed playing with the identities of people who have the same, or nearly the same, name. This occurs in ''Professor Martens' Departure'' where two different Martens-figures are discussed, legal experts who lived several decades apart, and in ''Sailing Against the Wind'' where in one dream sequence the protagonist Bernhard Schmidt meets a number of others named Schmidt.

When Kross was already in his late 70s he gave a series of lectures at Tartu University explaining certain aspects of his novels, not least the roman Ã  clef dimension, given the fact that quite a few of his characters are based on real-life people, both in the truly historical novels and the semi-autobiographical ones. These lectures are collected in a book entitled ''Omaeluloolisus ja alltekst'' (Autobiographism and Subtext) which appeared in 2003.

During the last twenty years of his life, Jaan Kross occupied some of his time with writing his memoirs (entitled ''Kallid kaasteelised'', i.e. ''Dear Co-Travellers'' â this translation of the title avoids the unfortunate connotation of the expression ''fellow-travellers''). These two volumes ended up with a total of 1,200 pages, including quite a few photographs from his life. His life started quietly enough, but after describing quite innocuous things such as the summer house during his childhood and his schooldays, Kross moves on to the first Soviet occupation of Estonia, his successful attempt to avoid being drafted for the Waffen-SS during the Nazi German occupation, and a long section covering his experiences of prison and the labour camps. The last part describes his return from the camps and his fledgling attempts at authorship. The second volume continues from when he moved into the flat in central Tallinn where he lived for the rest of his life, plus his growing success as a writer. There is also a section covering his one-year stint as Member of Parliament after renewed independence, and his various trips abroad with his wife to, for instance, the United States and Canada.

==Synopses==

===Short synopses of works available in English translation===

Five books by Jaan Kross have been published in English translation, four novels and one collection of stories: The English translations appeared in the following order: ''[[The Czar's Madman]]'' 1992; ''[[Professor Martens' Departure]]'' 1994; ''[[The Conspiracy and Other Stories]]'' 1995; ''[[Treading Air]]'' 2003; ''[[Sailing Against the Wind]]'' 2012. Descriptions of the above books can also be found on various websites and online bookshops. The protagonists of the first three books listed here are based on real-life figures.

'''The Czar's Madman''' (Estonian: ''Keisri hull'', 1978; English: 1994; translator: Anselm Hollo).
This tragic novel is based on the life of a Baltic-German nobleman, [[Timotheus von Bock]] (1787â1836), who was an adjutant to the relatively liberal Czar of Russia, Alexander I. Von Bock wishes to interest the Czar in the idea of liberating the serfs, i.e. the peasant classes, people who were bought and sold almost like slaves by rich landowners. But this is too much for the Czar and in 1818 von Bock is arrested and kept, at the Czar's pleasure, in a prison in [[SchlÃ¼ssleburg]]. Von Bock is released when the next Czar ascends the throne, but by that time he is having mental problems during his last years under house arrest. This is regarded as Kross most accomplished novel, along with the ''Between Three Plagues'' tetralogy (see below).&lt;ref&gt;This novel has also been translated into Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor Martens' Departure''' (Estonian: ''Professor Martensi Ã¤rasÃµit'', 1984; English: 1994; translator: Anselm Hollo).
In early June 1909 the ethnic Estonian professor, [[Friedrich Fromhold Martens]] (1845â1909) gets on the train in PÃ¤rnu heading for the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Empire in the capital, Saint Petersburg. During the journey he thinks back over the events and episodes of his life. Should he have made a career working for the Russian administration as a compiler of treaties at the expense of his Estonian identity? He also muses on his namesake, a man worked on a similar project in earlier decades. A novel that examines the compromises involved when making a career in an empire when coming from a humble background.&lt;ref&gt;This novel has also been translated into Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Latvian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sailing Against the Wind''' (Estonian: ''Vastutuulelaev'', 1987; English: 2012; translator: Eric Dickens).
This novel is about the ethnic Estonian [[Bernhard Schmidt]] (1879â1935) from the island of Naissaar who loses his right hand in a firework accident during his teenage years. He nevertheless uses his remaining hand to work wonders when polishing high quality lenses and mirrors for astronomical telescopes. Later on, when living in what had become Nazi Germany, he himself invents large stellar telescopes that are still to be found at, for instance, the [[Mount Palomar Observatory]] in California and on the island of [[Mallorca]]. Schmidt has to wrestle with his conscience when living in Germany as the country is re-arming and telescopes could be put to military use. But because Germany was the leading technical nation at the time, he feels reasonably comfortable there, first in the run-down small town of [[Mittweida]], then at the main [[Bergedorf Observatory]] just outside Hamburg. But the rise of the Nazis is literally driving him mad.&lt;ref&gt;This novel is also available in French, in Jean-Luc Moreau's translation, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Conspiracy and Other Stories''' (Estonian: ''Silmade avamise pÃ¤ev'', 1988 â most of the stories there ; English: 1995; translator: Eric Dickens).
This collection contains six semi-autobiographical stories mostly dealing with Jaan Kross' life during the Nazi-German and Soviet-Russian occupations of Estonia, and his own imprisonment during those two epochs. The stories, some of which have appeared elsewhere in this translation, are. ''The Wound'', ''Lead Piping'', ''The Stahl Grammar'', ''The Conspiracy'', ''The Ashtray'', and ''The Day Eyes Were Opened''. In all of them there is a tragi-comic aspect.&lt;ref&gt;The story ''The Days Eyes Were Opened'' is also available in the anthology ''Estonian Short Stories'', edited by Kajar Pruul and Darlene Reddaway (op.cit.), there entitled ''The Day His Eyes Are Opened"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Treading Air''' (Estonian: ''Paigallend'', 1998; English: 2003; translator: Eric Dickens).
The protagonist of this novel is Ullo Paerand, a restless young man of many talents. He attends a prestigious private school, but when his speculator father abandons him and his mother the money runs out. He then helps his mother run a laundry to make ends meet. He works his way up, ultimately becoming a messenger boy for the Estonian Prime-Minister's office. He is even offered a chance to escape abroad by going to study at the Vatican, but stays in Estonia. This semi-autobiographical novel is set against the background of a very stormy epoch in the history of Estonia, from when the Soviets occupy the country in 1940, the German occupation the next year, the notorious bombing of central Tallinn by the Soviet airforce on [[9 March 1944]], and a further thirty years of life in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.&lt;ref&gt;This novel has also been translated into Dutch, Finnish. Latvian, Russian, and Swedish&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Between Three Plagues''' (''[[Kolme katku vahel]]'', four volumes 1970â1976; English: three volumes 2016â2018; translator: Merike Lepasaar Beecher)
This is Kross' first major work and his largest in volume. The idea started out as a filmscript, which was shelved, then became a TV serial, and finally the four-volume suite of novels which is one of Kross' most famous works.&lt;ref&gt;Salokannel, op. cit. pages 175â228&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in the 16th century, especially the middle, before and during the [[Livonian War]] which lasted, on and off, from the 1550s to the early 1580s. [[Livonia]] included parts of what are now Estonia and [[Latvia]], and was by the 1550s split up into several parts ruled by Denmark, Sweden, Russia and [[Polish-Lithuanian union|Poland-Lithuania]]. The protagonist is, as is often the case with Kross, a real-life figure called [[Balthasar Russow]] (1543â1602), who wrote the [[Livonian Chronicle]]. The chronicle describes the political horse-trading between the various countries and churches of the day. The Estonians, mostly of peasant stock in those days, always ended up as piggy in the middle. There were also three outbreaks of the bubonic plague to contend with. Russow was the humble son of a peasant, but became a German-speaking clergyman, which was a big step up in society. The fact that he could read, let alone write a chronicle, was unusual. The tetralogy starts with a famous scene where the then ten-year-old Balthasar watches some tightrope walkers in Tallinn, a metaphor for his own diplomatic tightrope walking later in life. He appears as something of a rough diamond throughout the books. The entire tetralogy has been translated into Finnish, German, and Russian, and is being translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the above information is from the Finnish translation by Kaisu Lahikainen and Jouko Vanhanen, WSOY, Helsinki, 2003, 1240 pages, where the four volumes were published together&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short synopses of works not yet available in English===

The majority of Kross novels remain untranslated into English. These are as follows:

'''Under [[Clio]]'s Gaze''' (''Klio silma all''; 1972)
This slim volume contains four novellas. The first deals with [[Michael Sittow]], a painter who has been working at the court of Spain but now wants to join the painters' guild in Tallinn which is as good as a closed shop (''Four Dialogues on the Subject of [[Saint George]]''). The second story tells of an ethnic Estonian Mihkelson who will now be knighted by the [[Czar]] as he has been instrumental in putting down a rebellion in Russia; this is the story of his pangs of conscience, but also how he brings his peasant parents to the ceremony to show his origins (''Mihkelson's Matriculation'') The third story is set in around 1824, and about the collator of Estonian folk literature [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] who, after passing his exams, does not want to become a theologian but wants to study military medicine in Saint Petersburg, then the capital of the Russian Empire; meanwhile, he meets a peasant who can tell him about the Estonian epic hero [[Kalev (mythology)|Kalev]], here of the epic ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'' (''Two Lost Sheets of Paper''). The final story is set in the 1860s, when a national consciousness was awakening in Estonia and the newspaper editor [[Johann Voldemar Jannsen]] starts an Estonian-language newspaper with his daughter [[Lydia Koidula]] and founds the [[Estonian Song Festival]] (''A While in a Swivel Chair'').&lt;ref&gt;These four novellas have been translated into Finnish and Russian as one book.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Third Range of Hills''' (''Kolmandad mÃ¤ed''; 1974)
This short novel tells the story of the ethnic Estonian painter [[Johann KÃ¶ler]] (1826â1899) who had become a famous portrait-painter at the Russian court in [[Saint Petersburg]]. He is now, in 1879, painting a fresco for a church in [[Tallinn]], the capital of Estonia. As model for his Christ he picks out an Estonian peasant from the island of Hiiumaa. Later it transpires that the man he used as model was a sadistic criminal, and this is held against KÃ¶ler by his Baltic-German overlords.&lt;ref&gt;Available in Finnish translation&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Rakvere Novel''' (''Rakvere romaan''; 1982)
The novel is set in the year 1764. The young Berend Falck is taken on by the Baroness Gertrude von Tisenhausen. Falck is an ethnic Estonian, von Tisenhausen a Baltic-German. [[Rakvere]] (Wesenberg, in German) is an Estonian provincial town and in those days the baroness dominated. Falck soon gets involved in the struggle between the townspeople and the baroness. And as he has been employed by her, he is initially obliged to take her side. But as she begins to confiscate land, he grows disillusioned with her. The townspeople, for their part, attempt to reclaim the rights that they had had earlier under Swedish colonial rule, decades before. Sweden lost Estonia to Russia around 1710, so in the epoch in which this novel is set, Rakvere and indeed Estonia are part of the Russian Empire, despite the fact that this local dispute is between the German-speaking baronial classes and Estonian-speaking peasants. A panoramic novel of divided loyalties and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Book description based on the blurb of the Swedish translation by Ivo Iliste, ''Romanen om Rakvere'', [[Natur &amp; Kultur]]. Stockholm, 1992. It has also been translated into Finnish and German&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Wikman Boys''' (''Wikmani poisid''; 1988)
Jaan Kross' alter ego Jaak Sirkel will soon matriculate from school. It is the mid-1930s. Young people eagerly go to the cinema in their free time; at school they have the usual sprinkling of eccentric teachers. But Europe is gradually moving towards war, and this overshadows the lives of the young people. When war comes, some of Sirkel's schoolmates end up in the Red Army, i.e. the Soviets, others from the same school class fighting for the Nazi Germans. The tragedy of a small country fought over by two superpowers. One such devastating battle occurred at Velikiye Luki near the Russian-Estonian border, with Estonians fighting for both sides.

'''Excavations''' (''VÃ¤ljakaevamised''; 1990)
This novel first appeared in Finnish as the political situation in Estonia was very unclear owing to the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union. It tells the story of Peeter Mirk (another of Kross' alter egos) who has just returned from eight years of labour camp and internal exile in Siberia and is looking for work, in order to avoid being sent back, labelled as a "parasite to Soviet society". And he needs the money to live on. It is now 1954, Stalin is dead, there is a slight political thaw. He finds a job on an archaeological dig near the main bastion in central Tallinn. There he finds a manuscript written in the 13th century by a leprous clergyman, a document which could overturn some of the assumptions about the history of Estonia that the Soviet occupier has. The novel also gives portraits of several luckless individuals who have been caught up in the paradoxes of German and Russian occupations.&lt;ref&gt;Book description based on the blurb of the Swedish translation by Ivo Iliste, Fripress / Legenda, Stockholm, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elusiveness''' (''Tabamatus''; 1992)
In 1941, a young Estonian law student is a fugitive from the occupying German Nazis, as he is suspected of being a dangerous resistance fighter. He is accused of writing certain things during the one-year Soviet occupation the previous year. ''(Background note: Estonia was occupied by Soviet forces from summer 1940 to summer 1941; then the German Nazis occupied Estonia until 1944, when many Estonians escaped to Sweden; finally the Soviets came back and stayed until 1991.)'' But what the German occupiers dislike especially is that this young law student is writing a work about the Estonian politician and freedom fighter [[JÃ¼ri Vilms]] (1889â1918) who was obliged to flee from the Germans back in 1918 (during another period of Estonia's tangled history) and was shot by firing squad when he had just reached Helsinki, around the time that Estonia finally became independent of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Book description based on the blurb of the Swedish translation by Ivo Iliste, [[Natur &amp; Kultur]], Stockholm, 1992. This novel is also available in Finnish.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mesmer's Circle''' (''Mesmeri ring''; 1995)
Another novel involving Kross' alter ego, Jaak Sirkel, who is by now a first-year student at [[Tartu University]]. One of his fellow students Indrek Tarna has been sent to [[Siberia]] by the Reds, when the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1940. Indrek's father performs a strange ritual with several people standing around the dining-table and holding hands â as [[Franz Mesmer]] did with his patients. This ritual is meant to give his boy strength by way of prayer. Others react in a more conventional way to the tensions of 1939. This is also where the reader first meets the fellow student who will ultimately become the protagonist in Kross' novel ''[[Treading Air]]''. The novel is partly a love story, where Sirkel, a friend of Tarna's is in love with his girlfriend Riina. And Tarna is in Siberia... Conflicting loyalties. When the Germans invade Estonia Tarna can return to Estonia. The Riina problem gets more tangled.&lt;ref&gt;Book description based on the blurb of the Dutch translation by Frans van Nes, ''De ring van Mesmer'', Prometheus, Amsterdam, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tahtamaa''' (idem; 2001)
Tahtamaa is a plot of land by the sea. This novel is succinctly described by Rutt Hinrikus of the [[Estonian Literary Museum]]
in a short review article on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jaan+Kross.+Tahtamaa.-a098643991|title=Jaan Kross. Tahtamaa. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a novel about the differences in mentality between the Estonians who lived in the Soviet Union, and those that escaped abroad, and their descendants. It is also a novel about greed and covetousness, ownership, and is even a love story between older people. This is Kross' last novel and is set in the 1990s, after Estonia regained its independence.

==Death==

Jaan Kross died in Tallinn, at the age of 87, on 27 December 2007. He is survived by his wife Ellen Niit and four children. The [[President of Estonia]], [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]], praised Kross "as a preserver of the Estonian language and culture."&lt;ref name="International Herald Tribune"/&gt;

Kross is buried at the [[RahumÃ¤e cemetery]] in Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalmistud.ee/eng|title=Cemetery Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Education===
Mittell received his [[Ph.D.]] in Communication Arts from the [[University of WisconsinâMadison]]'s Media &amp; Cultural Studies Program (part of the Department of Communication Arts) in August 2000. In the spring of 1996, Mittell obtained an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in the same concentration and program. Mittell completed his undergraduate studies at [[Oberlin College]] in Oberlin, Ohio in 1992, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and majoring in English and Theater.

===Academic positions===
Mittell taught Communication at [[Georgia State University]] from 2000 to 2002. Currently, he is a professor at Middlebury College, where he teaches a number of courses related to television, culture, and media, such as ''Television and American Culture, Theories of Popular Culture, Media Technology and Cultural Change, American Media Industries, Animated Film &amp; TV, Narration Across Media'', ''Media and Childhood in American Culture'', and ''Urban American and Serial Television: Watching'' The Wire.

His research interests include pop culture topics such as television history and criticism, media and cultural history, genre theory, narratology, animation and children's media, cultural historiography, and new media studies and technological convergence. He is currently writing a book on contemporary American television narrative. Mittell also writes a blog entitled [http://justtv.wordpress.com JustTV].

===''Complex TV'' (2015)===
Mittell's book ''Complex TV'' outlines a [[historical poetics]] of contemporary television series, which he calls "complex TV." Mittell argues that the "complex" television series of today feature an array of storytelling techniques which cannot be adequately understood through the use of cinematic and literary theory. This is especially the case with [[seriality]], i.e. the fact that television series are told in several, separate episodes. To Mittell, this form of television drama emerged in the early 1990s and is characterized by its use of ânarrative special effectâ which is to say that a program sometimes "flexes its storytelling muscles to confound and amaze a viewerâ, e.g. by using [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s in innovative ways.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Mittell (2015) ''Complex TV: The Poetics of Contemporary Television Storytelling''. New York: New York University Press, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being based in Bordwellian [[historical poetics]], this books aims to "identify and describe the formal properties that create such textured narratives."&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Kozloff (2016) review of ''Complex TV: The Poetics of Contemporary Television Storytelling.'' ''Cinema Journal'' Volume 55, Number 3 (Spring 2016): 159&lt;/ref&gt; To film scholar [[Sarah Kozloff]], this means that Mittell's work shares some similarities with [[Seymour Chatman]]'s work on [[film narration]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Kozloff (2016) review of ''Complex TV: The Poetics of Contemporary Television Storytelling.'' ''Cinema Journal'' Volume 55, Number 3 (Spring 2016): 159-160&lt;/ref&gt;

Mittell's book also builds [[Cognitivism (aesthetics)|cognitivist]] assumptions, which means that to Mittell âcomprehension is based on the cognitive poetic model developed primarily through [[David Bordwell]]âs work on film narration. The core assumption of this approach is that viewers actively construct storyworlds in their minds, and that the best way to understand the comprehension process is through the tools of [[cognitive psychology]].â&lt;ref&gt;http://gwk.udk-berlin.de/scsmi/Abstracts/45_Mittell.html&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, Mittell also draws on [[Murray Smith (film scholar)|Murray Smith]]'s work. Mittell, however, makes a point of stressing that he believes that [[Cognitivism (aesthetics)|cognitivist approaches]] are fully compatible with cultural approaches in terms of understanding and studying television shows.

===Use of Wikipedia for college research===
In an interview in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on February 21, 2007, Mittell defended the use of Wikipedia as a citeable resource for college-level research. Mittell responded to critics that questioned the accuracy and reliability of an online document that anyone in the world can edit at any time by arguing that âThe message that is being sent is that ultimately they see it as a threat to traditional knowledge...[;] I see it [Wikipedia] as an opportunity. What does that mean for traditional scholarship? Does traditional scholarship lose value?â&lt;ref name="NYT wiki"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/education/21wikipedia.html?em&amp;ex=1172379600&amp;en=ad418204e5130dd2&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=A History Department Bans Citing Wikipedia as a Research Source |last=Cohen|first=Noam|date=February 21, 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The book "...proposes a new understanding of television genres as cultural categories, offering a set of in-depth historical and critical examinations to explore five key aspects of television genre:history, industry, audience, text, and genre mixing." Mittell uses a number of "well-known television programs" to develop "...a new model of genre historiography and illustrat[e] how genres are at work within nearly every facet of television..." Mittell's book "...argues that through analyzing how television genre operates as a cultural practice, we can better comprehend how television actively shapes our social world." &lt;ref&gt;[https://seguecommunity.middlebury.edu/index.php?&amp;site=jmittell&amp;section=5607&amp;action=site Mittell's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Obadiah Westwood''' (22 December 1805 â 2 January 1893) was an [[English people|English]] [[entomologist]] and [[archaeologist]] also noted for his artistic talents.

Born in [[Sheffield]], he studied to be a lawyer but abandoned that for his scientific interests.

He became a [[curator]] and later professor at [[Oxford University]], having been nominated by his friend and patron the Reverend [[Frederick William Hope]], whose donation was the basis of the [[Hope Department of Entomology|Hope Collection]] at Oxford. He was also a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29140|last=Foote|first=Yolanda |title=Westwood, John Obadiah (1805â1893)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004 |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westwood was a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society]] and president of the [[Royal Entomological Society of London|Entomological Society of London]] (1852â1853).

Among the prominent writers and [[Natural history|naturalists]] he associated with was [[James Rennie]], whom he assisted in the editing of [[Gilbert White]]'s [[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]] in 1833.

On 30 December 1892, not long after returning home from a convention in London, Westwood had suddenly collapsed of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] which left him hospitalised. He slipped into a coma just one day later and died on 2 January 1893. His funeral took place on 6 January 1893 and was interred in [[St Sepulchre's Cemetery]], Oxford.

The [[J.O. Westwood Medal]], awarded every two years by the [[Royal Entomological Society]], is named in his honour.&lt;ref name="RES-Medal"&gt;{{cite web |title=J.O.

[[File:St John the Baptist, Great East Window of York Minster, by John Thornton.jpg|thumb|right|Thornton's depiction of [[St John the Baptist]], from the Great East Window of [[York Minster]], showing his characteristic treatment of faces]]
'''John Thornton''' of [[Coventry]] ([[floruit|fl]]. 1405-1433) was a master [[glazier]] and [[stained glass]] artist active in England during the 15th century. The output of his workshop includes some of the finest English medieval glass.

==Biography==
The first certain record of Thornton, apart from a possible 1371 reference in Coventry, is his 1405 contract with the Dean of [[York Minster]] to glaze the choir east window.&lt;ref name=sge180&gt;Marks, R. ''Stained Glass in England during the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 1993, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of York]] at the time was [[Richard le Scrope]], a former [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]], and the window was funded by [[Walter Skirlaw]], also previously Bishop of Coventry, so it seems possible both men would have recommended Thornton based on their knowledge of his work in his home town.

Thornton was made a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of York in 1410, but was known to be back living in the St John's Bridges area of Coventry (now known as Burges&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16006&lt;/ref&gt;) by 1413. He appears again in 1433, when he received further payment from the dean and chapter of York, and was recorded as holding property there.&lt;ref name="sge180"/&gt;

It has been suggested, though without any strong evidence, that Thornton was the son of a "John Coventre", a glazier in the royal glass-painting workshops at Westminster in 1351 and 1352, who later assisted in setting up windows at [[Windsor Castle]] for [[Edward III of England]]. Thornton could have worked as an assistant to his father before rising to the position of designer and draughtsman.&lt;ref name=nq&gt;Knowles, J. 'John Thornton of Coventry', ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 140, 481&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Thornton was instrumental in disseminating the [[International Gothic]] style in the north and Midlands of England. The products of his workshop can be recognised by their favouring of white glass and [[silver nitrate|yellow stain]] set against blue and ruby "seaweed"-patterned backgrounds, and by the very distinctive modelling of faces.&lt;ref name=sge183&gt;Marks, p.183. Thornton's treatment of faces was expressive, using relatively heavy shading, and generally features small mouths and rather elongated noses with a bulbous tip.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thornton's masterpiece is the Great East Window of York Minster, the largest in the building and containing about {{convert|1680|sqft|m2}} of glass. According to the contract, much of the work was to be executed by his own hand, though specifically only to "pourtray [...] the histories, images, and other things to be painted on the [window]"; evidently some of the glazing would be carried out by apprentices or workmen.&lt;ref name=blair280&gt;Blair, J and Ramsay, N. ''English Medieval Industries'', CIP, 1991, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton is likely to have recruited glaziers locally in York: he seems to have been an enthusiastic teacher, and his style quickly became dominant in the area.&lt;ref name=marks182&gt;Marks, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Work thought to be by Thornton can also be found in several smaller churches, as well as in [[St Mary's Guildhall|St Mary's Hall]] in Coventry. His surviving windows for [[Coventry Cathedral]] were removed before it was destroyed in the [[Coventry Blitz]] and have been preserved.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2002/08/cathedral-stained-glass.shtml A rare glimpse of unseen cathedral stained glass]'', [[BBC]], 23-08-02&lt;/ref&gt; He is also thought to have produced the windows from the chapel at [[Hampton Court, Herefordshire]], which are now dispersed in various collections, and seven panels in the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent]].

The Thornton 'tradition' continued in York even after the middle of the 15th century, though many of the works produced show a coarsening or loss of quality compared with Thornton's authentic creations.&lt;ref name=sge185186&gt;Marks, pp.185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josef SchÃ¤chter''' (* September 16, 1901 in [[Kundrynce]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], â  March 27, 1994 [[Haifa]]) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[rabbi]], [[philosopher]] and member of the [[Vienna Circle]] from 1925 to 1936.

== Life ==
Josef SchÃ¤chter was the son of Shoel SchÃ¤chter and Sarah, ''nÃ©e'' Distenfield. He trained as a rabbi and was ordained in 1926. He worked as a [[Talmud]] teacher from 1922 to 1929 at the Hebraic school in [[Vienna]] and from 1935 to 1938 at the Bible Rambam Institute.

At the same time, he studied [[philosophy]], primarily with [[Moritz Schlick]] and completed his studies in 1931 with a dissertation under Schlick with the title âCritical Account of [[Nicolai Hartmann|N. Hartmann]]âs âGrundzÃ¼ge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnisââ (''âKritische Darstellung von N. Hartmanns âGrundzÃ¼ge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnisââ'').

From 1925 to 1936 SchÃ¤chter attended the meetings of the [[Vienna Circle]]. His work ''Prolegomena zu einer kritischen Grammatik'' (''Prolegomena to a Critical Grammar'') was published with a preface by Schlick in the Circleâs book series ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception'') in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moritz Schlick]], âGeleitwort [in: Josef SchÃ¤chter, Prolegomena zu einer kritischen Grammatik]â, in: Moritz Schlick Gesamtausgabe, Abteilung I, Band 6, ''Die Wiener Zeit'' (ed. by Johannes Friedl, Heiner Rutte), 635-642. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; This work was influenced by Schlick, [[Friedrich Waismann]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. After Schlickâs murder, SchÃ¤chter intermittently substituted Friedrich Waismann in running philosophical seminars.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 720.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 SchÃ¤chter emigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. He taught at secondary schools, first in [[Tel Aviv]] until 1940 and then in Haifa until 1950. In 1943 he married the teacher Netti Dlugacz. From 1951 to 1952 he was [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of schools in the Israeli school system. Later he worked as a lecturer for Bible and [[Aggadah]] at the teacherâs seminar in Haifa.

At the beginning of the 1950s a group of his students founded the [[Kibbuz]] "Yodefat" in [[Galilee]] in order to put SchÃ¤chterâs ideas into practice.&lt;ref&gt;''Schaechter, Josef'' In: Werner RÃ¶der, Herbert A. Strauss: ''Biographisches Handbuch der deutschsprachigen Emigration nach 1933.'' Vol. 2, Saur, MÃ¼nchen 1983. (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

SchÃ¤chter published numerous works on classical [[Judaism]], on language, meaning, and belief in the context of science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 720.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Judgement of Paris Amphora''''' ([[French language|French]]: ''amphore du Jugement de PÃ¢ris'') is an Attic [[black-figure]] [[amphora]] named for the scene depicted on it. It is held by the [[MusÃ©e des beaux-arts de Lyon]] with the inventory number E 581-c and is attributed to the London B76 Painter, who was active at [[Athens]] in the second quarter of the sixth century BC.

== History ==
The amphora was made around 575-550 BC, during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] and the tyranny of [[Peisistratus]] at Athens.

The amphora is a piece of black figure pottery, deriving from the region of [[Attica]], which is located in Mainland Greece to the south of [[Boeotia]], with [[Athens]] as its capital.

The work is now stored in the [[MusÃ©e des beaux-arts de Lyon]] under the inventory number E 581-c, in the department of antiquities. It was a donation of [[Joseph Gillet]] in 1923. In January 1995 the amphora was cleaned using steam and cotton swabs with water and a little [[ammonia]]. It was then buffed with soft fibreglass and the missing half of its foot was reconstructed in plaster. This returned the vase to a good state, though some scratches remain around the neck and the red part of the surface is damaged.

== Description ==
The amphora has a figural scene on each of its two faces. These scenes are supplemented by floral patterns above the figural scenes and around the lip of the vase, which are identical on both sides. In this period the vegetation decorating painted vases is becoming stylised and symbolic.

The scenes are framed like paintings, but the frame widens as the amphora bulges outwards. The background colour of the scenes reappears at the lip and foot of the amphora.

On face A there are three Greek goddesses: [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] dressed in [[himation]]s, the traditional women's overgarment. Each woman holds a crown in her hand as an offering. The women are led by [[Hermes]] in the direction of [[Paris of Troy|Paris]]. The scene, therefore is the [[Judgement of Paris]], which first appeared on Attic vases around 575 bc. The indifference displayed by the three goddesses and the tranquil assurance of Paris' face indicate that this vase was among the first depictions of this subject. Following convention, the individuals are represented in profile. Details are incised or highlighted with colour and tend towards realism, notably on the clothes.

[[File:Amphore - Le jugement de PÃ¢ris (face B).jpg|thumb|Face B]]
On face B there is a battle between two armoured [[hoplite]]s, wielding spears, their legs protected by [[greave]]s, their heads by [[Corinthian helmet]]s, their bodies by [[hoplon|hopla]] (round shields, secured to the forearm by a central strap and moved with a handle.

== Context ==
The word ''amphora'' derives from the Greek ''amphi-'' (on both sides) and ''-phoros'' (carrier). They are terracotta vases of variable size with two vertical handles, by which they are carried on both sides, designed for the transport and storage of liquids (principally olive oil and wine). They could be painted on their bellies (as in this case).

A large portion of Athenian pottery was produced by the Group of Haimon and the Leafless Group,&lt;ref&gt;These groups have been identified in modern times on the basis of various shared stylistic features; they did not necessarily have any formal or informal existence in ancient Athens&lt;/ref&gt; and was carried thence to ports around the Mediterranean. The rest was produced for local use, specifically mixing, storing and transporting wine and oil.

Attic pottery was valued in the sanctuaries of the Etruscans, where they had additional roles: cultic ritual, banqueting and votive offerings. These vases were bought specially for a given occasion and signified a dedication to a divinity. Generally, Attic cups were common while amphorae were rare.

=== Production ===
{{main|Black-figure pottery}}
The black figure technique is older than the red figure technique and continued alongside it. It was adopted by Athenian potters at the end of the seventh century BC and was still very novel in 580 BC. It remained in vogue until around 470.

To create this form of pottery, the vases were moulded on the [[potter's wheel]], then dried in the open air and painted after a few hours. The outlines of the designs were produced with a diluted black "varnish" made of very fine clay. Initially the figures were painted as opaque silhouettes and allowed to dry. Then the layer of dried slip was scratched with a needle in order to create details (facial features, hair, musculature). At the same time the artists highlighted elements in red or white. Finally the vase was fired in three phases:
# 900&amp;nbsp;Â°C with the air vents open: the bare clay turns red or brown
# 950&amp;nbsp;Â°C with the air vents closed: the oven was made smoky by burning green wood and as the carbon oxydised, the vases turned black and the clay slip was vitrified and transformed into "black varnish"
# Lower temperature with the air vents open again: Oxygen circulates, penetrating the surface of the unvarnished parts of the vase which then regain a red or brown colour (depending on the amount of oxygen in the oven). The slip retains the black colour which it developed in the second phase of firing.

=== Judgment of Paris ===
{{main|Judgement of Paris}}
In the archaic period, amphorae display the veneration of gods and heroes in their representation of myths. This vase depicts the myth of the Judgement of Paris.

At the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], all the deities were invited except the goddess of discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]]. In revenge she threw a golden apple into the middle of the party, inscribed "a gift for the most beautiful." Hermes picked up the apple and read out the inscription. All of the goddesses who considered themselves the most beautiful became jealous of one another. [[Zeus]] was unwilling to settle the debate lest he offend his wife, Hera, by judging in favour of another goddess. By mutual consent, the decision was given to the shepherd Paris.

Paris was a Trojan prince, a younger son of King [[Priam]] and his wife [[Hecuba]]. However, at his birth, an oracle announced that the future prince would cause the destruction of Troy. In fear, Priam ordered that the boy be killed and had Paris exposed on Mount Ida, where he was rescued by shepherds. Paris had to decide amongst:
* Athena, daughter of Zeus and [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] (an [[Oceanid]]), goddess of reason, prudence and wisdom. She promised Paris victory in his future wars.
* Hera, daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Cronus|Kronos]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], was the sister and wife of Zeus. She was the goddess of marriage, as well as the guardian of fertility, couples and woman in labour. She promised Paris the conquest of Europe and Asia.
* Aphrodite, depending on the version, was the daughter of Zeus and [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]] or the product of the fertile foaming of the sea around the castrated genitals of the [[Ouranos|Sky]]. She was the goddess of love and sex and offered the shepherd the love of the most beautiful of all mortal women: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].

Paris decides in favour of Aphrodite and receives the love of Helen, though she is already wife to [[Menelaos]]. His abduction of her brings about the [[Trojan War]], in which he participates. Thus the two faces are related, with face A foreshadowing the dueling hoplites on face B.

In his work ''Art &amp; Myth in Ancient Greece'', Thomas Carpenter compares this work with later representations of the myth. In short, Paris is here represented without his beard and trademark bow, attributes which he is depicted with in a near-contemporary [[krater]] made by [[Chalkis|Chalcidian]] colonists at [[Vulci]] around 540&amp;nbsp;BC and in most later depictions. Likewise Athena differs from the norm. She usually appears wearing her serpent-hemmed [[aegis]] and a helmet, as in an Attic Black figure [[hydria]] found at Vulci which was produced around 540 BC.

[[File:Knipl_326_detail.tif|thumb|right|detail from Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer, episode 326, 1994.]]
'''''Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer''''' is a weekly [[comic strip]] written and drawn by [[Ben Katchor]] since 1988. It is published in ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' and various [[alternative weekly]] newspapers.

Katchor embodies his love of the fading small-business community of [[New York City]] in the title character, a small businessman who wanders the streets taking pictures and being sidetracked into surreal escapades. Strips often depict Knipl's chance encounters with obscure, marginal businesses (e.g. a company that distributes newspaper weights to newsstands), eccentric hobbyists, and enigmatic details of the urban landscape. There is rarely continuity between the strips, and Knipl is the only recurring character.

A collection of ''Julius Knipl'' strips was published in 1991 by [[Penguin Books]] (as a ''[[RAW magazine|RAW]]'' One-Shot) as ''Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay''. Another collection was published in 1996 by [[Little, Brown and Company]] under the title ''Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: Stories''. [[Pantheon Books]] published a third volume of strips, ''The Beauty Supply District'', in 2000.  Each book includes one long story in addition to the self-contained weekly strips. Translated collections of the strip in [[French language|French]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] have also been released.

[[NPR]]'s [[Weekend Edition]] Saturday ran audio versions of several Julius Knipl stories in 1995 and 1996, narrated by Katchor and starring [[Jerry Stiller]] in the title role.

The word ''knipl'' means roughly "nest egg" or [[housewife hidden savings]] in [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;Chabon, Michael. [http://www.michaelchabon.com/archives/2005/06/introduction_to_4.html Introduction to ''Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020210615/http://www.michaelchabon.com/archives/2005/06/introduction_to_4.html |date=2006-10-20 }}, Ben Katchor (Little Brown, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

In 1988 publisher [[Russ Smith (publisher)|Russ Smith]] approached ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw]]'' co-editor [[Art Spiegelman]] about comic strips for the weekly [[alternative newspaper]] ''[[New York Press]]''.  Spiegelman recommended Katchor, whom he had published in ''Raw''.  Katchor has since produced the strip weekly, and it has been carried by other alternative weeklies as well, such as ''[[The Forward]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]''.{{sfn|Aubrey|2012|p=429}}

Strips from the series have appeared in the collections ''Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay'' (1991), ''Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: Stories'' (1996), ''Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: The Beauty Supply'' (2000).{{sfn|Aubrey|2012|p=429}}

==Style and analysis==

Katchor draws the strip in a loose, sketchy pen-and-ink style overlaid with a gray watercolor [[wash (visual arts)|wash]].  The backgrounds are detailed and drawn from a wide variety of shifting perspectives.  A typical strip is made up of eight or nine panels captioned with crooked, hand-lettered boxes.  The captions and drawings often follow independent narrative threads, sometimes with ironic effects, with the captions contradicting or reinforcing the visuals.{{sfn|Aubrey|2012|p=431}}

The dreamlike strip displays a nostalgic tone for New York City, and its Jewish heritage in particular.  The strip's city is populated with small businesses that had never existed and that are often implausible, but remiscent of a New York in the days of large numbers of immigrants before the dominance of large corporate chains.{{sfn|Aubrey|2012|p=431}}

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], '''modality''' is a feature of language that allows for communicating things about, or based on, situations which need not be actual. More precisely, modality is signaled by grammatical expressions (''moods'') that express a speaker's general intentions (or illocutionary point) as well as the speaker's commitment to how believable, obligatory, desirable, or actual an expressed [[proposition]] is.

Sometimes, the term ''mood'' is used to refer to both mood and modality, however, the two can be distinguished according to whether they refer to the grammatical expressions of various modalities (''mood'') or the meanings so expressed (''modality''). Modality can also be considered equivalent to the idea of ''[[illocutionary force]]'' if the kinds of expressions which can express modal meanings also include [[lexical items]] such as [[performative]] verbs.

Modality is closely intertwined with other linguistic phenomena such as [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[evidentiality]], [[Conditional mood|conditionals]], and others. As with other areas of linguistics, modality has been studied extensively from typological as well as formal perspectives.

An important distinction within linguistic modality is the distinction between [[epistemic]] and [[deontic]] modality. Generally speaking, epistemic modality has to do with possibility and necessity with regard to knowledge, whereas deontic modality has to do with permission and obligation according to some system of rules. The difference between the two is illustrated in the English example below:
: (1) Agatha ''must'' be the killer.
: (2) Agatha ''must'' be killed.
The sentence in (1) might be spoken by someone who has decided that all of the relevant facts in a particular murder investigation point to the conclusion that Agatha is the killer, even though it may or may not actually be the case. In contrast, (2) might be spoken by someone who has decided that, according to some standard of conduct, Agatha has committed a vile crime, and therefore the correct course of action is to kill Agatha. Note also that, although English ''must'' is ambiguous between these two interpretations, the form of the other elements in the sentences helps to disambiguate.

In standard formal approaches to '''linguistic modality''', an utterance expressing modality is one that can always roughly be paraphrased to fit the following template:

:(1) According to [a set of rules, wishes, beliefs,...] it is [necessary, possible] that [the main proposition] is the case.

The set of propositions which forms the basis of evaluation is called the '''modal base'''. The result of the evaluation is called the '''modal force'''.
For example the utterance in (2) expresses that, according to what the speaker has observed, it is necessary to conclude that John has a rather high income:

:(2) John must be earning a lot of money.

The modal base here is the knowledge of the speaker, the modal force is necessity. By contrast, (3) could be paraphrased as âGiven his abilities, the strength of his teeth, etc., it is possible for John to open a beer bottle with his teethâ. Here, the modal base is defined by a subset of John's abilities, the modal force is possibility.

:(3) John can open a beer bottle with his teeth.

A more elaborate account of formal semantic approaches to modality is given in section 1.

Cross-linguistically, modality can be expressed by a variety of means, such as [[auxiliary verbs]] as in the examples (2) and (3),  verbal morphology ([[grammatical mood|mood]]) or adverbs. An overview of the various modal expressions across languages is given below in section 2.

[[Linguistic typology|Typological]] approaches to modality usually favour a slightly wider definition of modality and also include meanings which do not fit the template in (1) exactly. Section 3 provides an overview over the range of meanings commonly associated with modality.

==Semantic accounts==

Semantic approaches dealing with modality are traditionally based on the principles of [[modal logic]]. Both work with the notion that propositions can be mapped to sets of possible worlds, that is, a proposition can be defined as the set of worlds in which that proposition is true. For example, the proposition âthe earth is flatâ corresponds to the set of possible worlds in which the earth is in fact flat.

In this framework, modal expressions such as ''must'' and ''can'' are then analyzed as quantifiers over a set of possible worlds. This set of worlds is given by the modal base and is said to be ''the set of accessible worlds'': For example, in sentence (2) above, the modal base is the knowledge the speaker has in the actual world. Therefore, the set of accessible worlds is defined by the information the speaker has about John. Assume for example that the speaker knows that John just bought a new luxury car and has rented a huge apartment. The speaker also knows that John is an honest person with a humble family background and doesn't play the lottery.
The set of accessible worlds is then the set of worlds in which all these propositions which the speaker knows about John are true.

The notions of '''necessity''' and '''possibility''' are then defined along the following lines: A proposition ''p'' follows necessarily from the set of accessible worlds, if all accessible worlds are part of ''p'' (that is, if ''p'' is true in all of these worlds). Applied to the example in (2) this would mean that in all the worlds which are defined by the speaker's knowledge about John, it is the case that John earns a lot of money (assuming there is no other explanation for John's wealth).

In a similar way a proposition ''p'' is possible according to the set of accessible worlds (i.e. the modal base), if some of these worlds are part of ''p''.

==Ways of expressing modality==

===Verbal Morphology===
{{Main article|Grammatical mood}}

In many languages modal categories are expressed by verbal morphology. If these verbal markers of modality are obligatory in a language, they are called [[Grammatical mood|''mood'']] markers. Well-known examples of moods in some European languages are referred to as [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]] and [[Indicative mood|indicative]] as illustrated below with examples from [[French language|French]], all three with the verb ''avoir'' âto haveâ. As in most [[Standard Average European|Standard European]] languages, the shape of the verb conveys not only information about modality, but also about other categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]].

An example for a non-European language with a similar encoding of modality is [[Manam language|Manam]]. Here, a verb is prefixed by a [[morpheme]] which encodes number and person of the subject. These prefixes come in two versions, one ''realis'' version and one ''irrealis'' version. Which one is chosen depends on whether the verb refers to an actual past or present event (realis), or merely to a possible or imagined event (irrealis) (see [[#elliott2000|Elliott 2000]]).

===Auxiliaries===
{{Main article|Modal verb}}

Modal [[auxiliary verb]]s, such as the English words ''may, can, must, ought, will, shall, need, dare, might, could, would,'' and ''should'', are often used to express modality, especially in the [[Germanic languages]].

===Lexical expression===

[[Verb]]s such as "want" can be used to express modality [[lexical (semiotics)|lexically]], as can [[adverb]]s.

===Other===

Complementizers (e.g. Russian) and conjunctions (e.g. Central Pomo, see [[#mithun1995|Mithun 1995]]) can be used to convey modality.

==Modal Categories==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Many different kinds of modal interpretations have been observed and studied, resulting in a variety of typologies. What follows below is one of the many ways that modality has been classified. Only broad categories have been distinguished below: the reader is referred to the main articles and the references for more detailed discussions.

===Realis vs. Irrealis===

The closely related [[realis mood|realis]], [[declarative mood|declarative]], and [[evidential mood]]s refer to situations that actually exist, are claimed to exist, or are inferred to exist. In contrast, [[irrealis mood]]s refer to situations that are not known to exist. Two common irrealis moods are the [[conditional mood]], stating what would happen under a certain condition or conditions (expressed periphrastically in English as ''would'' + main verb), and the [[subjunctive mood]], stating the speaker's preferences for what should occur (such as ''he leave'' in the English ''I demand that he leave'') or hypotheticals (such as English ''If I were to go,....'').

[[Counterfactual conditional#Examples|Counterfactuals]] refer to things that are contrary to the actual situation. In English, counterfactuals can be expressed implicitly in [[If clause|"if"-clauses]] by using a tense form that normally refers to a time prior to the time actually semantically referred to in the ''if''-clause. For example, ''If I knew that, I wouldn't have to ask'' contains the counterfactual ''If I knew'', which refers to the present tense despite the form of the verb, and which denies the proposition "I know that". This contrasts with the construction ''If I know that,...'', which is not a counterfactual because it means that maybe I know it and maybe I don't (or maybe I will know it, and maybe I will not). Likewise, ''If I had known that, I would have gone there'' contains the counterfactual ''If I had known'', denying the proposition that I had known; a note of caution on the above: the [[pluperfect]] verbal construction is sometimes mistakenly confused with the simple past, this is because most of the time the distinction has a very small effect on the semantic interpretation, and the incorrect logic that, through inertia, prior knowledge of X implies present knowledge of X, however this is not universal, (e.g. memory loss), a correct modal statement would look like "prior knowledge of X ''usually'' implies present knowledge of X". as with any subtlety, caution is prescribed.

===Epistemic vs. deontic modality===
{{Main article|Epistemic modality|Deontic modality}}
Epistemic modals are used to indicate the possibility or necessity of some piece of knowledge. It deals with the likelihood of the actualization of the state of affairs. In the epistemic use, modals can be interpreted as indicating inference or some other process of reasoning involved in coming to the conclusion stated in the sentence containing the modal. However, epistemic modals do not necessarily require inference, reasoning, or evidence. One effect of using an epistemic modal (as opposed to not using one) is a general weakening of the speaker's commitment to the truth of the sentence containing the modal. However, it is disputed whether the function of modals is to indicate this weakening of commitment, or whether the weakening is a by-product of some other aspect of the modal's meaning.

Examples of the expression of epistemic modality in English are: ''he might be there'' (low probability, substantial doubt), ''He may be there'' (possibility), ''He should be there by now'' (high probability), and ''He must be there by now'' (certitude, no doubt).

In contrast, [[deontic modality]] is concerned with possibility and necessity in terms of freedom to act (including ability, permission, and duty). In other words, deontic modals state something about the desirability of the actualization of the state of affairs, expressed in varying degrees of obligation. English examples include ''She can go'' (ability), ''You may go'' (permission), ''You should go'' (request), and ''You must go'' (command). In English as in many other languages, some of the same words are used for deontic modality as for epistemic modality, and the meaning is distinguished from context: ''He must be there by now'' (epistemic) versus ''He must be there tomorrow at noon'' (deontic).

'''Lustron houses''' are [[prefabricated]] [[vitreous enamel|enameled steel]] houses developed in the post-[[World War II]] era [[United States]] in response to the shortage of homes for returning [[GI (military)|GI]]s. Considered low-maintenance and extremely durable, they were expected to attract modern families who might not have the time or interest in repairing and painting conventional wood and plaster houses.

In January 1947, the newly formed Lustron Corporation announced that it had received a $12.5-million [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] [[loan]] to manufacture mass-produced prefabricated homes that featured [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]-[[coating|coated]] steel panels ({{US Patent|2416240}}).&lt;ref name="Reiss, Robert 1978"&gt;Reiss, Robert. "When Lustron Lost its Luster," ''The Columbus Dispatch''. 23 July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Chicago industrialist and inventor [[Carl Strandlund]], who had worked with constructing prefabricated [[gas station]]s, Lustron offered a home that would "defy weather, wear, and time."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lustron Corporation. "Compact, Beautiful Lustron Homes: Newport Two-Bedroom and Three-Bedroom Sizes." Company brochure.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strandlund's '''Lustron Corporation''', a division of the Chicago Vitreous Enamel Corporation, set out to construct 15,000 homes in 1947 and 30,000 in 1948.&lt;ref name="Reiss, Robert 1978"/&gt;  From its plant in [[Columbus, Ohio]] (the former [[Curtiss-Wright]] factory), the corporation eventually constructed 2,498 Lustron homes between 1948 and 1950.&lt;ref&gt;The plant would later be returned to aircraft production by [[North American Aviation]] as [[Air Force Plant 85]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The houses sold for between $8,500 and $9,500, according to a March 1949 article in the ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]''âabout 25 percent less than comparable conventional housing. By November 1949, however, a Lustron's average selling price had come up to $10,500.

Most of the known Lustron houses were constructed in 36 of the United States including Alaska. However, some were constructed in Venezuela, South America for families of oil industry employees.&lt;ref&gt;Lustron Homes: The History of a Postwar Prefabricated Housing Experiment by Tom Fetters&lt;/ref&gt;

Billed as a way to maximize pleasure and minimize work, Lustron advertising contended that the Lustron home would create a "new and richer experience for the entire family," where "Mother...has far more hours," the "youngsters...have fewer worries," and there would be "far more leisure for Dad."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; How this would be accomplished with just a choice of housing was not clarified, although presumably, it was through enameled-steel design that would not need painting.

The Lustron design was created to adapt it to mass production. A steel framing system was devised consisting of vertical steel studs and roof-ceiling trusses to which all interior and exterior panels were attached. The concept of prefabricated housing was well established by firms such as Alladin, Gordon-Van Tine, Montgomery Ward, and Sears in the early 1900s. These companies, however, used conventional [[Framing (construction)#Balloon framing|balloon-framing]] techniques and materials in their kits.&lt;ref name=NomCNRLH&gt;Overmyer, Beverly; Coambs, Norris and Harriet Lustron House, Coambs-Morrow House; 92001165; National Register InventoryâNomination Form, September 17, 1992, in digital files of National Park Service, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; After WWII, the domestic demand for steel exceeded production and the federal government exercised control over its allocation. Strandlund had orders for his porcelain-enameled panels for use in construction for new gas stations for Standard Oil. He made a request for allocation of steel but was denied. However, he was advised by Wilson Wyatt, Housing Expediter during the Truman administration, that steel would be available if Strandlund produced steel houses instead of gas stations.&lt;ref name=NomCNRLH/&gt;

Wyatt endorsed the idea but was unable to convince Congressional members to appropriate funds for Strandlund. In turn, Wyatt resigned his post, but other influential members of Congress were successful in getting support to finance the production of Lustron homes. Through the government agency, Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), Strandlund ultimately received over $37 million in loans plus a leased war surplus plant in Columbus, Ohio. This was the first venture capital loan made by the federal government. Initially, Strandlund was provided the availability of a war surplus plant in Chicago.&lt;ref name=NomCNRLH/&gt;
However, due to the political intrigue in government, Tucker, who proposed to produce a radical new automobile, acquired the plant. In turn, Tucker shortly failed in his business operation. The political ramifications are as fascinating as the engineering of the Lustron homes.&lt;ref name=NomCNRLH/&gt;
The Lustron factory had approximately eight miles of automated conveyor lines and included 11 enameling furnaces, each of which was more than 180 feet long. The plant equipment included presses for tubs and sinks. The bathtub press could stamp a tub in one draw and could produce 1000 tubs a day at capacity. Specially designed trailer trucks were used as the final assembling point where the manufactured parts came off the assembly line. There were approximately 3300 individual parts in a complete house loaded on a single trailer. The trucks then delivered the house package to the building site.&lt;ref name=NomCNRLH/&gt;

Lustron established builder-dealers, which in turn sold and erected the house package on a concrete foundation. In 20 months of production and sales, Lustron lost money on each house, and in turn, was not able to repay the RFC loan. RFC foreclosed on Lustron and production stopped on June 6, 1950. On the Lustron order book were contracts for more than 8000 housing units, which were never shipped.&lt;ref name=NomCNRLH/&gt;

==Models==
[[Image:Westchester Dlxe.jpg|thumb|225px|Westchester Deluxe 2-bedroom house]]

Arguably the most popular of the Lustron homes was the two bedroom, {{convert|1021|ft2|m2}} "Westchester Deluxe" model. In total, there were three "models" of Lustrons: the Westchester, Newport, and Meadowbrook.  With the exception of the Esquire (which had been the prototype's name) each Lustron type was available as either a two- or three-bedroom model.&lt;ref name="Boyd, Michelle Anne 2001"&gt;Boyd, Michelle Anne. âPreserving the Lustron House: Authenticity and Industrial Production.â Master's Thesis, Columbia University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design features==
[[Image:Lustron Downspout.jpg|thumb|80px|right|The decorative "zig-zag" accent is unique to Lustron homes.]]
Prefabricated housing had existed before the Lustron home came on the market.  However, it was Lustron's promises of assembly-line efficiency and modular construction that set it apart from its competitors. The homes were designed by [[Morris Beckman (architect)|Morris Beckman]] of Chicago firm [[Beckman and Blass]], and may have been loosely based on designs for the [[Cemesto]] houses in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Prudon, Theodore H. M. ''Preservation of Modern Architecture''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  With enameled steel panels inside and out, as well as steel framing, the homes stood out next to more traditional dwellings made of wood and plaster.

Lustron homes were usually built on concrete slab foundations with no basement. However, about 40 Lustron homes have been reported to have basements.&lt;ref name=Registry2&gt;[http://www.lustronregistry.org/HTML/statistics.htm LustronRegistry.org, Accessed July 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Their sturdy steel frame was constructed on-site and the house was assembled piece-by-piece from a special Lustron Corporation delivery truck. The assembly team, who worked for the local Lustron builder-dealer followed a special manual from Lustron, and were supposed to complete a house in 360 man-hours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mitchell, Robert J. "Whatever Happened to Lustron Homes?" ''APT Bulletin'', Vol. 23, No. 2, 1991: 44â53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color options===
The Ohio Historic Preservation Office recognizes four exterior colors: "Surf Blue," "Dove Gray," "Maize Yellow," and "Desert Tan." Reported in error over the years is that Blue-Green, Green, Pink, and White were available. Window surrounds were primarily ivory-colored, although early models used yellow trim on "Surf Blue" models.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Interiors===
The interiors were designed with an eye toward the modern age, space-saving, and ease of cleaning.  All Lustrons had metal-paneled interior walls that were most often gray.  To maximize space, all interior rooms and closets featured [[pocket door]]s. All models featured metal cabinetry, a service and storage area, and metal ceiling tiles.  In the Westchester Deluxe models, the living room and master bedrooms featured built-in wall units. As an added option, customers were presented with the unique [[Thor washing machine#Automagic washer.2Fdishwasher|Thor-brand combination clothes- and dish-washer]], which incorporated the kitchen sink.

===Window types===
[[Image:Lustron Tripartite Window.jpg|thumb|100px|left|A Lustron tripartite window.]]There were two major window types in Lustron homes: âtripartiteâ and casement, all manufactured by Reynolds Aluminum. The tripartite consisted of a central light flanked by two four-light casement windows. Three-light and/or square aluminum casements with interior screens were standard on all Lustrons. Add-on storm windows were available for residents in colder climates.

Westchester Deluxe two- and three-bedroom models were unique in that they boasted a tripartite bay window in the living room area: no other Lustron line included this feature.&lt;ref&gt;This "bay" window measured {{convert|12|in}} by {{convert|8|ft}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Westchester Deluxe two-bedroom models, additional tripartite windows were located in the dining area and bedrooms.  For Westchester Deluxe three-bedroom models, tripartite windows were found in the dining area and two of the bedrooms, as well as the living room bay.  Though the Westchester Standard line had no bay windows, it had tripartite windows in the same rooms as the Westchester Deluxe two-bedroom model.

Newport two- and three-bedroom models, which had no bay windows, offered tripartite windows in the dining/living room area. A model of the Meadowbrook home shows that the design would have provided two tripartite windows, both in the dining/living room area, similar to those in the Newport line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lustronpreservation.org/meet-the-lustrons/what-model-is-it/meadowbrook{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roof, flooring, and other details===
[[File:Lustron Garage Framing.jpg|thumb|upright|The interior supports of a Lustron G-2 garage]]
The roof likewise consisted of porcelain-enameled steel tiles, which were installed shingle-style. The front and rear doors featured a single light of translucent, rippled glass. As seen in the chart above, floors in the Westchester Deluxe models were asphalt tile, but in other models (Westchester Standard, Newport, and Meadowbrook), floors were installed as a âbuilder's option.â&lt;ref name="Boyd, Michelle Anne 2001"/&gt;

===Temperature control===
In most models, the homes were heated with an oil burning furnace that directed hot air into an enclosed space above the metal ceilings. The walls contained a one-inch blanket of fiberglass wool insulation. Later production models of the Newport use a forced-air system.

===Identifying marks===
Among noteworthy Lustron exterior features are the siding consisting of square segments of material, followed by a zig-zag downspout trellis on the buildings' front and rear corners. In the two-bedroom Westchester models, the downspout attaches via the trellis to a pillar that supports the open porch. Rust has often led to removal of the trellis by owners.

==End of the Lustron Corporation==
The Lustron Corporation declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1950, despite being an extremely well funded, well-publicized, government-supported enterprise manufacturing a desperately needed product. Production delays, the lack of a viable [[distribution (business)|distribution]] [[strategy]], and the escalating prices for the finished product all contributed to the failure. Additionally, local zoning codes also played a part. In some municipalities, for example, an ordinance prohibited homes with steel chimneys.&lt;ref name="Reiss, Robert 1978"/&gt; Some accounts suggest an organized effort from the existing housing industry to stop Strandlund, comparing him to [[Tucker automobile|Preston Tucker]] (ironic, because Strandlund's first choice for the Lustron factory building, the [[Dodge Chicago Aircraft Engine Plant]] in Illinois, was actually granted to Tucker to build his automobiles).

==Lustrons on a Marine base==
The largest assembly of Lustrons in one geographic location was in [[Quantico, Virginia]], where 60 were installed at the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[military base]]. All Westchester Deluxe models, they came all four colors." Major remodels in the 1980s resulted in some of them being painted pink and lime green.  In January 2006, it was announced that the homes, which had grown "too small for most families," would be eliminated from base housing and would be given away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hedgpeth|first1=Dana|title=Housing History for the Taking at Quantico|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/22/AR2006012200810.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=23 January 2006|page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-eight of Quantico's Lustrons were offered for free (with an application and $8,000 deposit) in 2006, yet only one individual came forward and acquired a home, which was disassembled and moved to storage in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, Nick. "A House of Dreams but Few Takers. Despite Inspiring Many, Quantico's Lustrons Hard to Unload," ''The Washington Post''. 25 Mar. 2007: T1&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-three of Quantico's Lustrons were demolished in 2006, and an additional thirty-four homes were razed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miroff|first1=Nick|title=Lights Out for Lustrons of Quantico|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/28/AR2007092802377.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=30 September 2007|page=T3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two remaining homes at the base are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and are currently used as maintenance buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miroff|first1=Nick|title=Even for Free, Metal Houses Lack Magnetism|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/14/AR2006071401936_pf.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=Washington Post|date=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
About 2,000 Lustron homes are still in existence in 36 states.&lt;ref name=Registry&gt;[http://www.lustronregistry.org/HTML/statistics.htm LustronRegistry.org], accessed March 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Many have been modified with additions, remodeled kitchens, vinyl windows, composite roofs, new heating systems, sheet rock interior walls, painted exteriors, and siding. Some have been dismantled, relocated and reassembled.

A restored Westchester Deluxe (sans ceiling and roof) from Arlington, Virginia, was reassembled inside the [[Ohio History Connection]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohiohistory.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in Columbus, Ohio, in 2013. It had been partially assembled (no bedrooms) for a few months in the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in Manhattan. The house is on display until December 2018 in Columbus.

A small group of Lustron owners are preserving the original condition of their homes and are urging others to do the same, and a significant number of entirely original Lustron homes exist. Over time, Lustron owners often removed the "[[Thor Washing Machine|Thor]]" brand combination washing machine/dish washer, and in cold regions, the ceiling's radiant heat systems were often replaced.

===Threats===
Demolition continues to threaten Lustrons where rising property values attract buyers who desire larger homes of newer construction. Other major threats to Lustron homes' integrity include: severe weather (tornadoes, hurricanes), vehicular or other impact, and lack of local zoning/preservation/aesthetic legislation.

==Current status==
Lombard, Illinois, in Dupage County had the most Lustron houses at 36. In Mount Morris, IL, 13 of the town's 18 Lustrons are located on Sunset Lane, First Street and Hannah Avenue, within walking distance of one another. There is one Lustron house included as a contributing property in the [[Euclid Avenue Historic District (Bristol, Virginia)|Euclid Avenue Historic District]] at [[Bristol, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Bristol/102-5022_EuclidAvenueHD_2005_NRfinal.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Euclid Avenue Historic District|author1=Teresa Douglass |author2=Phil Thomason |author3=Peggy Nickell |author4=Ellen Giese|date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{transl|ar|ALA|Naskh}}''''' ({{lang-ar|ÙØ³Ø®}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|nasá¸«}}&lt;span style="margin:2px"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;{{transl|ar|Wehr|nasá¸µ}}''&lt;span style="margin-left:3.5px"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; also known as '''''Naskhi''''' or by its [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name '''''Nesih'''''&lt;span style="margin-left:2px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; is a specific style of the [[Arabic alphabet]].
The root of this Arabic term ''{{transl|ar|ALA|nasakh-a}}'' ({{lang|ar|ÙØ³Ø®}})  means "to copy". It either refers to the fact that it replaced its predecessor, [[Kufic]] script, or that this style allows faster copying of texts. 

This type of script was derived from [[Thuluth]] by introducing a number of modifications resulting in smaller size and greater delicacy. It is written using a small, very fine pen known as a [[cava pen]], which makes the script eminently suitable for use in book production. Naskhi was used in copying [[Qur'an]]s,&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Qur'an Carpet Page; al-Fatihah|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/6807|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delails, En-ams and [[Hadith]]s. It was also used in commentaries on the Qur'an ([[Tafsir]]) and in collections of [[poetry]] ([[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]]). It was and is a very widely used form of script.

With major simplifications, such as reduction of script rules and forced horizontal alignment, this is the style most commonly used for printing [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Sindhi Language|Sindhi]] languages and for representations of the Arabic alphabet by [[computer font]]s.
Naskh, along with [[Ta'liq (script)|Ta'liq]], notably also gave rise to [[Nasta'liq script|Nasta'lÄ«q]], the style of script used for writing [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], and sometimes [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].

{{Anthropology of art}}
The '''Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology''' (formerly the '''Lowie Museum of Anthropology''') is an anthropology [[museum]] located in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus. 

==History==
Founded in 1901 under the patronage of [[Phoebe Hearst|Phoebe Apperson Hearst]], the original goal of the museum was to support systematic collecting efforts by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] in order to support a department of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of California]].  The Museum was originally located in [[San Francisco]] from 1903 (open to the public as of 1911) until 1931, when it moved to the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  On the Berkeley campus, the Museum was located in the former Civil Engineering Building until 1959, when it was moved to the newly built [[Kroeber Hall]]. In 1991, the Museum's name was changed to recognize the essential role of [[Phoebe Hearst|Phoebe Apperson Hearst]] as founder and patron. Today the Museum functions as a research unit of the University of California. 

Many notable names in American anthropology have been associated with the Museum. These include the Museumâs first director [[Frederic Ward Putnam]], the anthropologists [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], and [[William Bascom]], paleoanthropologists [[Francis Clark Howell]] and [[Tim D. White]], Egyptologists [[Klaus Baer]] and [[Cathleen Keller]], and archaeologists [[Max Uhle]], [[George Reisner]], [[John Howland Rowe]], [[J. Desmond Clark]], [[David Stronach]], [[Crawford Hallock Greenewalt, Jr.]] and [[Patrick Vinton Kirch]].  It was also the final residence of [[Ishi]], who lived there from 1911 until his death in 1916.

==Collections==
The Museum houses an estimated 3 million objects plus extensive documentation that includes [[fieldnotes]], photographs, and sound and film recordings.

Major collections include:

*Approximately 9,000 California Indian [[basket]]s, representing almost every tribe in California and all of the region's basketry techniques.
* A broad collection of approximately 20,000 [[ancient Egypt]]ian artifacts, with special emphasis on the various [[predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] cultures. The core of this collection comes from excavations carried out by [[George Reisner]] between 1899 and 1905.
* A large [[Ancient civilizations of Peru|Peruvian]] collection, especially strong in [[pottery]] and [[textiles]], including 9,200 objects collected by [[Max Uhle]] at the turn of the century.
* Approximately 32,000 African artifacts collected under anthropologist William Bascom and his students, and from the excavations of archaeologist [[J. Desmond Clark]].
* An important collection of Oceanic objects, including collections from the Trobriand Islands made by [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] in the early 1900s and archaeological collections from excavations in [[Fiji]] and [[New Caledonia]] undertaken by [[Edward Winslow Gifford|E.W. Gifford]] in the 1940s and 1950s.
* A collection of 12,000 Native American remains are stored in drawers and cabinets in the gym's basement.  It is one of the largest collections of human remains in the U.S. outside a cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montereyherald.com/article/ZZ/20080114/NEWS/801149942&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and activities==
In addition to supporting scholarly research and publication, the museum mounts exhibitions in a gallery located on the [[UC Berkeley]] campus, sponsors public educational programs, and works with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities on issues related to cultural property and [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|repatriation]].

The Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5905">'''Policy studies''' is a subdisicipline of [[political science]] that includes the analysis of the process of policymaking (the policy process) and the contents of policy ([[policy analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ascher|first1=William|title=The evolution of the policy sciences: Understanding the rise and avoiding the fall|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=5|issue=2|pages=365|date=1986|doi=10.2307/3323551|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/3323551|jstor=3323551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysis includes substantive area research (such as health or education policy), [[program evaluation]] and impact studies, and policy design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=419922|title=Political Science and Public Policy|first1=Paul|last1=Sabatier|date=1 June 1991|journal=Political Science &amp; Politics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=144â147|doi=10.2307/419922}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "involves systematically studying the nature, causes, and effects of alternative [[public policies]], with particular emphasis on determining the [[policies]] that will achieve given goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3110267|title=The Policy Studies Perspective|first1=Stuart S.|last1=Nagel|first2=Duncan|last2=MacRae|editor-first1=Robert L.|editor-last1=Lineberry|editor-first2=Theodore J.|editor-last2=Lowi|editor-first3=Alan|editor-last3=Stone|editor-first4=Charles O.|editor-last4=Jones|editor-first5=James A.|editor-last5=Wilde|editor-first6=R. A.

Policy Studies also examines the conflicts and conflict resolution that arise from the making of policies in civil society, the private sector, or more commonly, in the public sector (e.g. government).

It frequently focuses on the [[public sector]] but is equally applicable to other kinds of organizations (e.g., the not-for-profit sector).  Some policy study experts graduate from [[public policy school]]s with [[public policy degrees]]. Alternatively, experts may have backgrounds in [[policy analysis]], [[program evaluation]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]], [[law]], [[political science]], [[social work]], [[environmental planning]] and [[public administration]].

Traditionally, the field of policy studies focused on [[domestic policy]], with the notable exceptions of [[foreign policy|foreign]] and [[defense policy|defense policies]]. However, the wave of [[economic globalization]], which ensued in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, created a need for a subset of policy studies that focuses on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]]. This subset of policy studies, which is often referred to as international policy studies, typically requires mastery of a [[second language]] and attention to [[cross-cultural]] issues in order to address [[nation]]al and [[cultural bias]]es. For example, the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]] at [[Middlebury College]] offers Master of Arts programs that focus exclusively on [[international]] policy through a mix of [[interdisciplinary]] and [[cross-cultural]] analysis called the "Monterey Way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miis.edu/academics/courses|title=Courses - Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of academic programs in policy studies include the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and the [[LBJ School of Public Affairs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17649">'''Political satire''' is [[satire]] that specializes in gaining entertainment from [[politics]]; it has also been used with [[subversive]] intent where [[Political discourse analysis|political speech]] and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.

Political satire is usually distinguished from political [[protest]] or [[political dissent]], as it does not necessarily carry an agenda nor seek to influence the political process. While occasionally it may, it more commonly aims simply to provide entertainment. By its very nature, it rarely offers a constructive view in itself; when it is used as part of protest or dissent, it tends to simply establish the error of matters rather than provide solutions.

==Origins and genres==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Ghjkl.JPG|left|thumb|Animated shows like South Park are notorious for political satire]] --&gt;
Satire can be traced back throughout history; wherever organized [[government]], or social categories, has existed, so has satire.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The oldest example that has survived till today is [[Aristophanes]]. In his time satire targeted top politicians, like Cleon,&lt;ref&gt;Stephanos Matthaios, Franco Montanari, Antonios Rengakos [https://books.google.com/books?id=EZuetiBvK-wC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207 ''Ancient Scholarship and Grammar: Archetypes, Concepts and Contexts''] pp.207-8&lt;/ref&gt; and religion, at the time headed by Zeus. "Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith," leading to an increased doubt towards religion by the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Ehrenberg (historian)|Ehrenberg, Victor]] (1962) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oikOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263 ''The people of Aristophanes: a sociology of old Attic comedy''] p.263 quotation: {{quotation|The fact that the gods could be brought down to a human or 'far too human' level is certainly rooted in the very nature of Greek religion, and there is no doubt that this attitude contributed to the gradual undermining of the old belief in the gods. [...] To tell immoral and scandalous stories about the gods did not offend average religious feeling; it troubled only advanced spirits like Xenophanes and Pintar [...] and it is clear that people no longer believed either in the story or in Zeus. Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith, above all faith in the gods' power, and it was from this that doubt began to grow.&lt;br&gt; The power of the gods, whose dignity and stringth were impressively reflected in most of the tragedies, however different the religious attitudes of the tragic poets were, this same power was on the same festival days belittled and questioned by the comic poets who made fun of the gods and represented traditional and sacred forms in a starling manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman period, for example, gives us the satirical poems and epigrams of [[Martial]]. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers often engaged in political satire.

Due to lack of political freedom of speech in many ancient civilizations, [[covert satire]] is more usual than overt satire in ancient literatures of [[political liberalism]]. Historically, the [[public opinion]] in the [[Athenian democracy]] was remarkably influenced by the political [[satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching or reading satire has since ancient time been considered one of the best ways to understand a culture and a society.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes I: Clouds, Wasps, Birds'', Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Piscitelli (1993) [http://mysite.verizon.net/thelogos/lect-2.htm ''Before Socrates-Diotima''] ''The Special Case of Aristophanes: Tribal and Civil Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aristophanes'', pp.42-seq&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th and 21st Centuries satire is found in an increasing number of media (in [[cartoon]]s as [[political cartoon]]s with heavy [[caricature]] and exaggeration, and in [[List of political magazines|political magazine]]s) and the parallel exposure of [[political scandal]]s to performances (including [[television]] shows). Examples include musicians such as [[Tom Lehrer]], live performance groups like the [[Capitol Steps]] and the [[Montana Logging and Ballet Co.]], and public television and live performer [[Mark Russell]]. Additional subgenres include such literary classics as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and more recently, internet ''[[Ezine]]'' and website sources such as ''[[The Onion]]''.

==19th century==
===France===
One example is [[Maurice Joly]]'s 1864 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu''), which attacks the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]]. It was first published in [[Brussels]] in 1864. The piece used the literary device of a [[dialogue]] between two diabolical plotters in [[Hell]], the historical characters of [[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], to cover up a direct, and illegal, attack on Napoleon's rule.  The noble baron Montesquieu made the case for [[liberalism]]; the [[Florence|Florentine]] political writer Machiavelli presented the case for cynical [[despotism]]. In this manner, Joly communicated the secret ways in which liberalism might spawn a despot like Napoleon III. However, [[The Prince#Interpretation of The Prince as political satire|''The Prince'']] itself has also been sometimes understood as political satire.

===Germany===
{{Main|Kabarett}}
According to [[George Santayana|Santayana]], Nietzsche was actually "a keen satirist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/Santayana%27s%20Criticism%20of%20Nietzsche.htm#The%20Superman George Santayana : ''Egotism in German Philosophy''. 1915. chapter 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's satire" was aimed at Lutheranism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1kRbO4M5CB0C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Nietzsche+%22Lutheran+revivalist%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gniaAiHyMW&amp;sig=bx8O9CCvIvECzRJ3MPV81Nr-I2o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bFrSSYrzKorItgfV14zxBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Christa Davis Acampora &amp; Ralph R. Acampora : ''A Nietzchean Bestiary''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003. p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In UK media==
The UK has a long tradition of political satire, dating from the early years of English literature. In some readings, a number of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays can be seen â or at least performed â as satire, including ''[[Richard III]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Later examples such as [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' are more outright in their satirical nature.

In modern era, political satire in the [[United Kingdom]] includes pamphlets and newspaper articles, such as ''[[Private Eye]]'', topical television panel shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', and television series such as ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'' and ''[[The Thick of It]]'' and ''[[ToryBoy The Movie]]''.

==On American television==
Satire became more visible on American television during the 1960s. Some of the early shows that used political satire include the British and American versions of the program ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' (airing on the [[American Broadcasting Company]], or ABC, in the U.S.), [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. During the months leading up to the 1968 presidential election, [[Richard Nixon]] appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and repeated the program's catch-phrase "Sock it to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of satire of the 1960s and early 1970s typically used the sitcom format, such as the show ''[[All in the Family]]''.

When ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' debuted in 1975, the show began to change the way that comedians would depict the president on television. [[Chevy Chase]] opened the fourth episode of the show with his impersonation of a bumbling [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, "With All Due Respect: Satirizing Presidents from ''Saturday Night Live'' to ''Lil' Bush''", in Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; Chase did not change his appearance to look like President Ford, and he portrayed the president by repeatedly falling down on the stage. Some of the other famous presidential impersonations on ''Saturday Night Live'' include [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] caricatures, [[Dana Carvey]] as [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Darrell Hammond]] as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Will Ferrell]] as [[George W. Bush]], and [[Jay Pharoah]] as [[Barack Obama]]. Hammond was the first cast member to impersonate [[Donald Trump]], but now [[Alec Baldwin]] portrays him.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, ''Saturday Night Live'' gained wide attention because former cast member [[Tina Fey]] returned to the show to satirize Republican Vice Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]. In addition to Fey's striking physical resemblance to Palin, the impersonation of the vice presidential candidate was also noteworthy because of Fey's humorous use of some of exactly the same words Palin used in media interviews and campaign speeches as a way to perform political satire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b_Kaca5Fp-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=entertaining+politics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BryaUZqoKYb_4AOXtoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, ''Entertaining Politics: Satiric Television and Political Engagement''. 2nd edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2010. p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saturday Night Live'' also uses political satire throughout its ''[[Weekend Update]]'' sketch. ''Weekend Update'' is a fake news segment on the show that satirizes politics and current events. It has been a part of ''SNL'' since the first episode of the show on October 11, 1975.

''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' use stylistic formats that are similar to ''Weekend Update''. On ''The Daily Show'', host [[Jon Stewart]] used footage from news programs to satirize politics and the news media. [[Stephen Colbert]] performed in character on ''The Colbert Report'' as a right-wing news pundit. Both hosts' television programs were broadcast on [[Comedy Central]], while ''The Daily Show'' continues to run featuring [[Trevor Noah|a new host]]. Colbert became the host of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]'', succeeding David Letterman. With their shows, Stewart and Colbert helped increase public and academic discussion of the significance of political satire. ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' and ''[[The Jim Jefferies Show]]'' are also examples of political commentary.

=== Contributions ===
According to the findings of the 2004 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], both younger and older audiences are turning to late-night comedy shows as not only a source of entertainment, but also for an opportunity to gain political awareness.&lt;ref name="Baym"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|pages=259â276|doi=10.1080/10584600591006492|issn=1091-7675}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Geoffrey Baym suggests that shows that make use of political satire, such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'', should be considered as a form of [[alternative media|alternative journalism]].&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Utilizing satire has shown to be an attractive feature in news programming, drawing in the audiences of less politically engaged demographic cohorts. Moreover, satire news programming can be considered alternative because satire plays an important role in dissecting and critiquing  power.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

In his article ''The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism'', Baym detailed how ''[[The Daily Show]]'', then hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], presented news stories. For the satire news show, presenting information in a comprehensive manner was used to give viewers a greater perspective of a situation.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Often, Stewart studded his segments with additional background information, or reminders of relevant and past details.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; For example, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' displayed the full video of [[George W. Bush|Bush's]] comments regarding [[George Tenet|Tenet's]] resignation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; This was a deliberate choice by the show in attempt to give a more sincere representation of the event.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Moreover, it can be seen as a challenge and critique of what more traditional news shows failed to include.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; In this way, satire news can be seen as more informative than other news sources. Notably, research findings released by [[National Annenberg Election Survey|National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES)]] concede that followers of satire news are more knowledgeable and consume more news than the general population.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Joseph Faina has considered the satire used in news shows as a facilitator in developing a [[Citizen journalism|public journalism]] practice.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Faina explains in his article that the nature of satire encourages viewers to become politically engaged, and a [[Citizen journalism|civic participant]], in which the humor exercised by hosts elicit responses in viewers.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; However, Faina has acknowledged that this model is somewhat idealistic.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Nevertheless, Faina argues that the potential still exists.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Not to mention, with the rise in technology and the growing ubiquity of cellular phones, it can be argued that civic participation is all the more easier to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Natalie|editor1-last=Allan|editor1-first=Stuart|title=News in the Digital Age|journal=The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (1|date=October 2009|pages=557â567|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns ===
Though satire in news is celebrated as a vehicle toward a more informed public, such view is not universally shared among scholars.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Dannagal G.|title=Lighten up: How satire will make American politics relevant again|url=http://archives.cjr.org/cover_story/lighten_up.php|website=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have expressed their hesitancy toward the infiltration of lighthearted practices to cover more dire topics like political affair.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; Potentially off-color remarks, or vulgar comments made by the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]] of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', or [[Samantha Bee]], host of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]]'', can be used as examples of what critics are concerned over. Here, satire is believed to diminish the gravity of a topic.&lt;ref name="Faina"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faina|first1=Joseph|title=Public journalism is a joke: The case for Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert|journal=Journalism|date=2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=541 â555|doi=10.1177/1464884912448899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baym proposes that as these shows are [[alternative media|alternative]], they have no obligation to "abide by standard practices".&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Unlike traditional news sources, which may be required to adhere to certain agendas, like political affiliation or advertising restrictions, hosts of satire news shows are free and zealous to showcase personal contributions through their mentions of disdain, qualms, and excitement. Critics of satire in news shows thus believe that the showcasing of an overly and openly frustrated host will induce or perpetuate "cynicism in viewers".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19090">'''Linguistic prediction''' is a phenomenon in [[psycholinguistics]] occurring whenever information about a word or other linguistic unit is activated before that unit is actually encountered. Evidence from [[eyetracking]], [[event-related potentials]], and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words, language users may, under certain conditions, try to predict upcoming words. 
In particular, prediction seems to occur regularly when the context of a sentence greatly limits the possible words that have not yet been revealed. For instance, a person listening to a sentence like, "In the summer it is hot, and in the winter it is..." would be highly likely to predict the sentence completion "cold" in advance of actually hearing it. A form of prediction is also thought to occur in some types of [[priming (psychology)|lexical priming]], a phenomenon whereby a word becomes easier to process if it is preceded by a related word.&lt;ref name=Neely1991&gt;Neely, J. (1991). Semantic priming in visual word recognition: a selective review of current theories and findings. In: Basic processes in reading: visual word recognition (Besner D, Humphreys GW, eds), pp 264 â336. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguistic prediction is an active area of research in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]].

==Evidence from eyetracking==

===Visual world paradigms===
In the [[eyetracking]] [[visual world paradigm]], experimental subjects listen to a sentence while staring at an array of pictures on a computer monitor. Their [[saccade|eye movements]] are recorded, allowing the experimenter to understand how language influences eye movements toward pictures related to the content of the sentence. Experiments of this type have shown that while listening to the verb in a sentence, comprehenders anticipatorily move their eyes to the picture of the verb's likely [[direct object]] (e.g. "cake" rather than "ball" while hearing, "The boy will eat...").&lt;ref name=Altmann1999&gt;Altmann, G. &amp; Kamide, Y. (1999). Incremental interpretation at verbs: restricting the domain of subsequent reference. ''Cognition'', 73, 247â264.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations using the same experimental setup showed that the verb's [[subject (grammar)|subject]] can also determine which object comprehenders anticipate (e.g., comprehenders look at the merry-go-round rather than the motorcycle while hearing, "The little girl will ride...").&lt;ref name=KamideHaywood2003&gt;Kamide, Y., Altmann, G. &amp; Haywood, S. (2003). The time-course of prediction in incremental sentence process- ing: evidence from anticipatory eye movements. Journal of Memory and Language, 49, 133â159.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In short, comprehenders use the information in the sentence context to predict the meanings of upcoming words. In these experiments, comprehenders used the verb and its subject to activate information about the verb's direct object before hearing that word. However, another experiment has shown that in a language with more flexible word order ([[German language|German]]), comprehenders can also use context to predict the sentence's subject.&lt;ref name=KamideScheepers&gt;Kamide, Y., Scheepers, C. &amp; Altmann, G. (2003). Integration of Syntactic and Semantic Information in Predictive Processing: Cross-Linguistic Evidence from German and English. Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 32 (1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural reading===
Eyetracking technology has also been used to monitor readers' [[saccade|eye movements]] while they [[reading (process)|read]] text on a computer screen. Data from this kind of experiment has supported the hypothesis that readers use contextual information to predict upcoming words during natural reading. Specifically, readers [[fixation (visual)|fixate]] their eyes on a word for a shorter time when the word occurs in a moderately or highly constraining context, compared to the same word in an unconstrained context. This is true regardless of the word's [[frequency list|frequency]] or length. Readers are also more likely to skip over a word in a highly constraining context only.&lt;ref name=Rayner1996&gt;Rayner, K. &amp; Well, A. (1996). Effects of contextual constraint on eye movements in reading: A further examination. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 3 (4), 504-509.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations of reading in the [[Chinese characters|Chinese logographic script]] have shown that despite the large differences between the Chinese and English orthographies, readers exploit contextual information for prediction in similar ways, with the exception that Chinese readers were more likely to skip words in moderately constraining contexts.&lt;ref name=Rayner2005&gt;Rayner, K., Li, X., Juhasz, B. &amp; Yan, G. (2005). The effect of word predictability on the eye movements of Chinese readers. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 12 (6), 1089-1093.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2003). The E-Z Reader model of eye movement control in reading: Comparisons to other models.

==Evidence from event-related potentials==

===M100===
The [[N100|M100]] discussed here is the magnetic equivalent of the [[visual N1]] potentialâan event-related potential linked to visual processing and attention. The M100 was also linked to prediction in language comprehension in a series of event-related [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) experiments. In these experiments, participants read words whose visual forms were either predictable or unpredictable based on prior linguistic context&lt;ref name=Dikker2010&gt;Dikker, S., Rabagliati, H., Farmer, T. &amp; PylkkÃ¤nen, L. (2010). Early occipital sensitivity to syntactic category is based on form typicality. Psychological Science,  21(5), 629-634.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dikker2009&gt;Dikker, S., Rabagliati, H. &amp; PylkkÃ¤nen, L. (2009). Sensitivity to syntax in visual cortex. ''Cognition'', 110 (3), 293-321.&lt;/ref&gt; or based on a recently seen picture.&lt;ref name=Dikker2011&gt;Dikker, S. &amp; PylkkÃ¤nen, L. (2011). Before the N400: Effects of lexicalâsemantic violations in visual cortex. Brain and Language 118, 23-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The predictability of the word's visual form (but not the predictability of its meaning) affected the amplitude of the M100. 
There is ongoing controversy about whether this M100 effect is related to the [[early left anterior negativity]] (eLAN), an event-related potential response to words that is theorized to reflect the brain's assignment of local [[phrase structure]].&lt;ref name=Freiderici2007&gt;Friederici, A. &amp; Weissenborn, J. (2007). Mapping sentence form onto meaning: The syntax-semantic interface. Brain Research, 1146, 50-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===P2===
The [[P200|P2]] component is generally thought to reflect higher-order perceptual processing and its modulation by attention. However, it has also been linked to prediction of visual word forms. The P2 response to words in highly constraining contexts is often larger than the P2 response to words in less constraining contexts. When experimental participants read words that are presented to the left or right of their visual fixation (stimulating the opposite [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain first), the larger P2 for words in highly constraining contexts is observed only for right visual field presentation (targeting left hemisphere).&lt;ref name=Wlotko2007&gt;Wlotko, E. &amp; Federmeier, K. (2007). Finding the right word: Hemispheric asymmetries in the use of sentence context information. Neuropsychologia, 45, 3001-3014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the PARLO hypothesis that linguistic prediction is mainly a function of the left hemisphere, discussed below.

===N400===
The [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] is part of the normal ERP response to potentially meaningful stimuli, whose amplitude is inversely correlated with the predictability of a stimuli in a particular context.&lt;ref name=Kutas1984&gt;Kutas, M., &amp; Hillyard, S. A., (1984). Brain Potentials during reading reflect word expectancy and semantic association. ''Nature'', 307, 161-163.&lt;/ref&gt;  In sentence processing, the predictability of a word is established by two related factors: 'cloze probability' and  'sentential constraint'.  [[Cloze test|Cloze]] probability reflects the expectancy of a target word given the context of the sentence, which is determined by the percentage of individuals who supply the word when completing a sentence whose final word is missing.  Kutas and colleagues found that the N400 to sentences final words with cloze probability of 90% was smaller (i.e., more positive) than the N400 for words with cloze probability of 70%, which was then smaller for words with cloze probability of 30%.
Closely related, sentential constraint reflects the degree to which the context of the sentence constrains the number of acceptable continuations.  Whereas cloze probability is the percent of individuals who choose a particular word, constraint is the number of different words chosen by a representative sample of individuals.  Although words that are not predicted elicit a larger N400, the N400 to unpredicted words that are [[Semantics|semantically]] related to the predicted word elicit a smaller N400 than when the unpredicted words are semantically unrelated.  When the sentence context is highly constraining, semantically related words receive further facilitation in that the N400 to semantically related words is smaller in high constraint sentences than in low constraint sentences.&lt;ref name=Federmeier1999&gt;Federmeier, K. D., &amp; Kutas, M. (1999). Right words and left words: electrophysiological evidence for hemispheric differences in meaning processing. Cognitive Brain Research, 8, 373-392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Federmeier2002&gt;Federmeier, K. D., McLennan, D. B., De Ochoa, E., Kutas, M. (2002). The impact of semantic memory organization and sentence context information on spoken language processing by younger and older adults: an ERP study. Psychophysiology, 39, 133-146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Federmeier2007&gt;Federmeier, K. D. (2007). Thinking ahead: the role and roots of prediction in language comprehension. Psychophysiology, 44, 491-505.&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence for the prediction of specific words comes from a study by DeLong et al.&lt;ref name=DeLong2005&gt;DeLong, K. A., Urbach, T. P., Kutas, M. (2005). Probabilistic word pre-activation during language comprehension inferred from electrical brain activity. Nature Neuroscience, 8, 1117-1145.&lt;/ref&gt; DeLong and colleagues took advantage of the use of different [[Article (grammar)|indefinite articles]], 'A' and 'AN' for English words that begin with a consonant or vowel respectively. They found that when the most probable sentence completion began with a consonant, the N400 was larger for 'AN' than for 'A' and vice versa, suggesting that prediction occurs at both a semantic and lexical level during language processing.

===Late positivity===

====P300====

The [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]], specifically the [[P3b]] is an ERP response to improbable stimuli and is sensitive to the subjective probability that a particular stimulus will occur.  The P300 has been closely tied to context updating, which can be initiated by unexpected stimuli.&lt;ref name=Donchin1988&gt;Donchin, E., &amp; Coles, M. G. H., (1988). Is the P300 component a manifestation of context updating? The Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 11, 357â374.&lt;/ref&gt;

====P600====

The [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]] an ERP response to [[Syntax|syntactic]] violations, as well as complex, but error free, language.&lt;ref name=Osterhout1992&gt;Osterhout, L., &amp; Holcomb, P. J. (1992). Event-related brain potentials elicited by syntactic anomaly. Journal of Memory and Language, 31(6), 785-806.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friederici1996&gt;Friederici, A. D., Hahne, A., &amp; Mecklinger, A. (1996). Temporal structure of syntactic parsing: early and late event-related brain potential effects. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 22, 1219-1248.&lt;/ref&gt;  A P600-like response is also observed for [[theta role|thematically]] implausible sentences: example, "For breakfast, the eggs would only EAT toast and jam".&lt;ref name=Kuperberg2003&gt;Kuperberg, G. R., Sitnikova, T., Caplan, D., Holcomb, P. (2003). Electrophysiological distinctions in processing conceptual relationships within simple sentences. Cognitive Brain Research, 17, 117-129.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both P600 responses are generally attributed to the process of revising or continuing the analysis of the sentence.&lt;ref name=Kuperberg2007&gt;Kuperberg, G. R. (2007). Neural mechanisms of language comprehension: challenges to syntax. Brain Research, 1146, 23-49.&lt;/ref&gt; The syntactic P600 has been compared to the P300 in that both responses are sensitive to similar manipulations; importantly, the probability of the stimulus.&lt;ref name=Coulson1998&gt;Coulson, S., King, J. W., &amp; Kutas, M. (1998). Expect the unexpected: event-related brain response to morphosyntactic violations. Language and Cognitive Processes, 13, 21-58.&lt;/ref&gt;  The similarity between the two responses may suggest that the P300 significantly contributes to the syntactic P600 response.

====Post-N400 positivity====

A late positivity is often observed subsequent to the N400. Recent [[meta-analysis]] of the ERP literature on language processing has identified two different Post-N400 Positivities.&lt;ref name=VanPetten2011&gt;Van Petten, C., Luka, B. J., Prediction during language comprehension: Benefits, costs, and ERP components. International Journal of Psychophsiology. (2011). {{doi|10.1016/j.jpsycho.2011.09.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparing the Post-N400 Positivity (PNP) for congruent and incongruent sentence final words, a parietal PNP is observed for incongruent words.  This parietal PNP is similar to the typical P600 response, suggesting continued or revised analysis.  Within the congruent condition, when comparing high- and low-cloze probability sentence final words, a PNP response (if it is observed) is generally distributed across the front of the scalp. A recent study has shown that the frontal PNP may reflect processing an unexpected lexical item instead of an unexpected concept, suggesting that the frontal PNP reflects disconfirmed lexical predictions.&lt;ref name="VanPetten2011"/&gt;

==Evidence from functional imaging==
[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is a [[neuroimaging]] technology that uses [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] to measure blood oxygenation levels in the brain and spinal cord. Because neural activity affects blood flow, the pattern of the [[hemodynamic response]] is thought to correspond closely to the pattern of neural activity. The fine spatial resolution afforded by fMRI allows [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientists]] to see in detail which areas of the brain are activated in relation to an experimental task. However, the hemodynamic response is much slower than the neural activity measured by [[electroencephalography|EEG]] and [[magnetoencephalography|MEG]]. This poor sensitivity to timing information makes fMRI a less useful technique than EEG or [[eyetracking]] for studying linguistic prediction.
One exception is an fMRI test of the differences in neural activation between strategic and automatic [[semantic priming]]. When the time between the prime and the target word is short (around 150 milliseconds), priming is theorized to rely on automatic neural processes. However, at longer time intervals (approaching 1 second), it is thought that experimental subjects strategically predict related upcoming words and suppress unrelated words, leading to a processing penalty in the event that an unrelated word actually occurs.&lt;ref name="Neely1991"/&gt; An fMRI test of this hypothesis showed that at longer intervals, the processing penalty for an incorrect prediction is related to heightened activity in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] and [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref name=Gold2006&gt;Gold, B., Balota, D., Jones, S., Powell, D., Smith, C., &amp; Andersen, A. (2006). Dissociation of Automatic and Strategic Lexical-Semantics: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evidence for Differing Roles of Multiple Frontotemporal Regions. Journal of Neuroscience, 26 (24), 6523-6532.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of prediction ==

=== PARLO theory===
The PARLO ("Production Affects Reception in Left Only") framework is a theory of the neural domains supporting language prediction. It is based on evidence that shows that the left and right hemispheres differentially contribute to language comprehension.&lt;ref name="Federmeier2007"/&gt;  Generally, the neural structures that support [[language production]] are predominantly in the left hemisphere for most individuals creating an [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric asymmetry]], which results in differential language processing abilities of the two hemispheres.  Because of its spatially close ties and intergation with language production, left hemisphere language comprehension seems to be driven by expectancy and context in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] manner, whereas the right hemisphere seems to integrate information in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] manner.&lt;ref name="Federmeier2007"/&gt;  The PARLO framework suggests that both prediction and integration occur during language processing but rely on the distinct contributions of the two hemispheres of the brain.

=== Surprisal theory ===
The surprisal theory is a theory of [[sentence processing]] based on [[information theory]].&lt;ref name=Levy2008&gt;Levy, R. (2008). Expectation-based syntactic comprehension. ''Cognition'', 106(3), 1126-1177.&lt;/ref&gt; In the surprisal theory, the cost of processing a word is determined by its [[self-information]], or how predictable the word is, given its context. A highly probable word carries a small amount of self-information and would therefore be processed easily, as measured by reduced [[reaction time]], a smaller N400 response, or reduced fixation times in an eyetracking reading study. Empirical tests of this theory have shown a high degree of match between processing cost measures and the self-information values assigned to words.&lt;ref name=Levetal2011&gt;Levy, R., Fedorenko, E., Breen, M. and Gibson, T.

The '''Research Centre for East European Studies''' (''Forschungsstelle Osteuropa'') at the [[University of Bremen]] was founded in 1982. Under the directorship of Professor Wolfgang Eichwede, it has since then carved its own distinctive niche within the German academic community through an intensive study of recent developments in the culture and society of Central and East European countries.

Following the collapse of Communist rule, the institutes's research concentrated both on the cultural and socio-political continuities across the period of upheaval, and on the newly emerging potential for innovation in political and economic culture and [[cultural identity]]. In contrast to the predominantly economic approach to the transformation taking place in Eastern and Central Eastern Europe, the Research Centre places the traditions and potential of the region at the centre of attention. The institute endeavors to enable an understanding of the countries from the inside, and in this way make a genuine contribution to the drawing together of Europe.

Even before the radical political changes this was one of the tasks of the Research Centre: during the 1980s, it gave attention above all to the appearance of independent artistic and intellectual creativity. The focus on [[dissident]] culture was intertwined with the aspiration to track informal tendencies and intellectual approaches which could give an insight into the societies of the region. Alongside its research, the institute was able to build up a comprehensive and internationally renowned archive of [[Samizdat| Samizdat literature]]. It contains banned or unofficial artistic, literary and academic writings from [[Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and the [[East Germany|GDR]] (East Germany). The Russian collection also includes the private archives of leading Russian figures. A third branch of the institutes's activity is public work in the form of cultural and political consultancy in Germany and abroad.

== Structure ==

The Research Centre has charitable status and is registered in the federal states of Bremen, Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia. It was initially funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, but since 1986/7 it has received subsidies from the joint committee of the educational ministries of the German federal republics. The institute is closely connected with the University of Bremen, not only in that it is situated on the site of the university, but also in that its director holds a professorial chair at the university, and through concrete agreements and cooperation. The Research Centre has three subdivisions: research, the archive and library and public work in the form of cultural and political consultancy.

== Current projects ==

;Contemporary and cultural history
Using its extensive archive, which contains well in excess of 150,000 Samizdat documents and more than 300 private archives, the Research Centre organised a series of large-scale exhibitions titled ''Samizdat. Alternative Culture in Central and Eastern Europe from the 1960s to the 1980s''.&lt;ref&gt;The Conception of the Exhibition, in: Eichwede, W. (ed.) Samizdat. Alternative Culture in Central and Eastern Europe from the 1960s to the 1980s, Bremen 2002, p. 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition in Berlin was opened by the [[mayor of Budapest]] and former human rights activist [[GÃ¡bor Demszky]], that in Prague by the presidents of Germany and Czechoslovakia [[Johannes Rau]] and [[VÃ¡clav Havel]], in Brussels by the EU commissioner [[GÃ¼nter Verheugen]] and in Budapest by the German foreign minister [[Joschka Fischer]]. The exhibitions were received enthusiastically by the public. In Prague alone there were 75,000 visitors.

The Research Centre has built on this success by putting together another exhibition ''Counterviews. Photographs of the Political and Cultural Opposition in Eastern Europe 1956-1989''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamersky, Heidrun (ed.):
"Gegenansichten". Fotografien zur politischen und  kulturellen Opposition in Osteuropa 1956-1989, Verlag Chr. Links, Berlin 2005, {{ISBN|3-86153-373-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes the form of a touring exhibition which at present travels throughout Europe.

Alongside comprehensive individual research projects on dissent and society throughout Eastern and Central Eastern Europe, a joint research association funded by the Volkswagen Foundation has started its work in collaboration with institutes in Moscow, Warsaw, Poznan, Prague and Budapest on the topic ''âThe other Europe â the 1960s-1980s. Dissent in Politics and Society; Cultural Alternatives. Contributions to a Comparative Historyâ''. In this way, the Research Centre in cooperation with other German universities and partner organizations in the USA and Western Europe will become an important centre for the study of the contemporary history of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

At the moment a database is being created for the unique collections within the Bremen archive, which on account of its use of five different languages resembles a large-scale pilot project. A regular series of publications giving an overview of the contents of the archive will be forthcoming in 2008.

;Studies of the present - politics, economics and culture
In this area, the most notable research projects have in the past few years dealt with economic culture and informal politics. The topics investigated included taxation, the role of trust in business relations, the political influence of companies and the development of corporate governance. The majority of these projects were made possible through third-party funds.

Other recent areas of research (some of which were comparative) include the development of a new state symbolism in Russia and Slovakia, processes of the construction of identity and the politics of history in Poland, the Czech Republic and Russia. In addition, there are individual studies on various countries and regions.

A new focal point is the integration of the former socialist EU-member states in the decision-making process of the European Union. Above all, it is concerned with the role of civic interest and lobby group. Within the Sixth Framework Programme for Research of the European Union, the institute is a team leader in the integrated project,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.eu-newgov.org New Modes of Governance]''&lt;/ref&gt; which is headed by the European University Institute in Florence. A further third-party funded research project investigates how the Polish, Czech and Slovakian trade unions cope with EU governance.&lt;ref&gt;Pleines, Heiko; Obradovic, Daniela (Eds.)
The Capacity of Central and East European Interest Groups to Participate in EU Governance, {{ISBN|978-3-89821-750-7}}, ISSN 1863-8716.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000 the Research Centre has organized conferences for young scholars specializing in Eastern Europe. At the moment this is funded by the Otto-Wolff Foundation. In addition the Research Center organizes summer schools [http://www.changing-europe.org Changing Europe], sponsored by the Volkswagen Foundation. The first one took place in 2006 and selected contributions have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Pleines, Heiko; Fischer, Sabine; SchrÃ¶der, Hans-Henning (Eds.) Movements, Migrants, Marginalisation.

Restructuring of the Economic Elites after State Socialism. Recruitment, Institutions and Attitudes, ibidem-Verlag 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-89821-754-5}}, ISSN 1863-8716.
&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the summer schools is to bring together a select group of doctoral students from throughout the world and assist their integration into the research community of East European studies. Over 40 academics of international renown are involved in various functions under the supervision of the Research Centre in the work of the summer school.

== Publications ==

The results of the institutes's research are published in two series (''âStudies in East European Culture and Societyâ'' published by LIT-Verlag and ''âChanging Europeâ'' published by Ibidem-Verlag) and as individual volumes. The archive of the Research Centre produces its own series of works published by Ibidem-Verlag. In addition, the Research Centre brings out in journal form the series  ''Working papers and materials of the Research Centre for East European Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.forschungsstelle.uni-bremen.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=45&amp;Itemid=68 Working papers and materials of the Research Centre for East European Studies] (mostly in German)''&lt;/ref&gt; which contains 10 issues each year.

Moreover, the subsection dealing with studies of the present offers regular e-mail services, which include updates on individual countries in the region in German&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.laender-analysen.de www.laender-analysen.de] The joint website of all issued newsletters''&lt;/ref&gt; and English.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.res.ethz.ch/analysis/rad The Russian Analytical Digest]''&lt;br&gt;''[http://kultura-rus.de/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=32&amp;lang=en kultura - Russian cultural review in English]''&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, they have over 16,000 subscribers from the worlds of politics, economics and the media, as well as interested members of the public. In cooperation with the [http://www.kices.org Koszalin Institute of Comparative European Studies] the Research Center offers regular bibliographic e-mail servises, which cover books and articles recently published in English and German on politics, foreign policy, economic and social affairs.

== International Partner Organizations ==

The Research Centre amongst others works together with the following institutions in the former communist states:

The non-governmental organization [[Memorial (society)|MEMORIAL]] in Moscow, which like the Research Centre has an academic interest in Soviet dissidents, the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] and the [http://d1.hse.ru/lingua/en/newspaper.html Moscow Higher School of Economics], with which a lively exchange program of researchers takes place in Russia.

The Institute of Contemporary History in Prague and the Institute of Sociology of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] in the Czech Republic. The archive KARTA in Warsaw and the Chair of Polish Studies and Comparative Literature at the University of Poznan in Poland. The Faculty of Political Sciences at the [[Comenius University in Bratislava|Comenius University Bratislava]] in the Slovak Republic.

Furthermore, international networks exist with institutions in the USA (e.g. [[Hoover Institution|Hoover]], [[Harvard]] and the [[Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum|Zimmerli Art Museum, New Brunswick]]) and Western Europe (e.g. [[ETH ZÃ¼rich]], the [[University of Amsterdam]] and [[Cambridge University]]).

'''Richard Edgar Pipes''' ({{lang-pl|Ryszard Pipes}}; July 11, 1923 â May 17, 2018) was a [[Polish American]] academic who specialized in [[Russian history]], particularly with respect to the [[Soviet Union]], who espoused a strong [[anti-communist]] point of view throughout his career. In 1976 he headed [[Team B]], a team of analysts organized by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] who analyzed the strategic capacities and goals of the Soviet military and political leadership. Pipes was the father of American historian and expert on American foreign policy and the Middle East, [[Daniel Pipes]].

Pipes was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Cieszyn]], Poland, which fled the country as refugees after it was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]]. Settling in the United States in 1940, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1943 while serving in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].
From 1958 to 1996, Pipes worked at [[Harvard University]].

==Personal life==
Richard Pipes was born in [[Cieszyn]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] to an assimilated Jewish family (whose name had originally been spelled "Piepes").&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, Richard. ''Vixi: Memoirs of a Non-Belonger''. 2006, pp. 14â5&lt;/ref&gt; His father Marek was a businessman and a [[Polish Legions (World War I)|Polish legionnaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historia.uwazamrze.pl/artykul/774489,949992.html?p=4 |title=UwaÅ¼am Rze Historia |publisher=Historia.uwazamrze.pl |date= |accessdate=2015-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216095659/http://www.historia.uwazamrze.pl/artykul/774489,949992.html?p=4 |archive-date=February 16, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By Pipes's own account, during his childhood and youth, he never thought about the Soviet Union; the major cultural influences on him were Polish and German.  When he was age 16, Pipes laid eyes upon [[Adolf Hitler]] at [[MarszaÅkowska Street, Warsaw|MarszaÅkowska Street in Warsaw]] when Hitler made a victory tour after the [[Invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Pipes|first=Richard|interviewer=Jay Nordlinger|title=Need To Know with Mona Charen and Jay Nordlinger|url=http://ricochet.com/podcasts/need-to-know/The-Growling-Bear|date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pipes family fled occupied Poland in October 1939 and arrived in the United States in July 1940, after seven months passing through Italy.&lt;ref name = "Romano"&gt;{{cite book| first = Sergio| last = Romano| year = 2005| title = Memorie di un conservatore| page = 180| publisher = TEA| isbn = 88-304-2128-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Notes on Professor Richard Pipes | work=Persiancarpetguide.com | url=http://www.persiancarpetguide.com/sw-asia/People/Bio938.htm | accessdate=January 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pipes became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1943 while serving in the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. He was educated at [[Muskingum College]], [[Cornell University]], and [[Harvard University]]. He married Irene Eugenia Roth in 1946, and had two children with her. His son [[Daniel Pipes]] is a scholar of Middle Eastern affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Anne. ''Leo Strauss and the politics of American empire''. 2005, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven M.

==Career==
Pipes taught at [[Harvard University]] from 1958 until his retirement in 1996. He was the director of Harvard's Russian Research Center from 1968 to 1973 and later Baird Professor [[Emeritus]] of History at Harvard University. In 1962 he delivered a series of lectures on Russian intellectual history at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. He acted as senior consultant at the Stanford Research Institute from 1973 to 1978. During the 1970s, he was an advisor to [[Washington (state)|Washington]] Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]]. In 1981 and 1982 he served as a member of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], holding the post of Director of East European and Soviet Affairs under President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name="thenation2004"&gt;{{cite news

In the 1970s, Pipes was a leading critic of [[dÃ©tente]], which he described as "inspired by intellectual indolence and based on ignorance of one's antagonist and therefore inherently inept".&lt;ref name = "two"&gt;Bogle, Lori Lyn "Pipes, Richard" p. 922.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team B===
{{further|Team B}}

Pipes was head of the 1976 [[Team B]], composed of civilian experts and retired military officers and agreed to by then-CIA director [[George H. W. Bush]] at the urging of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) as a [[competitor analysis|competitive analysis]] exercise.&lt;ref name="thenation2004"/&gt;  Team B was created at the instigation of then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as an antagonist force to a group of CIA intelligence officials known as Team A. His hope was that it would produce a much more aggressive assessment of Soviet Union military capabilities. Unsurprisingly, it argued that the [[National Intelligence Estimate]] on the Soviet Union, generated yearly by the CIA, underestimated both Soviet military strategy and ambition&lt;ref&gt;Betts, Richard K. and Mahnken, Thomas G. ''Paradoxes of Strategic Intelligence: Essays in Honor of Michael I. Handel''. 2003, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and misinterpreted Soviet strategic intentions.

Team B faced criticism.  The international relations journalist [[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]] writes that Team B "turns out to have been wrong on nearly every point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan |first=Fred |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2103650/ |title=Can the CIA be saved? |publisher=Slate.com |date=7 September 2004|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes's group insisted that the Soviet Union, as of 1976, maintained "a large and expanding Gross National Product,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fareedzakaria.com/articles/newsweek/061603.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204090619/http://www.fareedzakaria.com/articles/newsweek/061603.html |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that the CIA belief that economic chaos hindered the USSR's defenses was a ruse on the part of the USSR. One CIA employee called Team B "a kangaroo court".&lt;ref name = "boston"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes called Team B's evidence "soft."&lt;ref name="thenation2004"/&gt; Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed several new weapons, featuring a nuclear-armed submarine fleet that used a system that did not depend on active sonar, and was thus undetectable by existing technology.&lt;ref name = "anat"&gt;{{cite journal | author= | title= Anatomy of a Neo-Conservative White House | journal= Canadian Dimension | date= 1 May 2005 | volume= 39 | issue= 03| page= 46| url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pipes, "Team B was appointed to look at the evidence and to see if we could conclude that the actual Soviet strategy is different from ours, i.e. the strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). It has now been demonstrated totally that it was".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/11/02/the_hard_liner/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=The hard-liner | first1=Sam | last1=Tanenhaus | date=11 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, Pipes maintained that Team B contributed to creating more realistic defense estimates.&lt;ref name = "comm"&gt;{{cite web

===Writings on Russian history===
Pipes wrote many books on [[History of Russia|Russian history]], including ''Russia under the Old Regime'' (1974), ''The Russian Revolution'' (1990), and ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'' (1994), and was a frequent interviewee in the press on the matters of [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet history]] and [[foreign relations of the Soviet Union|foreign affairs]]. His writings also appear in ''[[Commentary Magazine|Commentary]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and The ''Times Literary Supplement''. At Harvard, he taught large courses on Imperial Russia as well as the Russian Revolution and guided over 80 graduate students to their PhDs.

Pipes is known for arguing that the origins of the Soviet Union can be traced to the separate path taken by 15th-century [[Muscovy]], in a Russian version of the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' thesis. In Pipes' opinion, Muscovy differed from every State in Europe in that it had no concept of [[private property]], and that everything was regarded as the property of the [[Grand Duke]]/[[Tsar]]. In Pipes' view, this separate path undertaken by Russia (possibly under Mongol influence) ensured that Russia would be an [[autocracy|autocratic]] state with values fundamentally dissimilar from those of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Pipes argued that this "patrimonialism" of [[Imperial Russia]] started to break down when Russian leaders attempted to modernize in the 19th century, without seeking to change the basic "patrimonial" structure of Russian society. In Pipes's opinion, this separate course undertaken by Russia over the centuries made Russia uniquely open to revolution in 1917. Pipes strongly criticized the values of the radical ''intelligentsia'' of late Imperial Russia for what he sees as their fanaticism and inability to accept reality. The Russian writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] denounced Pipes' work as "the Polish version of Russian history". Pipes, in turn, accused Solzhenitsyn of being an [[anti-Semitic]] Russian ultra-nationalist, who sought to blame the ills of Communism on the Jews rather than to admit to the Russian roots of the Soviet Union. Writing of Solzhenitsyn's novel, ''August 1914'' in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on November 13, 1985, Pipes commented: "Every culture has its own brand of anti-Semitism. In Solzhenitsyn's case, it's not racial. It has nothing to do with blood. He's certainly not a racist; the question is fundamentally religious and cultural. He bears some resemblance to Dostoevsky, who was a fervent Christian and patriot and a rabid anti-Semite. Solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the Russian extreme right's view of the Revolution, which is that it was the doing of the Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, D.M. ''Alexander Solzhenitsyn'' St. Martin's Press, New York City, United States of America, 1998 {{ISBN|0-312-18036-5}} p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes explained Solzhenitsyn's view of Soviet communism: "[Solzhenitsyn] said it was because Marxism was a Western idea imported into Russia. Whereas my argument is that it has deep roots in Russian history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Cold Warrior At Peace |author=Nancy deWolf Smith |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903596904576516652848445180 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=20 August 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes stressed that the Soviet Union was an [[expansionism|expansionist]], [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[Sovereign state|state]] bent on world conquest. He is also notable for the thesis that, contrary to many traditional histories of the USSR at the time, the [[October Revolution]] was, rather than a popular general uprising, a coup foisted upon the majority of the Russian population by a tiny segment of the population driven by a select group of intellectuals who subsequently established a [[One-party state|one-party]] dictatorship which was intolerant and repressive from the start, rather than having deviated from an initially benign course. In Pipes's view, the Revolution was a total disaster, as  it allowed a small section of the fanatical ''intelligentsia'' to carry out policies that were completely unrealistic.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In what was meant to be an "off-the-record" interview, Pipes told Reuters in March 1981 that "Soviet leaders would have to choose between peacefully changing their Communist system in the direction followed by the West or going to war. There is no other alternative and it could go either way â DÃ©tente is dead." Pipes also stated in the interview that Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] of [[West Germany]] was susceptible to pressure from the Soviets. It was learned independently that Pipes was the official who spoke to Reuters. This potentially jeopardized Pipes' job. The White House and the "incensed" State Department issued statements repudiating Pipes' statements.&lt;ref name = "NYT1981"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Author Unknown| title= U.S. Repudiates a Hard-Line Aide| journal=New York Times | date= March 19, 1981| volume= | issue= | page= A8}}; {{cite journal | author=Shribman, David | title= Security Adviser Ousted for a Talk Hinting at War| journal=New York Times | date= October 21, 1981| volume= | issue= | page= A1 | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0812F7385D0C728EDDA90994D9484D81}}; {{cite journal | author= Author Unknown| title= The Rogue General | journal= Newsweek | date= November 2, 1981| volume= | issue= | pages= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Pipes served as an [[expert witness]] in the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]]'s trial of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE PAST ON TRIAL: RUSSIA, ONE YEAR LATER |author=Richard Pipes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/08/16/the-past-on-trial-russia-one-year-later/32752613-f345-40c2-9f0e-b0a584b031f9/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=16 August 1992 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Pipes' approach==
The writings of Richard Pipes have provoked criticism in the scholarly community, for example in ''[[The Russian Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Engerman, ''Know your enemy. The rise and fall of America's Soviet experts'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p.305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=2497460|title=U.S.-Soviet Relations in the Era of DÃ©tente|author1=Richard Pipes|author2=Walter C. Clemens, Jr.|work=Slavic Review|volume=42|date=1983|pages=117â18|publisher=Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond L. Garthoff, Foreign Affairs, May 1995, pg. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenin"&gt;{{cite web|jstor=131696|title=Richard Pipes's Lenin|publisher=Russian Review|volume=57|date=1998|pages=110â13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=2124477|title=The Russian Revolution|author1=Richard Pipes|author2=Diane P. Koenker|work=The Journal of Modern History|volume=65|date=1993|pages=432â35|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=2165391|title=The Russian Revolution|author1=Richard Pipes|author2=Ronald Grigor Suny|work=The American Historical Review
|volume=96|date=1991|pages=1581â83|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of Pipes's interpretation of the events of 1917 has come mostly from "revisionist" Soviet historians, who under the influence of the French [[Annales School|''Annales'' school]], have tended since the 1970s to center their interpretation of the Russian Revolution on social movements from below in preference to parties and their leaders and interpreted political movements as responding to pressures from below rather than directing them.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Revisionism in Soviet History'', ''History and Theory'', Vol. 46, Issue 4, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Among members of this school, [[Lynne Viola]] and [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] claim that Pipes focused too narrowly on intellectuals as causal agents. [[Peter Kenez]] (a one-time PhD student of Pipes') argued that Pipes approached Soviet History as a prosecutor, intent solely on proving the criminal intent of the "defendant", to the exclusion of anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=130919|title=The Prosecution of Soviet History, Volume 2|author=Peter Kenez|volume=54|date=1995|pages=265â69|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipes' critics argued that his historical writings perpetuated the Soviet Union as "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]" narrative in an attempt "to put the clock back a few decades to the times when Cold War demonology was the norm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutionaryhistory.co.uk/revs/richard-pipes-the-unknown-lenin.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520193532/http://www.revolutionaryhistory.co.uk/revs/richard-pipes-the-unknown-lenin.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 20, 2018 |accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Rabinowitch, "Richard Pipes' Lenin", ''The Russian Review'' 57, January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have written that Pipes wrote at length about what Pipes described as Lenin's "unspoken" assumptions and conclusions, while neglecting what Lenin actually said.&lt;ref&gt;''Lenin rediscovered: what is to be done? in context'', Volume 2005. Lars T. Lih, Vladimir IlÊ¹ich Lenin 2006. pp. 23â4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Rabinowitch]] writes that whenever a document can serve Pipes' long-standing crusade to demonize Lenin, Pipes commented on it at length; if the document allows Lenin to be seen in a less negative light, Pipes passed over it without comment.&lt;ref name="Lenin"/&gt;

Pipes, in his turn â following the demise of the USSR â charged the revisionists with skewing their research, by means of statistics, to support their preconceived ideological interpretation of events, which made the results of their research  "as unreadable as they were irrelevant for the understanding of the subject"&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, ''apud'' Ronald I. Kowalski, ''The Russian Revolution, 1917â1921''. London: Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-12438-7}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide intellectual cover for Soviet [[state terrorism|terror]] and acting as simpletons and/or Communist dupes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/Vol8Vixi.doc |author=Richard Pipes |title=Vixi: Memoirs of a Non-Belonger |date=2003 |publisher=Fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that their attempt at "history from below" only obfuscated the fact that "Soviet citizens were the helpless victims of a totalitarian regime driven primarily by a lust for power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/annals/Reviews/review_texts/Pipes_on_Siegelbaum_The_New_Republic_12.18.2000.html |title=Richard Pipes on Siegelbaum |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216100041/http://www.yale.edu/annals/Reviews/review_texts/Pipes_on_Siegelbaum_The_New_Republic_12.18.2000.html |archivedate=February 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Duane Ballard''' (born June 30, 1942) is a retired [[United States Navy]] officer and a professor of [[oceanography]] at the [[University of Rhode Island]] who is most noted for his work in [[underwater archaeology]]: [[maritime archaeology]] and [[archaeology of shipwrecks]]. He is most known for the discoveries of the wrecks of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1985, the [[German battleship Bismarck|battleship ''Bismarck'']] in 1989, and the aircraft carrier {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}} in 1998. He discovered the wreck of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]'' in 2002 and visited [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]], who saved its crew. He leads ocean exploration on [[EV Nautilus|E/V Nautilus]].&lt;ref name="About_Robert_Ballard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nautiluslive.org/people/robert-ballard |title=About Robert Ballard |author=Sea Research Foundation |date=2011 |publisher=nautiluslive.org |accessdate=27 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ballard grew up in [[Pacific Beach, San Diego, California]] to a mother of German heritage and a father of British heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D7143AF930A15755C0A96F948260|title=Crew of Bismarck may have sunk her|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2008-11-19 | date=June 23, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has attributed his early interest in [[underwater exploration]] to reading the novel ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with Dr. Robert Ballard |publisher=''Homeschool.com'' |url=http://www.homeschool.com/articles/ballard/ |accessdate=2005-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112153059/http://www.homeschool.com/articles/ballard/ |archivedate=2006-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; living by the ocean in San Diego, and his fascination with the groundbreaking expeditions of the [[bathyscaphe]] [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']].

Ballard began working for [[Andreas Rechnitzer]]'s Ocean Systems Group at [[North American Aviation]] in 1962 when his father, Chet, the chief engineer at North American Aviation's [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman missile]] program, helped him get a part-time job. At North American, he worked on North American's failed proposal to build the [[submersible]] [[DSV Alvin|''Alvin'']] for the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]].

In 1965, Ballard graduated from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], earning undergraduate degrees in chemistry and geology. While a student in [[Santa Barbara, California]], he joined [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and also completed the [[US Army]]'s [[ROTC]] program, giving him an Army officer's commission in Army Intelligence. His first graduate degree ([[Master of Science|MS]], 1966) was in geophysics from the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Geophysics where he trained porpoises and whales. Subsequently, he returned to [[Andreas Rechnitzer]]'s Ocean Systems Group at [[North American Aviation]].

Ballard was working towards a [[Ph.D.]] in [[marine geology]] at the [[University of Southern California]] in 1967 when he was called to active duty. Upon his request, he was transferred from the Army into the [[US Navy]] as an [[oceanographer]]. The Navy assigned him as a liaison between the [[Office of Naval Research]] and the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]].

After leaving active duty and entering into the Naval Reserve in 1970, Ballard continued working at Woods Hole persuading organizations and people, mostly scientists, to fund and use ''Alvin'' for undersea research. Four years later he received a Ph.D. in [[marine geology]] and [[geophysics]] at the [[University of Rhode Island]].

Ballard's first dive in a submersible was in the [[Ben Franklin (PX-15)|''Ben Franklin'' (PX-15)]] in 1969 off the coast of [[Florida]] during a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution expedition. In summer 1970, he began a field mapping project of the [[Gulf of Maine]] for his [[doctoral dissertation]]. It used an air gun that sent sound waves underwater to determine the underlying structure of the ocean floor and the submersible ''Alvin'', which was used to find and recover a sample from the [[bedrock]].

During the summer of 1975, Ballard participated in a joint French-American expedition called [[Phere]] searching for [[hydrothermal vents]] over the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], but the expedition did not find any active vents. A 1979 expedition was aided by deep-towed still camera sleds that were able to take pictures of the ocean floor, making it easier to find the vent locations.

When ''Alvin'' inspected one of the sites they located, the scientists observed black smoke billowing out of the vents, something not observed at the [[GalÃ¡pagos]] Rift. Ballard and geophysicist [[Jean Francheteau]] went down in ''Alvin'' the day after the [[black smoker]]s were first observed. They were able to take an accurate temperature reading of the active vent (the previous dive's thermometer had melted), and recorded 350&amp;nbsp;Â°C (662&amp;nbsp;Â°F). They continued searching for more vents along the [[East Pacific Rise]] between 1980 and 1982.

== Military career ==
Ballard joined the [[United States Army]] in 1965 through the Army's [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Reserve Officers Training program]]. He was designated as an intelligence officer and initially received a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]. When called to active duty in 1967, he asked to fulfill his obligation in the [[United States Navy]]. His request was approved, and he was transferred to the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]] on the reserve active duty list. After completing his active duty obligation in 1970, he was returned to reserve status, where he remained for much of his military career, being called up only for mandatory training and special assignments. He retired from the Navy as a [[Commander (United States)|commander]] in 1995 after reaching the statutory service limit.

== Marine archaeology ==
While Ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age, his work at [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute|Woods Hole]] and his [[scuba diving]] experiences off [[Massachusetts]] spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration. His work in the Navy had involved assisting in the development of small, unmanned submersibles that could be tethered to and controlled from a surface ship, and were outfitted with lighting, cameras, and manipulator arms. As early as 1973, he saw this as way of searching for the wreck of the ''Titanic''. In 1977, he led his first expedition, which was unsuccessful.

=== RMS ''Titanic'' ===
In summer 1985, Ballard was aboard the French research ship ''[[RV Le SuroÃ®t|Le SuroÃ®t]]'', which was using the [[side scan sonar]] ''SAR'' to search for the ''Titanic''{{'s}} wreck. When the French ship was recalled, he transferred onto a ship from [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute|Woods Hole]], the [[RV Knorr|R/V ''Knorr'']]. Unbeknownst to some, this trip was financed by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two Navy [[nuclear submarine|nuclear powered]] attack submarines, the [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']] and the [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS ''Thresher'']], which sank in the 1960s, and not for the ''Titanic''. Back in 1982, he approached the Navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft, the [[Argo (ROV)|''Argo'']], and his search for the ''Titanic''.&lt;ref name="Navy"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lewis |last=Smith |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Titanic search was cover for secret Cold War subs mission |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article3994955.ece |work=[[The Times]] |date=2008-05-24 |accessdate=2008-05-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy was not interested in financing it. However, they were interested in finding out what happened to their missing submarines and ultimately concluded that ''Argo'' was their best chance to do so.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt; The Navy agreed it would finance his ''Titanic'' search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines,&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt; and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time,&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt; and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt; He was placed on temporary active duty in the Navy, in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks. After the two missions were completed, time and funding permitting, he was free to use resources to hunt for the ''Titanic''.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

After their missions for the Navy, [[R/V Knorr|''Knorr'']] arrived on site on August 22, 1985,&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;[http://www.titanic-titanic.com/discovery_of_titanic.shtml Discovery Of Titanic]&lt;/ref&gt; and deployed [[Argo (submersible)|''Argo'']]. When they searched for the two submarines, Ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth.&lt;ref name="Cover up"&gt;[http://www.cdnn.info/news/industry/i080602a.html Ballard's Titanic search was cover-up of secret U.S. mission]&lt;/ref&gt; It littered thousands of pieces of debris all over the ocean floor.&lt;ref name="Cover up"/&gt; Following the large trail of debris led them directly to both&lt;ref name="Cover up"/&gt; and made it significantly easier for them to locate them than if they were to search for the hulls directly.&lt;ref name="Cover up"/&gt; He already knew that the ''Titanic'' imploded from pressure as well, much the same way the two submarines did, and concluded that it too must have also left a scattered debris trail.&lt;ref name="Cover up"/&gt; Using that lesson, they had ''Argo'' sweep back and forth across the ocean floor looking for the ''Titanic's'' debris trail.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt; They took shifts monitoring the video feed from ''Argo'' as it searched the ocean floor two miles below.

In the early morning hours of September 1, 1985, observers noted anomalies on the otherwise smooth ocean floor. At first, it was pockmarks, like small craters from impacts. Eventually, debris was sighted as the rest of the team was awakened. Finally, a boiler was sighted, and soon after that, the hull was found.

Ballard's team made a general search of the ''Titanic's'' exterior, noting its condition. Most significantly, they confirmed that it had split in two, and that the stern was in far worse shape than the bow. They did not have much time to explore, as others were waiting to take ''Knorr'' on other scientific pursuits, but his fame was now assured. He originally planned to keep the exact location a secret to prevent anyone from claiming prizes from it. He considered the site a cemetery, and refused to desecrate it by removing artifacts.

On July 12, 1986, Ballard and his team returned on board ''Atlantis II'' &lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt; to make the first detailed study of the wreck. This time, he brought ''Alvin''. It was accompanied by ''Jason Junior'', a small remotely operated vehicle that could fit through small openings to see into the ship's interior. Although the first dive (taking over two hours) encountered technical problems, subsequent ones were far more successful, and produced a detailed photographic record of the wreck's condition.

In 1988, Ballard published a book, ''Discovery Of The Titanic (Exploring The Greatest Of All Lost Ships)'', {{ISBN|0446513857}} and he later recounted the specifics of the expedition for National Geographic in a video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawn McCarty, Jef Feeley, Chris Dixon|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/titanic-nuclear-submarine-scorpion-thresher-ballard/|title=HOW DID THE 'UNSINKABLE' TITANIC END UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN?|publisher=National Geographic|date=2017-11-24 |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the relics retrieved by various groups, not including Ballard, from RMS Titanic were owned by [[Premier Exhibitions]] which filed for bankruptcy in 2016. In late August 2018, the groups vying for ownership of the 5,500 relics included one by museums in England and Northern Ireland with assistance from film maker [[James Cameron]] and some financial support from [[National Geographic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawn McCarty, Jef Feeley, Chris Dixon |title= James Cameron: Getting Titanic Artifacts to U.K. Would Be 'a Dream' |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/07/news-titanic-uk-belfast-bankruptcy-cameron/|publisher=National Geographic|date=2018-07-24 |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballard told the news media that he favored this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in [[Belfast]] and in [[Greenwich]]. A decision as to the outcome was to be made by a [[United States district court]] judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawn McCarty, Jef Feeley, Chris Dixon|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-31/bankrupt-titanic-exhibitor-sets-biggest-sale-ever-of-ship-relics|title=Bankrupt Titanic exhibitor sets biggest sale of ship relics|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2018-08-31 |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other wrecks ===

==== ''Bismarck'' ====
Ballard undertook an even more daunting task when he and his team searched off the coast of France for the German Battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]'' in 1989, using an ocean-crawling robot. The 15,000 foot deep water in which it sank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/13/science/undersea-robots-open-a-new-age-of-exploration.html |title=Undersea Robots Open a New Age of Exploration |last=Broad |first=William J |date=1990 |website=New York Times |access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is 4,000 feet deeper than that where the ''Titanic'' sank. He attempted to determine whether it had been sunk by the British or was scuttled by its own crew. Three weeks after the expedition however, personal tragedy struck him when his 21-year-old son, Todd, who had aided him in the search, was killed in a car accident.

Ballard later published a book about the quest, ''The Discovery of the Bismarck'' (1990). The discovery was also documented for [[National Geographic]] in a 1989 [[James Cameron]] video ''Search for the Battleship Bismarck'' which indicated that the ship had been damaged by torpedoes and shells from British ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.alibris.com/National-Geographic-Search-for-the-Battleship-Bismarck/movie/100034563 |title=National Geographic: Search for the Battleship Bismarck (1989) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1990 |website=Alibris |publisher=Alibris |access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual cause of the sinking, however, was sabotage of the underwater valves by the onboard crew, according to Ballard, who said, "we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact". Film maker Cameron, however, said that his crew's examination of the wreckage indicated that the Bismarck would have sunk eventually even if it had not been scuttled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World War 2 In Review No. 9: Warships |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HFQxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=Ballard+Bismarck+we+found+a+hull+that+appears+whole+and+relatively+undamaged+by+the+descent+and+impact&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj70eLx0JzdAhVk6IMKHQWaAgIQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ballard%20Bismarck%20we%20found%20a%20hull%20that%20appears%20whole%20and%20relatively%20undamaged%20by%20the%20descent%20and%20impact&amp;f=false |publisher=Merriam Press |isbn=9781387105434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Lusitania'' ====
In 1993, Ballard investigated the wreck of [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] off the Irish coast. It had been struck by a torpedo, whose explosion was followed by a second, much larger one. The wreck had been [[depth charge]]d by the [[Royal Navy]] several years after the sinking, and had also been damaged by other explorers, making a forensic analysis difficult. He found no evidence of boiler explosion and he speculated the ignition of coal dust inside the ship, caused a "massive, uncontrollable [second] explosion".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lostliners/lusitania.html |title=Text excerpted from Lost Liners, courtesy of Madison Press Books |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=PBS |publisher=PBS |access-date=September 2, 2018 |quote=previous visitors had already tampered with the evidence...we found nothing to suggest the ship was sabotaged.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have questioned this hypothesis, some suggesting that the ship had been sabotaged by the British. Ballard found no evidence to support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lostliners/lusitania.html |title=Text excerpted from Lost Liners, courtesy of Madison Press Books |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=PBS |publisher=PBS |access-date=September 2, 2018 |quote=previous visitors had already tampered with the evidence...we found nothing to suggest the ship was sabotaged.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts have indicated that it was, in fact, boiler explosions that caused the ship to sink so quickly, in a mere 18 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmidt |first=Donald E |date=May 31, 2005 |title=The Folly of War: American Foreign Policy, 1898-2005 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EXbQoSUOP4AC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Lusitania+cause+of+sinking+ballard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEsoWF1pzdAhVrzIMKHYdUBPYQ6AEIRzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Lusitania%20cause%20of%20sinking%20ballard&amp;f=false |publisher=Algora |page=74 |isbn=0875863825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballard published a book about the discovery, ''Exploring the Lusitania: Probing the Mysteries of the Sinking that Changed History'', also titled ''Robert Ballard's Lusitania'' in some markets, with co-author Spencer Dunmore (ISBN: ISBN-10: 0785822070).

==== Battle of Guadalcanal ====
In 1992, Ballard and his team have visited the sites of many wrecks of [[World War II]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], doing so, he discovered the wreck of the [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|IJN ''Kirishima'']].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navweaps.com/index_lundgren/Kirishima_Damage_Analysis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Lost Ships of [[Guadalcanal campaign|Guadalcanal]]'' locates and photographs many of the vessels sunk in the infamous [[Ironbottom Sound]], the strait between [[Guadalcanal Island]] and the [[Florida Islands|Floridas]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].

==== USS ''Yorktown'' ====
On 19 May 1998 Ballard found the wreck of ''[[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|Yorktown]]'', sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]]. Found 3 miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) beneath the surface, it was photographed.

==== ''PT-109'' ====
In 2002, the [[National Geographic Society]] and Ballard fielded a ship with remote vehicles to the [[Solomon Islands]]. They succeeded in finding a torpedo tube and the forward section from the shipwreck of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]'' which was rammed in 1943 by the Japanese destroyer ''Amagiri'' off [[Ghizo Island]].&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/07/0709_020710_kennedyPT109.html "JFK's PT-109 Found, U.S. Navy Confirms"].&lt;/ref&gt; The visit also brought to light the identity of islanders [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] who had received little recognition for finding the shipwrecked crew after searching for days in their [[dugout canoe]]. A TV special and a book were produced, and Ballard spoke at the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in 2005.

=== Institute for Exploration ===
In the 1990s Ballard founded the [[Mystic Aquarium &amp; Institute for Exploration|Institute for Exploration]], which specializes in deep-sea archaeology and deep-sea geology. It joined forces in 1999 with the Mystic Aquarium located in [[Mystic, Connecticut]]. They are a part of the non-profit Sea Research Foundation, Inc.

=== Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography ===
In 2003, Ballard started the [[Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography]], a research program at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography.&lt;ref name="URIInstitute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/news/ballard/institute.htm|title=Institute for Archaeological Oceanography|date=2004-06-01|publisher=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=17 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68XULgJyf?url=http://www.uri.edu/news/ballard/institute.htm|archivedate=19 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Sea ===
In 1976, [[Willard Bascom]] suggested that the deep, [[anoxic waters]] of the [[Black Sea]] might have preserved ships from antiquity because typical wood-devouring organisms could not survive there. At a depth of 150 m, it contains insufficient oxygen to support most familiar biological life forms.

Originally a land-locked fresh water lake, the Black Sea was flooded with salt water from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the [[Holocene]]. The influx of salt water essentially smothered the fresh water below it because a lack of internal motion and mixing meant that no fresh oxygen reached the deep waters,&lt;ref&gt;OÄuz, T., Latun, V.S., Latif, M.A., Vladimirov, V. L., Sur, H. I., Markov, A. A., Ozsoy, E. Kotovschichkov, B. B., Eremeev, V.N., and Unluata, U., 1993, Circulation in the surface and intermediate layers, ''Deep-Sea Research'' 1.40: 1597&amp;ndash;612.&lt;/ref&gt; creating a [[meromictic]] body of water. The anoxic environment, which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the oxygenated waters, provides an excellent testing site for deep water archaeological survey.

In a series of expeditions, a team of marine archaeologists led by Ballard identified what appeared to be ancient shorelines, freshwater snail shells, and drowned river valleys in roughly 300 feet (100 m) of water off the Black Sea coast of modern [[Turkey]]. [[Radiocarbon]] dating of freshwater mollusk remains indicated an age of about 7,000 years.

The team discovered three ancient wrecks to the west of the town of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]] at depths of 100 m. Wreck A and Wreck C probably date to the late Roman period (2ndâ4th century A.D.), while Wreck B probably dates to the Byzantine period (5th to 7th century A.D.).

To the east of Sinop, the team discovered a remarkably well-preserved wreck at a 320 m depth, in the Black Sea's deep anoxic waters. The vessel's entire hull and cargo are intact, buried in sediments. Its deck structures are also intact, including a mast rising some 11 m into the water column. Radiocarbon dating of wood from the wreck provides a date of 410â520 A.D. It has been named "Sinop D" by the Ballard team.

In 2000, the team conducted an expedition that focused on the exploration of the sea bed about 15â30&amp;nbsp;km west of Sinop, and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula. Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, they examined the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200 m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the [[Crimea]] indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains.

Although Sinop served as a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route predicted by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the Crimean peninsula. On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called [[amphorae]], were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor. The jars may have carried a variety of archetypal Black Sea products such as olive oil, honey, wine or fish sauce but the contents are presently unknown because no artifacts were recovered from any of these wreck sites in 2000.

The wreck found provided the team with vast information about both the technological changes and trade that occurred in the Black Sea during a period of political, social and economic transition through their study of the shipâs construction techniques. Studies show that in Sinop during the Byzantine era, they had developed long-distance trading as early as 4500 BC. Sea-trading on the Black Sea was most intense during the period of late antiquity, between the 2nd and 7th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., 2001, Black Sea coastal cultures: trade and interaction, ''Expedition'' 43: 11â20&lt;/ref&gt; The examination of the four shipwrecks found by Ballard and his team provide the direct evidence for Black Sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land.

The video images of Shipwreck A that were taken show a wall of shipping jars standing about 2 m above the seabed. The amphorae highest on the mound had fallen over without displacing those still standing in the rows beneath them, and it is likely that the ship settled upright on the sea-bed, gradually being both buried in and filled with sediment as exposed wood was devoured by the larva or the [[shipworm]].

Shipwreck B also consisted of a large pile of amphorae but several types are visible, as are multiple timbers protruding from within the mound and on it. In addition to the Sinop-styles jars, several amphorae similar to examples excavated on the [[Yassiada]] Byzantine shipwreck and dating from the 5th to late 6th century AD are present.&lt;ref&gt;van Doorninck, F. H. Jr., 2002, Byzantine shipwrecks, in A. Laiou (ed.), ''The Economic History of Byzantium from the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century'' I, 899â905. Dumbarton Oaks Studies 30, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two discrete and mostly buried piles of carrot-shaped shipping jars comprise shipwreck C. The teamâs visit to the site was short and was intended primarily to test survey methodology for deep-water procedures.

Shipwreck D provided the team with an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction during a time of transition. When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the seabed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200 m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no [[mortise and tenon]] fastenings, and no sewing. Shipwreck D may be one of the earliest [[lateen]]-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel.

The Institute for Exploration Black Sea expeditions relied on remote sensing with side-scan sonar in shallow and deep water to identify potential archaeological sites examined by [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]s. The hypothesis that the anoxic waters of the Black Sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation is borne out by the discovery of Sinop D, the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, Robert D., and Ward, Cheryl, 2004, Deep-water Archaeological Survey in the Black Sea; 2000 Season, ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', 33.1: 2â13, ([http://www.coastal.edu/archaeology/cward/Ward%20publication%20files/Ward%20and%20Ballard%202004%20IJNA.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522033235/http://www.coastal.edu/archaeology/cward/Ward%20publication%20files/Ward%20and%20Ballard%202004%20IJNA.pdf |date=2013-05-22 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine (May 4, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;13), the researchers found an underwater delta south of the [[Bosporus]]. There was evidence for a strong flow of fresh water out of the Black Sea in the [[8th millennium BC]]. Ballard's research has contributed to the debate over the [[Black Sea deluge theory]].

== Other works ==

=== Academics ===
In 2004, Ballard was appointed professor of [[oceanography]], and currently serves as Director of the Institute for Archaeological Oceanography, at the [[University of Rhode Island]]'s Graduate School of Oceanography. He was the first speaker to give the [[Marie Poland Fish|Charles and Marie Fish Lecture in Oceanography]] at the University of Rhode Island in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Charles and Marie Fish Lecture in Oceanography|url=https://web.uri.edu/gso/the-charles-and-marie-fish-lecture-in-oceanography/|website=The Charles and Marie Fish Lecture in Oceanography|publisher=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===
Ballard served as the technical consultant on the science fiction series ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'' during its first season from September 1993 until May 1994. During the closing credits, he would speak about the scientific elements that were present in any given episode and place them in a contemporary context. Although he exited the series in the second season, he was referenced in the third season, with the "Ballard Institute" being named after him.

=== Education ===
In 1989, Ballard founded the [[JASON Project]], a [[distance education]] program designed to excite and engage middle school students in science and technology. He began the JASON Project in response to the thousands of letters he received from students following his discovery of the wreck of the ''Titanic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The JASON Project - History |work=jason.org |url=http://www.jason.org/Public/AboutUS/History.aspx?pos=6 |accessdate=August 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917041819/http://www.jason.org/Public/AboutUS/History.aspx?pos=6 |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''San Miguel Ixtapan''' is an archaeological site located in the municipality of [[Tejupilco]] ([[Nahuatl]] "Texopilco" or "Texopilli"), in the State of Mexico.

Tejupilco is about 100 kilometers&lt;ref name= "  MCG" &gt;{{cite journal |last= ClÃ©ment |first= Marianne C.   |date= Dec 26, 2010 |title=Site visit |trans-title=|journal=Notes &amp; Photographs |location= San Miguel Ixtapan |language= |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; west from the city of Toluca, Mexico State, on federal highway 134. The site is some 15 kilometers south of the municipal head, on state highway 8 that leads to Amatepec.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= RodrÃ­guez Garcia |first= Norma L.  |date=  |title= Pagina web INAH, San Miguel Ixtapan |trans-title=San Miguel Ixtapan INAH Web Page  |journal=INAH |location=Mexico|url= http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00917.html|language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This site is one of the few explored in the southwest region of the State of Mexico, that has provided some archaeological information on an area that virtually was not explored.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Its apogee was in the aftermath of the Teotihuacan decline. Located in an area which probably served as a liaison between the Central Highlands and regions of MichoacÃ¡n and Guerrero, San Miguel Ixtapan had its greatest growth between 750 and 900 CE. Then the site reaches a substantial expansion and built most of the structures of the ceremonial area now visible, they represent only a portion of what was the site in its splendor. San Miguel Ixtapan was located in a privileged place with deposits of basalt prisms used for construction, fertile land and one of the larger flow springs in the State.&lt;ref name=Arqueomex&gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=  San Miguel Ixtapan|url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S9N5n7Esp35.html|publisher=Arqueologia Mexicana|location=Mexico|language= Spanish |trans-title=|year= |accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The earliest evidence of human habitation in the state is a [[quartz]] scraper and [[obsidian]] blade found in the [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya area]], which was an island in the former [[Lake Chalco]]. They are dated to the [[Pleistocene]] era which dates human habitation back to 20,000 years. These first peoples were hunter-gatherers. Stone Age implements have been found all over the territory from mammoth bones, to stone tools to human remains. Most have been found in the areas of [[Los Reyes Acozac]], [[Tizayuca]], [[Tepexpan]], [[San Francisco Mazapa]], [[El Risco]] and [[Tequixquiac]]. Between 20,000 and 5000 BCE, the people here eventually went from hunting and gathering to sedimentary villages with farming and domesticated animals. The main crop was corn, and stone tools for the grinding of this grain become common. Later crops include beans, chili peppers and squash grown near established villages. Evidence of ceramics appears around 2500 BCE with the earliest artifacts of these appearing in Tlapacoya, [[Atoto]], [[Malinalco]], [[Acatzingo]] and [[Tlatilco]].&lt;ref name="enchistoria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/ |title=Historia |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=History |accessdate=July 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608031957/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/ |archivedate=June 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest major city of the state is [[Teotihuacan]], built between 100 BCE and 100 CE.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

Between 800 and 900 CE, the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzincas]] established their dominion with [[Teotenango]] as capital.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

[[Image:Axayacatl.jpg|thumb|170px| Axayacatl [[Hueyi Tlatoani|Tlatoani of Tenochtitlan]] as depicted in the [[Codex Azcatitlan]]]]
During [[Axayacatl]]&lt;ref&gt;'''Axayacatl''' means "Water-mask" or "Water-face") was a ruler (''[[tlatoani]]'') of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Aztec|Aztec Empire]] and city of [[TenochtitlÃ¡n]], who reigned from 1469 to 1481. He was preceded on the throne by [[Moctezuma I]] and followed by his brother [[Tizoc|TÃ­zoc]] in 1481.&lt;/ref&gt; reign (1469â1481) the Aztecs and [[PurÃ©pecha people|PurÃ©pecha]] conquered much of the Matlazincas settlements, imposing names such as: Metepec, Capulhuac Quauhpanoayan, Xochiaca Tzinacantepec, Zoquitzinco, Toluca, Xiquipilco, Tenantzinco, Teotenango and Calixtlahuaca.&lt;ref name="enchistoria"/&gt;

Other dominions during the prehispanic period include that of the [[Chichimeca]]s in [[Tenayuca]] and of the [[Acolhua]]s in [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Huexotla]], [[Texcotizingo]] and Los Melones. Other important groups were the [[Mazahua people|Mazahuas]] in the [[Atlacomulco]]  area. Their center was at MazahuacÃ¡n, next to [[JocotitlÃ¡n]] mountain. The [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s were centered in [[Jilotepec de Abasolo|Jilotepec]].

===Toponymy===
The name of the place is composed from the words "Iztatl" (salt) and "pan" (place): "place where is salt",&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt; this makes reference to the importance that salt exploitation had from prehispanic times, it was fundamentally due to the saltpeter ([[Potassium nitrate]]) water wells that existed near the town.&lt;ref name=Visit&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=San Miguel Ixtapan|trans-title=|journal=visiting Mexico|location=|url=http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/turismo-en-mexico/arqueologico/tur-arqueologico-estado-mexico.php|language=Spanish|format=|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821184438/http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/turismo-en-mexico/arqueologico/tur-arqueologico-estado-mexico.php|archivedate=2010-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Still mined, although in smaller scale)

In relation to Tejupilco, there is no certainty of the true meaning of the word Tejupilco until today, it is known that a large volcanic rock which has a human footprint in the Huarache Hill east of San SimÃ³n, gave name to the place.&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis  /&gt;

Texopilco, as it was known to the arrival of the Spaniards and several decades afterwards, has had several versions of its meaning: Texo (foot print), pilli (small), place of small footprint, Te (not own), xopilli (toes).&lt;ref&gt;Olaguibel. OnomatologÃ­a del Estado de MÃ©xico. En: De la Fuente JosÃ© MarÃ­a. Hidalgo Ãntimo. MÃ©xico. 1979. PÃ¡g. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Place of strange footprints, or Tetl (stone), xo  (foot), pilli (son or prince)   Place of important people footprints.&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis  /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LeÃ³n LÃ³pez Gabriel. Nido de Ãguilas. PÃ¡g. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations have changed through the centuries, according to knowledge, feelings, views and opinions of the authors.&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis  /&gt;

===Investigations===
Initial explorations of this site occurred in 1985, it focused on the model found. The site was discovered by farmers plowing the land, when rocks and other vestiges were detected.&lt;ref name= MCG  /&gt;

It is difficult to determine the site constructors, although filiation from ethno historical sources indicates they were closely related to the [[Otomi people|Otomi]] culture.&lt;ref name=EDOMEX   &gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  San Miguel Ixtapan (Tejupilco)|url=  http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/imc/sanmiguelixtapan.html |publisher=State of Mexico Government   |location= Mexico|language= Spanish|trans-title=|year= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first report of the site was given in 1958, upon discovering the so-called "model",&lt;ref&gt;A similar model carved in stone was seen in the [[Tiwanaku]] site, in Bolivia, closely resembling the actual structures at the site.&lt;/ref&gt; a basaltic stone where the city was carved in miniature. The stone is now under roof, under a shelter next to the Museum. It was initially thought that it was a representation of the archaeological site; however, subsequent excavations demonstrated that it is not the case and so far not found a site that matches its design; now it is considered an ideal representation of a city or a sculpted ceremonial center sculpted, taking advantage of the rock morphology.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= El museo de San Miguel Ixtapan (Estado de MÃ©xico)|trans-title=|journal=Mexico desconocido  |location=  |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-museo-de-san-miguel-ixtapan-estado-de-mexico.html|language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupations===
As a result of site field investigations, at least four occupation stages were detected.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= EDOMEX    /&gt;

* First Occupation. Corresponds to the last years of the Classical period (500 to 750 CE), it includes remains of a housing residential structure where Teotihuacan III and IV type figurines were discovered.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= EDOMEX   /&gt;
* Second occupation. Is chronologically placed during the epiclassical period (750 to 900 CE), considered the apogee of the site, when the main structures of the place are constructed.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= EDOMEX  /&gt;
* Third occupation. It is placed during the early postclassical (900 to 1200 CE), the main monuments are reused, with several architectonic modifications, additions and extensions.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= EDOMEX  /&gt;
* Fourth Occupation. After 1200 CE, the site is abandoned for some time, until the time when the site is partially reoccupied by a cultural group part of the Mexica or Aztec culture; they built simple houses over the remains of older structures and remained on the site until the time Spanish invasion. One of the possible reasons why the Aztecs arrived to the area is that it is located on a strategic location, for trade control of goods from Tierra Caliente towards the central Highlands and vice versa. In addition to the saltpeter wells, previously mentioned, a product highly appreciated in prehispanic times.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name= EDOMEX  /&gt;

===Tejupilco chronology===
Documented periods of regional occupation.

====12000 BCE====
The oldest evidence of human occupation of these lands dates back to more than 12 thousand years, approximate date when Tejupilco cave paintings were. Early hunter-gatherers who arrived in the region at the end of the third glaciation evolved to become sedentary groups of farmers, complex societies and cultures which formed part of other civilizations.&lt;ref name= Tejugob  &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=  Historia CronolÃ³gica del Municipio de Tejupilco|url=http://www.tejupilco.gob.mx/contenido/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=65&amp;Itemid=77|publisher=Tejupilco Municipal Government |location=  |language= Spanish |trans-title=Tejupilco municipality chronologic history  |year= |accessdate= Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plentiful natural resources, consequence of the rugged geography formed from millions of years ago, attracted to the Tejupilco region early settlers at least 10 thousand years ago, date in which hunter-gatherer groups created the cave paintings at the "Cueva de los Monitos"; located north of "Bejucos" at the foot of the Nanchititla Sierra. The hunter-gatherer groups have evolved to sedentary tribes through peaceful or violent exchanges with other cultures, to the domain of agriculture and domestication of animals, basic astronomical, medical and scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis     &gt;{{cite web |first=   Rodolfo (Municipal Chronicler) |last=  SinaÃ­ GÃ³mez |title=  Antecedentes HistÃ³ricos|url=http://www.tejupilco.gob.mx/contenido/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=59 |publisher= Tejupilco Municipal Government   |location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Tejupilco Historical Background  |year= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These settlements scattered throughout the region evolved, some to become complex cultures with language and religion, stratified societies and priestly classes. Others collapsed and were forgotten until the recent discovery of its ruins and study of remains that repositioned them as key parts for the study and understanding of regional history.&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis  /&gt;

====2000 BCE====
The most remote archaeological discovery is located in the archaeological area of San Miguel Ixtapan, atop of a pyramid basement, still unexplored; a mask and jade necklace were found alongside organic remains. These artifacts belong to an unknown culture that flourished in San Miguel Ixtapan, but over two thousand years before the site recorded history.&lt;ref name= Tejugob      /&gt;

Sites such as "RÃ­o Grande"&lt;ref&gt;Ruins discovered in April 2004 while searching for the ruins of the old hacienda de RÃ­o Grande.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Pararrayos de San Miguel", evidenced the collapse of the settlement from hundreds or thousands of years before the conquest of Mexico. In San Miguel Ixtapan a human body was discovered, while digging to install a lightning rod, along with prepared foods, on top of a pyramid-like basement. The body provided a chronological placement to 2000 years BCE, which means that a culture existed about 4 thousand years ago, which probably collapsed due to an invasion, next to the body finding, a necklace and green stone mask were found, these are exhibited in the San Miguel Ixtapan site Museum. In the same site are located the San Miguel Ixtapan ruins, a much later culture.&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis  /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osorio, VÃ­ctor. Antrophology Museum Director&lt;/ref&gt;

====450 CE====
San Miguel Ixtapan, only archaeological site moderately excavated and studied, of the more than 180 sites existing in the region. The San Miguel Ixtapan culture flourished from 450 to 1522 CE, possibly the Chontal culture from the Balsas with close cultural and commercial ties with Teotihuacan, Tula, and the Central Highlands as well as other points of Tierra Caliente.&lt;ref name= Tejugob     /&gt;

The complex cultural overlay present in Mesoamerica throughout centuries, also existed in Tejupilco, where eventually a Chontal Kingdom was formed (Chontal meaning foreigner or not Aztec) probably Matlazinca with Tejupilco as capital and composed, according to Gaspar de Covarrubias by 18 groups&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis  /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De la Fuente, JosÃ© Maria. Hidalgo Ãntimo. Facsimile edition, original published 1910. MÃ©xico 1979. Pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1475 CE====
The Aztecs conquered the Tejupilco kingdom.&lt;ref name="  Tejugob"    /&gt;

Tejupilco was conquered by the Mexicas or Aztecs around 1475-1476, during the reign of Axayacatl, consequently, at the time of the conquest the Matlazinca and Nahuatl or Mexican was spoken in the region&lt;ref name= Tejugobhis  /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Chichimeca. PÃ¡g.257. En IbÃ­d..PÃ¡g. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Otomi Culture===
[[File:4 Tlapacoya figurines.jpg|thumb|300px|It is very possible that the Otomi ancestors have occupied central Mexico for at least five thousand years, so they would have participated in the development of early Mesoamerican cities. In the image, ceramic figurines related to a fertility cult. From Tlapacoya (Mexico State). Mesoamerican preclassical culture, central Mexico.]]

The '''Otomi people''' {{IPAc-en|Ë|oÊ|t|É|Ë|m|iË}}&lt;ref&gt;in Spanish spelling ''OtomÃ­'' {{IPA-es|otoËmi|lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|native ethnic group]] inhabiting the central altiplano of [[Mexico]]. The two most populous groups are the Highland or Sierra OtomÃ­ living in the mountains of [[La Huasteca]] and the Mezquital OtomÃ­, living in the [[Mezquital Valley]] in the eastern part of the state of Hidalgo, and in the Sierra of QuerÃ©taro state. The OtomÃ­ usually self-identify as ''Ãuhu'' or ''Ãuhmu'' depending on the dialect they speak, whereas Mezquital Otomi identify themselves as '''HÃ±Ã¤hÃ±u'''   (pronounced {{IPA-oax|Ê°É²ÉÌÊ°É²Å©|}}).&lt;ref&gt;See Wright Carr (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller Otomi populations exist in the states of [[Puebla]], [[Mexico (state)|Mexico]], [[Tlaxcala]], [[MichoacÃ¡n]] and [[Guanajuato]].&lt;ref&gt;Lastra (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Otomi language]] belonging to the Oto-Pamean branch of the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean language family]] is spoken in many different varieties some of which are not mutually intelligible.
One of the early complex cultures of Mesoamerica, the Otomi were likely the original inhabitants of the central Mexican highlands before the arrival of [[Nahuatl]] speakers around ca. 1000 AD, but were gradually replaced and marginalized by [[Nahua people]]s. In the colonial period Otomi speakers helped the Spanish conquistadors as mercenaries and allies, which allowed them to extend into territories that had previously been inhabited by semi-nomadic [[Chichimec]]s, for example QuerÃ©taro and Guanajuato.

Hence the names used by the otomÃ­es to refer to themselves are numerous: ''Ã±Ã¤tho'' (Toluca Valley), ''hÃ±Ã¤hÃ±u'' (Mezquital Valley), ''Ã±Ã¤Ã±ho'' (Santiago de MezquititlÃ¡n, south of QuerÃ©taro) and ''Ã±'yÃ¼hÃ¼'' (Northern Puebla Sierra), [[PahuatlÃ¡n]]) are some of the names used by the Otomi to call themselves in their own languages, although it is common when talking in Spanish they use the Nahuatl ethnonym "Otomi".&lt;ref&gt;Lately some speakers of Mezquital Valley have begun to consider the word "Otomi" as derogatory. This does not occur in other variants and therefore it is used. It is also a term used widespread in the Spanish speaking world in all areas. In this regard, echoing David C. Wright (2005: 19) words: "while the word 'Otomi' has been used in texts that belittle these ancient inhabitants of central Mexico, it is considered convenient to use the same word in the works in an attempt to regain their history; instead of discarding it, I propose it should be vindicated".&lt;/ref&gt;

====''OtomÃ­'' Demonym origins====
As with most [[ethnonym]]s&lt;ref&gt;An '''ethnonym''' (from the {{lang-el|á¼Î¸Î½Î¿Ï}}, ''Ã©thnos'', "nation" and {{lang|grc|á½Î½Î¿Î¼Î±}}, ''Ã³noma'', "name") is the [[name]] applied to a given [[ethnic group]]. Ethnonyms can be divided into two categories: [[exonym]]s  (where the name of the ethnic group has been created by another group of people) and [[endonym|autonym]]s or endonyms (self-designation; where the name is created and used by the ethnic group itself).&lt;/ref&gt; used to refer to native peoples of Mexico, the "Otomi" term is not native of the referenced village. "Otomi" is a term that derives from the [[Nahuatl]] source "otÃ³mitl",&lt;ref&gt;Gomez de Silva 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; a word in the language of the ancient Aztecs meaning "who walks with arrows",&lt;ref&gt;Barrientos LÃ³pez, 2004: 6&lt;/ref&gt; although authors such as [[Wigberto JimÃ©nez Moreno]] have translated it as "bird hunter with arrows" (flechador de pÃ¡jaros).&lt;ref&gt;JimÃ©nez Moreno, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Also it is plausible that the demonym is derived from the name Oton, a leader of this people in prehispanic times. According to the members of the Otomi people the term, "Otomi" is pejorative, associated with an image derived from colonial and Nahua sources where the Otomi are presented as indolent and lazy. Therefore, for some years now, there has been a resurgence of native names usage, especially in the Mezquital Valley, QuerÃ©taro and northwest of the State of Mexico; territories with a high percentage of Otomi ethnic population. On the other hand, in eastern MichoacÃ¡n, recovery of the native demonym has not had the same effort.&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIESAS, s/f ''a''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Otomi Language===
'''Otomi''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|oÊ|t|É|Ë|m|iË}}; {{Lang-es|OtomÃ­}} {{IPA-es|otoËmi}}) is an [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean language]] and one of the [[indigenous languages of Mexico]], spoken by approximately 240,000 indigenous [[Otomi people]] in the [[Mexican Plateau|central ''altiplano'']] region of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="INEGI 2009"&gt;INEGI, "Perfil sociodemogrÃ¡fico", p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The language is spoken in many different dialects, some of which are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], therefore it is in effect a [[dialect continuum]]. The word HÃ±Ã¤hÃ±u {{IPA|[hÉ²ÉÌhÉ²Å©&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]}} has been proposed as an [[endonym]], but since it represents the usage of a single dialect it has not gained wide currency. Linguists have classified the modern dialects into three dialect areas: the Northwestern dialects spoken in [[QuerÃ©taro]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Guanajuato]]; the Southwestern dialects spoken in the [[Mexico (state)|State of Mexico]]; and the Eastern dialects spoken in the highlands of [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], and eastern Hidalgo and in villages in [[Tlaxcala]] and Mexico states.

Like all other Oto-Manguean languages, Otomi is a [[tonal language]] and most varieties distinguish three tones. Nouns are marked only for possessor (either by prefixes or by proclitics); plural number is marked by the definite article and by a verb suffix, and some dialects maintain the historically existing dual number marking.

==The site==
[[File:Site Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Site arrangement map. 1 Ballgame court, 2 Basement, 3 [[File:SMI Maqueta 4.JPG|thumb|left|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Model Detail]]
basement, 4 stairway, 5 sunken patio, 6-7 &amp; 8 various structures&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;]]
In spite of the finding of the "model" rock in 1958, formal archaeological excavations only started in 1985, and Museum construction started in 1993.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

In addition to archaeological monuments, San Miguel has a Site Museum that holds and displays many pieces found on site that have been recovered during controlled excavations. This material offers to information about the culture, materials, and way of life of the ancient settlers of the region.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

Some of the figurines found in San Miguel Ixtapan indicate an occupation dating back to the formative period, between 800 and 200 BCE, they are very similar to the elaborate Tlapacoya and Tlatilco ceramic; some of them very peculiar represent pregnant women. Others clay figures are similar to those discovered in Teotihuacan phases III and IV (500 and 750 CE) and confirm a continued occupation during the classical period. Much of these objects were found in the deeper layers of the ballgame court.  However, the stage of further expansion of San Miguel Ixtapan is during the mesoamerican epiclassical period (750-900 CE). Then is when the principal monuments in the site are built matching the splendor of [[Xochicalco]], Morelos; [[Teotenango]], South of the Valley of Toluca and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], Puebla, cities that flourished after the decline of [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

The main pieces that are exhibited in the Museum belong to the epiclassical mesoamerican period, as the anthropomorphic sculptures with crossed arms, ceramic masks with a kind of eye masking, the ballgame court (tlachmalacÃ¡tl) stone ring and stone disks carved with the image of a dual serpent in the center. This period corresponds to the sculpture area, where there are two anthropomorphic [[Stelae]] carved in green stone and embedded in the ground.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

During this time the influence of the culture of the Balsas is stronger than ever, it can be appreciated by the large ceramics amount depicting style similarity. Some vessels are identical to those found at the Caracol dam, near Arcelia, Guerrero. The strong cultural exchange that existed between the cultures of MichoacÃ¡n and Guerrero is notorious, and in the south of the State Mexico, but also the matlatzincas influence is noted.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

In the late postclassical period the region was occupied by Aztecs, who imposed tribute or formed army alliances against the PurÃ©pecha. Constructive activity is very poor, however this period correspond to some of the burials with lavish offerings. Shell beads, necklaces, cooper needles, earrings, obsidian "bezotes", spear points, darts and numerous vases accompanied the dead on their journey to the underworld. Many of these objects have been perfectly preserved and can be seen in various Museum showcases.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

In the center of town, is the Church of San Miguel Ixtapan, its constructors used carved stone blocks from the archaeological constructions, and in the atrium of the church is another block.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

==Structures==
[[File:SMI Maqueta 6.JPG|thumb|left|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Model Detail]]
Upon entering the site, to the right side are two huge earth mounds that contain prehispanic ruins,&lt;ref name=Recupe   &gt;{{cite journal |last=Marin Ruiz|first=Guillermo   |date=Dec 30, 2009 |title= Recuperan zona arqueolÃ³gica de San Miguel Ixtapan |trans-title=Archaeological area of San Miguel Ixtapan is recuperated|journal=Toltecayotl  |location=  Tejupilco |url= http://www.toltecayotl.org/tolteca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=882:recuperan-zona-arqueologica-de-san-miguel-ixtapan&amp;catid=15:notas-de-prensa&amp;Itemid=159 |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and to the left is the ballgame court.&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

===Prehispanic Scale Model===
The Model [Maqueta, {{es icon}}], according to archaeologists, belongs to the early postclassical (900 to 1200 CE), San Miguel Ixtapan continued to be occupied and its buildings were constantly modified.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

Is a three by four meter basaltic rock outgrowth, in which the ancient inhabitants of the place carved with great skills a series of architectonic elements such as: ballgame courts, platforms or foundations, stairways with sides, roofed temples, etc., depicting an exceptional scale ceremonial center. As a result of investigations of this site and neighboring areas, it has been possible to determine that this architectonic complex does not seem to make reference to any of the known sites to date. Hence, more than a "scale model", it seems a [[Votive offering]] element in which some type of rites and ceremonies were carried out.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;
[[File:Ballgame court south side.JPG|thumb|right|300px|San Miguel Ixtapan, ballgame court, south side]]

Researchers have called "The model", a rocky outcrop that depicts the architectural design of a city, but the question is: what city?&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

May well be a city that is still lost; It can also be the drawing of a city yet to be built.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

Specialists are not inclined one way or another: it is the architectural model of a City, perhaps conceived at the time, it even contains several spaces (up to five&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;) in the form of ballgame courts.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

===Ballgame Court===
[[File:SMI Basement 2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Basement 2]]

The ballgame court has an outline oriented on an east-west direction; it is capital letter "I" shaped or double "T", the court area measures 50 meters long by 7.50 wide. Headers at both end measure 15 by 7.8 meters. A particularity of this ballgame court consists of the fact that the land was excavated for its construction below grade, reason why access stairways were built to enter the court. Towards the south side, a platform was added (Platform1), where many human burials were found containing rich offerings, from its characteristics this is placed within the postclassical period.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Basement 2===
[[File:SMI Basement 2 stairway.JPG|thumb|left|200px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Basement 2 recessed stairway]]
It is said to have been barely explored, due to the tree on top (see Basement 2 picture).&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

On its eastern side, have remains of red stucco. On its western side has a recessed stairway.&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

===Basement 3===
[[File:SMI Basement 3, top side.JPG|thumb|left|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Basement 3 structure on top]]
[[File:SMI Basement 3, stone nails.JPG|thumb|right|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, basement 3, stone nails]]
It is the most important structure on the site.&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

The structure is composed of three superimposed bodies, with a series of rooms in its superior part, which was accessed by a stairway with intermediate inclined walls (alfardas). The second level of this monument, a complex of overlaid residential-ceremonial enclosures is located distributed on different levels, certainly as a consequence of the need to make modifications to spaces and accesses.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Above the structure is a room, with stucco remains in floor and walls, which probably served for the king to rest.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

On the north-west corner is a small niche holding a Tlaloc sculpture, God of water, very important in this area for corn planting, other products and salt collection were the main income sources of the area.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

===Stairway 4===
[[File:SMI Stairway 4.JPG|thumb|right|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Stairway]]
On the north side of Basement 3, is a stairway leading down from the Tlaloc niche at site level, it is made from large basalt blocks, below is an external patio, surrounded by a wall. There are remains of a drainage system.&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

===Sunken Patio 5===
[[File:SMI South sunken patio 5.JPG|thumb|left|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Sunken Patio]]
[[File:SMI Sunken patio, stairway 7.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Patio hundido]]

On the south side of Basement 3 is the "Patio Hundido" (sunken patio), used hundreds of years ago to make offerings and rituals: strategically located so that attendees could focus on it, inside is a sacrificial stone.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

It has two access stairways, one with sides finished, leading directly to the "Sculptures Enclosure".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

===Structures 6, 7 &amp; 8===
[[File:SMI Structures 6, 7 &amp; 8.JPG|thumb|right|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Structures 6, 7 &amp; 8]]
These structures are not accessible to visitors, the sunken patio and the structures are chained off.&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

These are located south of basement 3 and west of the sunken patio, at the North West corner.&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

The enclosures are said to contain the "Recinto de la Banqueta" and the "Recinto de las esculturas", with accesses facing east and west respectively.&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt;

[[File:SMI Huiztocihuatl &amp; Tlaloc.JPG|thumb|right|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, Artistic rendition of the Huiztocihuatl &amp; Tlaloc sculptures]]

* Recinto de la Esculturas. Is located inside the first structure, a large amount of offerings and figurines was recovered, in addition to two sculptures made with green stone, embedded in the floor, depicting Huiztocihuatl (Goddess of salt water) &amp; Tlaloc (Rain God).&lt;ref name=MCG   /&gt; This structure was called
so called because most of the figurines exhibited in the site Museum from the archaeological site, made from basalt green stone were found in this place.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

* Recinto de la Banqueta. It is one of the two rooms, contains stucco remains in floor and walls, which probably served for the king to rest. This place is known as "Recinto de la banqueta".&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt; It also contains a kind of ceremonial walkway, displays as ornament a molding with architectonic stone nails.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Many structures are covered with stucco, perhaps to protect them from destruction due to the many invasions suffered with the Aztec occupation.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

==Site Museum==
[[File:SMI MCG Entrance.JPG|thumb|right|250px|San Miguel Ixtapan, west side of basement 3 &amp; M.C. ClÃ©ment]]

The museum was opened in 1995 by the "Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura".&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

San Miguel has a site museum which exhibits a large amount of recovered pieces. This material provided information about the culture and way of life of the ancient inhabitants of the region.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The Museum is small; however keeps a collection of more than 800 items, many in perfect state of conservation and cleverly distributed pursuant to museographer Jorge Carrandi layout. This material has been discovered, mostly as part of mortuary offerings. By ceramic type and style of the sculptures, it has been chronologically placed from the postclassical mesoamerican period.&lt;ref name=Mexicodesc   /&gt;

Some of the ceramic figures include women figurines, some pregnant, dating back to 800 BCE to 200 CE.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

Other pieces belong to the splendor period, between 750 and 900 CE. Including vessels, deities representations, feathers and the skeleton of an important man, exhibited as was found in one of the external mounds.&lt;ref name= Recupe   /&gt;

== History ==
In ''A History of News'', author [[Mitchell Stephens]] (professor of [[journalism]] and [[mass communication]] at [[New York University]])&lt;ref name="stephens"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephens |first=Mitchell |author-link=Mitchell Stephens |title=A History of News |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-518991-9 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes sensationalism can be found in the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] ''[[Acta Diurna]]'' (official notices and announcements which were presented daily on public message boards, the perceived content of which spread with enthusiasm in [[literacy|illiterate]] societies).&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt; Sensationalism was used in books of the 16th and 17th century, to teach [[morality|moral]] [[lessons]]. According to Stevens, sensationalism brought the news to a new audience when it became aimed at the [[working class|lower class]], who had less of a need to accurately understand [[politics]] and the [[economy]], to occupy them in other matters. Through sensationalism, he claims, the audience was further educated and encouraged to take more interest in the news.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt;
The more modern forms of sensationalism developed in the course of the nineteenth century in parallel with the expansion of print culture in industrialized nations. A genre of British literature, "sensation novels," became in the 1860s the best example of how the publishing industry could capitalize on a rhetoric made of surprising turns in the narrative to market serialized fiction in the expanded market of the periodical press. The London magazine "Belgravia" edited by the popular author of sensation novels Mary Elizabeth Braddon between 1867 and 1876 offered one of the earliest theories of modernity and its âshock valueâ mediated by sensationalism. The attention-grasping rhetorical techniques found in sensation fiction were also employed in articles on science, modern technology, finance, and in historical accounts of contemporary events, as discussed by Alberto Gabriele in ''Reading Popular Culture in Victorian Print''.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Gabriele, Reading Popular Culture in Victorian Print: Belgravia and Sensationalism, New York and London, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-230-61521-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of essays ''Sensationalism and the Genealogy of Modernity: a Global Nineteenth Century Perspective'' edited by Alberto Gabriele is also helpful to track the transhistorical presence of sensationalism in several national contexts in the course of the long nineteenth century. Scholars in the collection engage in an interdisciplinary discussion on popular culture, literature, performance, art history, theory, pre-cinema and early cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Gabriele, ed. Sensationalism and the Genealogy of Modernity: a Global Nineteenth Century Perspective. Palgrave Macmillan, 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-137-60128-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In mass media ==
One presumed goal of sensational reporting is to increase or sustain [[Nielsen ratings|viewership]] or readership, from which media outlets can price their [[advertising]] higher to increase their [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] based on higher numbers of viewers and/or readers.&lt;ref name="whatswrong"&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=101 "What's Wrong With The News?"] [http://www.fair.org Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="advertiserinfluence"&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=7&amp;issue_area_id=60 "Issue Area: Advertiser Influence."] [http://www.fair.org Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this can lead to a lesser focus on [[objective journalism]] in favor of a [[profit motive]],&lt;ref name=watersen /&gt; in which editorial choices are based upon sensational stories and presentations to increase advertising [[revenue]].&lt;ref name=watersen&gt;[http://econpapers.repec.org/article/oupecinqu/v_3a25_3ay_3a1987_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a135-44.htm Sensationalism, Newspaper Profits and the Marginal Value of Watergate] Accessed September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, advertisers tend to have a preference for their products or services to be reported positively in mass media, which can contribute to bias in news reporting in favor of media outlets protecting their profits and revenues, rather than reporting [[Journalistic objectivity|objectively]] about stated products and services.&lt;ref name="advertiserinfluence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="censorship"&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=7&amp;issue_area_id=31 "Issue Area: Censorship."] [http://www.fair.org Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, newspapers have a duty to report and investigate stories related to [[political corruption]]. Such [[investigative journalism]] is right and proper when it is backed up with documents, interviews with responsible [[witness]]es, and other [[primary sources]]. Journalists and editors are often accused of sensationalizing [[scandals]] by those whose public image is harmed by the legitimate reporting of the scandal. News organizations are not obliged to (and are often [[Journalism ethics and standards|ethically]] obliged ''not'' to) avoid stories that might make local, state and national public figures uncomfortable. Occasionally, news organizations mistakenly relay false information from unreliable anonymous sources, who use mass media as a tool for [[Revenge|retaliation]], [[defamation]], victim and witness tampering, and monetary or personal gain. Therefore, any story based on sources who may be reasonably assumed to be motivated to act in this way is best interpreted with [[critical thinking]].

In extreme cases, mass media may report only information that makes a "[[anecdote|good story]]" without regard for factual accuracy or social [[relevance]].  It has been argued that the distrust in government that showed in the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal]] created a new business tactic for the media and resulted in the spread of negative, dishonest and misleading news coverage of American politics;&lt;ref name=watersen /&gt;&lt;ref name=waterzzv /&gt; such examples include the labeling of a large number of political scandals, regardless of their importance, with the [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|suffix "-gate"]].&lt;ref name=waterzzv&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-06-16/watergate-scandal-changed-political-landscape/55639974/1 Watergate scandal changed the political landscape forever] Accessed September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Such stories are often perceived (rightly or wrongly) as [[partisan (political)|politically partisan]] or biased towards or against a group or individual because of the sensational nature in which they are reported. A media piece may report on a political figure in a biased way or present one side of an issue while deriding another. It may include sensational aspects such as [[zealots]], [[:wikt:doomsayer|doomsayers]] and/or [[junk science]]. Complex subjects and affairs are often subject to sensationalism. Exciting and emotionally charged aspects can be drawn out without providing the elements needed (such as pertinent [[Source (journalism)|background]], [[Investigative journalism|investigative]], or [[Context (language use)|contextual]] information) for the audience to form its own opinions on the subject.

== In broadcasting ==
Sensationalism is often blamed for the [[infotainment]] style of many news programs on radio and television.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt; According to [[John Thompson (sociologist)|sociologist John Thompson]], the debate of sensationalism used in the mass medium of broadcasting is based on a misunderstanding of its audience, especially the television audience. Thompson explains that the term 'mass' (which is connected to broadcasting) suggests a 'vast audience of many thousands, even millions of passive individuals'.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John |author1-link=John Thompson (sociologist) |editor1-first=Hugh |editor1-last=Mackay |editor2-first=Tim| editor2-last=O'Sullivan |title=The Media Reader: Continuity and Transformation |publisher=Sage Publications Ltd |date=June 22, 1999 |chapter=The Media and Modernity |isbn=978-0-7619-6250-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television news is restricted to showing the scenes of crimes rather than the crime itself because of the [[Predictability|unpredictability]] of events, whereas newspaper writers can always recall what they did not witness.&lt;ref name="stephens"/&gt; Television news writers have room for fewer words than their newspaper counterparts. Their stories are measured in seconds, not [[column inch]]es, and thus (even with [[footage]]) television stories are inherently shallower than most newspaper stories, using shorter words and familiar idioms to express ideas which a newspaper writer is more free to expand upon and define with precision.

The [[anti-nuclear]] badge âNuclear Power? No Thanks" ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Atomkraft? Nej tak.), also known as the '''âSmiling Sun,â''' is the international symbol of the [[anti-nuclear movement]]. It was ubiquitous worldwide in the late 1970s and the 1980s. BBC News reported in 2005 that few symbols had become "as instantly recognizable across the world.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4484642.stm |title=The other smiley |publisher=BBC News Magazine |first=Denise |last=Winterman |date=1 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the [[nuclear power]] industry recognized the logo's "power and success," the BBC report said.  Over 20 million Smiling Sun badges were produced in 45 national and regional languages.&lt;ref name=smilingsun.org&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smilingsun.org |title=The Smiling Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the logo is playing a prominent role once again to raise awareness and funding for anti-nuclear groups, especially in Germany, Austria and Switzerland where opposition is growing to plans for extending operation of old nuclear reactors and constructing new ones.

The Smiling Sun logo was designed in 1975 by [[Denmark|Danish]] activist Anne Lund who was part of the Danish organization OOA ({{Interlanguage link multi|Organisationen til Oplysning om Atomkraft|dk}}/ Organization for Information on Nuclear Power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,773903,00.html |title=The Origin of the Anti-Nuclear Emblem: 'We Wanted a Logo that Was Cheerful and Polite' |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By posing the question: âNuclear Power?â and providing a polite answer, âNo Thanksâ, the logo was meant to express friendly dissent and - by questioning nuclear power - to stimulate dialogue.&lt;ref name=smilingsun.org/&gt; In 2011, after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], a new version was released for [[renewable energy]], with the statement "Renewable Energy", "Yes Please" (Danish: "Vedvarende Energi? Ja tak!") on a green background with a yellow sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy|url=http://www.smilingsun-shop.org/en/Renewable-Energy/|website=smilingsun-shop.org|publisher=OOA Fonden|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:bouchedefer.jpg|thumb|First issue of ''La Bouche de fer'' (''Mouth of Iron'')]]

The '''Society of the Friends of Truth''' ('''Amis de la VeritÃ©'''), also known as the '''Social Club''' (French: 
''Cercle social''), was a French revolutionary organization founded in 1790. It was "a mixture of revolutionary political club, the Masonic Lodge, and a literary salon".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution'', PUF, 1989, page 196&lt;/ref&gt;  It also published an influential revolutionary newspaper, the ''Mouth of Iron''.

==The inception==
The Society of the Friends of Truth was established by [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], who announced its birth in the popular press on 21 February 1790. The original purpose of the club was to become a "clearing-house" for correspondence between and among scholars from all over Europe. In the spirit of its founders, the club wished to cultivate a "public mandate" under which its activities would be governed. Thus, its newsletter, ''Mouth of Iron'' (''La Bouche de fer''), solicited letters from readers to comment on political affairs and to issue denunciations of counter-revolutionary plots.

The club was actually launched in the month of October 1790, when the sessions "of the Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth" at the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] started. Before an audience that ranged from five thousand to eight thousand people every week, Claude Fauchet, self-appointed "attorney of Truth", lectured on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s 1762 work ''[[The Social Contract]]''. The club also formulated political theories on democratic government, ultimately dismissing direct democracy in favor of a system that resembled a popularly elected dictatorship that could be dismissed by the citizens whenever its actions became insupportable. The Social Club also advocated steps toward a more equitable distribution of wealth, always with an eye to Rousseau's ideals, but the club did ''not'' support land reform.

The meetings were described in detail in the "Mouth of Iron", which published the proceedings of the Fauchet lectures and discussions and the mail that arrived following them. This publication is important for understanding the genesis of democratic ideas during the [[French Revolution]]. The Social Club was also the first revolutionary group to identify itself clearly as a ''cosmopolitan organization'', meaning that its aims superseded national boundaries. It made appeals to scholars worldwide, and it produced a polyglot edition of the 1791 Constitution for distribution globally. Its goal was to create a universal republic led by scholars.

==Membership and adherents==
Key figures attending the Social Club included [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], as well as [[Sylvain MarÃ©chal]], [[FranÃ§ois-NoÃ«l Babeuf|"Gracchus" Babeuf]], [[:fr:Guillaume-FranÃ§ois-Charles Goupil de PrÃ©feln|Goupil de PrÃ©feln]], [[Camille Desmoulins]], [[Bertrand BarÃ¨re]], and the [[Marquis de Condorcet]]. About one-hundred-thirty persons were members and attended meetings regularly.

The meetings were public because the club wanted to show the widest possible audience what discourse in the atmosphere of a [[Salon (gathering)|literary or philosophical salon]] might accomplish. (This explains the choice of the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] as a meeting-place, rather than some smaller venue like a private home.) Spectators were invited to ask questions, and a resolution was passed at the end of each session.

In 1791, the membership of the Social Club openly declared themselves [[Republicanism#French and Swiss thought|republicans]]. It then became a meeting place for the [[Girondist]]s, who rivaled the [[Jacobins]] for primacy of republican ideology and action. The club's political orientation was liberal, and it promoted the ideal of a society composed of small and medium economic producers: craftsmen, farmers, merchants, and entrepreneurs.

The members of the Social Club also considered themselves contemporary feminists, and while no remarkable feminist change would come out of the club, the members of the club helped individually to develop the framework for what would become the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]''. [[Olympe de Gouges]], the author of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman'', was a member of the club and would often develop her ideas through the liberal conduit of the Social Club. While the members did proclaim themselves supporters of republican ideals publicly, their embrace of feminists ideals was regarded as much more treasonous (and as such, was quite under wraps).&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, Donna. ''Margaret Fuller: Writing a Woman's Life''. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993). {{ISBN|0-312-09145-1}}, 45â46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1791 on, the club's offices operated a publishing business. It became a center for the dissemination of revolutionary literature, including numerous newspapers, political pamphlets, theatrical works, poetry, posters, etc. A number of seminal authors, [[Louis-SÃ©bastien Mercier#Political views|Louis-SÃ©bastien Mercier]], [[Nicolas-Edme RÃ©tif|Nicolas-Edme RÃ©tif de la Bretonne]], [[Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Condorcet]], [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], and [[Jean-Marie Roland]], were published under the club's auspices.

After the fall of the Girondins, the club dissolved. Fauchet was arrested and executed on 31 October 1793. Bonneville, the printer, resumed activity after [[9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794). His press tried to resurrect the Social Club, but it never regained its previous audience. In a fragmented state, it continued to exist until [[Brumaire]] of year VIII (November 1800). By then, ideologues like [[Pierre Claude FranÃ§ois Daunou|Daunou]], [[Constantin-FranÃ§ois ChassebÅuf|Volney]], [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton|Daubenton]], and [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Berthollet]] held center stage.

The ''Amis de la VeritÃ©'' was fondly remembered, and it became a touchstone for the romantics of the nineteenth century, like [[Charles Nodier]] and [[Victor Hugo]], but it was also highly esteemed among politicians and social theorists such as [[Charles Fourier]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], and [[Karl Marx]].

==The ''Mouth of Iron''==

''La Bouche de fer'', the ''Mouth of Iron'', may have derived its name, sardonically, from [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]]'s observation about [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 96 BC)|the consul, Domitius]], "that it was no wonder that a man who had a beard of brass, also had a mouth of iron and a heart of lead."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' xviii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suet"&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Nero,'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ix. 1. Â§ 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' ii. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Others hold that the name comes from a mailbox in the shape of a lion's mouth, located at the headquarters of the club, at No. 4, rue du ThÃ©Ã¢tre-FranÃ§ais, where letters, petitions, proposals, denunciations, screeds, and other treatises could be deposited. A third theory is that this name, ''Mouth of Iron'', was the same name as a lodge of freemasons to which Bonneville and Fauchet had once belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Copin-Albancelli]], ''Le drame maÃ§onnique. Le Pouvoir occulte contre la France'', 1908, p.334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the ''Mouth of Iron'' was published in Paris between October 1790 and 28 July 1791, at first, three times per week, then daily, beginning on 22 June 1791. The newsletter contained comments on "The Social Contract" of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, essays by Claude Fauchet, transcripts of speeches by Condorcet, petitions from the ''Club of the [[Cordeliers]]'', etc. A subscription cost thirty-six pounds (livres) per year, and anyone who subscribed was automatically made a member of the Social Club; so, since casual readers and curiosity-seekers were counted as members, the size of the club's membership was probably somewhat overstated.

''La Bouche de fer'' was the origin{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} of the famous quote, often attributed to [[Denis Diderot]]: ''"Quand le dernier des rois sera pendu avec les boyaux du dernier prÃªtre cÃ©libataire, le genre humain pourra espÃ©rer Ãªtre heureux."'' ("When the last king is hanged with the entrails of the last celibate priest, mankind may hope to be happy.")

== Speculation of identity ==
Little is known about the identity of those depicted in the sculpture, but it is known that the type of shoes the middle figure is depicted to wear distinguishes them as a member of the Roman noble class.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From this small bit of information, many theories have risen in speculation of the true identity of the center figure, but little evidence has been provided to back up many of these claims and as such they remain only theories.

Recent research has suggested that represents a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Roman Senate|senator]], holding the heads of his ancestors. The head on the right is that of a famous [[List of Roman generals|general]], which is evident thanks to the palm-tree support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, it is now known that the head and body of the middle figure do not, in fact, belong to each other, evident due to the marble of the head and body being of different types and colors (the head being a white marble and the body being a yellow).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gramberg, Werner. "TOMB OF POPE PAUL III FARNESE."&lt;/ref&gt; This is made more evident due to the toga's finish from behind and the evidence  of the restoration of the nose and ears.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to some, the figure is supposed to represent [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]], holding the severed heads of his two sons, while others claim that instead it is the portrait of a sculptor. Other still believe the prominent figure to be that of [[Julius Caesar]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; while many simply claim that the figure is an unknown Roman senator.&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, Nigel, and Michael Squire.

The '''''VijÃ±Äna Bhairava Tantra''''' (sometimes spelled in a Hindicised way as ''Vigyan Bhairav Tantra'') is a key [[Tantra]] text of the [[Trika]] school of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] in [[Sanskrit]] language. Cast as a discourse between the god [[Bhairava]] and his consort [[Bhairavi]], it briefly presents 112 Tantric meditation methods or centering techniques (''[[dharana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Paul Reps, ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]], A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings'' ({{ISBN|0-8048-0644-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; These include several variants of [[Anapanasati|breath awareness]], concentration on various centers in the body, [[Nondualism|non-dual awareness]], [[japa|Mantra chanting]], imagination and visualization and contemplation through each of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;Osho, ''The Book of the Secrets'', vols. 1-5, St. Martin's Griffin, 1998, {{ISBN|0-312-18058-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-18058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prerequisite to success in any of the 112 practices is a clear understanding of which method is most suitable to the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Vijnana Bhairava â The Manual for Self Realization, ed. John Hughes. Contents pp. vii-xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The text ==

The text is a chapter from the ''Rudrayamala Tantra'', a [[Bhairava]] [[Ägama (Hinduism)|Agama]]. [[Bhairavi]], the goddess, asks [[Bhairava]] to reveal the essence of the way to realization of the highest reality. In his answer [[Bhairava]]  describes 112 ways to enter into the universal and transcendental state of consciousness. References to it appear throughout the literature of Kashmir Shaivism, indicating that it was considered to be an important text in the monistic school of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy. Trika and Kashmiri Shaiva tradition names the Absolute Reality as Bhairava. Combination of three alphabets bha + ra + va form the word ââBhairavaâ. Each of these three alphabets means three different acts of God. âbhaâ means sustenance of the universe, âraâ means dissolution of the universe and âvaâ means manifestation of the universe. Vijnana Bhairava Tantra is the knowledge about the highest state of consciousness. It describes methods to merge the human consciousness with the divine consciousness or the individual consciousness with cosmic consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.manblunder.com/articlesview/vijnana-bhairava-tantra&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentaries and English Translations ==
The text appeared in 1918 in the Kashmir Series of Text and Studies (''KSTS'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muktabodha.org|title=Muktabodha Institute|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kashmir Series published two volumes, one with a commentary in Sanskrit by [[Kshemaraja]] and Shivopadhyaya and the other with a commentary, called ''Kaumadi'', by [[Ananda Bhatta]].

In 1957, [[Paul Reps]] brought the text to wide attention by including an English translation in his popular book ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42954648|title=Zen Flesh, Zen Bones : A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings|last=|first=|date=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|others=Reps, Paul, 1895-1990.|year=|isbn=0140288325|location=London|pages=|oclc=42954648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reps' translation was the subject of a voluminous commentary by [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/555656282|title=The Book of Secrets : 112 Meditations to Discover the Mystery Within|last=Rajneesh|first=Osho|date=2010|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Osho, 1931-1990.|year=|isbn=9780312650605|edition=1st updated and rev.

[[File:Votive relief dedicated by Xenokrateia to the river-god Cephissus - NAMA 2756.JPG|thumb|The Xenokrateia Relief]]

The '''Xenokrateia Relief''' is a [[marble]] [[votive offering]], dated to the end of the fifth-century BCE. It commemorates the foundation of a sanctuary to the river god [[Cephissus (mythology)|Kephisos]] by a woman named Xenokrateia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Athens,+NM+2756&amp;object=sculpture "Athens, NM 2756 (Sculpture)"], Perseus Digital Library Catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

The relief, currently on display at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Athens]] (NAMA 2756), was found in [[Neo Phaliro]] in 1908, in the area inside the [[Long Walls]], which in Antiquity connected the harbor of [[Piraeus]] with Athens proper, around the wallsâ intersection point with the bed of the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Kephisos]] river. It is dated on stylistic grounds to 410 BCE, and is made of [[Mount Pentelicus|Pentelic]] [[marble]], while the pillar on which it stands is made of [[limestone]].

The relief marks the foundation of a local sanctuary to the river god Kephisos. We have no knowledge of this sanctuary from literary sources, or any indication of archaeological structure in the area where the relief was discovered. This has led some scholars to propose that the sanctuary consisted of only a [[sacred grove]] and an [[altar]]. Thus, the only information we have comes from this relief and its inscription, as well as from two other finds excavated nearby â the Kephisodotos relief and an inscribed [[stele]].

Xenokrateia to Kephisos a sanctuary

has founded and dedicated [it]

to [him] and to the gods who share this altar

in thanks for ''ta didaskalia'', the daughter

and the mother of Xeniades of Choleidai,

whoever wishes, is permitted to sacrifice for

the fulfillment of good things
|}

This inscription has generated many â and sometimes contradicting â interpretations. First, there is some disagreement regarding Xenokrateiaâs familial status. Most scholars agree that both her father and son were named Xeniades, and that her husband is not mentioned in the inscription. Mclees thinks she was a widow or maybe that she was not legally married,&lt;ref&gt;McClees, H., A study of women in Attic inscriptions, (New York, 1920), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Kron believes she was an heiress who did not need a guardian,&lt;ref&gt;Kron, Uta, âPriesthoods, Dedication, and Euergetism,â in Hellstrom, P. and Alroth, B. (eds.), Religion and Power in the Ancient Greek World. (Uppsala, 1993). p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and Purvis suggests that Xenokrateia was married to Kephisodotos, who dedicated the other relief mentioned earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Purvis, A., Singular Dedications. (New York, 2003). p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cook, however, claims Xenokrateia was the wife of Xeniades, and that she dedicated the relief âas daughter (before her marriage) and mother (after it).â&lt;ref&gt;Cook, A.B., Zeus. A Study in Ancient Religion. (New York, 1964). p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, scholars are divided in their opinions on how to translate ta didaskalia and to what it refers, since no other information is given for the reason behind the dedication. This phrase is usually translated as âinstructions,â âteachings,â âupbringing,â or âtraining.â One of the interpretations suggests that the relief was given in thanks for the education of Xenokrateiaâs son. Yet it was also claimed that since dedications are given to the gods only after they fulfill what was asked of them, Xenokrateia is thanking the god for her own education which she now uses in order to educate her son. Other suggestions are that this is an act in which Xenokrateia places her son under the protection of Kephisos, or that it was given in thanks after her son won a singing competition.&lt;ref&gt;Purvis, A., Singular Dedications. (New York, 2003). p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relief ==
The main problem regarding this relief is the identification of the thirteen figures portrayed on it. Unfortunately, most of the figures lack attributes, thus they cannot be identified with certainty, and scholars vary in their opinions in this regard, since such little secure evidence leaves a great room for hypothesis and guesswork. For example, while it is clear that the third figure from the left is holding an object, it is unclear what it is. It was identified as a [[caduceus|kerykeion]], meaning the figure is [[Hermes]], as a loom, claiming that this is [[Rhapso]], one of the [[Moirai]], who weave the destinies of men, and as a torch held by [[Artemis]]. 
The attributes of the figures on the relief must have been painted on rather than carved, since otherwise they would make less sense to the visitors of the sanctuary. Most scholars assume that the two figures in the smaller scale are Xenokrateia and her son, and that she is introducing him to Kephisos, so that the god may oversee the boyâs growth to adulthood.

=== The Inscribed Stele ===
In order to decipher the composition of the Xenokrateia Relief and to identify the figures portrayed on it, scholars use the two other finds from the site. The first is an inscribed stele with names of some divinities in the [[dative case]], and it is understood by some as the sacrificial regulation of the sanctuary. However, since there is no mention of a cult, a sacrifice, or any instructions, others consider this stele as another votive offering. The names inscribed upon the stele are [[Hestia]], Kephisos, [[Apollo]] Pythios, [[Leto]], [[Artemis]] Lochia (of birth), [[Eileithyia]], [[Achelous|Acheloos]], Kallirohe, the Geraistian [[nymph]]s of birth, and Rhapso. This is an interesting list, as most of these deities were perceived as nurturing and protecting children. Unfortunately, this list cannot represent the gods in our relief, since while the relief depicts five gods and six goddesses, the stele names three gods and nine goddesses, assuming that there are three Geraistian nymphs, since nymphs are usually depicted in groups of three in Athenian art. However, some of the deities named on the stele might also appear on our relief.

=== The Kephisodotos Relief ===
Next is the double relief of Kephisodotos, also dated to 410 BCE. On one side it depicts the hero Acheloos, kidnapping a nymph whose name is inscribed as Iasila,&lt;ref&gt;There is no other mention of this nymph in Greek mythology, so it is assumed that this nymph is the nymph Basila, who is known from other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; while Hermes is leading the chariot. On the other side, Kephisos, depicted as a horned god, stands in the middle. On the right are three nymphs and on the left appear two other unidentified figures. The inscription says it is a dedication to Hermes and the nymphs, thus demonstrating that there were even more divinities associated with this sanctuary.

=== The Imagery ===
The one certain identification on the Xenokrateia relief is the figure on the far left. This is the god [[Apollo]], sitting on a [[sacrificial tripod|tripod]], resting his legs on an [[Omphalos]], near to which stands an eagle. The figure to his right is usually identified as Apolloâs mother, Leto, or as his sister, Artemis. Some scholars identify Artemis as the third figure from the left, while others identify it as Hermes, Leto, Rhapso, or an unidentified youth. The two figures of a smaller scale are almost unanimously identified as Xenokrateia and her son, Xeniades, since Greek art usually depict humans as smaller than deities. The figure who interacts with Xenokrateia and her son is usually identified as either Kephisos or merely a priest.

There is a great uncertainty regarding the next five figures, and there are many possible identifications for them, namely Hestia, Eileithyia, Leto, Rhapso, nymphs or river-gods such as Kephisos or [[Ilisos]]. Finally, of the two figures on the far right, the one on the top is understood to be Kallirhoe or a statue of hers, although some suggest it is Eileithyia or [[Hecate]], and the bull-like deity on the bottom, is identified as the river-god Acheloos by almost all scholars.

Thus, most of the suggestions identify Xenokrateia and her son in this relief and attempt to match to them the relevant deities. However, there is one interpretation that deviates from this line of thought. Stais claims that this relief depicts the mythological participants of the Athenian myth of [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]], in which the Athenian princess [[Creusa]] was raped by Apollo and gave birth to his son, Ion, whom she exposed to the elements. He was rescued by Apollo, however, and guided to Delphi by Hermes. Years later, when Creusa arrived to Delphi with her husband, [[Xuthus|Xuthos]], to ask why they cannot have children, she is reunited with her son. Following this myth, Stais identified the first three figures as Apollo, his mother, Leto, and his sister, Artemis, while recognizing the next five figures as the participants of this myth: the [[Pythia]], who was Apolloâs priestess, Ion, Xuthus, Hermes, and Creusa. Next he identifies three nymphs and Eileithyia. Finally he believes that the bull-like deity is Kephisos, thus connecting the myth of Ion to the locality of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Î£ÏÎ±Î·Ï, Î., âÎÎ½Î±Î¸Î·Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¿Î½ Î¬Î½Î¬Î³Î»ÏÏÎ¿Î½ Î­Îº Î¦Î±Î»Î®ÏÎ¿Ï,â ÎÏÏÎ±Î¹Î¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¹ÎºÎ® ÎÏÎ·Î¼ÎµÏÎ¯Ï, (1909). pp. 239-264.&lt;/ref&gt;
