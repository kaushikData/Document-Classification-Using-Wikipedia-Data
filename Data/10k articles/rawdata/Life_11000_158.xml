'''Actelion''' is a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company established in December 1997, headquartered in Allschwil near Basel in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=fierce&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson scraps phase 3 antibiotic program acquired in $30B Actelion takeover|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/j-j-scraps-phase-3-antibiotic-program-acquired-30b-actelion-takeover|first1=Nick Paul|last1=Taylor|date=17 April 2018|access-date=5 July 2018|publisher=Fierce Biotech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actelion specializes in [[orphan diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicine|url = http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actelion scientists were among the first to work in the field of endothelian receptor antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Businessweek|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=ATLN:VX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company name might be a reminder for its first product, an endothelian receptor antagonist and the verb "action", "act upon". Actelion was initially financed with [[venture capital]] provided through a syndicate including Atlas Venture, [[Sofinnova]] and [[HealthCap]].

Actelion has 29 operative affiliates around the world, including the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, Switzerland and a number of EU countries.
The Swiss affiliate is located in Baden, the German affiliate in [[Freiburg]], the Austrian one in [[Vienna]], the French one in [[Paris]] and the UK affiliate is located in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actelion affiliates|url=http://www.pah-info.com/Affiliates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the company established the Actelion Endothelin Research Award programme which supports selected clinical research projects.

In January 2017, [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] announced that it would purchase the company for $30 billion.&lt;ref name=wsj-rockoff&gt;{{Citation

In 2018, Johnson &amp; Johnson announced they would discontinue development of one of the phase III drugs it acquired during its purchase of Actelion.&lt;ref name=fierce /&gt;

==Medicines==
Actelion currently has 10 compounds in its pipeline – including 3 in late-stage development – and 4 medicines on the market for [[orphan disease]]s:
* ''Tracleer'' ([[bosentan]]): Tracleer was the first oral treatment approved for [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], a rare, chronic, life-threatening disorder that severely compromises the functions of the lungs and heart. It is a dual [[endothelin receptor antagonist]], see also: [[Endothelin receptor antagonist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Medicines Agency|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000401/human_med_001100.jsp&amp;murl=menus/medicines/medicines.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Zavesca'' ([[miglustat]]): is currently the only approved oral treatment for patients with mild to moderate type 1 [[Gaucher disease]] for whom enzyme replacement therapy is unsuitable. Type 1 Gaucher disease is a rare and debilitating metabolic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Medicines Agency|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000435/human_med_001171.jsp&amp;murl=menus/medicines/medicines.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ventavis'' ([[iloprost]]): Ventavis is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group 1) in patients with [[NYHA]] Class III or IV symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Medicines Agency|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000474/human_med_001133.jsp&amp;murl=menus/medicines/medicines.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Veletri'' ([[epoprostenol]] for injection): is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the long-term intravenous treatment of [[primary pulmonary hypertension]] and [[pulmonary hypertension]] associated with the [[scleroderma]] spectrum of disease in NYHA Class III and Class IV patients who do not respond adequately to conventional therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News Medical|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100826/FDA-approves-brand-name-VELETRI-for-Actelions-epoprostenol-for-injection-therapy.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/migration/taskforce/docs/administrativedetentionrev5.pdf ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION OF MIGRANTS, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Democracy|democratic]] and undemocratic, resort to administrative detention as a means to combat [[terrorism]], to control [[illegal immigration]], or to protect the ruling regime.{{fact?|date=November 2016}}

Unlike [[Crime|criminal]] [[incarceration]] (imprisonment) imposed upon [[conviction]] following a trial, administrative detention is a forward-looking mechanism. While criminal proceedings have a retrospective focus – they seek to determine whether a defendant committed an offense in the past – the reasoning behind administrative detention often is based upon contentions that the suspect is likely to pose a threat in the future. It is meant to be preventive in nature rather than punitive (see [[preventive detention]]). The practice has been criticized by [[human rights]] organizations as a breach of [[civil and political rights]].

==Counter-terrorism==
Administrative detentions are defined in the law of many of the world's states.  In democratic countries using administrative detention as a [[counter-terrorism]] measure, the rationale given by its proponents is that legal existing systems are ill suited to handle the specific challenges presented by terrorism. Proponents of administrative detention maintain that criminal law's reliance on defendant rights and strict rules of evidence cannot be used effectively to remove the threat of dangerous terrorists. Some of the reasons often used to support this claim are that the information used to identify terrorists and their plots may include extremely sensitive intelligence sources and methods, the disclosure of which during trial would undermine future counter-terrorism operations. It is also claimed that the conditions under which some suspected terrorists are captured, especially in combat zones, make it impossible to prove criminal cases using normal evidentiary rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf Administrative Detention: The Integration of Strategy and Legal Process,  Matthew C. Waxman, p. 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616123121/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents also maintain that criminal prosecution is designed primarily to punish past behavior, thus it is deliberately skewed in favor of defendant, in order to assure that few, if any, innocents are punished. Counter-terrorism, on the other hand, aims to prevent future action, and thus requires a system that is weighed more heavily toward reducing the possibility of future harm, by ensuring that no guilty party will go free.

The [[Laws of War]] are also seen by the proponents as inadequate. These laws allow the capture of enemy fighters, and also allow holding them for the duration of hostilities without [[trial]]. However, these laws grew out of the need to regulate combat between professional armies accountable to a sovereign state, who were engaged in combat of possibly lengthy, but finite duration. Attempting to apply these laws to terrorists who are intermingled with a civilian population and accountable to no-one opens the possibility of [[indefinite detention without trial]], combined with a substantial likelihood of error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf Administrative Detention: The Integration of Strategy and Legal Process,  Matthew C. Waxman, p. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616123121/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/0724_detention_waxman/0724_detention_waxman.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of administrative detention challenge the above assumptions. While acknowledging the need to protect the sources and methods used to obtain sensitive intelligence, they maintain that existing laws, such as the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]  (FISA) and the [[Classified Information Procedures Act]] (CIPA), successfully balance the need to protect sensitive information, including the sources and means of intelligence gathering, with defendants' fair trial rights. They point to the historical record of prosecutors who were able to obtain convictions against terrorists on the basis of existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/usls/2008/alert/115 Post 9-11 Terrorism Cases Show Federal Courts Bring Terrorists to Justice Without Administrative Detention, Military Commissions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617221231/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/usls/2008/alert/115 |date=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents maintain that in essence, administrative detention is a form of [[collective punishment]]. Since it does not require proof of individual guilt, it attributes to all members of a group the actions of a few.

==Immigration control==
{{Main article|Immigration detention}}
Many countries utilize administrative detention to hold illegal immigrants – those arriving at a country's borders without proper authorization – as an interim step to either [[deportation]] or the obtainment of proper legal status. Immigration detention is controversial because it presents a clash between traditional notions of individual liberty and the territorial [[sovereignty]] of states. Comparative studies on administrative detention practices of different countries found that those experiencing large-scale influxes of illegal migrants by sea (such as the United States and Australia) typically have the most draconian systems. Proponents of administrative detention for illegal immigrants claim that detention is required since these immigrants have not committed any crime for which they could be prosecuted under existing laws, and that allowing them to await their potential deportation while not in custody runs a risk of their absconding. Opponents maintain that alternatives to detention exist, and that such alternatives are preferable because they do not violate personal liberty, as well as being less of a financial burden to the state. Among the alternatives suggested are supervised release to a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO),  the release into the custody of a private citizen who will guarantee the immigrant's participation in immigration hearings, and "open detention" centers with mandatory reporting requirements.&lt;ref name="ecre"&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3c0273224.html Research Paper on Alternatives to Detention], European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), London, September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection of the ruling regime==
In many non-democratic countries, administrative detention is used by the ruling regime to suppress dissent and sanction opponents of the government. In [[Asia]] in particular, administrative detention was first introduced by the British and French colonial authorities prior to and during [[World War II]]. Created as a mechanism to control political dissent, it has ironically survived and made its way into the law books of the now-independent former colonies, who legitimized its use against their own political opponents in their constitutions.&lt;ref name="omar"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULRev/2003/9.html BOOK REVIEW: RIGHTS, EMERGENCIES AND JUDICIAL REVIEW, Imtiaz Omar, Kluwer Law International Hague, Netherlands 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, they were and codified as "emergency measures" or "internal security" acts. [[Bangladesh]], India, [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Pakistan]], [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]] are notable examples of such former colonies who hold political prisoners under administrative detention which has its legal roots in British [[Colonialism|colonial]] practices.&lt;ref name="omar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7616147.stm Malaysia resignation amid arrests]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vietnam]] is an example where administrative detention was widely used by the French colonial authorities in the 1930s,  to arrest those suspected of [[Communist]] activities. Post-independence, the now-ruling Communist authorities have employed very similar means to detain those suspected of ``counter-revolutionary" offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/vietnm/Vietn97d-03.htm Human Rights wtah - RURAL UNREST IN VIETNAM]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of these political prisoners, such as [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] in Myanmar, have become known worldwide due to the detention, and their cause is championed by human rights organizations.

==Instances of administrative detention==

===Armenia===
[[Armenia]] has been criticized by [[Human Rights Watch]] for not fully reforming the legal framework it inherited from the former [[Soviet Union]], and failing to bring its administrative detention system into accord with prevailing international norms. During the 2003 Presidential elections,  Armenian police arbitrarily applied the Code of Administrative Offenses, under which administrative detention is authorized, to lock up dozens of opposition activists and supporters for periods of up to fifteen days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/armenia/armenia052303bck0.htm#P61_1497 The Use of Administrative Detention in the 2003 Armenian Presidential Election]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main article|Mandatory detention in Australia}}
Like many other countries experiencing large scale illegal immigration, such as Canada and the United States, Australia has a system of mandatory administrative detention for illegal immigrants, or asylum seekers who arrive at its shores without proper visas.&lt;ref&gt;The Administrative Detention of Non-Nationals Pursuant to Immigration Control: International and Constitutional Law Perspectives, Daniel Wilsher, International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 53, No. 4, pp. 897-934, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The legal basis for this system is found in Australia's [[Migration Act 1958]] (Cth), which authorized the indefinite detention of an unlawful non-citizen who can not be deported immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Migration and Refugee Law in Australia, Mirko Bagaric, Kim Boyd, John Vrachnas, Penny Dimopoulos, Sue Tongue, p. 471, Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch criticized this Australian policy, claiming it seriously contravenes Australia's obligations to non-citizens, refugees and asylum seekers under international human rights and refugee law. Additionally, opposition to the system on humanitarian grounds came from a range of religious, community and political groups including the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]], Amnesty International, the [[Australian Greens]] and Rural Australians for Refugees

===Brazil===
Administrative detentions in [[Brazil]] are admitted only for members of the military. Any member of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]] may be imprisoned if found to be repeatedly in violation of the Military Disciplinary Regulations (''Regulamento Disciplinar'') by his or her superiors. Each military branch has issued a list of "transgressions" in their Disciplinary Regulations. The harshest punishment of this kind, in the Brazilian Army, is a 30-day imprisonment penalty.

Notwithstanding, members of the Brazilian Armed Forces under administrative detention may be granted a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' by the justice system to deliver them from imprisonment. They retain their full rights as citizens.

===Myanmar===
In an overview that describes [[Myanmar]] as "one of the most repressive countries in Asia", Human Rights Watch quotes a [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] report that states that in 2002, there were approximately 3,500 detainees in Myanmar, of which 1,300 are political prisoners, including parliament members. Burmese authorities often extend the detention of prisoners who have already served their prison sentences, by placing them under administrative detention. This practice is used even with elderly and infirm prisoners. One of the most notable cases of this practice was the detention of  [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/burma9826.htm Human Rights Overview – Burma]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The use of administrative detention in China has been commonplace since before 1949. At that time, it was used primarily against minor offenders as well as against [[opium]] addicts, [[prostitute]]s, vagrants and those considered to be insane. Since the 1978 legal reforms in China, the public security organs (gong'an jiguan), primarily the police, hold administrative detention powers which are used alongside the state's criminal justice system. Administrative detention is used against subjects that are viewed by the ruling regime as "socially undesirable", in order to maintain public order, social stability and political stability of the ruling regime.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Reform and Administrative Detention Powers in China, pp. 3-8, Sarah Biddulph, Cambridge Studies in Law and Society, Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This target group includes prostitutes and their clients, drug addicts, political dissenters and petty criminals, who perform legal misdemeanors that are not serious enough for criminal prosecution. [[Custody and repatriation]] (Chinese: 收容遣送; Pinyin: shōuróng qiǎnsòng) was also used until 2003 for people, especially peasants, who did not have required papers.

There are three main forms of these administrative detentions: "detention for education" ("Shourong jiaoyu"), coercive [[drug rehabilitation]] ("Qiangzhi jiedu"), and "reeducation through labor" ("Laodong jiaoyang"). In addition, administrative detention is used for several internal security reasons, such as detention under the Security Administrative Punishments Law ("Xingzheng juliu"); Administrative detention for questioning of suspects ("Luizhi panwen");  and detention of juvenile offenders in work-study schools ("Gongdu Xuexiao")

The use of administrative detention in China has been criticized by international human rights organizations, as well as by domestic groups. These criticisms maintain that the police often abuse their power, that the execution of these powers is at the complete discretion of the police, and that there are no legal constraints placed on their execution.

===Egypt===
Egypt's Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 authorizes the government to suspend basic civil liberties by declaring a state of emergency. Such a state of emergency has been in force almost continuously since 1967. Acting under this law, Egyptian authorities have administratively detained individuals who were suspected of membership in banned organizations such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15966 21-year-old blogger detained despite release order]&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as individuals engaged in peaceful demonstrations expressing opposition to the war in Iraq or support for the Palestinian uprising. [[Human Rights Watch]] has criticized this practice as the use of emergency legislation for 'repression of public dissent'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/02/egypt021403.htm Egypt: Growing Numbers of Arrests]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] charges that relatives of political prisoners in Egypt have been administratively detained solely because of their family relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde12/035/2002/en/ Document - Egypt: Torture or ill-treatment/Incommunicado detention, Al-Sayid Muhammad Hassan 'Abd al-Ghani] &lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian government refuses to disclose how many administrative detainees are held, but human rights groups estimate that 16,000-20,000 are held in detention without charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eipr.org/en/press/05/opinion%205%7B1%7D.htm Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights - OPINION No.  5/2005 (EGYPT)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122020525/http://www.eipr.org/en/press/05/opinion%205%7B1%7D.htm |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Ireland utilizes administrative detention to control illegal immigration. Beginning in 1996, a legal framework was put in place to authorize the use of administrative detention for this purpose. This legal framework includes the Refugee Act, 1996, the Immigration Acts, 1999, 2003 and 2004, and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000. According to official Irish government statistics, in 2003-2004, a total of 2,798 people were administratively detained for immigration-related reasons, two thirds of whom were held in prison for periods of longer than 51 days. The vast majority (more than 90%) of detainees are held in one of two [[Dublin]] prisons, Cloverhill Prison (male detainees) and the [[Dóchas Centre]] at Mountjoy Prison (female detainees). The rest are held in prisons as well as border control (Garda Síochána) stations.

The [[Council of Europe]] and human rights organizations have criticized the overcrowded conditions in which the detainees are held, as well as the fact that detainees are held together with convicted criminals. In addition, Human Rights Consultants have reported that Irish law does not protect the rights of detainees, by not informing them of their right to challenge the legality of their detention, nor recognizing their rights to have access to a lawyer and to have access to medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detention-in-europe.org/images/stories/detention%20ireland.pdf Immigration-related detention in Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116191803/http://www.detention-in-europe.org/images/stories/detention%20ireland.pdf |date=2016-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{See also|Palestinian prisoners in Israel#Administrative detention}}
The legal basis for Israel's use of Administrative Detention is the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] 1945 [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations]] which were amended in 1979 to form the Israeli Law on Authority in States of Emergency. Administrative detention is for six-month terms, although they can be extended barring appeal.&lt;ref&gt;B'Tselem, 1 January 2011, [http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention/criticism_on_the_administrative_detention_order ''Criticism of administrative detention under the Administrative Detention Order'']&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative detention is also used in cases where the available evidence consists of information obtained by the security services (particularly the [[Shin Bet]]), and where a trial would reveal sensitive security information, such as the identities of informers or infiltrators.

Although it is commonly applied to alleged Palestinian militants, it has occasionally been applied to Jewish Israeli citizens, including Jewish right-wing public-figures and activists (notably in the aftermath of the [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin]]) and in more recent years sometimes to [[Israeli settlement|settlers]] for short periods.&lt;ref&gt;B'Tselem, 22 July 2012 [http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention Administrative Detention]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Israel, the Minister of Defense has the authority to issue Administrative Detention orders for up to 6 months in cases where there is a reasonable chance that the person harms the security of the state. The same officeholder has the authority to renew such orders. Likewise, the Chief of the General Staff can issue such orders, but valid for only 48 hours. Law enforcement authorities have to show cause within 48 hours (in a hearing behind closed doors). Administrative Detention orders can be appealed to the District Court and, if denied there, to the [[Supreme Court of Israel]]. The District Court can annul such orders if it finds the administrative detention occurred for reasons other than security (mainly for common crimes or the exercise of freedom of expression). Overall supervisory authority on the application of the relevant law rests with the Minister of Justice.

Within the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], any Israeli district army commander can issue an administrative detention order, and the order can be appealed at the Israeli district military court, or, if denied there, at the Supreme Court. Here too, an administrative detention order is valid for at most six months, but can be renewed by the appropriate authority. Israel refers its use of administrative detention in the occupied territories to Article 78 of the Fourth [[Geneva Convention]] 1949, which states that "If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected persons, it may, at the most, subject them to assigned residence or to internment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Israel Yearbook on Human Rights vol. 23| publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | pages=49–50 | volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Addameer, Israel held 285 Palestinians in administrative detention in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Addameer, [http://www.addameer.org/etemplate.php?id=496 ''Addameer Monthly Detention Report - 1 July 2012''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019163115/http://www.addameer.org/etemplate.php?id=496 |date=19 October 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen of them were members of parliament, out of 4,706 prisoners. According to [[B'Tselem]], as of April 2012, about 308 Palestinians were being held under administrative detention by the [[Israel Prisons Service]] (IPS) and statistics on those held by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] were unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention/statistics |title=Statistics on administrative detention |publisher=[[B'Tselem]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606145620/http://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention/statistics |archivedate=June 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IPS figures for December 2012, 178 Palestinians were being held in administrative detention (without charge or trial).&lt;ref name=bbc20130221&gt;{{cite news|title=Many injured in West Bank protests over hunger strikes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21532020|newspaper=BBC|date=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2013, B'Tselem reported that 140 Palestinians were being held under administrative detention by the IPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Administrative_Detention/Statistics.asp |title=Statistics on administrative detention |publisher=[[B'Tselem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan, [[immigration detention]] is a form of administration detention under the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, Act No. 319 of 1951 (ICRRA).

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has maintained many forms of administrative detention over the years. The most recent forms were a series of Acts intended to introduce a form of administrative detention to Northern Ireland under the auspices of the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974]]. This Act allowed the security forces to apprehend and detain persons suspected of terrorist activities without trial for an unlimited period. The introduction of the Act led directly to the creation of internment camps (particularly [[Long Kesh]] (the Maze) and the prison ship [[HMS Maidstone (1937)|HMS ''Maidstone'']] where suspects were detained, some for protracted periods.
The Act of 1974 was amended a number of times during the late 20th and early 21st century, the most recent incarnation being the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] which introduced the concept of the [[control order]], itself a more politically palatable means of limiting the freedom of a suspect without the need to provide a court of law with ''prima facie'' evidence of any wrongdoing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===United States===

{{further|Extrajudicial prisoners of the United States}}

The United States currently uses indefinite detention without trial –  known under various names as internment, [[civil commitment]], preventive detention or administrative detention – to hold people who fall within a few narrow categories, including the mentally ill ([[involuntary commitment]]), and "[[Sexual predator|sexually violent predators]]",&lt;ref name="mariner"&gt;[http://writ.news.findlaw.com/mariner/20020610.html INDEFINITE DETENTION OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS]&lt;/ref&gt; though the right of [[habeas corpus]] still applies, and some determinations regarding mental illness and sexual dangerousness are made by juries.

During [[World War II]], the United States detained over 100,000 [[Japanese American]]s in [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]]; smaller numbers of [[German American internment|German Americans]] and [[Italian American internment|Italian Americans]] were interned.

The United States also utilizes administrative detention as a counter-terrorism measure, and as a means to control illegal immigration. There are approximately 100,000 persons in removal proceedings at any one time,&lt;ref name="ecre" /&gt; and about 31,000 held in detention during these proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_detention_us/incustody_deaths/index.html New York Times Topics:In-Custody Deaths], accessed October 28, 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914160753/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_detention_us/incustody_deaths/index.html |date=September 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Patriot Act]] was passed. The Act expanded the authority of law enforcement agencies to use administrative detention for the stated purpose of fighting [[terrorism]] in the United States and abroad. Under the Act, any person ([[United States nationality law|citizen]] or alien) suspected of terrorist connections may be administratively detained for up to seven days without the benefit of an ''[[habeas corpus]]'' proceeding. The [[Attorney General of the United States]], at his discretion, may extend this seven-day period to six months, and this extension itself may be renewed indefinitely – legally creating the possibility of lifetime imprisonment without ever facing charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lsbM0USTAa8C&amp;pg=PA578 Administrative Law in the Political System, Kenneth F. Warren], Westview Press, 2004, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticisms of the PATRIOT Act is that the Attorney General's decision is not subject to any judicial review, unlike the situation in other democratic countries which have similar administrative detention laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lsbM0USTAa8C&amp;pg=PA578 Administrative Law in the Political System, Kenneth F.

As part of the [[War on Terror]], and particularly during and after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], U.S. forces captured hundreds of terrorists, who were subsequently detained without trial at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. The United States initially refused to grant these detainees [[prisoner of war]] status, holding that they were [[Unlawful combatant|illegal]] [[enemy combatant]]s because they did not meet the requirements set down by the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. Of the 775 detainees incarcerated at Guantanamo, 420 have been released without charge, and only one has been tried and convicted. U.S. authorities claim that they intend to put 60 to 80 more on trial.

==Criticism by human rights groups==
Administrative detention practices have come under severe criticism, with critics claiming that it breaches human rights.
[[Amnesty International]] believes that administrative detention breaches Article 9 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]  (ICCPR) which "makes clear that no-one should be subjected to arbitrary detention and that deprivation of liberty must be based on grounds and procedures established by law". The ICCPR does allow a government, under narrow circumstances, such as a public emergency threatening the life of a nation, to temporarily derogate from its obligation not to engage in arbitrary detention.&lt;ref name="mariner"/&gt;

Amnesty International is also concerned that [[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]] are being "held solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[United Nations]] has created the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] on the issue. One of the issues the group has focused on is the determination whether a detention is arbitrary or not – which is not as clear-cut in the case of administrative detention as it is in the case of criminal arrest. The group has proposed certain guidelines to aid in such determination. For example, it has suggested that any deprivations of liberty that violate the [[freedom of association]] must be deemed arbitrary. Based on these guidelines, the group has condemned countries who have used long-term administrative detention when the detainees were held for the mere fact of belonging to an "illegal organization".&lt;ref name="mariner"/&gt;

Get Liquefied When You’re Dead |author=McClurg, Lesley |publisher=KQED |date=July 24, 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a process for the disposal of human remains using lye and heat. The process is being marketed as an alternative to the traditional options of [[burial]] or cremation.

==Process==
The process is based on [[alkaline hydrolysis]]: the body is placed in a pressure vessel that is then filled with a mixture of water and [[potassium hydroxide|lye]], and heated to a temperature around {{convert|160|C|F}}, but at an elevated pressure, which prevents boiling. Instead, the body is effectively broken down into its chemical components, which takes approximately four to six hours. A lower temperature and pressure may be used, but at a longer duration ({{convert|208|F|C|order=flip}}, 14 to 16 hours).&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; At the beginning of the process, the mixture is strongly basic, with a [[pH]] level of approximately 14; pH drops to 11 by the end, but the final pH level depends on the total operation time and the amount of fat in the body.&lt;ref name=TAMU /&gt;

The end result is a quantity of green-brown tinted liquid (containing [[amino acids]], [[peptides]], [[sugars]] and [[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and soft, porous white bone remains ([[calcium phosphate]]) easily crushed in the hand (although a [[cremulator]] is more commonly used) to form a white-colored dust. The "ash" can then be returned to the [[next of kin]] of the deceased. The liquid is disposed of either through the sanitary sewer system, or through some other method, including use in a garden or green space.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} To dispose of {{convert|1000|lb}}, approximately {{convert|60|–|240|gal}} of water are used, resulting in {{convert|120|–|300|gal}} of effluent, which carries a dried weight of {{convert|20|lb}} (approximately 2% of original weight).&lt;ref name=TAMU /&gt;

Alkaline hydrolysis has also been adopted by the pet and animal industry. A handful of companies in North America offer the procedure as an alternative to pet cremation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New ‘petuary’ liquifies deceased pets, green alternative to cremation |url=http://www.dailynews.com/lifestyle/20140529/new-petuary-liquifies-deceased-pets-green-alternative-to-cremation |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkaline hydrolysis is also used in the agricultural industry to sterilize animal carcasses that may pose a health hazard, because the process inactivates viruses, bacteria, and [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]].&lt;ref name=TAMU&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ssl.tamu.edu/edss/handbook/04_Alkaline.pdf |title=Managing Contaminated Animal and Plant Materials: Field Guide on Best Practices |author= |date= |chapter=Alkaline hydrolysis |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |isbn= |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Efficacy of Alkaline Hydrolysis as an Alternative Method for Treatment and Disposal of Infectious Animal Waste |author1=Kaye, G |author2=Weber, P |author3=Evans, A |author4=Venezia, R |date=May 1998 |journal=Contemp Top Lab Anim Sci |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=43-46 |pmid=12456159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p051f7vn|title=BBC World Service - People Fixing The World, Greener In Death|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process was originally developed as a method to process animal carcasses into plant food, patented by Amos Herbert Hobson in 1888&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/bath-turns-dead-bodies-coffee-colored-water/ |title=The Fight to Legalize a Machine That Melts Flesh From Bone |author=Stockton, Nick |date=10 March 2017 |publisher=Wired |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=394982 |status= |title=Process of separating gelatine from bones |pubdate=25 December 1888 |gdate= |fdate=5 April 1888 |pridate= |inventor=Amos Herbert Hobson |invent1= |invent2= |assign1= |assign2= |class= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChangingJourney /&gt;, in 2007, a Scottish biochemist, Sandy Sullivan, started a company making the machines calling the process (and company) Resomation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/04/lucy-siegle-innovator-sandy-sullivan-resomation|title=The innovator: Sandy Sullivan|last=Siegle|first=Lucy|date=2010-04-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
{{see also|Cremation#Religious views on cremation}}
In [[Christianity|Christian]] countries and cultures, cremation has historically been discouraged, but now in many denominations it is accepted.&lt;ref name="GassmannLarson2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=Günther |last2=Larson|first2=Duane H.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Mark W. |title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Htz8M1Xlqi4C&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |date=4 April 2001|publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810866201|page=48 |quote=Cremation was unheard of from the time Charlemagne outlawed it (784) until the 17th century. At that point, the practice was urged primarily by those opposed to the church, and for a long time cremation was forbidden by Roman Catholicism and practiced only reluctantly by Protestants. Recently, these strictures have eased, and more and more churches have established columbaria or memorial gardens within their precincts for the reception of the ashes by the faithful.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman [[Catholic Church]] permits ordinary [[cremation]] of bodies as long as it is not done in denial of the beliefs in the sacredness of the human body or the resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyscatholic.org/2002/12/catholics-and-cremation-questions-and-answers-from-the-bishops-of-new-york-state/ |title=Catholics and Cremation: Questions and Answers from the Bishops of New York State |date=December 6, 2002 |publisher=New York State Catholic Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When alkaline hydrolysis was proposed in New York state the New York State Catholic Conference condemned the practice, stating that hydrolysis does not show sufficient respect for the teaching of the intrinsic dignity of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/ny-catholic-conference-opposes-chemical-digestion-of-human-remains/ |title=NY Catholic conference opposes 'chemical digestion' of human remains |date=Mar 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public crematorium operated by [[Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council]] at [[Rowley Regis]], central England, was the first to receive [[Planning permission in the United Kingdom|planning permission]] to offer the process but in March 2017 the local water utility, [[Severn Trent Water]], refused the council's application for a "trade effluent permit" because there was no water industry standard regulating the disposal of liquified human remains into sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fears over liquefied remains of the dead|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-42385567|accessdate=18 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Anabel Flores Salazar was a Mexican journalist. She was thirty two years old when she was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and [[murdered]].&lt;ref name=nbcnews2 /&gt; She lived in a house in the mountains of [[Mariano Escobedo, Veracruz|Mariano Escobedo]], which is located in Orizaba, Veracruz.&lt;ref name=proceso2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/429384/pen-mexico-exige-localizacion-de-la-periodista-anabel-flores|title=PEN México exige la localización con vida de la periodista Anabel Flores |date=9 February 2016|publisher=Proceso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salazar's aunt, Sandra Luz Salazar, was with her on the day that she was kidnapped.&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpj.org/2016/02/body-of-missing-veracruz-crime-reporter-anabel-flo.php|title=Body of missing Veracruz crime reporter Anabel Flores Salazar found in neighboring state|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/10/americas/mexico-abducted-journalist-body/index.html|title=Murder in Mexico: Journalist's body discarded on highway|first=Greg Botelho and Annie Ramos|last=CNN|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salazar was married to a previous commander of the Nogales police, Alejandro Báez Juárez.&lt;ref name=expediente&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blog.expediente.mx/nota/17980/portales-de-noticias-de-veracruz/reportera-plagiada-celosa-de-su-periodismo|title=Reportera plagiada, celosa de su periodismo|first=|last=|publisher=BlogExpediente}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the mother of a 2-week-old newborn and a young son when she was kidnapped from her home.&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;

==Career==
Anabel Flores Salazar worked as a [[freelancer|freelance reporter]] for the newspaper ''El Sol de Orizaba'' at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=thedailybeast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/11/thugs-snatch-brave-mexican-journalist-as-she-fed-infant-son.html|title=Thugs Snatch Brave Mexican Journalist as She Fed Infant Son|first=Michael|last=Daly|date=11 February 2016|publisher=thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had worked as a reporter for at least six years prior to her murder.&lt;ref name=expediente /&gt; Before her job at ''El Sol de Orizaba,'' she had also reported for other news outlets such as ''El Mundo de Orizaba'' and ''El Buen Tono''.&lt;ref name=expediente /&gt;&lt;ref name=animalpolitico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2016/02/denuncian-la-desaparicion-de-la-reportera-anabel-flores-salazar-en-veracruz/|title=Hombres armados secuestran a la reportera Anabel Flores Salazar, en Veracruz|publisher=animalpolitico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salazar worked for ''El Buen Tono'' before she began working for ''El Sol de Orizaba''. However, due to her investment in a vehicle that seemed to be out of her price range, Salazar's boss thought she was secretly working with criminals to gain more money. Because of this, she was let go from her job at ''El Buen Tono'' nearly a year before her death.&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt;

In her reports, Salazar investigated local crimes such as vehicle accidents and police duties. In addition, she often wrote about murders, often finding a connection with teenage girl victims and the [[drug cartel]] in the area.&lt;ref name=vice /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt; Due to her investigation of the murders of young females, she coined the term "femicida" in her writing.&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt;

On Monday, February 8, 2016, fifteen days after giving birth to her baby, Anabel Flores Salazar was abducted from her home.&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt; The next day, Tuesday, February 9, 2016, her tied up body was recovered on the side of a road.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; Her corpse was located thirty minutes from her home in Mariano Escobedo, in the state of Puebla alongside the Cuacnopalan-Tehuacan highway.&lt;ref name=proceso1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=borderlandbeat /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt; When she was discovered, her head had been covered by a plastic bag, her pants were around her ankles, and her hands were bound tightly against her back.&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt; The cause of her death was deemed to be [[suffocation]]. Salazar was the third Mexican journalist who had been murdered in 2016.&lt;ref name=nbcnews2 /&gt;

===Investigation===
Salazar's aunt, Sandra Luz Salazar, witnessed eight people that were dressed in dark military fatigues and wielding weapons enter the Salazar household around two in the morning on February 8, 2016. The criminals stated they carried a warrant for the arrest of Anabel Flores Salazar as they aimed their weapons at the family. Salazar was feeding her 2-week-old newborn at the time of their arrival. The people in fatigues forcefully took her from her home, threw her into a large vehicle, and drove away.&lt;ref name=nbcnews2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ibtimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=borderlandbeat /&gt;&lt;ref name=proceso2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt;&lt;ref name=nbcnews1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/gunmen-kidnap-female-reporter-southern-mexico-n514126|title=Gunmen Kidnap Female Reporter in Southern Mexico|publisher=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Salazar's family reported the incident, local police began a search for Salazar, placing [[random checkpoint|clearance zones]] along heavily traveled roads in the area.&lt;ref name=vice /&gt; Her body was found the next day on February 9, 2016.&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

When Mexican authorities learned of Salazar's kidnapping, they opened an investigation regarding her involvement with a local [[drug cartel]].&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; The investigation was started because she had been previously seen at the same restaurant as a leader of the infamous drug gang, [[Los Zetas]].&lt;ref name=nbcnews2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt;&lt;ref name=nbcnews1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpjonduarte&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2016/02/why-the-governor-of-veracruz-should-resign.php|title=Why the governor of Veracruz should resign |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her aunt, Sandra, confirmed that Salazar was only at the restaurant to enjoy a meal with her family and had had no connection with the man.&lt;ref name=ibtimes /&gt;

Two arrests have been made regarding Salazar's murder. The first was the arrest of Gonzalo Paulo "N" which was made in May 2016. The second arrest was of Manuel "N" also known as El Cacharro, a suspected leader of Los Zetas.&lt;ref name=knightcenter1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-17370-second-person-arrested-murder-mexican-journalist-anabel-flores|title=Second person arrested in the murder of Mexican journalist Anabel Flores|publisher=Knight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
It is believed that Salazar's murder is connected to drug cartel violence. The same day that Salazar's body was found, two other bodies were uncovered on a property connected to illegal activities, including drug storage. These bodies were connected to a crime that Salazar had been investigating before she was murdered.&lt;ref name=thedailybeast /&gt; In addition, in the days following Salazar's murder, a newspaper that she had previously worked for, ''El Buen Tono'', was being threatened with arson by alleged members of the drug gang, Los Zetas.&lt;ref name=proceso2 /&gt;

[[Mexico]] is known for its drug related violence which causes it to be very dangerous for journalists. The state of Veracruz is one of the most dangerous.&lt;ref name=ibtimes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexico-Suspected-Killer-of-Veracruz-Journalist-Arrested-20160214-0007.html|title=Mexico: Suspected Killer of Veracruz Journalist Arrested|first=|last=|publisher=telesurtv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several journalists have been murdered and a few have vanished in Veracruz since 2010. Many account these occurrences to the election of [[Javier Duarte de Ochoa|Governor Javier Duarte]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=vice /&gt;&lt;ref name=nbcnews1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpjonduarte /&gt;

==Impact==
Anabel Flores Salazar is only one of several journalists who have been murdered in reaction to his or her job. Veracruz is an exceedingly dangerous area for journalists to live and report in. There have been six murders, seven ongoing investigations of murders, and three missing person reports in the state since 2011. These reports were confirmed to be in retaliation of the victim's journalism career.&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=nbcnews1 /&gt;

Salazar's murder had an impact internationally due to Governor Duarte's false accusations of her involvement with a member of Los Zetas.&lt;ref name=knightcenter1 /&gt; Several organized groups have been vocal in their dismissal of Governor Duarte's condemning of journalists. [[UNESCO]], the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], and several other organizations have issued statements regarding Anabel Flores Salazar's murder.&lt;ref name=knightcenter2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-16685-governor-veracruz-links-man-prison-murder-journalist-anabel-flores|title=Governor of Veracruz links man in prison with the murder of journalist Anabel Flores|publisher=Knight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Irina Bokova]], UNESCO's director-general, said, "I condemn the murder of Anabel Flores Salazar. This crime has deprived people of a voice that nourished informed public debate and contributed to the free flow of information. In the name of justice and in order to promote safer working conditions for journalists, I call on the authorities to investigate this crime and bring its perpetrators to trial."&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt;

A spokesperson for the Committee to Protect Journalists, Carlos Lauría, said, "The administration of Governor Javier Duarte Ochoa has a dismal record of impunity and has been incapable and unwilling to prosecute crimes against the press. We urge federal authorities to take over the investigation into Anabel Flores Salazar's murder, seriously look her journalism as a possible motive, and bring all those responsible to justice."&lt;ref name=nbcnews2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=borderlandbeat /&gt;

The [[European Union]] said, "The Delegation and the Embassies of the Member States of the European Union in Mexico trust that the competent Mexican authorities will carry out an investigation expeditious, transparent and effective to clarify the facts, to identify and to judge the culprits, considering among other reasons those linked to the exercise of their profession."&lt;ref name=eeas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/mexico/documents/news/2016/20160212declaracion_ue_anabel_f_es.pdf|title=European Union local statement on the murder of the reporter Anabel Flores Salazar|publisher=European Union|date=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9013">[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound cleaned.jpg|right|thumb|''Mound 2'' is the only [[Sutton Hoo]] [[tumulus]] to have been reconstructed to its supposed original height.]]
'''Anglo-Saxon burial mounds''' refers to the [[burial mounds]] - also known as barrows or [[Tumulus|tumuli]] - that were produced during the late sixth and seventh centuries CE in [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. Such barrows were "princely burials", being of high status individuals who would have been members of the social elite within their local tribal group. Some of the most prestigious were "chamber burials", containing a richly furnished wooden chamber within the mound, but in others the corpse had simply been buried into the ground and had a mound erected on top.

[[Early Anglo-Saxon burial]] involved both inhumation and cremation, with burials then being deposited in cemeteries. At this time, the Anglo-Saxons adhered to [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|a pagan religion]], but as Christianity was introduced in the seventh century, it gradually became the dominant and eventually sole religion amongst the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Many of those buried in barrows were pagan, but others were instead Christian, and it is usually impossible for archaeologists to know which religion an individual belonged to.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier peoples living in Britain during the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Ages]] had also constructed barrows for use as places of burial, something that was recognised by the Anglo-Saxon burial builders, who in many cases re-used these earlier barrows for their own uses.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Keltengrabhuegel Hochdorf.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A reconstruction of the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave, a large Iron Age burial mound dating from c. 550 BCE in [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany. Although constructed a thousand years before the Anglo-Saxon barrows, there are cultural similarities between the two.]]
Tumulus burials were not restricted to the Anglo-Saxons, but had a long pedigree in prehistoric and early mediaeval Europe. By this latter date, when the Anglo-Saxon society existed, such burials were not restricted to any one cultural or ethnic group, with [[Germanic people|Germanic-speaking]], [[Slavic people|Slavic-speaking]] and [[Celtic people|Celtic-speaking]] peoples of the period all taking part in such a burial practice for elite members of their societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman Iron Age, whilst the construction of barrows had ended in Britain, it had continued in areas of continental Europe free from Roman domination. The [[Hallstatt culture]] which existed in central Europe between c. 750 and 400 BCE utilised chamber burials within barrows as the way of commemorating deceased members of the social elite. The most prominent known Hallstatt example is the [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave]], which dates from c. 550 BCE and which was richly laden with grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the sixth century CE, when the practice of building burial mounds is first adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, it was also being practiced by other Germanic-speaking peoples on continental Europe. In the German region of [[Thuringia]], several important chamber burial barrows have been excavated, including at a cemetery in [[Trossingen]] which dates to c. 580 CE, thereby being contemporary with similar Anglo-Saxon sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly for the development of Anglo-Saxon barrow burials, the practice had been adopted by the [[Merovingian dynasty]] [[Franks]], who lived in what is now France, from the mid fifth century CE. It was from these Merovingian Franks that the Anglo-Saxons likely adopted the practice.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2008. p. 28"&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
The Anglo-Saxon peoples had migrated to Britain during the fifth century CE, settling primarily along the eastern areas of what is now [[England]]. They were adherents of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|a pagan religion]].

Throughout the sixth century, the south-eastern Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of Kent]] developed political ties with the Merovingian kings in Francia, with their respective royal families eventually being sealed through a marriage alliance. It was through this connection that the Kentish Anglo-Saxons adopted the Merovingian practice of burying members of their social elite in large tumuli.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2008. p. 28"/&gt; The importance and influence of the Kentish kingdom across the south of England subsequently led to Anglo-Saxon peoples north of the river [[Thames]] also adopting the practice.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2008. p. 28"/&gt;

==Purpose==
Various archaeologists and historians have discussed why the barrows were built by the Anglo-Saxons and for what purpose. Anglo-Saxon specialist Stephen Pollington noted that they were ways of creating "a permanent mark on the landscape" which allowed them to claim "the territory and the right to hold it".&lt;ref name="Pollington35"&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollington also remarked that "the burial chamber was an idealised portrayal of the 'house of the dead', the last resting place of the deceased into which they would welcome those who sought them out through spirit travel."&lt;ref name="Pollington35"/&gt; Weston Wyly interpreted them as being symbolic of the pregnant belly of the earth, into which the corpse, representing the human seed, was planted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wes07|Weston Wyly 2007]]. pp. 323-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The construction and burial within a burial mound would have been a lengthier process than ordinary Anglo-Saxon inhumation or cremation burials, with funerary rites and preparations having lasted for at least a week. The first step in a barrow burial would have been the removal of a circular area of topsoil, which was then encircled with a ditch where the soil had been dug even deeper.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Martin Carver]] believed that this first stage had a symbolic significance in setting aside an inner and an outer zone between where the burial was going to be built and the outside world around it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car02|Carver 2002]]. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The second step in the process involved a grave cut then being made into the ground, with enough space either for an inhumation burial or for an entire burial chamber to be constructed. In the case of some inhumation burials, a step or platform was cut into one of the ends of the grave so that mourners at the funeral could kneel down and arrange the corpse and their grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases, the grave-cut, or at least its bottom, was sealed with clay prior to the body then being placed into it with their grave goods.&lt;ref name="Pollington30"&gt;[[#Pol08|Pollington 2008]]. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the body then in the grave, a funerary service would have taken place, involving the performance of certain rituals and the eating of a graveside meal.&lt;ref name="Pollington30"/&gt; A covering would then have been placed over the body, which was usually textile but in some cases was instead made up of hazel poles or stakes. In the case of chamber burials, it is at this point that the chamber that the body was in would have been sealed up with a wooden roof.&lt;ref name="Pollington30"/&gt; At this point the grave would have been complete, and the next step would have been to build the earthen mound on top. Some of this would have come from the ring ditch surrounding the barrow, although other soil would have come from the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="Pollington30"/&gt; It is possible that when the mound was finally constructed, a timber post would have been inserted into the top, marking the burial.&lt;ref name="Pollington30"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">[[File:Antiochos Nikator.jpg|thumb|300px| Bactrian coin bearing the legend "Of king Antiochos".]]
'''Antiochus I Nikator of [[Bactria]] ''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀντίοχος Α΄ ὁ Νικάτωρ}}; [[epithet]] means "Victorious") was possibly a Graeco-Bactrian king of the dynasty of [[Diodotus I]], who ruled for some period between 240 - 220 BCE. His existence is controversial.

==A Seleucid king or a Bactrian namesake?==

Several Bactrian coins from the time of Diodotus I are struck with the legend ''"Of King Antiochus",'' though the portraits resemble those of Diodotos I and the reverse is the same as on other Diodotid coins: [[Zeus]] hurling a thunderbolt, with an eagle on the side.

These coins have often been interpreted as semi-independent issues of the first Bactrian king Diodotus I,&lt;ref&gt;Monnaies Gréco-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques, Catalogue Raisonné", Osmund Bopearachchi, 1991, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, {{ISBN|2-7177-1825-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who during the early stages of his liberation from the [[Seleucid]] empire used the name of his former overlord, the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus II]], but used his own portrait.

However, another possibility would be that they were struck by a Bactrian king who himself was called Antiochos. This king might have been a brother or a younger son of Diodotos I, ruling either as a co-regent or after the death of the first Diodotos' successor and son [[Diodotus II]]. Numismatic and circumstantial evidence for this idea was published in 2010 by Jakobsson.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Jakobsson,''Antiochus Nicator, a third king of Hellenistic Bactria?'', Numismatic Chronicle 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient sources are ambiguous: they mention no king between [[Diodotus II]] and [[Euthydemus I]], but do not exclude the possibility.

The later Bactrian king [[Agathocles]] honoured earlier rulers of Bactria on commemorative coins. Some of these honour a king Antiochos similar to the aforementioned series. On these commemorative coins, Antiochos was given the epithet ''"Nikator"'' (Victor). Similar coins were issued for Diodotus I, at the same mints, but the portraits for Antiochus Nikator are never identical to those of Diodotus I. Even if the portraits were not lifelike, this may indicate that Nikator was a separate person, and that the coins are not merely reissues of coins with Diodotus' portrait in the name of Antiochus II.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bop 13A Antiochos Nikator.jpg|thumb|300px| Commemorative coin for Antiochus Nikator, struck by [[Agathocles]] (ca [[185 BCE]]-[[175 BCE]])]] --&gt;

Since this epithet was never used by Antiochus II (who was called ''"Theos"'', (God)), nor by any other Seleucid king named Antiochus, might indicate that Antiochus Nikator was a distinct individual. However, given the practices surrounding the award of epithets to Hellenistic rulers, it may be that Agathocles gave this epithet to one of the various Antiochi in celebration of some victory.

No ancient sources mention him. Until further evidence appears, the question of his existence remains unresolved.

'''Bucky''' is the name used by several different [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as a sidekick to [[Captain America]]. The [[Bucky Barnes|original version]] was created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Captain America|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d March 1941), which was published by Marvel's predecessor, [[Timely Comics]].&lt;ref name="milestone"&gt;The 1995 ''Marvel Milestone Edition: Captain America'' archival reprint has no [[cover date]] or number, and its postal [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] says, "Originally published ... as Captain America #000". Timely's first comic, ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1, likewise had no number on its cover, and was released with two different cover dates.&lt;/ref&gt; The name has been borne by five male characters, the original '''[[Bucky Barnes]]''' as well as '''Fred Davis''', '''[[Jack Monroe (comics)|Jack Monroe]]''', '''[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]''', '''[[Battlestar (comics)|Lemar Hoskins]]''' and two female ones '''Julia Winters''' and '''[[Rikki Barnes]]'''.

==James Buchanan Barnes==
{{Main|Bucky Barnes}}
'''James Buchanan''' "'''Bucky'''" '''Barnes''' was the first individual to use the Bucky alias before being [[comic book death|brought back from supposed death]] as the brain-washed assassin Winter Soldier and later assumed the role of Captain America when Steve Rogers was presumed to be dead.

===Powers and abilities===
Having trained under Steve Rogers (the original Captain America in World War II) and others in the time leading up to World War II, "Bucky" Barnes is a master of hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, as well as being skilled in the use of military weapons such as firearms and grenades. He also used throwing knives on occasion and was a gifted advance scout. His time as the covert Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier helped to further hone his skills, making him the equal to his predecessor in combat skills, and an expert assassin and spy. He is also fluent in many languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Russian, Latin, and Japanese.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He can understand French.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 5, #43. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter Soldier's left arm is a cybernetic prosthetic with superhuman strength and enhanced reaction time. The arm can function when not in contact with Barnes and can discharge bolts of electrical energy from its palm. The arm can discharge an EMP causing electronics to either shut down or become useless. The use of Barnes' EMP is shown when Barnes uses it to shut down a Nick Fury [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] and when he attempts to use it on Iron Man. The arm has a holographic function to disguise it as a flesh and blood arm.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

As Captain America, he possesses the original, indestructible, vibranium alloy shield used by his predecessor, as well as a [[Kevlar]]/[[Nomex]] blend, shock-absorbing costume. He often carries several conventional weapons such as knives, guns - mostly a Colt 1911-A1 .45 and a [[Luger P08 pistol|P08 Luger]] - and grenades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Fred Davis==
'''Fred Davis Jr.''', created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Sal Buscema]], first appeared in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #4 (August 1977). He was the late-World War II and post-war depiction of Bucky.

Within the context of the stories, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] feared the death of Captain America and Bucky, if revealed, would be a blow to morale. He asked [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|William Naslund]] of the [[Crusaders (Marvel Comics)|Crusaders]] to assume the Captain America identity. Naslund was assisted by Fred, a former bat-boy for the [[New York Yankees]] who had posed as Bucky in 1942. Captain America and Bucky finished the rest of the war and continued to fight crime with the [[All-Winners Squad]]. Naslund was killed in 1946, at which time the Captain America identity passed to [[Jeffrey Mace|Jeff Mace]].&lt;ref&gt;''What If'' #4 (August 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Davis assisted Mace until he was shot and wounded in 1948, forcing him to retire with a permanent limp. 

In 1951, Davis joined the secret [[V-Battalion]] organization that hunted [[war crimes|war criminals]], and eventually became one of its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America Comics'' #66 (1948); ''Citizen V and the V-Battalion'' #1–4 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, he was killed by a [[Russia]]n [[sleeper agent]] who wanted to send a message to the original Bucky.&lt;ref&gt;''Winter Soldier'' #6 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powers and abilities===
As Bucky, Davis was trained in hand-to-hand combat and acrobatics. He was also a baseball player.&lt;ref&gt;''A Complete History of American Comic Books'', p 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jack Monroe==
{{Main|Jack Monroe (comics)}}
In 1953, an orphan named '''Jack Monroe''', who idolized Captain America and Bucky, discovered that his history teacher also had a similar passion, to the extent of undergoing plastic surgery to make him look like Steve Rogers and assuming his name as well. In addition, [[Grand Director|"Rogers"]] had discovered, in some old Nazi files stored in a warehouse in [[Germany]], the lost formula for the Super-Soldier serum that had given Captain America his abilities. The two used the serum and began to fight [[Communism|Communists]] as Captain America and Bucky.&lt;ref&gt;''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, "Rogers" and Monroe were unaware of the stabilizing "Vita-Ray" process used on the original Captain America. As a result, despite their bodies being enhanced to peak human efficiency, they slowly grew [[paranoia|paranoid]] and dangerously insane. By the middle of 1954 they were irrationally attacking anyone they perceived to be a Communist. In 1955 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] managed to hunt them down and placed them in suspended animation. The 1950s Captain America and Bucky would be revived years later after the return of Steve Rogers, going on another rampage, and would be defeated by the man they had modeled themselves after.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #153 (Sept. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe was eventually cured of his insanity and took up the superhero identity of [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], an identity that Rogers himself had once taken in the 1970s (when he discarded Cap's mantle as a consequence of the Marvel-version of the [[Watergate Scandal]], engineered by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]), even teaming up with the original Captain America on a number of occasions. At one point during his solo career, Monroe was injured severely enough to need to be placed in stasis once again. He was revived and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] (who was in turn being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]). Monroe was then forced to become the new [[Scourge of the Underworld]] and sent to kill the reformed supervillain team known as the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Monroe eventually broke free of the conditioning, helped the Thunderbolts to defeat Gyrich, and then disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #35-#50, (1999–2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe was last seen reassuming his original Nomad costume. At this time, he had checked in on his former ward he called Bucky, who had since been adopted. Monroe was starting to have delusions again, and started hallucinating; his sanity was again destabilizing, as it had when he first became Bucky. In the same story, Jack Monroe was shot by the Winter Soldier (James Buchanan Barnes, the original Bucky) and dumped in the trunk of a car.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 5, #3 (April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powers and abilities===
Monroe had augmented strength and reflexes superior to that of any Olympic athlete. Monroe has extensive experience in hand-to-hand combat, having received personal tutoring by Captain America. He is also an expert marksman.

==Rick Jones==
{{Main|Rick Jones (comics)}}
Soon after awakening in the modern age, Steve Rogers met Rick Jones. Jones donned the Bucky costume in an attempt to make himself Captain America's partner. However, Rogers was still wracked with guilt over the original Bucky's death, and refused to make this a permanent arrangement. While Jones' time in this identity is short lived and the task of measuring up to the original Bucky was daunting, he profited from it with invaluable training from Rogers.

===Powers and abilities===
During his position as Bucky, Jones received training in combat gymnastics along with hand-to-hand combat by Captain America.

==Lemar Hoskins==
{{Main|Battlestar (comics)}}
As the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|Super-Patriot]], John Walker teamed up with a group known as the Bold Urban Commandos (BUCkies) as a backup team who were sometimes used in staged attacks on the Super-Patriot during his public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #323&lt;/ref&gt; Walker's main partner was African-American '''Lemar Hoskins''' who was allowed to continue to serve as Walker's partner when Walker became Captain America,&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #334&lt;/ref&gt; while the other Buckies, disgruntled after being left out by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], became [[Left-Winger (comics)|Left-Winger]] and [[Right-Winger (comics)|Right-Winger]]. Hoskins used the name and costume of Bucky until he realized the racist connotations of the alias when applied to him (prior to the [[American Civil War]], a male slave was often referred to as a "buck"). He then assumed the name "Battlestar".&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powers and abilities===
Hoskins had superhuman strength, endurance, durability and resilience as a result of the experimental mutagenic process conducted on him by [[Karl Malus]] on behalf of the [[Power Broker#Curtiss Jackson|Power Broker]]. His agility and reflexes are of the order of a superior Olympic athlete. Hoskins is also highly trained in gymnastics and acrobatics. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, and received rigorous training in unarmed combat from the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].

==Rikki Barnes==
{{Main|Rikki Barnes}}
[[Rikki Barnes]] was from an [[Counter-Earth (comics)|alternate Earth]] created by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] in the wake of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] incident. Rikki is still a member of the [[Young Allies]] on Counter-Earth. In the wake of the ''Onslaught Reborn'' series, another version of this character (from an alternate Heroes Reborn universe where the Avengers and Fantastic Four never left) has been transported to the mainstream Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Onslaught Reborn'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; She sought to make contact with the new Captain America (Bucky Barnes) by contacting [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], befriended the Patriot in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America vol. 5'' #600&lt;/ref&gt; In a new miniseries she is assuming the Nomad identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Nomad: Girl Without A World'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powers and abilities===
Rikki is a natural athlete who was trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. and Captain America. She is a gifted fighter, marksman and acrobat with the familiarity with technological devices of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent. As Bucky she wore a bulletproof costume modeled after the original Bucky. She also made use of a vibranium-photonic energy shield along with vibranium soled boots that allowed her to run up walls, move silently, leap greater distances and land from great heights. She also wielded a pistol.

==Julia Winters==
Other persons who have used the Bucky alias include a baby that Nomad looked after for a period (after which she was adopted and given the name '''Julia Winters''').&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' vol. 5, #7 (July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
In the [[DC Comics]]/[[Marvel Comics]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[intercompany crossover]] ''Batman/Captain America'' (Dec. 1996), written and drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and set during [[World War II]], Bucky briefly takes Dick Grayson/[[Robin (comics)|Robin's]] place as [[Batman|Batman's]] sidekick, while Robin becomes Captain America's sidekick. In this [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] (set in one of DC Comics' numerous "[[Elseworlds]]" continuities), Bucky dies (off-page) as he had done in numerous ''Avengers'' and ''Captain America'' recollections.

In the alternate reality of the five-issue ''[[Bullet Points (comics)|Bullet Points]]'' miniseries (Jan.-May 2005), James Barnes never teams up with Steve Rogers as the Super-Soldier program was never activated. However, Rogers volunteers for the 'Iron Man' program and as such, saves Barnes and several fellow soldiers from an advancing tank during the battle of Guadalcanal. Unfortunately he is not swift enough to save Barnes from severe damage to his legs.

In the alternate timeline of the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline, James Buchanan Barnes is one of the United States government agents (alongside [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]]) sent to Genosha to kill Magneto and as many of his followers as possible. Nuke and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes sneaked into Magneto's headquarters;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: [[House of M]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and though he fatally stabs Professor Xavier, Bucky was killed by Magneto.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: House of M'' #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second issue of the crossover miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'', a zombified Winter Soldier appears and attempts to devour [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]. This version of the Winter Soldier is ultimately killed by [[Ash Williams]], who shoots his head off with his "[[shotgun|boomstick]]", even having shot off his bionic arm.

The [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Bucky Barnes is an adult sidekick of [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). This version is Steve Rogers' childhood friend who accompanies on missions as an [[War photography|Army press photographer]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultimates]] #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving the war and believing Captain America's death, Bucky eventually marries Gail Richards and has a large extended family. During which, Bucky is diagnosed as having [[lung cancer]] from [[chain smoking]] back in the War. Barnes and Gail both live to see Steve's revival in the 21st century and renews their friendship. After America was taken by the Liberators, Bucky is captured at a cemetery with Steve and remains unseen.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultimates 2]]'' #9. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both he and Gail are seen being taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. protective custody after it is discovered that the [[Red Skull]] is Steve's and Gail's illegitimate son.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] [[Marvel MAX]] series ''[[War Machine#U.S. War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Bucky was serving in the present as [[Captain America]], as the Captain had died in his stead in World War II. Bucky was accompanied here by two assistants, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], neither wearing a costume and both addressed by their real names.

In the 2005 ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' event, the Captain America story, set during the American Civil War, featured Steve Rogers' commanding officer, Colonel Buck Barnes, whom the men called "Bucky". His mercenary tendencies led to Rogers' desertion, and when he later intervened in Rogers' transformation into Captain America, his face was destroyed, turning him into an undead being known as the White Skull.

In ''Ruins'', which is set in a dystopian alternate future, Bucky is taken into custody alongside Victor Creed and others for several heinous crimes, including cannibalism.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

An alternate-universe Bucky appears in the 2011 miniseries ''Captain America Corps''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/117/1175095p1.html |title=''Captain America Corps'' #1 Exclusive Preview|date= June 9, 2011 | first=Joey| last= Esposito|publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Bucky named Steve Wilson-Bradley appears in an alternate timeline seen in ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]''. This Bucky is the son of [[Elijah Bradley]] and Samantha Wilson (the daughter of the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Children's Crusade: Young Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a world where all the Marvel characters are small children depicted in ''A-Babies vs. X-Babies'', Bucky is Steve's teddy bear, named Bucky Bear. He is stolen by Scott Summers, igniting an enormous battle between the baby Avengers and the baby X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''A-Babies vs. X-Babies'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teenaged Bucky appears as a member of the Battleworld [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] during the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marvel Announces Runaways - A New Secret Wars Series|first=Jamie|last=Lovett|date=27 February 2015|work=ComicBook.com|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/02/27/marvel-announces-runaways---a-new-secret-wars-series/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cecil Roberts Blackbeard''' (1900 – 19 April 1954), was a South African male [[tennis]] player who represented South Africa in the [[Davis Cup]] and the [[Olympic Games]]. He competed in the [[Tennis at the 1920 Summer Olympics – Men's doubles|doubles event]] at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. With compatriot [[George Dodd (tennis)|George Dodd]] he reached the quarterfinal round after victories over [[Alfred Beamish]] and [[Francis Lowe (tennis player)|Francis Lowe]] in the first round, followed by a win over [[Jean-Pierre Samazeuilh]] and [[Daniel Lawton]] in the second. In the quarterfinal they were defeated in four sets by [[Max Decugis]] and [[Pierre Albarran]].&lt;ref name=sportsreference&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/bl/cecil-blackbeard-1.html |title=Olympic Sports – Athletes – Cecil Blackbeard |work=sports-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackbeard participated in the [[1920 Wimbledon Championships]] playing in all three events (singles, doubles, mixed). In the singles event he made it to the quarterfinal round after victories over Yasin Mohamed, Ambrose Dudley, his doubles partner [[George Dodd (tennis)|George Dodd]] and  Frank Jarvis. In the quarterfinal he lost in four sets to [[Chuck Garland]]. With countryman George Dodd he also reached the quarterfinal of the doubles event in which [[Algernon Kingscote]] and Cecil Parke proved too strong. He was less successful in the mixed doubles, reaching the second round with [[D.K. Betty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimbledon players archive – Cecil Blackbeard|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/draws/archive/players/146a711f-b09a-47a0-b70f-d71d26f4d3aa/index.html|publisher=AELTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 1920, he reached the final of the doubles event at the [[World Hard Court Championships]], played at the [[Stade Français]] in Paris. With his teammate [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Mi%C8%99u_(tennis) Nicolae Mişu] they were defeated in the final by the French pair [[André Gobert]] and [[William Laurentz]] in straight sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les Sports – Lawn-tennis|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k489346s/f3.zoom.langFR|newspaper=Journal des débats politiques et littéraires|date=31 May 1920|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1926, Blackbeard reached the final of the singles event at the [[South African Open (tennis)|South African Championships]] which he lost in three straight sets to countryman [[Jack Condon]]. At the same championships he won the doubles title in 1923 with his brother, D. Blackbeard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawn Tennis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10228">[[Image:SABG MEFs.jpg|thumb|(Upper) Primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) before senescence. Spindle-shaped.&lt;br&gt;(Lower) MEFs became senescent after passages. Cells grow larger, flatten shape and expressed senescence-associated [[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]] (SABG, blue areas), a marker of cellular senescence.]]

'''Cellular senescence''' is one phenomenon by which normal [[cell (biology)|cells]] cease to [[cell division|divide]]. In their seminal experiments from the early 1960's, [[Leonard Hayflick]] and Paul Moorhead found out that normal human fetal fibroblasts in culture reach a maximum of approximately 50 cell population doublings before becoming senescent.&lt;ref name="Cell 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collado|first1=M|last2=Blasco|first2=MA|last3=Serrano|first3=M|title=Cellular senescence in cancer and aging|journal=Cell|date=27 July 2007|volume=130|issue=2|pages=223–233|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.003|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayat|first1=M|title=Tumor dormancy, quiescence, and senescence, Volume 2: Aging, cancer, and noncancer pathologies|date=2014|publisher=Springer|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tollefsbol|first1=T|title=Epigenetics of Aging|date=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-0638-0|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is known as "replicative senescence", or the [[Hayflick limit]]. Hayflick's discovery that normal cells are mortal overturned a 60-year-old dogma in cell biology that maintained that all cultured cells are immortal. Hayflick found that the only immortal cultured cells are cancer cells.&lt;ref name=Shay2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shay|first1=JW|last2=Wright|first2=WE|title=Hayflick, his limit, and cellular ageing.|journal=Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology|date=October 2000|volume=1|issue=1|pages=72–6|doi=10.1038/35036093|pmid=11413492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular mechanisms==
Mechanistically, replicative senescence is triggered by a [[DNA damage]] response which results from the shortening of [[telomere]]s during each cellular division process. Cells can also be induced to senesce independent of the number of cellular divisions via DNA damage in response to elevated [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), activation of [[oncogene]]s and cell-[[cell fusion]]. The number of senescent cells in tissues rises substantially during normal aging.&lt;ref name="pmid26646499" /&gt;

Although senescent cells can no longer replicate, they remain metabolically active and commonly adopt an immunogenic [[phenotype]] consisting of a pro-inflammatory secretome, the up-regulation of immune [[ligand]]s, a pro-survival response, promiscuous gene expression (pGE) and stain positive for [[Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase|senescence-associated β-galactosidase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campisi|first=Judith|title=Aging, Cellular Senescence, and Cancer|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|date=February 2013|volume=75|pages=685–705|doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-030212-183653|pmid=23140366|pmc=4166529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, along with [[p16|p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4A&lt;/sup&gt;]], is regarded to be a [[biomarker]] of [[Senescence#Cellular senescence|cellular senescence]]. This results in false positives for maturing tissue [[macrophage]]s and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase as well as for [[T-cell]]s p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4A&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="pmid26646499"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Childs BG, Durik M, Baker DJ, van Deursen JM | title=Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy | journal= [[Nature Medicine]] | volume=21 | issue=12 | pages=1424–1435 | year=2015 | doi= 10.1038/nm.4000 | pmc = 4748967 | id= | pmid=26646499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] response (DDR) arrests cell cycle progression until damages, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs), are repaired.

=== Role of telomeres ===
Lately, the role of [[Telomere|telomeres]] in cellular senescence has aroused general interest, especially with a view to the possible genetically adverse effects of [[cloning]]. The successive shortening of the [[Chromosome|chromosomal]] telomeres with each [[cell cycle]] is also believed to limit the number of divisions of the cell, thus contributing to aging. There have, on the other hand, also been reports that cloning could alter the shortening of telomeres. Some cells do not age and are, therefore, described as being "[[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]]". It is theorized by some that when it is discovered exactly what allows these cells, whether it be the result of telomere lengthening or not, to divide without limit that it will be possible to genetically alter other cells to have the same capability. 

The length of the telomere strand has senescent effects; telomere shortening activates extensive alterations in alternative RNA splicing that produce senescent toxins such as [[progerin]], which degrades the tissue and makes it more prone to failure.&lt;ref name="pmid21670498"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Collins FS, etal|date=13 June 2011|title=Progerin and telomere dysfunction collaborate to trigger cellular senescence in normal human fibroblasts|journal=J Clin Invest|volume=121|issue=7|pages=2833–44|doi=10.1172/JCI43578|pmc=3223819|pmid=21670498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of senescent cells==
A Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) consisting of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s, [[growth factor]]s, and [[protease]]s is another characteristic feature of senescent cells.&lt;ref name="pmid27235851"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Malaquin N, Martinez A, Rodier F | title=Keeping the senescence secretome under control: Molecular reins on the senescence-associated secretory phenotype | journal= EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY | volume=82 |  pages=39–49 | year=2016 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2016.05.010 | id= | pmid=27235851}}&lt;/ref&gt; SASP is associated with many age-related diseases, including [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] and [[atherosclerosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid26646499" /&gt; This has motivated researchers to develop [[senolytic]] drugs to kill and/or eliminate senescent cells in an effort to improve health in the elderly.&lt;ref name="pmid26646499" /&gt; Whether or not this approach will prove effective is debatable.

The nucleus of senescent cells is characterized by senescence-associated [[heterochromatin]] foci (SAHF) and [[DNA-SCARS|DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence]] (DNA-SCARS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodier|first1=F.|last2=Campisi|first2=J.|title=Four faces of cellular senescence|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=14 February 2011|volume=192|issue=4|pages=547–556|doi=10.1083/jcb.201009094|pmid=21321098|pmc=3044123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senescent cells affect tumour suppression, wound healing and possibly embryonic/placental development, and play a pathological role in age-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=Dominick G. A.|last2=Krizhanovsky|first2=Valery|title=Physiological and pathological consequences of cellular senescence|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|date=31 July 2014|volume=71|issue=22|pages=4373–4386|doi=10.1007/s00018-014-1691-3|pmid=25080110|pmc=4207941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisms lacking senescence==
Cellular senescence is not observed in some organisms, including [[perennial]] plants, [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[lobster]]s. In those species where cellular senescence is observed, cells eventually become post-[[mitotic]] when they can no longer replicate themselves through the process of [[mitosis|cellular mitosis]]; i.e., cells experience ''replicative senescence''. How and why some cells become post-mitotic in some species has been the subject of much research and speculation, but it has been suggested that cellular senescence evolved as a way to prevent the onset and spread of [[cancer]]. [[Somatic cell]]s that have divided many times will have accumulated [[DNA]] [[mutation]]s and would therefore be in danger of becoming [[cancer]]ous if cell division continued. As such, it is becoming apparent that senescent cells undergo conversion to an immunogenic phenotype that enables them to be eliminated by the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burton | last2 = Faragher | year = 2015 | title = Cellular senescence: from growth arrest to immunogenic conversion | url = | journal = AGE | volume = 37| issue = | page = | doi = 10.1007/s11357-015-9764-2|pmid= 25787341|pmc=4365077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chingiz Mustafayev''' ({{lang-az|Çingiz Fuad oğlu Mustafayev}}; August 29, 1960 &amp;ndash; June 15, 1992) was one of the most notable independent [[Azerbaijan]]i journalists, who was posthumously bestowed by state order as [[National Hero of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://az.timeturk.com/cingiz-mustafayev-kimdir-991-haberi.html Çingiz Mustafayev kimdir?] {{Az icon}}  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830225236/http://az.timeturk.com/cingiz-mustafayev-kimdir-991-haberi.html |date=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafayev, with no formal background or degree in journalism save for a year of on the job training, created a video [[anthology]] during the early stages of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], most of the documentary had to be shot from the frontline which ultimately was the cause of his abrupt death due to mortar wounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memorium.cjes.ru/?pid=4&amp;id=5571 Чингиз Мустафаев - человек и пароход.

==Biography==
He was the man behind the video camera, who filmed scenes of atrocity in the [[Khojaly Massacre]] of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irfs.org/news-feed/azerbaijani-mark-anniversary-of-journalist-chingiz-mustafayev/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.az/books?id=TaZzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=chingiz+mustafayev+journalist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V-Lklk5qbN&amp;sig=8p5aECwjr46Q62pqdpytS94fgCg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMsL3g_OvRAhUCtxQKHeszDPk4ChDoAQg4MAo#v=onepage&amp;q=chingiz%20mustafayev%20journalist&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In order to document the massacre, Mustafayev traveled via an army helicopter which at most time came under heavy enemy fire&lt;ref&gt;Сергей Таранов. Нагорный Карабах: Солдаты и офицеры армии СНГ воюют по обе стороны конфликта // Известия: газета. — 4 марта 1992. — № 54 (23628). — С. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;. He was able to film that which gave evidence to the massacre which showed hundreds of dead bodies strewn across snow-covered fields of Khojaly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.cjes.ru/online/?a=con&amp;b_id=25&amp;c_id=428 Романов Ю. «Я снимаю войну…»] {{ru icon}}  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804094806/http://www.library.cjes.ru/online/?a=con&amp;b_id=25&amp;c_id=428 |date=2012-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film at times were coupled with commentaries by a sobbing and emotional Mustafayev as he described the carnage he had seen as he filmed.

Azerbaijani's official press tried to cover up the fact that the town had been wiped out{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} by Armenian forces. [[Human Rights Watch]] and the Russian [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] society attributed the carnage to  Armenian forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/HOJALY/Chapter1.htm#_VPID_5 Memorial about Khojaly]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/WR93/Hsw-07.htm HRW about Khojaly]&lt;blockquote&gt;The most notorious of these attacks occurred on February 25 in the village of Khojaly. A large column of residents, accompanied by a few dozen retreating fighters, fled the city as it fell to Armenian forces. As they approached the border with Azerbaijan, they came across an Armenian military post and were cruelly fired upon. At least 161 civilians are known to have been murdered in this incident, although Azerbaijani officials estimate that about 800 perished. Armenian forces killed unarmed civilians and soldiers who were hors de combat, and looted and sometimes burned homes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his brother Vahid Mustafayev, during the span of eight months Mustafayev had shot and is credited for about 18 documentaries about the war in [[Karabakh]], leaving behind substantial historical documentation.

==Death==

On 15 June 1992, Mustafayev while filming an exchange of fire between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces near the village of Nakhichevanik was felled by mortar fire &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/in_depth/newsid_4673000/4673955.stm bbc.co.uk:Главы из русского издания книги "Черный сад"] {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his brother Vahid Mustafayev, he was fatally wounded when a shell exploded right beside him and shrapnel from the shell severed one of his major arteries. By the time Mustafayev was airlifted to the hospital, he had died of blood loss. His last moments were captured on his own camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/73_folder/73_articles/73_chingiz.html Chingiz Mustafayev in Action by Vahid Mustafayev]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Mustafayev family is described as the typical Azerbaijani family. His father was in the military and was working on missiles and rockets in the [[USSR]]. His mother hailed from the city of [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]]; Married when she was 19, Chingiz was the oldest child, born in 1960 and he had two brothers, [[Seyfulla Mustafayev]], born in 1962, and [[Vahid Mustafayev]], born in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai134_folder/134_articles/134_mustafayev.html Our Own Voices, Our Own Minds:Stalin Crushes Would-Be Student Activists]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''crab-eating macaque''' (''Macaca fascicularis''), also known as the '''long-tailed macaque''', is a [[cercopithecinae|cercopithecine]] primate native to [[Southeast Asia]]. It is referred to as the '''cynomolgus monkey''' in laboratories.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; It has a long history alongside humans;&lt;ref name="Gumert, MD, Fuentes A, Jones-Engel, L. 2011" /&gt; they have been alternately seen as agricultural pests,&lt;ref name="Long, 2003" /&gt; sacred animals in some temples,&lt;ref name="Island of the Monkey God" /&gt; and more recently, the subject of medical experiments.&lt;ref name="Gumert, MD, Fuentes A, Jones-Engel, L. 2011" /&gt; The crab-eating macaque lives in matrilineal social groups with a female dominance hierarchy,&lt;ref name="van Noordwijk, Maria, Carcel van Schaik, 1999" /&gt; and male members leave the group when they reach puberty.&lt;ref name="de Ruiter, Jan, Eli Geffen, 1998" /&gt; They are opportunistic omnivores&lt;ref name=ADW /&gt;  and have been documented using tools to obtain food in Thailand and Myanmar.&lt;ref name="Gumert, Kluck, Malaivijitnond, 2009" /&gt; The crab-eating macaque is a known invasive species and a threat to biodiversity in several locations, including Hong Kong and western New Guinea.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; The significant overlap in macaque and human living space has resulted in greater habitat loss,&lt;ref name="Gumert, MD, Fuentes A, Jones-Engel, L. 2011" /&gt; [[Synanthrope|synanthropic living]], and inter- and intraspecies conflicts over resources.

==Etymology==
''Macaca'' comes from the Portuguese word ''macaco'', which was derived from ''makaku'', a [[Fiot]] ([[West Africa]]n language) word (''kaku'' means monkey in Fiot).&lt;ref name="Language Log"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmer|first=Benjamin|title=Makaku, macaco, macaque, macaca|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003458.html|work=Language Log|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific epithet  ''fascicularis'' is Latin for a small band or stripe. [[Stamford Raffles|Sir Thomas Raffles]], who gave the animal its scientific name in 1821, did not specify what he meant by the use of this word.

In Indonesia and Malaysia, ''M. fascicularis'' and other macaque species are known generically as ''kera'', possibly because of their high-pitched cries.&lt;ref name=Raffles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raffles|first=Thomas Stamford|title=Descriptive Catalogue of a Zoological Collection, made on account of the Honourable East India Company, in the Island of Sumatra and its Vicinity, under the Direction of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Lieutenant-Governor of Fort Marlborough|journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London|year=1821|volume=13|issue=1|pages=246–247|url=http://biostor.org/reference/129523|accessdate=26 September 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1821.tb00064.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crab-eating macaque has several common names. It is often referred to as the long-tailed macaque due to its tail, which is often longer than its body.&lt;ref name="Primate Factsheets"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cawthon Lang|first=Kristina|title=Primate Factsheets: Long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) Taxonomy, Morphology, &amp; Ecology|url=http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/long-tailed_macaque|work=Primate Info Net|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name crab-eating macaque refers to its being often seen foraging [[beach]]es for crabs. Another common name for ''M. fascicularis'' is the cynomolgus monkey, from the name of a race of humans with long hair and handsome beards who used dogs for hunting according to [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who seemingly derived the etymology of the word ''cynomolgus'' from the Greek κύων, cyon: dog (Gen. cyno-s) and the verb ἀμέλγειν, amelgein: to milk (Adj. amolg-os), by claiming that they milked female dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes of Byzantium, Tῶν Ἀριστοτέλους περί ζώων ἐπιτομή. ΑΠΑΝΤΑ Ι, 2.59. ΚΑΚΤΟΣ 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This name is commonly used in laboratory settings.

In Thailand, the species is called "ลิงแสม" (''Ling s̄æm''; lit: "Mangrove monkeys") because it lives and forages in [[mangrove forest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oknation.nationtv.tv/blog/justicedal2kland/2013/02/15/entry-2|work=Oknation|language=Thai|date=2013-02-15|accessdate=2017-06-07|author=DL|title=ลิงแสมในป่าชายเลนที่เราต้องเจอ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
The body length of the adult, which varies among subspecies, is {{convert|38|–|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} with relatively short arms and legs. Males are considerably larger than females, weighing {{convert|5|–|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|3|–|6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of females.&lt;ref name="Primate Factsheets" /&gt; The tail is longer than the body, typically {{convert|40|–|65|cm|in|abbr=on}}, which is used for balance when they jump distances up to {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Primate Factsheets" /&gt; The upper parts of the body are dark brown with light golden brown tips. The under parts are light grey with a dark grey/brown tail. Crab-eating macaques have backwards-directed crown hairs which sometimes form short crests on the midline. Their skin is black on their feet and ears, whereas the skin on the muzzle is a light grayish pink color. The eyelids often have prominent white markings and sometimes there are white spots on the ears. Males have a characteristic mustache and cheek [[whisker]]s, while females have only cheek whiskers. Crab-eating macaques have a cheek pouch which they use to store food while foraging. Females show no perineal swelling.&lt;ref name="ISSG Database" /&gt;

==Behavior==

===Group living===
[[Image:Monkey batu.jpg|thumb|Crab-eating macaque baring its teeth - often an indication of aggression]]
[[Image:Long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) juvenile.jpg|thumb|Juvenile crab-eating macaque in [[Borneo]]]]
[[Image:Long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) juvenile 2.jpg|thumb|Juvenile crab-eating macaque in Borneo]]

Macaques live in [[social group]]s that contain three to 20 females, their offspring, and one or many males. The groups usually have fewer males than females. In social groups of macaques, a clear [[dominance hierarchy]] is seen among females. These ranks remain stable throughout the female’s lifetime and also can be sustained through generations of [[matrilinearity|matrilines]]. Females have their highest birth rates around 10 years of age and completely stop bearing young by age 24.&lt;ref name="van Noordwijk, Maria, Carcel van Schaik, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van Noordwijk, M. |author2=van Schaik, C. | title = The Effects of Dominance Rank and Group Size on Female Lifetime Reproductive Success in Wild Long-tailed Macaques, Macaca fascicularis |date=1999 | journal = Primates | volume = 40 |issue=1 | pages = 105–130 | doi=10.1007/bf02557705|pmid=23179535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social groups of macaques are female-bonded, meaning the males will disperse at the time of [[Sexual maturity|puberty]]. Thus, group [[relatedness]] on average appears to be lower than compared to [[matrilinearity|matrilines.]]  More difference in relatedness occurs when comparing high-ranking lineages to lower ranking lineages, with higher-ranking individuals being more closely related to one another. Additionally, groups of dispersing males born into the same social groups display a range of relatedness, at times appearing to be brothers, while at other times appearing to be unrelated.&lt;ref name="de Ruiter, Jan, Eli Geffen, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=de Ruiter, Jan |author2=Eli Geffen | title = Relatedness of matrilines, dispersing males and social groups in long-tailed macaques (''Macaca fascicularis'') |date=1998 | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]| volume = 265 |issue=1391 | pages = 79–87 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0267 | pmid=9474793 | pmc=1688868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the matrilineal dominance hierarchy, male dominance rankings also exist.  [[Alpha (ethology)|Alpha males]] have a higher frequency of mating compared to their lower-ranking conspecifics. The increased success is due partially to his increased access to females and also due to female preference of an alpha male during periods of maximum [[fertility]]. Though females have a preference for alpha males, they do display [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] behavior. Through this behavior, females risk helping to rear a nonalpha offspring, yet benefit in two specific ways, both in regard to [[aggression|aggressive]] behavior. First, a decreased value is placed on one single [[copulation]]. Moreover, the risk of [[infanticide]] is decreased due to the uncertainty of paternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=de Ruiter, Jan |author2=Jan van Hooff |author-link2=Jan van Hooff

Increasing group size leads to increased competition and energy spent trying to [[Foraging|forage]] for resources, and in particular, food. Further, social tensions build and the prevalence of tension-reducing interactions like [[social grooming]] fall with larger groups. Thus, group living appears to be maintained solely due to the safety against [[predation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schaik, Carel | author2 = Maria Noordwijk | author3 = Rob Boer | author4 = Isolde Tonkelaar | last-author-amp = yes | title = The effect of group size on time budgets and social behavior in wild long-tailed macaques |date=1983 | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 173–181 | doi=10.1007/bf00299920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict===
Group living in all species is dependent on tolerance of other group members. In crab-eating macaques, successful social group living maintains postconflict resolution must occur. Usually, less dominant individuals lose to a higher-ranking individual when conflict arises. After the conflict has taken place, lower-ranking individuals tend to fear the winner of the conflict to a greater degree. In one study, this was seen by the ability to drink water together. Postconflict observations showed a staggered time between when the dominant individual begins to drink and the subordinate. Long-term studies reveal the gap in drinking time closes as the conflict moves further into the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cords, Marina | title = Post-conflict reunions and reconciliation in long-tailed macaques |date=1992 | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 44 | pages = 57–61 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80754-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grooming and support in conflict among [[primate]]s is considered to be an act of [[reciprocal altruism]]. In crab-eating macaques, an experiment was performed in which individuals were given the opportunity to groom one another under three conditions: after being groomed by the other, after grooming the other, and without prior grooming. After a grooming took place, the individual that received the grooming was much more likely to support its groomer than one that had not previously groomed that individual. These results support the reciprocal altruism theory of grooming in long-tailed macaques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hemelrijk, Charlotte | title = Support for being groomed in long-tailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis |date=1994 | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 479–481 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crab-eating macaques demonstrate two of the three forms of suggested postconflict behavior. In both captive and wild studies, the monkeys demonstrated reconciliation, or an affiliative interaction between former opponents, and redirection, or acting aggressively towards a third individual. Consolation was not seen in any study performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aureli, Filippo | title = Post-conflict behaviour among wild long-tailed macaques, (''Macaca fascicularis'') |date=June 1992 | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 329–337 | doi=10.1007/bf00177773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postconflict [[anxiety]] has been reported in crab-eating macaques that have acted as the aggressor. After a conflict within a group, the aggressor appears to scratch itself at a higher rate than before the conflict. Though the scratching behavior cannot definitely be termed as an anxious behavior, evidence suggests this is the case. An aggressor’s scratching decreases significantly after reconciliation. This suggests reconciliation rather than a property of the conflict is the cause of reduction in scratching behavior. Though these results seem counterintuitive, the anxiety of the aggressor appears to have a basis in the risks of ruining [[Cooperation|cooperative]] relationships with the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Das, Marjolijn |author2=Zsuzsa Penke |author3=Jan van Hoof  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Potconflict Affiliation and Stress-Related Behavior of Long-Tailed Macaque Aggressors | year = 1998 | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 19 | pages = 53–71 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020354826422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kin altruism and spite===
In a study, a group of crab-eating macaques was given ownership of a food object. Unsurprisingly, adult females favored their own offspring by passively, yet preferentially, allowing them to feed on the objects they held. When juveniles were in possession of an object, mothers robbed them and acted aggressively at an increased rate towards their own offspring compared to other juveniles. These observations suggest close proximity influences behavior in ownership, as a mother’s kin are closer to her on average. When given a nonfood object and two owners, one being a kin and one not, the rival will choose the older individual to attack regardless of [[kinship]]. Though the hypothesis remains that mother-juvenile relationships may facilitate social learning of ownership, the combined results clearly point to aggression towards the least-threatening individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kummer, Hans  |author2=Marina Cords | title = Cues of ownership in long-tailed macaques, ''Macaca fasciculari''s |date=1991 | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 42 |issue=4 | pages = 529–549 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80238-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted in which food was given to 11 females. They were then given a choice to share the food with kin or nonkin. The kin altruism hypothesis suggests the mothers would preferentially give food to their own offspring. Yet eight of the 11 females did not discriminate between kin and nonkin. The remaining three did, in fact, give more food to their kin. The results suggest it was not [[kin selection]], but instead [[spite]] that fueled feeding kin preferentially. This is due to the observation that food was given to kin for a significantly longer period of time than needed. The benefit to the mother is decreased due to less food availability for herself and the cost remains great for nonkin due to not receiving food. If these results are correct, crab-eating macaques are unique in the animal kingdom, as they appear not only to behave according to the kin selection theory, but also act spiteful toward one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schaub, Hanspeter | title = Testing Kin Altruism in Long-Tailed Macaques (''Macaca fascicularis'') in a Food-sharing Experiment | year = 1996 | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 445–467 | doi=10.1007/bf02736631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:A Macaca fascicularis hand helping a Macaca fascicularis baby in Bali, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|Adult crab-eating macaque with a baby]]

After a [[gestation]] period of 162–193 days, the female gives birth to one infant. The infant's weight at birth is about {{convert|320|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ADW&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonadio|first=C. |date=2000 |title=''Macaca fascicularis'' |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Macaca_fascicularis.html|work=Animal Diversity Web|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are born with black fur which will begin to turn to a yellow-green, grey-green, or reddish-brown shade (depending on the subspecies) after about three months of age.&lt;ref name="Primate Factsheets" /&gt; This [[wikt:natal|natal]] coat may indicate to others the status of the infant, and other group members treat infants with care and rush to their defense when distressed. Immigrant males sometimes [[infanticide (zoology)|kill infants not their own]], and high-ranking females sometimes [[kidnap]] the infants of lower-ranking females. These kidnappings usually result in the death of the infants, as the other female is usually not [[lactation|lactating]]. A young juvenile stays mainly with its mother and relatives. As male juveniles get older, they become more peripheral to the group. Here they play together, forming crucial bonds that may help them when they leave their natal group. Males that [[emigrate]] with a partner are more successful than those that leave alone. Young females, though, stay with the group and become incorporated into the matriline into which they were born.&lt;ref name=Behavior&gt;{{cite web|last=Cawthon Lang|first=Kristina|title=Primate Factsheets: Long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) Behavior|url=http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/long-tailed_macaque/behav&gt;|work=Primate Info Net|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
[[File:Macaca fascicularis.jpg|thumb|A crab-eating macaque]]

Despite their name, crab-eating macaques typically do not consume [[crab]]s as their main food source; rather, they are opportunistic [[omnivore]]s, eating a variety of animals and plants. Although fruits and seeds make up 60 - 90% of their diet, they also eat leaves, flowers, roots, and bark.&lt;ref name=ADW /&gt; They sometimes prey on vertebrates (including bird chicks, nesting female birds, lizards, frogs, and fish), invertebrates, and bird eggs. In Indonesia, the species has become a proficient swimmer and diver for crabs and other crustaceans in mangrove swamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/biodiversity/loe/page_289.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828032238/http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/biodiversity/loe/page_289.htm |archivedate=2013-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in [[Bukit Timah]], [[Singapore]] recorded a diet consisting of 44% fruit, 27% animal matter, 15% flowers and other plant matter, and 14% food provided by humans.&lt;ref name=gardens&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore Supplement No. 3|chapter-url=http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/dna/docs/fb6050e4ee025362a43a216afd6af802.pdf|accessdate=2015-08-14|chapter=Long-tailed Macaques|pages=107–112|author=Lucas, P.W.|publisher=Singapore Botanic Gardens: National Parks Board|issn=0374-7859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This species exhibits particularly low tolerance for swallowing seeds. Despite their inability to digest seeds, many primates of similar size swallow large seeds, up to {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and simply defecate them whole. The crab-eating macaque, though, spits seeds out if they are larger than {{convert|3|–|4|mm|in|abbr=on}}. This decision to spit seeds is thought to be adaptive; it avoids filling the monkey’s stomach with wasteful bulky seeds that cannot be used for energy.&lt;ref name=Seeds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corlett|first=R.T.|author2=P.W.

Although the species is ecologically well-adapted and poses no threat to population stability of prey species in its native range, in areas where the crab-eating macaque is not native, it can pose a substantial threat to [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Wild Facts"&gt;{{cite web|last=Richer|first=Nathan|title=Wild Facts|url=http://www.wild-facts.com/tag/crab-eating-macaque/|work=Wild Fact #834 – The Perfect Gift – Crab-Eating Macaque|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe the crab-eating macaque is responsible for the extinction of forest birds by threatening critical breeding areas &lt;ref name="Introduced Species"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hazan|first=Tracy|title=Introduced Species Summary Project|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/cerc/danoff-burg/invasion_bio/inv_spp_summ/Macaca_fascicularis.htm|work=Crab-eating Macaque (''Macaca fascicularis'')|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as eating the eggs and chicks of endangered forest birds.&lt;ref name="ISSG Database"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Steve|title=Global Invasive Species Database|url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=139&amp;fr=1&amp;sts=&amp;lang=EN|work=''Macaca fascicularis'' (mammal)|publisher=Invasive Species Specialist Group|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crab-eating macaque can become a [[synanthrope]], living off human resources. They are known to feed in cultivated fields on young dry rice, cassava leaves, rubber fruit, taro plants, coconuts, mangos, and other crops, often causing significant losses to local farmers.&lt;ref name="Long, 2003" /&gt; In villages, towns, and cities, they frequently take food from garbage cans and refuse piles.&lt;ref name="Long, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=John|title=Introduced Mammals of the World: Their History, Distribution, and Influence|year=2003|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|location=Australia|isbn=978-0643067141|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7YC3cYhGMOcC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=crab-eating+macaque+pest#v=snippet&amp;q=crab-eating%20macaque%20pest&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species can become unafraid of humans in these conditions, which can lead to macaques directly taking food from people, both passively and aggressively.

===Tool use===
[[File:Macaca fascicularis aurea stone tools - journal.pone.0072872.g002.png|thumb|Stone tool usage by crab-eating macaques in [[Laem Son National Park]] in Thailand]]

In Thailand and Myanmar, crab-eating macaques [[Tool use by animals|use stone tools]] to open nuts, oysters and other bivalves, and various types of [[sea snail]]s ([[nerite]]s, [[muricid]]s, [[trochid]]s, etc.) along the Andaman sea coast and offshore islands.&lt;ref name="Gumert, Kluck, Malaivijitnond, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumert|first=MD|author2=Kluck, M. |author3=Malaivijitnond, S. |title=The physical characteristics and usage patterns of stone axe and pounding hammers used by long-tailed macaques in the Andaman Sea region of Thailand|journal=American Journal of Primatology|year=2009|volume=71|pages=594–608|doi=10.1002/ajp.20694|pmid=19405083|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of tool use is washing and rubbing foods such as sweet potatoes, [[cassava]] roots, and [[papaya]] leaves before consumption. Crab-eating macaques either soak these foods in water or rub them through their hands as if to clean them. They also peel the sweet potatoes, using their [[incisor]]s and canine teeth. Adolescents appear to acquire these behaviors by [[observational learning]] of older individuals.&lt;ref name=Wheatley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheatley|first=Bruce|title=Cultural behavior and extractive foraging in ''Macaca Fascicularis''|journal=Current Anthropology|date=1988 |volume=29|issue=3|pages=516–519|doi=10.1086/203670|jstor=2743474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The crab-eating macaque lives in a wide variety of habitats, including primary lowland [[rainforest]]s, disturbed and secondary rainforests, shrubland, and riverine and coastal forests of [[nipa palm]] and [[mangrove]]. They also easily adjust to human settlements; they are considered sacred at some Hindu temples and on some small islands,&lt;ref name="Island of the Monkey God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Island of the Monkey God|url=http://www.offthefence.com/detail/island-of-the-monkey-god/1093564/|work=Off the Fence|accessdate=2013-09-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928024123/http://www.offthefence.com/detail/island-of-the-monkey-god/1093564/|archivedate=2013-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are pests around farms and villages. Typically, they prefer disturbed habitats and forest periphery. The native range of this species includes most of mainland [[Southeast Asia]], from extreme southeastern [[Bangladesh]] south through [[Malaysia]], and the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] islands of [[Sumatra]], [[Java (island)|Java]], and [[Borneo]], offshore islands, the islands of the [[Philippines]], and the [[Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]].

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:Monkey with a Ventolin inhaler.jpg|thumb|A crab-eating macaque living in a human vicinity, with a stolen [[asthma inhaler]]]]

Crab-eating macaques extensively overlap with humans across their range in Southeast Asia. Consequently, they live together in many locations. Some of these areas are associated with religious sites and local customs, such as the temples of [[Bali, Indonesia|Bali]] in Indonesia, [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]], while other areas are characterized by conflict as a result of habitat loss and competition over food and space.&lt;ref name="Gumert, MD, Fuentes A, Jones-Engel, L. 2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gumert, MD|author2=Fuentes A|author3=Jones-Engel, L.|title=Monkeys on the Edge: Ecology and Management of Long-tailed Macaques and their Interface with Humans|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and crab-eating macaques have shared environments since prehistoric times, and both tend to frequent forest and river edge habitats. Crab-eating macaques are occasionally used as a food source for some indigenous forest-dwelling peoples. In Mauritius, they are captured and sold to the pharmaceutical industry, and in Angaur and Palau, they are sold as pets.&lt;ref name="ISSG Database" /&gt; Macaques feed on [[sugarcane]] and other crops, affecting agriculture and livelihoods, and can be aggressive towards humans. Macaques may carry potentially fatal human diseases, including [[herpes B virus]].&lt;ref name="ISSG Database" /&gt;

===In scientific research===
''M. fascicularis'' is also used extensively in medical experiments, in particular those connected with [[neuroscience]] and disease. Due to their close physiology, they can share infections with humans. Some cases of concern have been an isolated event of ''[[Reston ebolavirus]]'' found in a captive-bred population shipped to the US from the Philippines, which was later found to be a strain of Ebola that has no known pathological consequences in humans, unlike the African strains.&lt;ref name="Gumert, MD, Fuentes A, Jones-Engel, L. 2011"/&gt; Furthermore, they are a known carrier of [[monkey B virus]] (''Herpesvirus simiae''), a virus which has produced disease in some lab workers working mainly with rhesus macaques (''M. mulatta'').&lt;ref name="Gumert, MD, Fuentes A, Jones-Engel, L. 2011"/&gt;  [[Nafovanny]], the largest facility for the captive breeding of nonhuman primates in the world, houses 30,000 macaques .{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The crab-eating macaque is one of the [[monkeys in space|species]] used as space test flight animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi]]'', which causes [[malaria]] in ''M. fascicularis'', can also infect humans. A few cases have been documented in humans, but for how long humans have been getting infections of this malarial strain is unknown. It is, therefore, not possible to assess if this is a newly emerging health threat, or if just newly discovered due to improved malarial detection techniques.&lt;ref name="Gumert, MD, Fuentes A, Jones-Engel, L. 2011"/&gt; Given the long history of humans and macaques living together in Southeast Asia, it is likely the latter.

The use of crab-eating macaques and other nonhuman primates in experimentation is controversial with critics charging that the experiments are cruel, unnecessary and lead to dubious findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linzy|first1=Andrew|last2=Linzy|first2=Clair|title=Normalising the Unthinkable: The Ethics of Using Animals in Research|date=2015|publisher=Working group of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics|url=http://www.oxfordanimalethics.com/2015/03/press-release-centres-report-ethics-animal-experiments/|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well known examples of experiments on crab-eating macaques is the 1981 [[Silver Spring monkeys]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blum|first1=Deborah|title=The Monkey Wars|date=13 October 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195094121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crab-eating macaque has the third-largest range of any primate species, behind only humans and [[rhesus macaque]]s. The [[IUCN]] Red List categorizes the species as [[Least Concern]], and [[CITES]] lists them as Appendix II ("not necessarily threatened with extinction", in which trade must be controlled to avoid use incompatible with their survival). A recent review of their populations suggests a need for better monitoring of populations due to increased wild trade and rising levels of human-macaque conflict, which are reducing overall population levels despite the species being widely distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eudey|first=Ardith|title=The crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) widespread and rapidly declining.|journal=Primate Conservation|year=2008|volume=23|pages=129–132|doi=10.1896/052.023.0115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each subspecies faces differing levels of threats, and too little information is available on some subspecies to assess their conditions. The ''M. f. umbrosa'' subspecies is likely of important biological significance and has been recommended as a candidate for protection in the [[Nicobar Islands]], where its small, native population has been seriously fragmented,&lt;ref name="Umpathy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Umapathy|first=G. |author2=Singh M. |author3=Mohnot, S.M.|title=Status and Distribution of Macaca fascicularis umbrosa in the Nicobar Islands, India|journal=International Journal of Primatology|year=2003|volume=24|issue=2 |pages=281–293|doi=10.1023/A:1023045132009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; The Philippine long-tailed macaque (''M. f. philippensis'') is listed as near threatened, and ''M. f. condorensis'' is vulnerable.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;  All other subspecies are listed as data deficient and need further study;&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; although recent work is showing ''M. f. aurea'' and ''M. f. karimondjawae'' need increased protection.&lt;ref name="Umpathy"/&gt;  One concern for conservation is, in areas where ''M. fascicularis'' is not native, their populations need to be monitored and managed to reduce their impact on native flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Umpathy"/&gt;

On 24 January 2018, scientists in China reported in the journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' the creation of two crab-eating macaque [[Clone (cell biology)|clone]]s, named ''[[Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua]]'', using the [[Nuclear transfer|complex DNA transfer method]] that produced [[Dolly (sheep)|''Dolly'' the sheep]].&lt;ref name="CELL-20180124"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liu, Zhen et al. |title=Cloning of Macaque Monkeys by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer |url=http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30057-6 |date=24 January 2018 |journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |volume=172 |issue=4 |pages=881–887.e7 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.020 |pmid=29395327 |accessdate=24 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20180124"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Normile |first=Dennis |title=These monkey twins are the first primate clones made by the method that developed Dolly |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/these-monkey-twins-are-first-primate-clones-made-method-developed-dolly |date=24 January 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.aa1066 |accessdate=24 January 2018 |doi-broken-date=2018-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20180124"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyranoski |first=David |title=First monkeys cloned with technique that made Dolly the sheep - Chinese scientists create cloned primates that could revolutionize studies of human disease. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01027-z |date=24 January 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=553 |issue=7689 |pages=387–388 |accessdate=24 January 2018 |bibcode=2018Natur.553..387C |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-01027-z |pmid=29368720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20180124"&gt;{{cite news |last=Briggs |first=Helen |title=First monkey clones created in Chinese laboratory |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42809445 |date=24 January 2018 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180124"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Scientists Successfully Clone Monkeys; Are Humans Up Next? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/01/24/science/ap-us-sci-cloned-monkeys.html |date=24 January 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua the first primates to be cloned using the [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] method.

'''Emasculation''' of a human male is to deprive (a man) of his male role or identity.

The word also has other meanings which are more commonly used. See below.

==Genital modification and mutilation==
:''For removal of the penis alone, see [[penis removal]].
:''For removal of the testicles alone, see [[castration]].

===In history===
;Europe
In [[Medieval Europe]], emasculation was used as a form of punishment. It was sometimes done when a person was [[hanged, drawn, and quartered]] (a form of execution by [[torture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;China
In ancient [[China]], emasculation was performed as a punishment up until the [[Sui Dynasty]] and [[Tang Dynasty]]. Additionally, some men underwent the procedure as means of becoming employed as an imperial servant or bureaucrat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XuX-MGTZnJoC&amp;pg=PA248 |title=Encyclopedia of birth control|author=Vern L. Bullough|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=|isbn=1-57607-181-2|page=248|pages=|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9bBJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA235 |title=The journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 39, Part 1|author=American Medical Association|year=1902|publisher=American Medical Association Press|location=|isbn=|page=235|pages=|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fz8I3INERwsC&amp;pg=PA71 |title=Rome and China: comparative perspectives on ancient world empires|author=Walter Scheidel|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|location=|isbn=0-19-533690-9|page=71|pages=|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IZmZNiq7gCoC&amp;pg=PA254 |title=The healing hand: man and wound in the ancient world|author=Guido Majno|year=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|isbn=0-674-38331-1|page=254|pages=|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the word [[eunuch]] is generally used to refer to these Chinese people who underwent emasculation, and they are often referred to as having been "castrated" rather than "emasculated". As of the [[Qing Dynasty]], emasculation was still performed in China. In the 19th century, the rebel [[Yaqub Beg]] and all of his sons and grandsons were punished by being emasculated and enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yjg1AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan |title=Translations of the Peking Gazette|year=1880|publisher=|location=|page=83|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan |title=The American annual cyclopedia and register of important events of the year ..., Volume 4|year=1888|publisher=D.

;Vietnam
The ancient [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] adopted China's practice of emasculation and the use of eunuchs as servants and slaves for the monarchy. The procedure was reportedly very painful as both the testicles and penis were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa |url=http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/2131549871/70/ |newspaper=Viet Bao |date=October 5, 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, the Emperor of Vietnam made a law that said only adult men of high social standing could be emasculated. In the end, most eunuchs ended up being men who had been born with genital abnormalities and then handed over to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Andaya (2006), p. 177  {{Google books|tClCMl7hswQC|The Flaming Womb: Repositioning Women in Early Modern Southeast Asia|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodside (1971), p. 66 {{Google books|0LgSI9UQNpwC|Vietnam and the Chinese Model: A Comparative Study of Nguyen and Ch'ing Civil Government in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th century, the French used the existence of eunuchs in Vietnam to degrade the Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns (2006), p. 1  {{Google books|oJFrN5tRlCgC|Aching for Beauty: Footbinding in China|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on emasculation in Vietnam, see [[Castration#Vietnam]].

;Khitan
The [[Khitan people]] of northeast Asia adopted the Chinese practice of emasculating slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLNrqn4WLZYC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en |title= Peterson(2000), 259 |publisher= Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Russia
In 19th century [[Russia]], the [[Skoptsy]] sect of [[Christianity]] performed emasculation, which they termed the "greater seal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Skoptsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Middle East and Africa
In the [[Arab slave trade]], enslaved men and boys from [[East Africa]] were often "castrated" by removing both the penis and testicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery in the Arab World|series=Companions to Asian Studies|author=Murray Gordon|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date=1989|isbn=9780941533300|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the modern day===
In The [[Indian Subcontinent]], some members of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called ''nirwaan'' and seen as a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, S. "Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India (in Herdt, G. (1996) Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History. Zone Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], males in the [[Nullo (body modification)|Nullo]] subculture voluntarily undergo emasculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/i-still-unload-this-man-is-a-nullo-who-removed-his-1645409616|title=&amp;quot;I Still Unload&amp;quot;: This Man Is a &amp;quot;Nullo&amp;quot; Who Removed His Penis and Balls|first=Simon|last=Davis|work=Gawker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Bible===
In the [[Old Testament]]:

''“No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the LORD.''
:~ [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 23:1 ([[ESV]])
:("''shall not enter the assembly of the Lord''," Explained by the Rabbis to mean that he cannot marry a daughter of Israel)&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulhan Arukh]], ''Eben ha-Ezer'' 5:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben Maimon |first=M.|author-link=Maimonides |title= Guide for the Perplexed |publisher= Dover Publishers |translator=Michael Friedländer |volume= |edition=2nd |date=1956|location=New York |pages=379 |language=English |url= |doi= |id= |isbn= |jfm= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other meanings==
{{Wiktionarypar|emasculation}}

By extension, the word ''emasculation'' has also come to mean rendering a male less [[masculine]], including by humiliation. It can also mean to deprive anything of vigour or effectiveness. This figurative usage has become more common than the literal meaning. For example: "[[William Lewis Hughes]] voted for Folkestone’s amendment to Curwen’s emasculated reform [[bill (law)|bill]], 12 June 1809..."&lt;ref&gt;Thorne R. (1986) [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/hughes-william-lewis-1767-1852 History of Parliament online]. Accessed 12 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[horticulture]], the removal of male (pollen) parts of a plant, largely for controlled pollination and breeding purposes, is also called emasculation.&lt;ref&gt;Hedhly A. et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423808003750 Flower emasculation accelerates ovule degeneration and reduces fruit set in sweet cherry].

F International was founded in 1962 when successful female entrepreneurs and freelance working were rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Becoming a Metapreneur | author=Lessem, Ronnie | journal=Journal of General Management | volume=11 | number=4 | pages=5–21 | year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Case Study: Growth and Change at F International | author=Symons, Rosemary | booktitle=Businesswoman | pages=142–150 | year=1987 | publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Evans |first1=Pam |year=  |editor1-last= Davidson  |editor1-first= Marilyn J.  |editor2-last= Cooper |editor2-first= Cary L.  |title= Women Homeworkers and Information Technology - The F International Experience |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages= 227–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Shirley]] started the company despite having no capital or business experience, to escape the constraints of working as a woman in a predominantly male working context:&lt;ref name="Let IT go"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Let IT Go: The Memoirs of Dame Stephanie Shirley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ciy6BAAAQBAJ|publisher = Andrews UK Limited|date = 2014-06-10|isbn = 9781782341536|first = Dame Stephanie|last = Shirley|first2 = Richard|last2 = Askwith}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|loc 923}}

The total revenues for the first 10-month tax year were £1,700.&lt;ref name="HCase01" /&gt;

The [[Cranfield School of Management]] undertook a study of the reported differences between male and female [[entrepreneur]]s in the late 1980s, concluding that because of the differences in context and background for men and women, the principal factor for successful women [[entrepreneur]]s was the nature of market entry.&lt;ref name="Birley01"&gt;{{cite journal | last       = Birley | first      = Sue | date       = 1988 | title      = Female Entrepreneurs - are they really any different? | url        = https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1826/439/SWP0587.pdf?sequence=2 | journal    = Cranfield School of Management Working Papers | volume     = SWP 5/87 | issue      =  | pages      =  | doi        =  | access-date = 2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; F International is an early example: business and industry were short of computer-skilled people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Software Technology in the 1990s | author = Balzer, Robert and Green, Cordell | journal = Computer | number = 11 | pages = 39–45 | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nature of much software and systems work was, even at that time, amenable to [[homeworking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Failed technology futures: pitfalls and lessons from a historical survey | author = Geels, Frank W and Smit, Wim A  | journal = Futures | year = 2000 | page = 875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company, then known as "[[Freelance Programmers]]", was registered on 13 May 1964 and a "panel" of [[freelance]] software and systems specialists, almost exclusively female, began to work for the company. An early assignment came from [[Urwick Diebold]] and this attracted attention from the media.&lt;ref name="Computer women"&gt;{{citation|year=1964|title=Computer women|publisher=The Guardian, 31st January}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early days were difficult; at one point [[Kit Grindley]], a recent acquaintance at Urwick Diebold, wrote Steve a cheque for £500 to cover operating costs and payments to the workforce.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1166}} Once over the early [[cash flow]] problems the business began to grow. By 1966, there were about 75 regular freelance workers on the panel,&lt;ref name="HCase01" /&gt; some of whom became significant role players as technical experts and project managers&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1762}}.  Seriously problematic projects were rare, but one in particular, with [[Castrol]], forced the management team to focus on [[quality management]].&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1226}} Quality management became one of the foundations of the operating model for the company.&lt;ref name="QM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, F., "Change-Related Behaviour and Information Systems", OMEGA, Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 369-381, Sep-Oct 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start, in the 1960s, there were no accessible [[data communication]]s services and no [[Internet]], but in the 1970s the business attracted interest from [[academic]]s and [[futurist]]s as an example of what became known as [[teleworking]] or [[telecommuting]].&lt;ref name="futures01"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Geels | first1 = Frank W  | last2 = Smit | first2 = Wim A | journal = Futures | year = 2000 | title = Failed technology futures: pitfalls and lessons from a historical survey  | pages = 875}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harvard Business School]] documented the F International business in a number of case studies.&lt;ref name="HCase01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Franklin, Diane | year = 1986 | title = F International | publisher = Harvard Business School | id = Case numbers: 486-118, 486-119 and 486-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HCase02"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zuboff | first1 = Shoshana  | last2 = Delong | first2 = David  | date = 1989-09-01 | title = Steve Shirley  | publisher = Harvard Business School | id = Case number: 490004-PDF-ENG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business was the subject of several other international academic studies of homeworking. &lt;ref name="Thomas01"&gt; {{cite report | first1 = Neil | last1 = Thomas | first2 = Connie  | last2 = Conner | title=At home in the office - A Guide for the Homeworker | publisher=Office for Research in High Technology Education, College of Education, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN | date=December 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh01"&gt;{{cite thesis | type = Masters | first = Joseph P | last = Cavanaugh | date = December 1991 | title = The Social and Behavioral Impacts of Information Systems in the Automated Office: A Literature Review | publisher = Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
In the 1970s the company's development paralleled the emergence of [[feminist]] thinking and the consequent awareness and pre-occupation with [[gender equality]]; together these led to legislation in the [[United Kingdom]] that was intended to bring equal rights to women but had unexpected consequences;  F International was specifically offering employment ''to women'', and therefore they had to adjust their policies to be ''gender-independent''.&lt;ref name="SexAct"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/65 | title = Sex Discrimination Act 1975 | last   = UK Government | date  = 1975 | website  = The National Archives | access-date= 2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I felt strongly that my “female” approach, which had attracted such scorn in the business’s early years, had been vindicated, and it irked me that the state, in addition to its other meddlings, had now declared that approach illegal. Still, there was no point in quarrelling with the law, especially such a well-intentioned one. At a board meeting ... we amended our personnel policy again. Our purpose was now to provide employment for “people with dependants unable to work in a conventional environment.|source=[[Steve Shirley|Dame Stephanie Shirley]].&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1897}}}}

Despite these issues, the business continued to grow until the 1970s, when it encountered difficulties for at least two reasons: the business reported its first financial loss (of £3,815) and suffered its first significant personnel loss, when Pamela Woodman resigned to form [[Pamela Woodman Associates]], working in direct competition to Freelance Programmers.&lt;ref name="HCase01" /&gt; However, by the end of the decade, [[revenue]] had risen to £2.5m and there was a partnership with Heights Information Technology Services Inc in the [[USA]], F International ApS in [[Copenhagen]], servicing [[Scandinavia]], and F International BV in [[Amsterdam]], servicing the [[Benelux]] countries;&lt;ref name = "FI2"&gt;FI newsletter, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; At home, still in the 1970s, spin-off businesses were re-absorbed into the parent business which was re-established in 1974 as "F International".&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1838}}

By 1980 the business had developed country-wide coverage with more than 600 staff.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 2342}} The administrative headquarters for the [[UK]] were then based in [[Chesham]], [[Buckinghamshire]], where the original organisation, Freelance Programmers had been founded. 

F International was a founder member of the [[Computing Services Association]], and was active in the [[British Computer Society]] and the [[Institute for Data Processing Management]] (IDPM)&lt;ref name="FI1"&gt;F International Group hand-out for clients, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the early 1980s that a wider general interest in home working with telecommunications support became evident, a phenomenon that later known as [[teleworking]] or [[telecommuting]].&lt;ref name="Huws01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Huws, Ursula | year = January 1991 | title = Telework: Projections | journal = Futures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later history===

As the 1990s opened, the company made several strategic acquisitions, for example [[AMP Computer Recruitment]] in 1990 and the [[Kernel Group]] in 1991, with the objective of providing clients with staffing and training services. In 1997, [[IIS Infotech Limited]], an Indian computer services company based in [[New Delhi]] was acquired, joined in 1999 by a small [[London]]-based project management and IT consultancy group and in 2000 by Druid, a [[Reading]]-based software consultancy.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 3773}}

In March 2001, now  a substantial and international business with over 6,000 employees, a market capitalisation of £1.2bn and projected sales for the coming year of £515m, the company announced that it was going to change its name to [[Xansa plc]].&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 3926}}

==Philosophy and method of working==

The founding idea at F International was to provide meaningful home-based employment for young mothers with software skills, and later (when challenged by the legislation on sex discrimination) for “people with dependents unable to work in a conventional environment". &lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 1897}} 

Although for the first decade the F International workforce communicated successfully on a daily basis, using the United Kingdom overnight first class mail service, home working became increasingly interesting and increasingly accepted as telecommunications services became available. The F International story attracted extensive public and professional interest, for example in [[Tomorrow%27s World]] (a long-running BBC science and technology programme), and books by [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  Steve herself continued to write and speak about the business model and the benefits for the workforce.&lt;ref name="Telematics01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Shirley, Steve | year = 1985 | pages = 165-168 | title = F international: A unique approach to computer consulting | journal = Telematics and Informatics Volume 2, Issue 2 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/S0736-5853(85)80010-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book "The Third Wave"&lt;ref name="Toffler01" /&gt; [[Alvin Toffler]] included a Chapter on "The Electronic Cottage" wherein he quotes from a 1971 report by the Institute for the Future suggesting a range of occupations that could be undertaken from home, and mentioning F International as one example. Toffler wrote (quoting from the IFF report):

{{quote| ... many of the present duties of the secretary "''could be done from home as well as in the office. Such a system would increase the labor pool by allowing married secretaries caring for small children at home to continue to work ... there may be no overriding reason why a secretary could not just as well, in many instances, take dictation at home and type the text on a home terminal which produces a clean text at the author's home or office.''" In addition, IFF continued, "''Many of the tasks performed by engineers, draftsmen, and other white-collar employees might be done from home as readily as, or sometimes more readily than, from the office.' One "seed of the future" exists already in Britain, for example, where a company called F. International Ltd. (the "F" stands for Freelance) employs 400 part-time computer programmers, all but a handful of whom work in their own homes. The company, which organizes teams of programmers for industry, has expanded to Holland and Scandinavia and counts among its clients such giants as British Steel, Shell, and Unilever.'' |source=[[Alvin Toffler]]. &lt;ref name="Toffler01" /&gt;{{rp|215}}}}

In a book concerning adapting to change in the world of work (and surviving) [[Michel Syrett]] summarised some of the particulars of working with F International: 

{{quote| Around 71 per cent of staff work from home — ideal for married women, and for a slowly growing number of men who likewise appreciate being able to care for children, or maybe start their own business. Hours are from a minimum of 20 a week when a project is underway ... contact with head office and the five regional sales offices is through project managers and staffing co-ordinators. In essence the company uses the skills of women who have opted out of the everyday labour market after having had at least four years work experience with computers. |source=[[Michel Syrett]] &lt;ref name="Syrett01" /&gt;{{rp|24-25}}}}

More recently Steve Shirley has observed that the F International way of working presaged many features of the [[gig economy]]:  flexibility, variable remuneration for different modes of working, and a high level of self-reliance. Comments from [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] (in a television programme marking his retirement from the London School of Economics) support this idea.  When he addressed the question: 'Has Britain got a future?', he said: 

{{quote| Some answers may be found in Party Manifestos. But the real changes are to be found where people live and work. F International has several characteristics which make it a model. It allows people to organise their own lives; it decentralises management decisions; it makes effective use of modern technology — and of course, it is successful.  |source= Dahrendorf on Britain, BBC1, January 1983 &lt;ref name="Kinsman01" /&gt;{{rp|55}}}}

==Working standards==

As well as a Quality Manual &lt;ref name="QM" /&gt; there were ten other management manuals dealing with: [[quality policy]], [[project management]], [[estimating]], and technical standards for general work, [[consulting]] work, [[systems design]], [[software documentation]], [[software testing]] and [[configuration management]]. The commitment gained from individuals who took direct responsibility for their own work, working by themselves at home, led to significant productivity gains of more than 40% when compared to conventional software and systems businesses. This was underpinned by the early focus on estimating and costing projects accurately in advance; there were sound systems in place to monitor progress, costs and quality.&lt;ref name="Let IT go" /&gt;{{rp|loc 4129}}

==Innovation and outreach==

Some aspects of the company's technical work on standards and methods were published in technical journals and presented at international conferences. Senior technical staff and management contributed to technical journals and conferences concerning issues such as management  
&lt;ref name="Shirley01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Shirley, Steve | author2 = Collins, E G | year = 1986| title = A company without offices| journal = Harvard Business Review January-February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Shirley02"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Shirley, Steve | year = 1987| title = The distributed office| journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|503-514}} measurement techniques &lt;ref name="Meth01"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bytheway, Andy | year = June 1980 | title = On the proper treatment of measurement data | journal = Computer Performance }}&lt;/ref&gt; methods of [[systems analysis]] 
&lt;ref name="Meth02"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bytheway, Andy | author2 = Morris, Gill | year = 1983 | title = Structured Systems Analysis - from ideas to practice | journal = Proc Pergamon Infotech Conference }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Meth04"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bytheway, Andy | year = 1985 | title = Structured Methods - an analysis | journal = Proc IBM Computer Users Conference }}&lt;/ref&gt;, maintenance,

&lt;ref name="Meth06"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bytheway, Andy | year = September 1987| title = An open season on Standards| journal = Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper by Calow on maintenance is particularly interesting, because it explains how a strategy was devised to manage the maintenance of legacy systems, freeing mainline systems development staff to undertake productive work and significantly reducing the frequency of bugs and systems failures; this was a key feature of the F International strategy at the time.

'''Frederick Laurence Schaffner''' (August 18, 1855 &amp;ndash; May 22, 1935) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] physician and politician.

Born in [[Williamstown, Nova Scotia|Williamstown]], [[Nova Scotia]], the son of William C. Schaffner and A.

==Life==
His ''[[Nisba (onomastics)|nisbah]]'' (al-Maghribī) and the name Maṣāl suggest a [[Berbers|Berber]] origin. He was born in the town of Lukk in the [[Cyrenaica]].{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}} From his father, he learned [[falconry]] and [[veterinary science]], which enabled him to assume a military post in the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] capital [[Cairo]].{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}} Details of his military career are not known, but by 1144/45 he had risen to the point where he was entrusted with the leadership of the government by Caliph [[al-Hafiz]]. He was not given the title of [[vizier]], however, which had been vacant since the ouster of [[Ridwan ibn Walakhshi]] in 1139, but instead was titled "supervisor of affairs" (''nāẓir fi’l-umūr'') and "supervisor of the public interests" (''nāẓir fi ’l-maṣāliḥ'').{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}}{{sfn|Daftary|1992|p=249}}

When al-Hafiz died in October 1149, his 16-year-old son [[al-Zafir]] succeeded him.{{sfn|Bianquis|2002|p=382}} Al-Zafir, who was more interested in the pleasures of the court than exercising governance, appointed Ibn Masal, despite the latter's advanced age, as his vizier.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}} Ibn Masal received the customary titles of the Fatimid viziers, ''al-Sayyid al-ʿAjal'' ("most noble master"), ''Amīr al-Juyūsh'' ("commander of the armies"), and ''al-Mufaḍḍal'' ("the preferred one") or ''al-Afḍal'' ("most superior one").{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}} He was quickly successful in calming the quarrels between the Turkish cavalry (''Rayḥānī'') and the black military slaves by distributing money and promising to take care of their future welfare.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}}{{sfn|Bianquis|2002|p=382}}

He was soon after confronted with the rebellion of the governor of [[Alexandria]], [[Ibn al-Sallar]], who had entertained hopes of becoming vizier himself. Following the appointment of Ibn Masal, together with his stepson [[Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh|Abbas]], Ibn al-Sallar marched on Cairo to seize the vizierate. When al-Zafir learned of Ibn Sallar's intentions, he called upon assistance from the grandees of the realm in support of Ibn Masal, but they proved unwilling to.{{sfn|Al-Imad|2015}} In the end, the Caliph provided Ibn Masal with funds to raise an army for action against Ibn al-Sallar. Ibn Masal assembled a force of [[Lawata]] Berbers, of blacks, of [[Bedouin]] Arabs and of native Egyptians, but despite a first success in the field, he was soon forced to leave Cairo in December 1149 for Upper Egypt, to recruit more men, while Ibn al-Sallar took over the city.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}}{{sfn|Bianquis|2002|p=382}}{{sfn|Al-Imad|2015}} Ibn al-Sallar sent his stepson Abbas with an army against Ibn Masal and his ally, Badr ibn Rafi, who had tried unsuccessfully to rally resistance among the Arab tribes of the [[Nile Delta]]. The two armies met in battle at Dalas in the province of [[al-Bahnasa]] on 19 February 1150, in which Ibn Masal was defeated and killed. Abbas brought his severed head back to Cairo as a token of victory.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}}{{sfn|Bianquis|2002|p=382}}

His vizierate had lasted only about 50 days.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}} This was the last time a Fatimid caliph would exercise that right, as with Ibn al-Sallar's coup the vizierate became the object of fierce contest between rival strongmen, and the last Fatimid caliphs were reduced to mere figureheads.{{sfn|Canard|1971|p=868}}{{sfn|Daftary|1992|pp=249ff.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8104">'''Ja'far ibn Fallah''' or '''ibn Falah''' was a [[Berbers|Berber]] general of the [[Kutama]] tribe in the service of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=138}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=318}} He led the first Fatimid attempt to conquer [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] in 970–971, but his attack on [[Byzantine]]-held [[Antioch]] was repulsed, and he lost his life in June 971 fighting against the [[Qarmatians]].

== Biography ==
In summer 969, the troops of the [[Fatimids]] of [[Ifriqiya]], under the command of [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]], conquered [[Egypt]] from its [[Ikhshidid]] rulers. The only resistance was offered by the regiments of the Ikhshidid army barricaded on the island of [[Rawdah Island]] near the capital of [[Fustat]], but the [[Nile]] was low and the Fatimids' Kutama troops quickly crossed it and massacred the Ikhshidid troops.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=297–304}} At the same time, further north, the [[Byzantine Empire]] seized [[Antioch]]. Seized with the spirit of ''[[jihad]]'' and aiming to legitimize their rule, the Fatimids used the Byzantine advance on Antioch and the "[[infidel]]" threat as a major item in their propaganda aimed towards the newly conquered region, along with promises to restore just government.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=295–308}}

Jawhar therefore sent Ja'far ibn Fallah, who had distinguished himself before Fustat, to invade [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where the remnants of the Ikhshidids were holding out.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=318}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=311–312}} Ibn Fallah defeated and captured the Ikhshidid governor [[al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj]] and took [[Ramla]] on 24 May 970. He then moved against [[Tiberias]], held by the ''[[ghulam]]'' Fatik and his [[Banu Uqayl]] [[Bedouin]] allies. Fatik was killed through treachery, while Ibn Fallah used other Bedouin, the [[Banu Murra]] and the [[Banu Fazara]], to drive the Uqayl north towards [[Homs]]. At the news of these events, the Ikhshidid-appointed governor of [[Damascus]], Shamul, surrendered himself to the Fatimids.{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=312}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=336–337}} The Damascenes however resolved to resist and set up a governor of their own under the [[Abbasid]] Ibn Abi Ya'la and a certain Muhammad ibn Asuda, after Ibn Fallah's Kutama soldiers mistreated and robbed a delegation of leading citizens. The Damascene militia drove off the first detachments of the Fatimid army that appeared before the city walls, but as soon as Ibn Fallah himself with the bulk of his force appeared before the city in November and they were driven back behind the city walls, they offered to surrender. In stark contrast to Jawhar's leniency to Fustat, Ibn Fallah imposed humiliating terms on Damascus, demanding that the women come out and let their hair down in the dust. During the takeover of the city, the Kutama pillaged the markets and clashed with the populace for three days, after which Ibn Fallah executed several prominent citizens. This quietened the situation for the time, and Ibn Fallah secured Damascus by erecting a citadel in the city, but it left a legacy of hatred towards the Fatimids and their Berber troops in the city.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=312–313}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=338}}

Almost as soon as Damascus submitted, Ibn Fallah entrusted one of his ''ghulams'', named Futuh ("Victories"), to carry out the promised ''jihad'' against the Byzantines.{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=313}} Futuh assembled a large army of [[Kutama]] [[Berbers]], strengthened with levies from Palestine and southern Syria, and moved to besiege Antioch in December 970. The city resisted with success, and although Ibn Fallah sent reinforcements, they were unable to take it. In spring, a Byzantine relief army [[Battle of Alexandretta|defeated]] a detachment of the Fatimid troops, forcing the Fatimids to raise the siege and withdraw.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=431–439}} At the same time, Ibn Fallah faced an invasion by the [[Qarmatians]]. The Damascene leader Muhammad ibn Asuda, along with the Uqayli chieftain Zalim ibn Mawhub, had sought refuge with the Qarmatians of the [[Syrian Desert]], and urged them to attack the Fatimids. The Qarmatians were all the more responsive because the Fatimids had stopped the Ikhshidid practice of paying them a tribute of some 300,000 [[gold dinar]]s a year in exchange for peace. The Qarmatians mounted a major retaliatory expedition that involved a broad coalition of the region's powers: not only were the Qarmatians of Syria aided by their co-religionists of [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]], but they also received aid from the [[Buyid]] ruler of [[Baghdad]], [[Izz al-Dawla]], and the [[Hamdanids]] of [[Mosul]]. They were also joined by former Ikhshidid ''ghulams'', the Bedouin of the [[Banu Kilab]] tribe, and the Uqayli followers of Zalim. Unwisely, Ibn Fallah chose to confront them in the open desert, where he was defeated and killed in battle in August 971. Muhammad ibn Asuda cut off his head in revenge at the death of his brother, who had been among the Damascene notables executed by Ibn Fallah.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=318}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=313–314}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=339}}

This defeat led to the near total collapse of Fatimid control in southern Syria and Palestine, and the Qarmatian invasion of Egypt. The Fatimids were victorious before [[Fustat]], however, and eventually managed to drive the Qarmatians out of Syria and restore their control over the restive province.{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=314–315, 346}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=339ff.}}

His son [[Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah|Sulayman]] also became a senior Fatimid commander, serving from the late 970s until the late 990s,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=323, 328}} as did his brother Ibrahim.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=344}} Another brother, [[Ali ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah|Ali]], also became a senior commander at the turn of the 11th century, and was honoured with the ''[[laqab]]'' of ''Qutb al-Dawla'' ("Axis of the Realm") for his services against [[Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah]] and his Bedouin.{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=367, 383–385}}

'''Julia the Elder''' (30 October 39 BC – AD 14), known to her contemporaries as '''Julia Caesaris filia''' or '''Julia Augusti filia''' ([[Classical Latin]]: &lt;small&gt;IVLIA•CAESARIS•FILIA&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;IVLIA•AVGVSTI•FILIA&lt;/small&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|E. Groag, A. Stein, L. Petersen - e.a.}} (edd.), ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani saeculi I, II et III'' ('''PIR'''), Berlin, 1933, I 634&lt;/ref&gt; was the daughter and only biological child of [[Augustus]], the first [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. Augustus subsequently adopted several male members of his close family as sons.  Julia resulted from Augustus' second marriage with [[Scribonia]], her birth occurring on the same day as Scribonia's divorce from Augustus, who wished to marry [[Livia]].

She was the daughter of the Emperor Augustus, stepsister and second wife of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], maternal grandmother of the Emperor [[Caligula]] and the Empress [[Agrippina the Younger]], grandmother-in-law of the Emperor [[Claudius]], and maternal great-grandmother of the Emperor [[Nero]].

==Life==

===Early life===
At the time of Julia's birth, 39 BC, Augustus had not yet received the title "Augustus" and was known as "Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius," though historians refer to him as "Octavian" until  27 BC, when Julia was 11. Octavian divorced Julia's mother the day of her birth and took Julia from her soon thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], 48.34.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian, in accordance with Roman custom, claimed complete parental control over her. She was sent to live with her stepmother [[Livia]] when she was old enough and learn how to be an aristocrat. Her education appears to have been strict and somewhat old-fashioned. Thus, in addition to her studies, [[Suetonius]] informs us, she was taught spinning and weaving.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Vita Augusti'' 64&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macrobius]] mentions "her love of literature and considerable culture, a thing easy to come by in that household".&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia: Julia's Wit'', 2.5.1-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia's social life was severely controlled, and she was allowed to talk only to people whom her father had vetted.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''Vita Augusti'' 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, Octavian had a great affection for his daughter and made sure she had the best teachers available. Macrobius preserves a remark of Augustus: "There are two wayward daughters that I have to put up with: the Roman commonwealth and Julia."&lt;ref&gt;''Inter amicos [Augustus] dixit duas habere se filias delicatas, quas necesse haberet ferre, rem publicam et Iuliam.'' Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 2.5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 37 BC, during Julia's early childhood, Octavian's friends [[Gaius Maecenas]] and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] concluded an agreement with Octavian's great rival [[Mark Antony]]. It was sealed with an engagement: Antony's ten-year-old son [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]] was to marry Julia, then two years old.

The engagement never led to a marriage because civil war broke out. In 31 BC, at the [[Battle of Actium]], Octavian and Agrippa defeated Antony and his wife, [[Cleopatra]]. In [[Alexandria]], they both committed suicide, and Octavian became sole ruler of the [[Roman Empire]].

===First marriage===
As with most aristocratic Roman women of the period, expectations of Julia focused on marriage and on the resulting family [[Political alliance|alliances]]. Moreover, Augustus desired a male issue; as his only living child Julia's duty would be to provide her father with grandsons whom he could adopt as his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Augustus'', 63-4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 25 BC, at the age of fourteen, Julia married her first cousin [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], the son of her father's sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]], who was some three years older than her. Augustus himself was not present for the wedding as he was fighting a war in Spain and had fallen ill. Instead, he commissioned Agrippa to preside over the ceremony and hold the festival in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'', Book LIII 27.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to marry Marcellus to Julia, and then Augustus's choice to raise Marcellus to the [[College of Pontiffs|pontificate]] and curule aedileship&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'',  I.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt;, was perceived to be an indication that he would be Augustus' successor in power, despite his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'', II.93.&lt;/ref&gt; This put him at odds with Agrippa, whom people believed would oppose Marcellus' accession to power; the apparent preference for Marcellus is allegedly the catalyst that led to Agrippa to withdraw to [[Mytilene]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Augustus'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Marcellus died in September 23 BC when Julia was sixteen. The union produced no children.

===Marriage to Agrippa===
[[File:Julia Augusti filia.jpg|thumb|200px|Julia from [[Guillaume Rouillé]]'s ''Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum '']]
In 21 BC, having now reached the age of 18, Julia married Agrippa, a man from a modest family who had risen to become Augustus' most trusted general and friend. This step is said to have been taken partly on the advice of Maecenas, who in counseling him remarked: "You have made him so great that he must either become your son-in-law or be slain."&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, 54.6&lt;/ref&gt; Since Agrippa was nearly 25 years her elder, it was a typical arranged marriage, with Julia functioning as a pawn in her father's dynastic plans. There is from this period the report of an infidelity with one [[Sempronius Gracchus]], with whom Julia allegedly had a lasting ''liaison'' ([[Tacitus]] describes him as "a persistent paramour").&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' 1.53&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of a series of alleged adulteries. According to Suetonius, Julia's marital status did not prevent her from conceiving a passion for Augustus' stepson, and thus her stepbrother, [[Tiberius]], so it was widely rumoured.&lt;ref&gt;"''vulgo existimabatur"'', Suetonius, ''Vita Tiberii'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The newlyweds lived in a villa in Rome that has since been excavated near the modern [[Farnesina (district of Rome)|Farnesina]] in [[Trastevere]]. Agrippa and Julia's marriage resulted in five children: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Julia the Younger]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Agrippina the Elder]] (mother of [[Caligula]]), and [[Agrippa Postumus]] (a posthumous son). From June 20 BC to the spring of 18 BC, Agrippa was governor of [[Gaul]], and it is likely that Julia followed him across the Alps. Shortly after their arrival, their first child Gaius was born, and in 19 BC, Julia gave birth to Vipsania Julia. After their return to Italy, a third child followed: a son named Lucius. In 17 BC, Augustus adopted the newborn Lucius and the three-year-old Gaius.&lt;ref&gt;Dio 54.18; Suet. ''Div. Aug''. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  He took care of their education personally. Although Agrippa died in 12 BC, Augustus did not adopt the third brother, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Posthumus, until AD 4, after the exile of Julia - and after the deaths of both Gaius and Lucius.

[[Nicolaus of Damascus|Nicolaus]] and [[Josephus]] mention that during Julia's marriage to Agrippa, she travelled to meet Agrippa where he was campaigning. She was caught up in a flash flood in [[Troy|Ilium]] (Troy), and almost drowned.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus of Damascus|Nicolaus, ([''Fragmenta der Griechischein Historiker''] 2 A: 421-2; [[Josephus]], ''Antiquities'' 16.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippa was furious, and in his anger he fined the locals 100,000 drachmae. The fine was a heavy blow but no one would face Agrippa to request an appeal.  Only after [[Herod the Great|Herod]], king of Judaea, went to Agrippa to request a pardon did he withdraw the fine. In the spring of 16 BC, Agrippa and Julia started a tour through the eastern provinces, where they visited Herod. In October 14 BC, the couple traveled to [[Athens]], where Julia gave birth to her fourth child, Agrippina.

After the winter, the family returned to Italy. Julia quickly became pregnant again, but her husband died suddenly in March 12 BC in [[Campania]] at the age of 51. He was buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Julia named the [[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumous]] son Marcus in his honor. He was to be known as Agrippa Postumus. Immediately after the boy was born, and while Julia was still in mourning, Augustus had her betrothed&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 54.31&lt;/ref&gt; and then remarried to Tiberius, her stepbrother.

===Marriage to Tiberius===
After the death of Agrippa, Augustus sought to promote his step-son Tiberius, believing that this would best serve his own dynastic interests. Tiberius married Julia (11 BC), but first had to divorce [[Vipsania Agrippina]] (daughter from a previous marriage of Agrippa), the woman he dearly loved. Suetonius alleges that Tiberius had a low opinion of Julia's character,&lt;ref&gt;"''Iuliae mores improbaret''", ''loc.cit''. Suetonius&lt;/ref&gt; while Tacitus claims that she disdained Tiberius as an unequal match and even sent her father a letter, written by Sempronius Gracchus, denouncing him.&lt;ref name="Tacitus, Annals 1.53"&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 1.53&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage was thus blighted almost from the start, and the son that Julia bore him died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vita Tiberii'' 7.3&lt;/ref&gt; By 6 BC, when Tiberius departed for [[Rhodes]], if not earlier, the couple had separated.

===Scandal===
Because Augustus was her legitimate father, having married her mother with ''conubium'', Augustus had [[Patria Potestas]] over her. ''Patria Potestas'' lasted until the paterfamilias, Augustus, either died or emancipated his child. Marriage had no effect on ''Patria Potestas'', unless it was [[manus marriage]] which was rare at this point in time.

As the daughter of Augustus, mother (now legally the sister) of two of his heirs, Lucius and Gaius, and wife of another, Tiberius, Julia's future seemed assured to all. Yet in 2 BC she was arrested for adultery and treason; Augustus sent her a letter in Tiberius' name declaring the marriage null and void (Tiberius was at this time on the island of Rhodes and unable to respond quickly). He also asserted in public that she had been plotting against his own life.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''NH'' 7.149 ''adulterium filiae et consilia parricidae''&lt;/ref&gt; Though at the time Augustus had been passing legislation to promote family values, he likely knew of her intrigues with other men but hesitated for some time to accuse her. Several of Julia's supposed lovers were exiled, most notably Sempronius Gracchus, while [[Iullus Antonius]] (son of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Fulvia]]) was forced to commit suicide. Others have suggested that Julia's alleged paramours were members of her city clique, who wished to remove Tiberius from favour and replace him with Antonius. This would explain the letter, written by Gracchus, asking Augustus to allow Julia to divorce Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;Levick, Barbara, ''Tiberius the Politician'', p26-29. {{ISBN|0-415-21753-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile===
Reluctant to execute her, Augustus decided instead to confine Julia on [[Pandateria]], an island that measures less than {{convert|1.75|km²}}, with no men in sight and forbidden even to drink wine.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 55.10, Suetonius, ''Vita Augusti'' 65&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, [[Scribonia]], accompanied her into exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Velleius Paterculus]], 2.100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 55.10&lt;/ref&gt;  She was allowed no visitor unless her father had given permission and had been informed of the stature, complexion, and even of any marks or scars upon his body.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In AD 6, Julia's youngest son, [[Agrippa Postumus]], was exiled for his growing unruliness. Then in 8 her elder daughter, [[Julia the Younger]], was exiled to [[Isole Tremiti|Tremirus]] also charged with adultery; it may also have been related to the attempted revolt by her husband [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] and one Plautius Rufus.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Life of Augustus, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that at any mention of Julia or her two disgraced children, Augustus would remark of them: "If only I had never married, or had died childless", slightly misquoting [[Hector]], in the [[Iliad]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, LXV, ''Life of Augustus''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Five years after her initial exile, around AD 4, Julia was moved to [[Rhegium]] on the mainland and Augustus appears to have granted her a ''peculium'' (property), a yearly income and permitted her to walk about the town.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Tiberius'', 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these concessions Augustus never forgave her nor ever allowed her to return to Rome. This choice appears to have been unpopular with the Roman people who petitioned several times for her to be recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Augustus'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Julia's exile cast a long shadow over Augustus's remaining years. There is mention of at least one suppressed plot to take her from captivity; one Lucius Audasius and one Asinius Epicadus had planned to forcibly take her and her son Agrippa Postumus from where they were held and to the armies, presumably to stage a coup against Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Life of Augustus, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Augustus' death in 14, Tiberius ascended to the Princeps. Despite having shown some sympathy towards Julia when she was initially exiled&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Tiberius'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt;, he instead enforced harsher conditions upon her. He removed her dowry and yearly  income, citing that Augustus had failed to make provisions for them in his will, and thus left her destitute.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', Book 1:53.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he denied her permission to leave her house or receive visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Tiberius'', 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and aftermath===
Julia died in 14, some time after Augustus' death.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 1.53, "That same year Julia ended her days..."; cf. ''Ann''.1.55, which commences the narration of events of 15&lt;/ref&gt; While it is generally agreed by contemporary historians that it was as a result of Tiberius's actions against her, the circumstances of her death are obscure. Dio Cassius indicates Tiberius had a direct hand in her death by imprisoning her until she died either from debility or starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'', Book LVII.18.&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus remarks that upon learning Postumus had been murdered, she succumbed to despair and her health slowly declined.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', Book 1.53. ''"Inopia ac tabe".''&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus had explicitly given instructions in his will that she should not be buried in his [[Mausoleum of Augustus]].

Simultaneously, her alleged ''paramour'' [[Sempronius Gracchus]], who had endured 14 years of exile on Cercina ([[Kerkennah Islands|Kerkenna]]) off the African coast, was executed either at Tiberius' instigation&lt;ref name="Tacitus, Annals 1.53" /&gt; or on the independent initiative of Nonius Asprenas, proconsul of Africa.

Her daughter Julia died in AD 29 after 20 years of exile; she was also forbidden to be buried in Augustus' tomb by his will.

According to Suetonius, after his own ascension [[Caligula]], the son of Julia's daughter [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] and [[Tiberius]]'s nephew [[Germanicus]], would claim that his mother Agrippina was the product of an incestuous union between Julia and Augustus. The reason for this is allegedly because he did not wish to be thought of as the grandson of Agrippa due to his humble origins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Vita Caligulae'' 23&lt;/ref&gt; However, the existence of coins and inscriptions dating from Caligula's reign that clearly identify Agrippina as Agrippa's daughter suggests this account is apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial Women: A Study in Public Images, 40 BC-AD 68|last=Wood|first=Susan|publisher=BRILL|year=2000|isbn=9789004119505|location=Netherlands|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural depictions==

=== In ancient literature ===
Among contemporary writers Julia is almost universally remembered for her flagrant and promiscuous conduct. Thus [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] (2.100) describes her as "tainted by luxury or lust", listing among her lovers Iullus Antonius, Quintius Crispinus, Appius Claudius, Sempronius Gracchus, and [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 16 BC)|Cornelius Scipio]]. [[Seneca the Younger]] refers to "adulterers admitted in droves";&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''admissos gregatim adulteros'', ''De Beneficiis'' 6.32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] calls her an “''exemplum licentiae''” (''NH'' 21.9). [[Dio Cassius]] mentions "revels and drinking parties by night in the Forum and even upon the [[Rostra]]" (''Roman History'' 55.10). Seneca (''De Beneficiis'' 6.32) tells us that the Rostra was the place where "her father had proposed a law against adultery", and yet now she had chosen the place for her "debaucheries". Seneca specifically mentions prostitution: "laying aside the role of adulteress, she there [''in the Forum''] sold her favours, and sought the right to every indulgence with even an unknown paramour." Modern historians discredit these representations as exaggerating Julia's behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Fantham, Elaine. (2006) ''Julia Augusti''. p. 82/157. "Routledge". {{ISBN|0-415-33146-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]] provides invaluable details of her witticisms and personality.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', ''Book II,'' 5:2, translations from ''Macrobius:'' ''Saturnalia, Volume I: Books 1-2''. Edited and translated by Robert A. Kaster. Loeb Classical Library 510. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2011. pp. 361-2. [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL510/2011/volume.xml]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the sassy ripostes he attributes to her is a retort to people's surprise that all her children all resembled Agrippa - “I take on a passenger only when the ship’s hold is full.”&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', ''Book II,'' 5:9.&lt;/ref&gt; On her character, he writes that Julia was extensively celebrated for her amiable, empathetic nature and studiousness despite her profligacy; "[S]he was abusing her standing as fortune’s darling, and her father’s, though in other respects she gained a great deal of credit for her love of literature and extensive learning... and her kindness, fellow-feeling, and lack of cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', ''Book II,'' 5:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sidonius Apollinaris]], writing in the 5th century, was the first person to identify Julia as the figure Corinna in Ovid's ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Carmina'', 23.158-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===
{{In popular culture|date=October 2017}}
====Literature====

*In [[Ben Jonson|Ben Jonson's]] comedy play, ''[[Poetaster (play)|The Poetaster]]'' (1601), Julia is the romantic interest of Ovid. The play itself is commonly thought to be a parody on the literary scene at the time with Julia and Ovid performing a balcony scene similar to [[Romeo and Juliet|''Romeo and Juliet'']].
*[[Aphra Behn|Aphra Behn's]] satirical, heroic epistle poem, ''Ovid to Julia. A Letter'' (1685). The poem itself is a satire of [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby]], who allegedly courted the future [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and was exiled from court in 1682.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oroonoko and Other Writings|last=Behn, Aphra|first=ed. Paul Salzman,|publisher=OUP|year=2009|isbn=978-0199538768|location=Oxford|pages=274.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Charlotte-Antoinette de Bressay's epistolary novel, ''Lettres De Julie À Ovide Et D'ovide À Julie'' ("Letters from Julia, the Daughter of Augustus, to Ovid", 1753).

*[[Robert Graves]]' novel, [[I, Claudius|''I, Claudius'']] (1934). The titular character, Claudius, recounts that Julia was tricked by Livia into taking aphrodisiacs that increase her sexual appetite, leading to her affairs and ultimately her exile. Graves appears to have been largely influenced by Macrobius' account of Julia, with Claudius referring to her as "a decent, good hearted woman, though fond of pleasures and excitement, and the only one of my female relations who had a kindly word for me."
*[[Taylor Caldwell]]'s novel ''Dear and Glorious Physician'' (1958) portrays Julia as the unhappy wife of [[Tiberius]] and a seductress of Lucanus, the young evangelist [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]].
*[[Elisabeth Dored|Elisabeth Dored's]] novel, ''[[I Loved Tiberius|Jeg elsket Tiberius]]'' (''"''I Loved Tiberius", 1959), Julia serves as the main character; it portrays Julia as innocent of all charges against her, both her affairs and modern historians’ speculation of a plot.
*Julia is one of the narrators in [[John Edward Williams]]' epistolary novel [[Augustus_(Williams_novel)|''Augustus'']] (1972). There are a number of contributions in her name, written as part of a diary she wrote while in exile in Pandateria reflecting on her father, her marriages, her relationships with her lovers and the restrictions on her as a prominent Roman matron.
*[[Allan Massie|Allan Massie's]] novel, ''[[Augustus (Massie novel)|Augustus]]'' (1986), depicts Julia very closely to the contemporary histories, with her engaging in affairs as a slight against her father's laws. Its follow-up, ''[[Tiberius (Massie novel)|Tiberius]]'' (1991), invents an affair between Julia and Tiberius during her marriage to Marcellus.
*Edward Burton's novel, ''[[Caesar's Daughter]]'' (1999). Julia is the titular character; it downplays her affairs with Iullus Antonius being her only lover and instead attributes Julia's exile to a failed coup to kill Tiberius.
*Julia appears in the final novel in [[Colleen McCullough]]'s ''[[Masters of Rome|Master of Rome]]'' series, ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (novel)|Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (2007), as a child. Emphasising her as a highly intelligent child, the focus is chiefly on her education, which Octavius purposefully ensures is "like a man's".
*[[Michelle Moran|Michelle Moran's]] novel, ''Cleopatra's Daughter'' (2009)'','' which focuses on Cleopatra Selene' Queen Cleopatra VII's daughter, depicts a teenage Julia as one of the main characters.

====Film and television====

*In the 1976 BBC Television adaptation of ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]],'' Julia was portrayed by [[Frances White]]. Julia is one of the few major female characters who does not scheme to murder another character, along with her daughter [[Agrippina the Elder]], her cousin [[Antonia Minor]] and Antonia's granddaughter, [[Julia Livia|Helen]].
*In the [[Italy|Italian]] [[mini series]], ''[[Imperium: Augustus]]'', Julia was portrayed by [[Vittoria Belvedere]]. The series focused on the relationship between Augustus and Julia as he recounts how he came to power to her. After being forced into an abusive marriage with Tiberius by her father and Livia, she begins an affair with Iullus Antonius. He subsequently attempts to murder Augustus in order to free Julia from his dynastic plans, leading to her exile.
*In the film, ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'', she is played by [[Rosalind Ivan]], making an anachronistic appearance as Tiberius' wife.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046247/goofs Mistakes in ''The Robe (1953)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Anno Domini chronology==
In 1605, the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]], published a tract (later quoted by [[Kepler]]), which for the first time suggested that the mythological figure [[Jesus]] was born sometime during the years 6-4 BC, not on December 25, 1 BC as [[Dionysius Exiguus]] implied, but never stated. According to Dionysius' dating scheme, the Christian era supposedly began on January 1, AD 1 about one week after Jesus' birth at the end of December. Julia's expulsion from Rome in 2 BC was featured in Suslyga's chronological argument which sought to establish Herod's death in 4 BC. Suslyga's chronological ideas concerning the dating of Herod's death based on Julia the Elder's exile have since been challenged by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M. Strickert, Philip’s City: From Bethsaida to Julias, (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical, 2011), pp. 163-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and births==
*25 BC, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], until his death on September 23 BC. No children.
*21 BC, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], until his death in 12 BC. Their children:
**[[Gaius Caesar]] in 20 BC
**Vipsania Julia Agrippina (known as [[Julia the Younger]]) in c. 19 BC.
**[[Lucius Caesar]] in 17 BC
** Vipsania Agrippina Julia (known as [[Agrippina the Elder]]) in 14 BC (mother of Emperor [[Caligula]]) 
**[[Agrippa Postumus]] in 12 BC (posthumously after Agrippa's death). 
*11 BC, Julia marries her stepbrother [[Tiberius]]. Their child:
**Infant son, (dubbed "Tiberillus" by modern historians), died in infancy.

'''Čedomir "Ljubo" Čupić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Чедомир "Љубо" Чупић}}; 1913 – 9 May 1942) was a Yugoslav law student, political commissioner of Communist resistance movement in [[Nikšić]], [[Montenegro]] and a decorated war hero of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. He became famous for the photo of him taken moments before he was shot by [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] collaborators who captured him, showing him with shackles on his hands and smiling. He is a recipient of the [[Order of the People's Hero]], a Yugoslav gallantry medal. He is commonly referred to by media as "Montenegrin [[Che Guevara]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/osmijeh-ljuba-cupica-na-elektroskoli-88795|title=Osmijeh Ljuba Čupića na Elektroškoli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glas-javnosti.rs/aktuelne-vesti/2012-05-09/vijenci-na-grob-ljuba-cupica|title=Vijenci na grob Ljuba Čupića - Glas javnosti|website=www.glas-javnosti.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born in 1913 in the United States, being one of the ten children in an immigrant Montenegrin working-class family of father Sava and mother Stana (née Burić), from the village of Zagreda.

During the 1930s, he moved to Nikšić, where he finished high school. He studied law at the [[University of Belgrade]], and was a member of a progressive student movement, and joined the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1940.

After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] he returned to Nikšić and participated in the preparation of the uprising. In July 1941, he fled from the Nazi-occupied city, and joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan]] division "Đuro Đaković", formed by communists and [[SKOJ]] members who also escaped from Nikšić.

As a commissioner of the Partisan movement in Nikšić, he was captured by [[Chetniks]] in April 1942, after a battle on [[Battle of Kablena Glavica|Kablena Glavica]] near Nikšić. He was tortured in prison and was subject to a public trial by the ''[[ad hoc]]'' court composed by the Chetniks. He was sentenced to death and executed by shooting squad following the illegal and biased trial. Before the public execution, he cheered his friends and the people who were forced to witness the event. Among his last word was the parole "Long live the glorious Communist Party."

== Legacy ==
He was posthumously declared a [[Order of the People's Hero|people's hero]] by the decree of the Yugoslav President [[Josip Broz Tito]] on 10 July 1953.

In memory of Ljubo Čupić, a street in Zagorič, a neighbourhood of [[Podgorica]], has been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leksikon-yu-mitologije.net/read.php?id=7114 Yugoslav lexicon - Ljubo Čupić] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717065651/http://www.leksikon-yu-mitologije.net/read.php?id=7114 |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|loyalty|allegiance|troth}}
'''Loyalty''', in general use, is a [[Fixation (psychology)|devotion]] and [[faithfulness]] to a nation, cause, philosophy, [[country]], group, or [[person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/loyalty |title=Loyalty definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary |publisher=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophers]] disagree on what can be an object of loyalty, as some argue that loyalty is strictly interpersonal and only another human [[being]] can be the object of loyalty. The definition of loyalty in [[law]] and [[political science]] is the fidelity of an individual to a [[nation]], either one's nation of birth, or one's declared home nation by [[oath]] ([[naturalization]]).

==Historical concepts==

=== Western world ===
{{further|Semper fidelis|In Treue fest|Fidelity|Tryggvi}}
Classical [[tragedy]] is often based on a conflict arising from [[dual loyalty]]. 
''[[Euthyphro]]'', one of [[Plato]]'s early dialogues, is based on the ethical dilemma arising from
Euthyphro intending to lay manslaughter charges against his own father, who had caused the death of a slave through negligence.

In the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 6:24, Jesus states, "No one can serve two masters.  Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and [[mammon]]".  This relates to the authority of a master over his servants (as per [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 6:5), who, according to [[Biblical law]], owe undivided loyalty to their master (as per Leviticus 25:44–46).&lt;ref name=White2000 /&gt;
On the other hand, the "[[Render unto Caesar]]" of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties (secular and religious) without conflict, but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to God, the latter takes precedence.&lt;ref name=SharmaSharma1998 /&gt;

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] defines loyalty as "allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one's country" and also "personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family".  It traces the word "[[wikt:loyalty|loyalty]]" to the 15th century, noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service, in love, or to an [[oath]] that one has made. The meaning that the ''Britannica'' gives as primary, it attributes to a shift during the 16th century, noting that the origin of the word is in the [[Old French]] "[[wikt:loialte|loialte]]", that is in turn rooted in the [[Latin language|Latin]] "[[wikt:lex|lex]]", meaning "[[wikt:law|law]]".  One who is loyal, in the [[feudalism|feudal]] sense of [[fealty]], is one who is lawful (as opposed to an [[outlaw]]), who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful [[allegiance]] to a feudal lord.  Hence the 1911 ''Britannica'' derived its (early 20th century) primary meaning of loyalty to a [[monarch]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandekerckhove2006 /&gt;

=== East Asia ===
(Zhong){{clarify-inline||date=August 2017|reason=What does "zong" mean?  Per Wiktionary, it does not seem to be the Mandarin word for "loyalty", nor the name of a (Confucian) philosopher who wrote about the subject.}} Often cited as one of the many virtues of [[Confucianism]], meaning to do the best you can do for others.

"Loyalty" is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in [[Bushido]]. It combines other six virtues, such as Righteousness ([[wikt:義|義 gi?]]), Courage ([[wikt:勇気|勇 yū?]]), Benevolence, ([[wikt:仁|仁 jin?]]), Respect ([[wikt:礼|礼 rei?]]), Sincerity ([[wikt:誠|誠 makoto?]]), Honour ([[wikt:名誉|名誉 meiyo?]]), and formed the Bushido code: "It is somehow implanted in their chromosomal makeup to be loyal".&lt;ref name=Hurst1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurst|first1=G. Cameron|title=Death, Honor, and Loyality{{sic}}: The Bushidō Ideal|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=October 1990|volume=40|issue=4|page=516|issn=0031-8221|doi=10.2307/1399355|jstor=1399355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern concepts==

[[Josiah Royce]] presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book ''The Philosophy of Loyalty''. According to Royce, loyalty is a [[virtue]], indeed a primary virtue, "the heart of all the virtues, the central duty amongst all the duties". Royce presents loyalty, which he defines at length, as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived.&lt;ref name=Thilly1908 /&gt;  The short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is "the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause".&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thilly1908 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin1994 /&gt;  Loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause.&lt;ref name=Mullin2005 /&gt;

Royce's view of loyalty was challenged by Ladd in the article on "Loyalty" in the first edition of the Macmillan ''[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1967).

Ralls (1968) observes that Ladd's article is the Macmillan ''Encyclopaedia''{{'}}s only article on a virtue, and praises it for its "magnificent" declaration by Ladd that "a loyal Nazi is a contradiction in terms".&lt;ref name=Ralls1968 /&gt;
Ladd asserts that, contrary to Royce, causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal, not impersonal or suprapersonal.&lt;ref name=Baron1984 /&gt;  He states that Royce's view has "the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men.  The individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into 'superhuman' good". Ronald F. Duska, the Lamont Post Chair of Ethics and the Professions at [[The American College of Financial Services|The American College]], extends Ladd's objection, saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one's self-will to be identified with anything, as Royce would have it.  Even if one were identifying one's self-will with God, to be worthy of such loyalty God would have to be the ''[[summum bonum]]'', the perfect manifestation of good.

Ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal, i.e., a relationship between a lord and vassal, parent and child, or two good friends.  Duska states that doing so leads to a problem that Ladd overlooks.  Loyalty may certainly be between two persons, but it may also be from a person to a group of people.  Examples of this, which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty, are loyalty by a person to his or her family, to a team that he or she is a member or fan of, or to his or her country.  The problem with this that Duska identifies is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved, and whether Ladd's contention that loyalty is interpersonal—not suprapersonal—is an adequate description.&lt;ref name=Duska2007 /&gt;

Ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives: its proper object and its moral value.&lt;ref name=Ladd1967 /&gt;  

John Kleinig, professor of [[philosophy]] at [[City University of New York]], observes that over the years the idea has been treated by writers from [[Aeschylus]] through [[John Galsworthy]] to [[Joseph Conrad]], by psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, scholars of religion, political economists, scholars of business and marketing, and—most particularly—by political theorists, who deal with it in terms of [[loyalty oath]]s and [[patriotism]]. As a philosophical concept, loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of [[Josiah Royce]], the "grand exception" in Kleinig's words.&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;  John Ladd, professor of philosophy at [[Brown University]], writing in the Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' in 1967, observes that by that time the subject had received "scant attention in philosophical literature". This he attributed to "odious" associations that the subject had with [[nationalism]], including [[Nazism]], and with the metaphysics of [[idealism]], which he characterized as "obsolete". However, he argued that such associations were faulty and that the notion of loyalty is "an essential ingredient in any civilized and humane system of morals".&lt;ref name=Ladd1967 /&gt;  Kleinig observes that from the 1980s onwards, the subject gained attention, with philosophers variously relating it to [[professional ethics]], [[whistleblowing]], [[friendship]], and [[virtue theory]].&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;

Additional aspects enumerated by Kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects.&lt;ref name=Kleinig2007 /&gt;

=== The proper object of loyalty ===
Ladd and others, including [[Milton R. Konvitz]]{{year needed|date=October 2015}} and Marcia W. Baron (1984),&lt;ref name=Baron1984/&gt; disagree amongst themselves as to the proper ''object of'' loyalty—what it is possible to be loyal ''to'', in other words.  Ladd, as stated, considers loyalty to be interpersonal, and that the object of loyalty is always a person. In the ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Ideas'', Konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles, causes, ideas, ideals, religions, ideologies, nations, governments, parties, leaders, families, friends, regions, racial groups, and "anyone or anything to which one's heart can become attached or devoted".  Baron agrees with Ladd, inasmuch as loyalty is "to certain people or to a group of people, not loyalty to an ideal or cause".  She argues in her [[monograph]], ''The Moral Status of Loyalty'', that "[w]hen we speak of causes (or ideals) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them".  Kleinig agrees with Baron, noting that a person's earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people, and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values, causes, and ideals.  He disagrees, however, with the notion that loyalties are restricted ''solely'' to personal attachments, considering it "incorrect (as a matter of logic)".&lt;ref name=Kleinig1996 /&gt; Loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary tactic]], as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs.&lt;ref name="breedbites"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Tribes in Evolution |work=Breed Bites |date=1 December 2007 |url=https://breedbites.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/the-power-of-tribes-in-evolution/ |accessdate=23 January 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplicity, disloyalty, and whether loyalty is exclusionary ===
Stephen Nathanson, professor of Philosophy at [[Northeastern University]], states that loyalty can be either ''exclusionary'' or ''non-exclusionary''; and can be ''single'' or ''multiple''.  Exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups; whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not.  People may have single loyalties, to just one person, group, or thing, or multiple loyalties to multiple objects.  Multiple loyalties can constitute a ''disloyalty'' to an object if one of those loyalties is ''exclusionary'', excluding one of the others.  However, Nathanson observes, this is a special case.  In the general case, the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty.  One can, for example, be loyal to one's friends, or one's family, and still, without contradiction, be loyal to one's religion, or profession.

=== Other dimensions ===
In addition to ''number'' and ''exclusion'' as just outlined, Nathanson enumerates five other "dimensions" that loyalty can vary along: basis, strength, scope, legitimacy, and attitude.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''basis'' according to their foundations. They may be constructed upon the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty, such as biological ties or place of birth (a notion of natural allegiance propounded by [[Socrates]] in his political theory). Alternatively, they may be constructed from personal choice and evaluation of criteria with a full degree of freedom. The degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple; Nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one's parents or relatives, one ''can'' choose to desert them.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''strength''.  They can range from supreme loyalties, that override all other considerations, to merely presumptive loyalties, that affect one's presumptions, providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations.  Nathanson observes that strength of loyalty is often interrelated with basis.  "[[Blood is thicker than water]]", states an aphorism, explaining that loyalties that have biological ties as their bases are generally stronger.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''scope''.  They range from loyalties with limited scope, that require few actions of the subject, to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes, which require many actions, or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty.  Loyalty to one's job, for example, may require no more action than simple punctuality and performance of the tasks that the job requires.  Loyalty to a family member can, in contrast, have a very broad effect upon one's actions, requiring considerable personal sacrifice.  Extreme patriotic loyalty may impose an unlimited scope of duties.  Scope encompasses an element of ''constraint''.  Where two or more loyalties conflict, their scopes determine what weight to give to the alternative courses of action required by each loyalty.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Loyalties differ in ''[[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]''.  This is of particular relevance to the conflicts among multiple loyalties.  People with one loyalty can hold that another, conflicting, loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate.  In the extreme view, one that Nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples, all loyalties bar one's own are considered illegitimate.  The xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions.  At the other end of the spectrum, past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not, according to cases, or plain and simple indifference to other people's loyalties, is the positive regard of other people's loyalties.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Finally, loyalties differ in the ''attitude'' that the subjects of the loyalties have towards other people.  (Note that this dimension of loyalty concerns the ''subjects'' of the loyalty, whereas legitimacy, above, concerns the loyalties themselves.)  People may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties, with hate and disdain at one end, indifference in the middle, and concern and positive feeling at the other.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

==In relation to other subjects==

===Patriotism===
{{Main|Patriotism}}
Nathanson observes that loyalty is often directly equated to patriotism.  He states, that this is, however, not actually the case, arguing that whilst patriots exhibit loyalty, it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots.  He provides the example of a [[mercenary]] soldier, who exhibits loyalty to the people or country that pays him.  Nathanson points to the difference in motivations between a loyal mercenary and a patriot.  A mercenary may well be motivated by a sense of [[professionalism]] or a belief in the sanctity of [[contracts]].  A patriot, in contrast, may be motivated by affection, concern, identification, and a willingness to sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

Nathanson contends that patriotic loyalty is not always a virtue.  A loyal person can, in general be relied upon, and hence people view loyalty as virtuous.  Nathanson argues that loyalty can, however, be given to persons or causes that are unworthy.  Moreover, loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane.  Thus, Nathanson argues, patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue, when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable.  Such loyalties, in Nathanson's view, are erroneously ''unlimited'' in their scopes, and fail to acknowledge boundaries of morality.&lt;ref name=Nathanson1993 /&gt;

===Whistleblowing===
{{Main|Whistleblowing}}
Several scholars, including Duska, discuss loyalty in the context of whistleblowing.  Wim Vandekerckhove of the [[University of Greenwich]] points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a ''bidirectional'' loyalty—between employees and their employer.  (Previous thinking had encompassed the idea that employees are loyal to an employer, but not that an employer need be loyal to employees.)  The ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties, where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community, which the employer's business practices may be adversely affecting.  Vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways, some of which he, himself, does not find to be satisfactory.  Duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances, the community, a position that Vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty.

John Corvino, associate professor of Philosophy at [[Wayne State University]] takes a different tack, arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice, not a virtue, and that "loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good" (similar to Nathanson). Vandekerckhove calls this argument "interesting" but "too vague" in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer's shortcomings.  Vandekerckhove suggests that Duska and Corvino combine, however, to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing, by clarifying the objects of those loyalties.&lt;ref name=Vandekerckhove2006 /&gt;

===Marketing===
{{Main|Loyalty business model}}
Businesses seek to become the objects of loyalty in order to retain customers. [[Brand loyalty]] is a consumer's preference for a particular [[brand]] and a commitment to repeatedly purchase that brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dick Alan S. |author2=Basu Kunal | year = 1994 | title = Customer Loyalty: Toward an Integrated Conceptual Framework | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1177%2F0092070394222001 | journal = Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1177/0092070394222001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loyalty programs]] offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharp Byron |author2=Sharp Anne | year = 1997 | title = Loyalty Programs and Their Impact on Repeat-Purchase Loyalty Patterns | url = http://byronsharp.com/resources/6076.PDF| journal = International Journal of Research in Marketing | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 473–86 | doi=10.1016/s0167-8116(97)00022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One similar concept is [[fan loyalty]], an allegiance to and abiding interest in a [[sports team]], [[fictional character]], or fictional series. Devoted sports fans continue to remain fans even in the face of a string of losing seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Mark|title=The Business of Sports: A Primer for Journalists|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415876520| edition=2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YG2wf1DT1MYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==
Attempting to serve two masters leads to “double-mindedness” ([[Epistle of James|James]] 4:8), undermining loyalty to a cause. The [[Bible]] also speaks of loyal ones, which would be those who follow the Bible with absolute loyalty, as in "Precious in the eyes of God is the death of his loyal ones" ([[Psalms]] 116:15).  Most Jewish and Christian authors view the [[binding of Isaac]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22), in which [[Abraham]] was called by God to offer his son Isaac as a [[burnt offering]], as a test of Abraham's loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Louis A., ''The Akedah: The Binding of Isaac''. (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997; {{ISBN|1-56821-899-0}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s faithfulness to his master [[Potiphar]] and his rejection of Potiphar's wife's advances ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 39) have also been called an example of the virtue of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;[[William J. Bennett]], ''[[The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories]]'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995; {{ISBN|0-684-83577-0}}), p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misplaced==
{{Main|Misplaced loyalty}}
Misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or [[organisations]] where that loyalty is not acknowledged or [[respect]]ed, is [[Betrayal|betrayed]], or taken advantage of. It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause.

[[Social psychology (sociology)|Social psychology]] provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way "the ''norm of social commitment'' directs us to honor our agreements...People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith and Diane M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanists]] point out that "man inherits the capacity for loyalty, but not the use to which he shall put it...may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile, as he may to what is generous and noble".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur James Balfour, ''Theism and Humanism'' (2000) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Edwin Landseer Attachment.JPG|thumb|160px|right| Foxie, guarding the body of her master [[Charles Gough (artist)| Charles Gough]], in  ''Attachment'' by [[Edwin Landseer]], 1829]]

Animals as [[pet]]s have a large sense of loyalty to humans. Famous cases include [[Greyfriars Bobby]], a Skye terrier who attended his master's grave for fourteen years; [[Hachiko]], a dog who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his [[death]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AC95cdzhg_4C&amp;pg=PA7 |title= First Friend |author= Katharine Rogers|isbn= 9781450208734 |date= April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Foxie, the [[spaniel]] belonging to [[Charles Gough (artist)|Charles Gough]], who stayed by her dead master's side for three months on [[Helvellyn]] in the [[Lake District]] in 1805 (although it is possible that Foxie had eaten Gough's body).&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Jones |date= 15 March 2003 |title= The Romantics and the Myth of Charles Gough |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/mar/15/art.artsfeatures |work= The Guardian |location= London |accessdate= 25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the righteous King [[Yudhishthira]] appears at the gates of Heaven at the end of his life with a stray dog he had picked up along the way as a companion, having previously lost his brothers and his wife to death.  The god [[Indra]] is prepared to admit him to Heaven, but refuses to admit the dog, so Yudhishthira refuses to abandon the dog, and prepares to turn away from the gates of Heaven.  Then the dog is revealed{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to be the manifestation of [[Dharma]], the god of righteousness and justice, and who turned out to be his deified self.  Yudhishthira enters heaven in the company of his dog, the god of righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;
''[[Mahabharata]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm book 17, ch. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, supra, pp. 684–85
&lt;/ref&gt;
Yudhishthira is known by the [[epithet]] Dharmaputra, the lord of righteous duty.

'''Malam Mamane Barka''' (1958/1959 – 21 November 2018) was a [[Niger]]ien musician, and one of the world's most prominent players of the ''biram''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sole|first1=Deanne|title=Mamane Barka: Introducing Mamane Barka|url=https://www.popmatters.com/93025-mamane-barka-introducing-mamane-barka-2496019943.html|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=4 February 2018|date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 21 November 2018, aged 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.aniamey.com/h/89128.html|title=Décès du musicien Mamane Mallam Barka ce mercredi à Niamey|website=aniamey.com|language=French|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Malam Mamane Barka was born in 1958 or 1959 in [[Tesker, Niger|Tesker, a town in the east of the then autonomous republic of Niger]]. He came from the nomadic people of Toubou. As a player of the Ngurumi, a two-string plucked instrument, he gained popularity in his homeland and neighboring Nigeria. In 2002 he decided to devote himself to the study of Biram. It is a five-stringed instrument used by the Boudouma, a fishing community on Lake Chad, for traditional songs.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The attack occurred in October 2002, in the [[Gulf of Aden]], off [[Yemen]].
One [[Bulgaria]]n crew member was killed.&lt;ref name=Bbc20061001/&gt;  Twelve crew members were injured.  90,000 tonnes of oil were spilled.
Al-Ahdal was captured in [[Yemen]] on November 25, 2003.

During the 90s' he fought in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]] and [[First Chechen War|Chechnya]].

According to [[Global Security]] Al-Ahdal was born in 1971, and received a three-year sentence.&lt;ref name=GlobalSecurityMohammedHambdiAlAhdal /&gt;
The Prosecution appealed, because they thought the original sentence was too lenient.&lt;ref name=InternationalHeraldTribune20061118&gt;

The '''Monsanto House of the Future''' was an attraction at [[Disneyland]]'s [[Tomorrowland]].&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]], from 1957 to 1967.&lt;ref name=Colomina&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Colomina|editor-first1=Beatriz|title=Cold War hothouses inventing postwar culture, from cockpit to Playboy|date=2004|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=9781568983028|pages=102-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl03E5zOJmIC&amp;pg=102|first=Stephen|last= Phillips|chapter=Plastics: Monsanto Home of the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
Sponsored by [[Monsanto Company]], the House of the Future was made possible by Monsanto, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), and [[Walt Disney Imagineering]].&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Plastic Town|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=26–33|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/plastic-town|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this project, Monsanto wanted to demonstrate plastics' versatility as a high-quality, engineered material.  The design team for this innovative structure included MIT architecture faculty [[Richard Hamilton (architect)|Richard Hamilton]] and Marvin Goody (founders of Goody Clancy) and MIT civil engineering faculty [[Albert G. H. Dietz]] &lt;ref name=Mannheim&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mannheim|first1=Steve|title=Walt Disney and the quest for community|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=978-0-7546-1974-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTfVFY__wJoC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Frank J. Heger, Jr. (a founder of [[Simpson Gumpertz &amp; Heger Inc.|Simpson Gumpertz &amp; Heger]]) and Frederick J. McGarry. The MIT faculty worked with the Engineering Department of Monsanto's Plastics Division, including R. P. Whittier and M. F. Gigliotti.  The house, featuring four symmetric wings cantilevered off a central core, was fabricated with glass-reinforced plastics.

The attraction offered a tour of a [[home of the future]], featuring household appliances such as [[microwave oven]]s, which eventually became commonplace.&lt;ref name=Mental_Floss&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Monsanto's House of the Future, 1957|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12908/inside-monsantos-house-future-1957|website=Mental_Floss|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The house saw over 435,000 visitors within the first six weeks of opening, and ultimately saw over 20 million visitors before being closed.&lt;ref name=Disney&gt;{{cite web|title=Living in the Monsanto House of the Future|url=http://www.disneyavenue.com/2015/05/living-in-monsanto-house-of-future.html|website=Disney Avenue|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house closed in 1967. The building was so sturdy that when demolition crews failed to demolish the house using wrecking balls, torches, chainsaws and jackhammers, the building was ultimately demolished using choker chains to crush it into smaller parts.  The plastic structure was so strong that the half-inch steel bolts used to mount it to its foundation broke before the structure itself did.&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinstein|first1=Dave|title=Plastic Fantastic Living Disneyland's spectacular 'Monsanto House of the Future' combined science, showmanship and dreams|url=http://www.eichlernetwork.com/article/plastic-fantastic-living?page=0,0|website=Eichler Network|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

The reinforced concrete foundation was never removed, and remains in its original location, now the Pixie Hollow, where it has been painted green and is used as a planter.&lt;ref name=Yesterland&gt;{{cite web|title=Homage to the House of the Future|url=http://www.yesterland.com/homages.html|website=Yesterland|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebirth==
The House of the Future has had a significant impact on later design at Disney and Epcot.&lt;ref name=Mannheim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yesterland/&gt; In February 2008, Disney announced it would conceptually bring back the attraction with a more modern and accessible interior. The $15 million '''[[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]] Dream Home''' was a collaboration of the [[Walt Disney Company]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], software maker LifeWare, and homebuilder [[Taylor Morrison]].&lt;ref name=Flaccus&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaccus |first1=Gillian |title=Disney Revives 'House of the Future' |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/custom/fringe/sns-ap-disneyland-futuristic-house,0,3848749.story |accessdate=31 March 2015 |publisher=Sun Sentinel |date=13 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217070624/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/custom/fringe/sns-ap-disneyland-futuristic-house%2C0%2C3848749.story |archivedate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, MIT Museum Architecture Curator Gary Van Zante gave a presentation on campus where he showed archived drawings and photographs of the plastic house. The talk, titled ''Back to the Future: A 1950s House of the Future'', was part of the Cambridge Science Festival.&lt;ref name=Marcott&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2010/04/30/monsanto_mit_house/ |title=Houses: Make Mine Small, Modular, and Made of Plastic |first=Amy |last=Marcott |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=MIT Alumni Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Testudo horsfieldii locking into the camera.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some tortoises show negligible senescence.]]
'''Negligible senescence''' is a term coined by [[biogerontology|biogerontologist]] [[Caleb Finch]] to denote organisms that do not exhibit evidence of [[senescence]] (biological aging), such as measurable reductions in their reproductive capability, measurable functional decline, or rising death rates with age.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finch |first1=Caleb |title=Longevity, Senescence and the Genome |date=1994 |publisher=.  University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=206-247 |chapter=Negligible Senescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of species for whose organisms scientists have not detected an increase in mortality rate after maturity.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt; This may mean that the lifespan of the organism is so long that researchers' subjects have not yet lived up to the time when a measure of the species' longevity can be made. Turtles, for example, were once thought to lack senescence, but more extensive observations have found evidence of decreasing fitness with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Study of negligibly senescent animals may provide clues that lead to better understanding of the aging process&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = J | year = 2004 | title = Emerging area of aging research: long-lived animals with "negligible senescence" | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1019 | issue = | pages = 518–20 | doi=10.1196/annals.1297.096 | pmid=15247078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence [[evolution of aging|theories of aging]]. The phenomenon of negligible senescence in some animals is a traditional argument for attempting to achieve similar negligible senescence in humans by technological means.

There are also organisms{{which|date=January 2017}} that exhibit negative senescence, whereby mortality chronologically decreases as the organism ages, for all or part of the life cycle, in disagreement with the [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Late-life mortality deceleration]]). Furthermore, there are species that have been observed to regress to a larval state and regrow into adults multiple times, such as ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of '&amp;#39;Turritopsis'&amp;#39; |publisher=8e.devbio.com |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated a connection between phenomena related to negligible senescence and the general stability of an organism's [[genome]], specifically [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] processes, over its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kogan|first1=Valeria|first2=Ivan|last2=Molodtcov|first3=Leonid I.|last3=Menshikov|first4=Robert J.|last4=Shmookler Reis|first5=Peter|last5=Fedichev|title=Stability analysis of a model gene network links aging, stress resistance, and negligible senescence|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|year=2015|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13589|doi=10.1038/srep13589|pages=13589|pmid=26316217|pmc=4551969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vertebrates==
Some fish, such as some varieties of [[sturgeon]] and [[rougheye rockfish]], and some [[tortoise]]s and [[turtle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = J | year = 2001 | title = Escaping senescence: demographic data from the three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis)". | url = | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 36 | issue = 4–6| pages = 829–32 | doi=10.1016/s0531-5565(00)00243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; are thought to be negligibly senescent, although recent research on turtles has uncovered evidence of senescence in the wild.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Daniel A.|last2=Miller|first2=David A.

==In plants==
In plants, [[aspen]] trees are one example of [[biological immortality]]. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the [[root]] system of the [[clonal colony]] is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. One such colony in [[Utah]], given the nickname of [[Pando (Quaking Aspen)|"Pando"]], is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the [[list of long-living organisms|oldest living colony]] of aspens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm Quaking Aspen] by the [[Bryce Canyon]] [[National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest known living non-[[Vegetative cloning|clonal]] organism was the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] of the species ''[[Pinus longaeva]]'' growing high in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] of [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] in eastern [[California]], aged {{Age as of date|4789|1957|August|5}} years.&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_longaeva.php |title= ''Pinus longaeva'' |accessdate= 2008-06-20 |publisher= Gymnosperm Database|date= March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This record was superseded in 2012 by another Great Basin bristlecone pine located in the same region as Methuselah, and was estimated to be 5062 years old. The tree was sampled by Edmund Schulman and dated by Tom Harlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm |title=OLDLIST, a database of old trees |last=Brown |first=Peter M |date=2012 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc. |access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In bacteria==
Among [[bacteria]], individual organisms are vulnerable and can easily die, but on the level of the [[Colony (biology)|colony]], bacteria can live indefinitely. The two daughter bacteria resulting from [[cell division]] of a parent bacterium can be regarded as unique individuals or as members of a biologically “immortal” colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Lin|author2=Guttman, David S.|title=A Model for Damage Load and Its Implications for the Evolution of Bacterial Aging|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=26 August 2010|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e1001076|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001076|pmid=20865171|pmc=2928801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two daughter cells can be regarded as “rejuvenated” copies of the parent cell because damaged macromolecules have been split between the two cells and diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rang|first=Camilla U.|author2=Peng, Annie Y. |author3=Chao, Lin |title=Temporal Dynamics of Bacterial Aging and Rejuvenation|journal=Current Biology|date=8 November 2011|volume=21|issue=21|pages=1813–1816|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.09.018|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010207|pmid=22036179}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[asexual reproduction]].

==Cryptobiosis==
Some rare organisms, such as [[tardigrade]]s, usually have short lifespans, but are able to survive for thousands of years — and, perhaps, indefinitely — if they enter into the state of [[cryptobiosis]], whereby their [[metabolism]] is reversibly suspended. It is hypothesized by advocates of [[cryonics]] that the human [[central nervous system]] can be similarly put into a state of [[suspended animation]] shortly before [[brain death]] to be revived at a future point in the technological development of humankind when such operation would be possible.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Homology ==
[[Homologous protein|Homologues]] of the NicO family have differing predicted topologies: 6, 7 and 8 TMSs. One such homologue, RcnA (YohM; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.113.1.1 TC# 2.A.113.1.1]) of ''E. coli'' (274 aas) has 6 putative transmembrane segments (TMSs) in a 3 + 3 arrangement with a large hydrophilic loop between putativeTMSs 3 and 4.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Several homologues of RcnA (e.g., RcnA homologue from ''[[Ralstonia solanacearum]]''; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.113.1.3 TC# 2.A.113.1.3]; CAD17703) have 7 putative TMSs (4 + 3). Still another homologue, UreH of ''Methanocaldococcus janaschii'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.113.1.4 TC# 2.A.113.1.4]) has 6 putative TMSs in a more characteristic 3 + 3 TMS arrangement. The NicO family within the [[Lysine Exporter|LysE superfamily]] may have a common origin with the [[TOG Superfamily|TOG superfamily]], having lost TMSs 1 and 4 in the 8 TMS TOG superfamily topology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Function ==
This protein is believed to catalyze Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

The overall reaction catalyzed by proteins of the NicO family is probably:

[Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] (in) → [Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] (out).

'''Parallel metaheuristic''' is a class of techniques that are capable of reducing both the numerical effort{{clarify|date=June 2015}} and the run time of a [[metaheuristic]]. To this end, concepts and technologies from the field of parallelism in [[computer science]] are used to enhance and even completely modify the behavior of existing metaheuristics.  Just as it exists a long list of metaheuristics like [[evolutionary algorithm]]s, [[particle swarm]], [[ant colony optimization]], [[simulated annealing]], etc. it also exists a large set of different techniques strongly or loosely based in these ones, whose behavior encompasses the multiple parallel execution of algorithm components that cooperate in some way to solve a problem on a given parallel hardware platform.

==Background==

[[File:Parallel models.png|x300px|thumb | An example of different implementations of the same PSO metaheuristic model.]]

In practice, optimization (and searching, and learning) problems are often [[NP-hard]], complex, and time consuming.
Two major approaches are traditionally used to tackle these problems: exact methods
and [[metaheuristics]].{{disputed inline|date=June 2015}} Exact methods allow to find exact solutions but are often impractical as they are
extremely time-consuming for real-world problems (large dimension, hardly constrained, multimodal,
time-varying, epistatic problems). Conversely, metaheuristics provide sub-optimal (sometimes optimal)
solutions in a reasonable time. Thus, metaheuristics usually allow to meet the resolution delays imposed
in the industrial field as well as they allow to study general problem classes instead that particular
problem instances. In general, many of the best performing techniques in precision and effort to solve
complex and real-world problems are metaheuristics. Their fields of application range from combinatorial
optimization, bioinformatics, and telecommunications to economics, software engineering, etc. These fields are full of many
tasks needing fast solutions of high quality. See [http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470293322.html] for more details on complex applications.

Metaheuristics fall in two categories: '''trajectory-based''' metaheuristics and '''population-based''' metaheuristics. The main difference of these two kind of methods relies in the number of tentative
solutions used in each step of the (iterative) algorithm. A trajectory-based technique starts with a single
initial solution and, at each step of the search, the current solution is replaced by another (often the best)
solution found in its neighborhood. It is usual that trajectory-based metaheuristics allow to quickly find
a locally optimal solution, and so they are called '''exploitation-oriented''' methods promoting intensification
in the search space. On the other hand, population-based algorithms make use of a population of solutions.
The initial population is in this case randomly generated (or created with a [[greedy algorithm]]),
and then enhanced through an iterative process. At each generation of the process, the whole population
(or a part of it) is replaced by newly generated individuals (often the best ones). These techniques are
called '''exploration-oriented''' methods, since their main ability resides in the diversification in the search
space.

Most basic metaheuristics are sequential. Although their utilization allows to significantly reduce
the temporal complexity of the search process, this latter remains high for real-world problems arising
in both academic and industrial domains. Therefore, parallelism comes as a natural way not to only
reduce the search time, but also to improve the quality of the provided solutions.

For a comprehensive discussion on how parallelism can be mixed with metaheuristics see [http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471678066.html].

==Parallel trajectory-based metaheuristics==
Metaheuristics for solving optimization problems could be viewed as ''walks through neighborhoods''
tracing search trajectories through the solution domains of the problem at hands:

'''Algorithm:''' ''Sequential trajectory-based general pseudo-code''&lt;br /&gt;
Generate(''s''(0));        // Initial solution &lt;br /&gt;
''t'' := 0;                // Numerical step &lt;br /&gt;

'''endwhile'''

Walks are performed by iterative procedures that allow moving from one solution to another one in
the solution space (see the above algorithm). This kind of metaheuristics perform the moves in the neighborhood
of the current solution, i.e., they have a perturbative nature. The walks start from a solution randomly
generated or obtained from another optimization algorithm. At each iteration, the current solution
is replaced by another one selected from the set of its neighboring candidates. The search process is
stopped when a given condition is satisfied (a maximum number of generation, find a solution with a
target quality, stuck for a given time, . . . ).

A powerful way to achieve high computational efficiency with trajectory-based methods is the use of
parallelism. Different parallel models have been proposed for trajectory-based metaheuristics, and three
of them are commonly used in the literature: the parallel ''multi-start'' model, the parallel
exploration and evaluation of the ''neighborhood'' (or parallel moves model), and the parallel ''evaluation'' of
a single solution (or move acceleration model):

• '''Parallel multi-start model''': It consists in simultaneously launching several trajectory-based
methods for computing better and robust solutions. They may be heterogeneous or homogeneous,
independent or cooperative, start from the same or different solution(s), and configured with the
same or different parameters.

• '''Parallel moves model''': It is a low-level master-slave model that does not alter the behavior of
the heuristic. A sequential search would compute the same result but slower. At the beginning
of each iteration, the master duplicates the current solution between distributed nodes. Each one
separately manages their candidate/solution and the results are returned to the master.

• '''Move acceleration model''': The quality of each move is evaluated in a parallel centralized way.
That model is particularly interesting when the evaluation function can be itself parallelized as
it is CPU time-consuming and/or I/O intensive. In that case, the function can be viewed as an
aggregation of a certain number of partial functions{{clarify|date=June 2015}} that can be run in parallel.

==Parallel population-based metaheuristics==

Population-based metaheuristic are stochastic search techniques that have been successfully applied in many real and complex applications (epistatic, multimodal, multi-objective, and highly constrained problems).
A population-based algorithm is an iterative technique that applies stochastic operators on a pool
of individuals: the population (see the algorithm below). Every individual in the population is the encoded version of a tentative solution. An evaluation function associates a fitness value to every individual indicating its suitability to the problem. Iteratively, the probabilistic application of variation operators on selected individuals guides the population to tentative solutions of higher quality. The most well-known metaheuristic families based on the manipulation of a population of solutions are [[evolutionary algorithm]]s (EAs), [[ant colony optimization]] (ACO), [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO), [[scatter search]] (SS), [[differential evolution]] (DE), and [[estimation distribution algorithms]] (EDA).

'''Algorithm:''' ''Sequential population-based metaheuristic pseudo-code'' &lt;br /&gt;
Generate(P(0)); // Initial population &lt;br /&gt;
''t'' := 0;          // Numerical step &lt;br /&gt;
'''while not''' Termination Criterion(P(''t'')) '''do''' &lt;br /&gt;
...Evaluate(P(''t'')); // Evaluation of the population &lt;br /&gt;
...P′′(''t'') := Apply Variation Operators(P′(''t'')); // Generation of new solutions &lt;br /&gt;
...P(''t'' + 1) := Replace(P(''t''), P′′(''t'')); // Building the next population &lt;br /&gt;
...''t'' := ''t'' + 1; &lt;br /&gt;
'''endwhile'''

For non-trivial problems, executing the reproductive cycle of a simple population-based method on
long individuals and/or large populations usually requires high computational resources. In general, evaluating a ''fitness'' function for every individual is frequently the most costly operation of this algorithm.
Consequently, a variety of algorithmic issues are being studied to design efficient techniques. These issues usually consist of defining new operators, hybrid algorithms, parallel models, and so on.

Parallelism arises naturally when dealing with populations, since each of the individuals belonging to it is an independent unit (at least according to the ''Pittsburg'' style, although there are other approaches like the ''Michigan'' one which do not consider the individual as independent units). Indeed, the performance of population-based algorithms is often improved when running in parallel. Two parallelizing strategies are specially focused on population-based algorithms:

(1) '''Parallelization of computations''', in which the operations commonly applied to each of the individuals are performed in parallel, and

(2) '''Parallelization of population''', in which the population is split in different parts that can be simply exchanged or evolved separately, and then joined later.

In the beginning of the parallelization history of these algorithms, the well-known '''master-slave''' (also known as ''global parallelization'' or ''farming'') method was used. In this approach, a central processor performs the selection operations while the associated slave processors (workers) run the variation operator and the evaluation of the fitness function. This algorithm has the same behavior as the sequential one, although its computational efficiency is improved, especially for time consuming objective functions. On the other hand, many researchers use a pool of processors to speed up the execution of a sequential algorithm, just because independent runs can be made more rapidly by using several processors than by using a single one. In this case, no interaction at all exists between the independent runs.

However, actually most parallel population-based techniques found in the literature utilize some
kind of spatial disposition for the individuals, and then parallelize the resulting chunks in a pool of processors. Among the most widely known types of structured metaheuristics, the '''distributed''' (or coarse grain) and '''cellular''' (or fine grain) algorithms are very popular optimization procedures.

In the case of distributed ones, the population is partitioned in a set of subpopulations (islands) in which isolated serial algorithms are executed. Sparse exchanges of individuals are performed among these islands with the goal of introducing some diversity into the subpopulations, thus preventing search of getting stuck in local optima. In order to design a distributed metaheuristic, we{{Who|date=April 2012}} must take several decisions. Among them, a chief decision is to determine the migration policy: topology (logical links between the islands), migration rate (number of individuals that undergo migration in every exchange), migration frequency (number of steps in every subpopulation between two successive exchanges), and the selection/replacement of the migrants.

In the case of a cellular method, the concept of neighborhood is introduced, so that an individual
may only interact with its nearby neighbors in the breeding loop. The overlapped small neighborhood in the algorithm helps in exploring the search space because a slow diffusion of solutions through the population provides a kind of exploration, while exploitation takes place inside each neighborhood. See [https://www.springer.com/business/operations+research/book/978-0-387-77609-5] for more information on cellular Genetic Algorithms and related models.

Also, hybrid models are being proposed in which a two-level approach of parallelization is undertaken. In general, the higher level for parallelization is a coarse-grained implementation and the basic island performs a cellular, a master-slave method or even another distributed one.

{{Lead rewrite|date=October 2018|reason=various issues, as discussed on talk page}}

'''Patience''' (or '''[[wikt:forbearance#English|forbearance]]''') is the ability to endure difficult circumstances such as perseverance in the face of delay; tolerance of provocation without responding in annoyance/[[anger]]; or forbearance when under strain, especially when faced with longer-term difficulties. Patience is the level of endurance one can have before negativity. It is also used to refer to the [[character trait]] of being steadfast. [[Antonyms]] include [[Wiktionary: hasty|hastiness]] and [[wiktionary: impetuous|impetuousness]].

== Scientific perspectives ==
{{See also|Delayed gratification|Reward dependence|Reward system}}

In [[psychology]] and in [[cognitive neuroscience]], patience is studied as a [[decision-making]] problem, involving the choice of either a small reward in the short-term, versus a more valuable reward in the long-term. When given a choice, all animals, humans included, are ''inclined'' to favour short-term rewards over long-term rewards. This is despite the often greater benefits associated with long-term rewards.

In 2005 a study involving [[common marmoset]]s and [[cottontop tamarin]]s, animals of both species faced a [[self-control]] paradigm in which individuals chose between taking an immediate small reward and waiting a variable amount of time for a large reward. Under these conditions, marmosets waited significantly longer for food than tamarins. This difference cannot be explained by life history, social behaviour or brain size. It can, however, be explained by feeding ecology: marmosets rely on [[Gum (botany)|gum]], a food product acquired by waiting for exudate to flow from trees, whereas tamarins feed on [[insect]]s, a food product requiring impulsive action. [[Foraging]] ecology, therefore, may provide a selective pressure for the evolution of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The ecology and evolution of patience in two New World monkeys |journal= Biology Letters|volume= 1|issue= 2|pages= 223–226|date= |pmc=1626214|year= 2005|author1= Stevens|first1= J.

Patience of human users in the online world has been the subject of much recent scientific research. In a 2012 study&lt;ref name="people.cs.umass.edu"/&gt; involving tens of millions of users who watched videos on the Internet, Krishnan and [[Ramesh Sitaraman|Sitaraman]]  show that online users lose patience in as little as two seconds while waiting for their chosen video to start playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/tech/web/video-loading-study/| title =CNN: Online viewers ditch slow-loading video after 2 seconds, November 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that users who are connected to the Internet at faster speeds are less patient than their counterparts connected at slower speeds, demonstrating a link between the human expectation of speed and human patience. These and other scientific studies of patience have led many social commentators to conclude that the rapid pace of technology is rewiring humans to be less and less patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/10/168974423/in-video-streaming-rat-race-fast-is-never-fast-enough/| title =NPR Morning Edition: In Video-Streaming Rat Race, Fast is Never Fast Enough, October 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/02/01/the-growing-culture-impatience-where-instant-gratification-makes-crave-more-instant-gratification/q8tWDNGeJB2mm45fQxtTQP/story.html?s_campaign=8315| title =Boston Globe: Instant gratification is making us perpetually impatient, Feb 2013 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.roughtype.com/?p=2069 | title= Patience is a Network Effect, by Nicholas Carr, Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious perspectives ==
[[File:Three virtues Patientia.jpg|thumb|Three virtues by Jan Saenredam after Hendrik Goltzius. This is plate 2, titled Patientia.]]

=== Judaism ===
Patience and fortitude are prominent themes in [[Judaism]]. The [[Talmud]] extols patience as an important personal trait. The story of Micah, for example, is that he suffers many challenging conditions and yet endures, saying "I will wait for the God who saves me." Patience in God, it is said, will aid believers in finding the strength to be delivered from the evils that are inherent in the physical life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firestone |first=Reuven |title=Patience |url=http://www.huc.edu/chronicle/60/patience.shtml |accessdate=2008-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117061152/http://www.huc.edu/chronicle/60/patience.shtml |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sefer Torah|Hebrew Torah]], patience is referred to in several proverbs, such as "The patient man shows much good sense, but the quick-tempered man displays folly at its height" ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 14:29, NAB); "An ill-tempered man stirs up strife, but a patient man allays discord." (Proverbs 15:18, NAB); and "A patient man is better than a warrior, and he who rules his temper, than he who takes a city." (Proverbs 16:32). The emotion is also discussed in other sections, such as Ecclesiastes: "Better is the patient spirit than the lofty spirit. Do not in spirit become quickly discontented, for discontent lodges in the bosom of a fool." ([[Ecclesiastes]] 7:8-9, NAB).

=== Christianity ===
In the [[Christianity|Christian religion]], patience is one of the most valuable [[virtue|virtues]] of [[Life expectancy|life]]. Increasing patience is viewed as the work of the [[Holy Ghost]] in the Christian who has accepted the gift of [[salvation]]. While patience is not one of the traditional biblical three [[theological virtues]] nor one of the traditional [[cardinal virtues]], it is part of the [[fruit of the Holy Spirit]], according to the [[Apostle Paul]] in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]].&lt;ref&gt;See David Baily Harned, ''Patience: How We Wait Upon the World'', rev. ed. (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2015), chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian Bible]], patience is referred to in several sections. The [[Book of Proverbs]] notes that "through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone" (Proverbs 25:14-16, NIV); [[Ecclesiastes]] points out that the "end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride" (Ecclesiastes 7:7-9, NIV); and [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] states that we should "be patient with all. See that no one returns evil for evil; rather, always seek what is good for each other and for all" (1 Thessalonians 5:14-15, NAB). In the [[Epistle of James]], the Bible urges Christians to be patient, and " see how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth,...until it receives the early and the late rains." (James 5:7-11, NAB). In [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], patience is listed as part of the "fruit of the Spirit": "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law". (Galatians 5:21-23, NIV). In Timothy, the Bible states that "Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life".([[1 Timothy]] 1:15-17, [[NIV]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harned, David Baily (2015).

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Sabr (Islamic term)|l1=Sabr}}

Patience with steadfast belief in [[Allah]] is called ''sabr'' ({{lang-ar|صْبِرْ ṣabr}}), one of the best virtues of life in Islam. Through [[Sabr (Islamic term)|sabr]], a Muslim believes that an individual can grow closer to God and thus attain true peace. It is also stressed in Islam, that Allah is with those who are patient, more specifically during calamity and suffering. Several verses in Quran urge Muslims to seek Allah's help when faced with fear and loss, with patient prayers and perseverance for Allah. For example:&lt;ref&gt;see also: {{Cite quran|3|195|end=200}}, {{Cite quran|41|24|end=35}}, and {{Cite quran|11|114|end=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives or the fruits (of your toil), but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere; who say, when afflicted with calamity: "To Allah We belong, and to Him is our return".|Quran|{{Cite quran|2|155|end=156|expand=no}}}}

Similarly, patience is mentioned in hadith [[Sahih Bukhari]]:

{{quote|Narrated Aisha: I asked Allah’s rasool about the plague. He said, “That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whomsoever He wished, but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but '''has patience and hopes for Allah’s reward''', and knows that nothing will befall him except what Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.”|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|77|616}}|}}

In Islamic tradition,(''Ayyoob'') illustrates a story where he demonstrated patience and steadfast belief in [[Allah]]. [[Ibn Kathir]] narrates the story in the following manner: Job was a very rich person with much land, and many animals and children — all of which were lost and soon he was struck with disease as a test from Allah. He remained steadfast and patient in his prayers to Allah, so Allah eventually relieved him of the disease, gave him double the money he lost, and raised to life twice the number of children who had died before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ibn Kathir |authorlink= |title=Stories of the Prophet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_053Peu7XSgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9776005179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year= 2001|publisher=Dar Al-Manarah | isbn=977-6005-17-9 |pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Kshanti}}

In [[Buddhism]], patience ([[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''kshanti''; [[Pali]]: ''khanti'') is one of the "perfections" (''[[paramita]]s'') that a [[bodhisattva]] trains in and practices to realize perfect enlightenment (''[[bodhi]]''). The Buddhist concept of patience is distinct from the English definition of the word. In Buddhism, patience refers to not returning harm, rather than merely enduring a difficult situation. It is the ability to control one's emotions even when being criticized or attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/the-ten-perfections-in-theravada-mahayana-and-bon |title=Alexander Berzin, The Ten Perfections in Theravada, Mahayana and Bon, 1995 |publisher=StudyBuddhism.com |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 184 of the [[Dhammapada]] it is said that 'enduring patience is the highest austerity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buddharakkhita|first1=Acharya|title=Dhammapada, 184|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.14.budd.html#dhp-184|website=Access to Insight|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
Patience and forbearance is considered an essential virtue in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/665848/sanatana-dharma See virtues discussed under article on Sanatana Dharma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, T. (2009), Schopenhauer’s compassionate morality, Philosophy Now, 52, 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient literature of Hinduism, the concept of patience is referred to with the word ''pariksaha'' (patience and forbearance, Sanskrit: परिषहा),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=pariSahA&amp;link=m see PariSahA], Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Search for sanskrit word pariSahA] Monier Williams Translation of Sanskrit Concepts, University of Koln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; and several other words such as sahiṣṇutā (patient toleration, Sanskrit: सहिष्णुता),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=patience&amp;link=m Sanskrit words related to "Patience" in Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany] See also Monier Williams Translation of Sanskrit Concepts&lt;/ref&gt; ''titiksha'' (forbearance, Sanskrit: तितिक्षा),&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, A.

Patience, in Hindu philosophy, is the cheerful endurance of trying conditions and the consequence of one's action and deeds ([[karma]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gsoy/gsoy06.htm Shankaracharya's Vedānta] Ernest Wood, {{ISBN|978-1425482596}}, see Chapter 4, under GNYANA-YOGA, pp 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the capacity to wait, endure opposites - such as pain and pleasure, cold and heat, sorrows and joys - calmly, without anxiety, and without a desire to seek revenge.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Nathan (2000), Hinduism that is Sanatana Dharma, {{ISBN|81-7597-065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tattvabhushan, S. (1898), Sankvracharya (His life and teaching: a translation of Atma-Bodha), 2nd Edition, The Society for the Resuscitation of Indian Literature&lt;/ref&gt; In interpersonal relationships, virtuous ''titiksha'' means that if someone attacks or insults without cause, one must endure it without feeling enmity, anger, resentment or anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, A. and Rigby, A. (2009), [http://curve.coventry.ac.uk/open/file/a9392056-ec87-76d1-89ac-b9b379a28501/1/huntergandhi.pdf Gandhi and the virtue of forgiveness], Gandhi Marg 30 (4), see page 430&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of patience is explained as being more than trust, and as a value that reflects the state of one's body and mind.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; The term ''pariksaha'' is sometimes also translated as test or exam, in other contexts. Some of these concepts have been carried into the spiritual understanding of yoga. Sandilya [[Upanishad]] of Hinduism identifies ten sources of patience and forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. In each of these ten forbearances, the virtuous implicit belief is that our current spirit and the future for everyone, including oneself, will be stronger if these forbearances are one's guide.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It too discusses patience and forbearance, dedicating Chapter 16 of Book 1 to it. ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' suggests ''patience'' is necessary for an ethical life and one's long term happiness, even if patience is sometimes difficult in the short term. Some of the verse excerpts from this book are: "our conduct must always foster forbearance"; "one must patiently endure rude remarks, because it delivers us to purity"; "if we are unjustly wronged by others, it is best to conquer our hurt with patience, accept suffering, and refrain from unrighteous retaliation"; "it is good to patiently endure injuries done to you, but to forget them is even better"; "just as the Earth bears those who dig into her, one must with patience bear with those who despise us", and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U.

=== Meher Baba ===
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that "[O]ne of the first requirements of the [spiritual] aspirant is that he should combine ''unfailing enthusiasm with unyielding patience''....Spiritual effort demands not only physical endurance and courage, but also unshrinking forbearance and unassailable moral courage."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''3'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 118-119. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical perspectives ==
In ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that "being able to wait is so hard that the greatest poets did not disdain to make the inability to wait the theme of their poetry." He notes that "Passion will not wait", and gives the example of cases of duels, in which the "advising friends have to determine whether the parties involved might be able to wait a while longer. If they cannot, then a duel is reasonable [because]...to wait would be to continue suffering the horrible torture of offended honor...".

== Impatience ==

Impatience is not just the opposite of patience or the lack of it, it is more than that. Impatience is also a cultural phenomenon in many respects. There are deep-rooted psychological and social reasons for both feelings of and displays of impatience.

=== Examples of Impatience ===
The term '[[road rage]]' is commonly used to refer to situations that are the result of some form of impatience, though of course there can be other factors involved. This phrase refers to circumstances where one or both drivers get into a confrontation in which they are emotionally involved. Driving anywhere in the world can be frustrating. However, attitudes towards annoying circumstances vary widely from one place to another. Excessive honking, as a further example of impatience, is very common in some countries, but not so much in others.

Behavior in '''restaurants and other public places''' is another example. People can often be rude and impatient toward other patrons, as well as to the staff serving customers. Although a customer may have legitimate complaints about something, there is really no justification to be difficult about it. On the other hand, there is no reason for staff to be surly or curt with customers, but it does happen, all too often.&lt;ref&gt;sounds bias&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telephone service and support''' is another situation where customers can become impatient with company representatives. This may partly be the result of changes in how these support services work. In an effort to save expense costs, many organizations have automated part of all of these services. This starts off the process, in the customer's view, on a somewhat unpleasant note. By the time the client has maneuvered their way through the system, including being on hold for a significant length of time, and sometimes eventually reaching the wrong person for whatever reason, the customer is understandably upset.

=== Positive Aspects of Impatience ===
Impatience is usually viewed as a negative thing. Patience should not be confused with laziness, complacency or inaptitude. Laziness is lacking a desire to fix a certain problem or complete a job. Laziness means that one's desire to do other things than a given task outweighs the desire to do that particular task. This is not the same as being patient with a process.

The Perl programming culture has famously declared Impatience to be a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://threevirtues.com/ ''The Three Virtues'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Product quality risk in supply chain''' focuses on the quality problems in the supply chain context rather in the manufacturing quality context.

==Definition==
Tse and Tan (2009) &lt;ref&gt;Tse, Y.K. and Tan K.H., 2009. Product Quality Risk in Multi-tier Global Supply Chain, 3rd ICOSCM Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the concept of “Product Quality Risk in Supply Chain” as:

''Inherent quality problems (i.e. raw materials / ingredients / production / logistics / packaging) in any of the supply members trigger a domino effect that spread through a multi-tier supply network. For this reason, it is hard for a network member to keep track of who did what, and when, to the final quality of the products. The product that a focal firm sells to the consumer comprises components made by the focal firm and the suppliers. When the product breaks down due to defects in either the firm’s component or the supplier’s component, the firm has to bear the consequences.''

==In practice==
Thus, product quality risk is an inherent part of the supply chain risks. In other words, it tends to comprise some or all of the risk elements, such as [[operational risk]], disruption risk and reputational risk. For example, when lead was found in their toys, it tarnished [[Mattel]]’s reputation, and disrupted the supply of its products in the market.

In the literature, the concept of product quality risk has not been fully investigated. Although Zsidisim (2003) &lt;ref&gt;Zsidisin, G. A., 2003. Managerial perceptions of supply risk. Journal of Supply Chain Management, 39(1): 14-25.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that quality risk includes the risk of producing unsafe products that can harm the consumer, even when these defects are caused by another firm or inherited from a sub-contractor. However, neither PQR nor its [[Domino theory|domino effect]] in the [[supply chain]] have been thoroughly studied.

The product quality risk in global supply chain concept, though similar to “product harm crisis” (defined as defective or dangerous products) (Dawar &amp; Pillutla, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dawar, N. and Pillutla, M., 2000. The impact of product-harm crises on brand equity: The moderating role of consumer expectations. Journal of Marketing Research, XXXVII: 215-226.&lt;/ref&gt; and “moral hazard problem” (defined as the outcome of [[Information asymmetry|asymmetric information]], imperfect observability in supplier’s quality) (Hwang et al., 2006),&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, I., [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]] and L. N. Su, 2006. Vendor Certification and Appraisal: Implications for Supplier Quality. Management Science, 52(10): 1472-1482.&lt;/ref&gt; are not about the risk of product quality in a global supply chain context.

[[Image:Seaton Delaval Hall - all from NW with tree.jpg|thumb|right|[[Seaton Delaval Hall]], built by the Delavals and the former seat of the Astley family]]
'''Rhoda Delaval Astley''' (1 July 1725 – 1757) was an English aristocrat and artist. She was married to [[Sir Edward Astley, 4th Baronet|Edward Astley]], with whom she had a daughter and three sons. Lady Astley studied painting with [[Arthur Pond]], who painted her portrait. [[Seaton Delaval Hall]] passed from the Delaval family to the Astley family through her descendants.

==Early life==
Rhoda Delaval was born on 1 July 1725 to Captain [[Francis Blake Delaval (1692–1752)|Francis Blake Delaval]] (the elder) and Rhoda Apreece and baptized at [[St George's, Hanover Square]] in London{{r|National Trust}}{{r|Northumberland}}  on 22 July 1725.{{r|Cole}}{{rp|133}} She was their oldest daughter{{r|National Trust}} of 12 children.{{r|Jeffares}} Her siblings were Anne Hussey, Mary Elizabeth, Sarah, Robert, George, Henry, Ralph, Francis, Edward, Thomas, [[John Delaval, 1st Baron Delaval|John]].{{r|Northumberland}} Two years after her birth, her brother, [[Francis Blake Delaval (1727–1771)|Sir Francis Blake Delaval]] (the younger) (1727–1771) was born.{{r|BBC 1}} A brother George, who died as a young adult, also pursued the art of painting with her instructor, [[Arthur Pond]]. She was known to be a talented, beautiful woman.{{r|Jeffares}} One of her sisters was [[John Savile, 1st Earl of Mexborough|Sarah, Countess of Mexborough]].{{r|Jeffares}}

==Marriage and children==
[[File:11 Downing Street - geograph.org.uk - 253377.jpg|thumb|[[11 Downing Street]] (grey building), London]]
On 23 May 1751,{{r|Northumberland}} she married [[Sir Edward Astley, 4th Baronet|Edward Astley]], who became the 4th Baronet of [[Melton Constable]].{{r|National Trust}} They lived at [[11 Downing Street]] when in London.{{r|Jeffares}} Astley gave birth to four children, one daughter and three sons.{{r|National Trust}} Editha Rhoda was born 14 April 1755 and died by 12 May, when she was brought to be buried.

Edward Astley lived at [[Melton Constable]] with his children after her death.{{r|National Trust}} Her letters, before and after her marriage, describe the personal daily lives of the people she knew in Northumberland.{{r|National Trust}} As the result of Edward and Rhoda's marriage, [[Seaton Delaval Hall]] came into the Astley family in 1814 through Jacob, when none of her brothers produced a male heir.{{r|National Trust}}{{r|Cole}}{{rp|134}}

==Artist==
Periodically between 1744 and 1750, Astley studied art under Arthur Pond, who also painted her portrait.{{r|National Trust}}{{r|Jeffares}} She purchased prints for about £1,500 ({{inflation|UK|1,500|1750|cursign=£|fmt=eq}}) from Pond.{{r|Jeffares}}

The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] has the painting of her drawing with pastels.{{r|National Trust}} Her painting of [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Sir Jacob Astley]], 1st Baron Astley of Reading was made from a 17th-century original painting.{{r|BBC 2}} She made a painting of herself and her brother entitled ''Painting and Poetry'', patterned after [[Bernardino Luini]].{{r|BBC 1}} The painting of Anne Hussey Delaval (1737–1812), Lady Stanhope in the National Trust is attributed to Rhoda Delaval and is loan by Lord Hastings.{{r|BBC 3}} Lady Anne Delaval Stanhope was Astley's sister.{{r|Cole}}{{rp|183}} She had been commissioned, for a total of about £300 ({{inflation|UK|300|1750|cursign=£|fmt=eq}}), to paint portraits of her sisters and brothers.{{r|Jeffares}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56498">'''Sensory substitution''' is a change of the characteristics of one [[sensory modality]] into stimuli of another sensory modality.

A sensory substitution system consists of three parts: a sensor, a coupling system, and a stimulator. The sensor records stimuli and gives them to a coupling system which interprets these signals and transmits them to a stimulator. In case the sensor obtains signals of a kind not originally available to the bearer it is a case of [[#Sensory augmentation|sensory augmentation]]. Sensory substitution concerns human [[perception]] and the [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the human brain; and therefore, allows us to study these aspects of neuroscience more through [[neuroimaging]].

It is hoped{{according to whom|date=March 2017}} that sensory substitution systems can help people by restoring their ability to perceive  certain defective sensory modality by using sensory information from a functioning sensory modality.

==History==
The idea of sensory substitution was introduced in the '60s by [[Paul Bach-y-Rita]] as a means of using one sensory modality, mainly [[Touch|taction]], to gain environmental information to be used by another sensory modality, mainly [[Visual perception|vision]].&lt;ref name = "TVSS"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bach-y-Rita P, Collins CC, Saunders F, White B, Scadden L|year=1969|title=Vision substitution by tactile the image projection|journal=Nature|volume=221|pages=963–964|pmid=5818337|doi=10.1038/221963a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A History of the Mind: Evolution and the Birth of Consciousness | author = [[Nicholas Humphrey]] | publisher = Springer | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-387-98719-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W8G8Oji53XsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22Paul+Bach-y-Rita%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=RMn3R7zKFaistAPnxpiFCg&amp;sig=KtTuO7ZgvcsSLGFk2Y_VLE07U-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the entire field was discussed by Chaim-Meyer Scheff in "Experimental model for the study of changes in the organization of human sensory information processing through the design and testing of non-invasive prosthetic devices for sensory impaired people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/15711.15713|title=Experimental Model for the Study of Changes in the Organization of Human Sensory Information Processing Through the Design and Testing of Non-invasive Prosthetic Devices for Sensory Impaired People|first=Chaim-Meyer|last=Scheff|date=1 January 1986|journal=SIGCAPH Comput.

==Physiology==
When a person becomes blind or deaf they generally do not lose the ability to hear or see; they simply lose their ability to transmit the sensory signals from the periphery ([[retina]] for visions and [[cochlea]] for hearing) to brain.&lt;ref name = "bach"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bach-y-Rita P, Kercel SW|year=2003|title=Sensory substitution and the human-machine interface|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=12|pages=541–546|pmid=14643370|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2003.10.013|url=http://hci.ucsd.edu/102a/readings/SensorySubstitution.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the vision processing pathways are still intact, a person who has lost the ability to retrieve data from the retina can still see subjective images by using data gathered from other sensory modalities such as touch or audition.&lt;ref name="Regan, JK 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O'Regan, JK|author2=Noe, A.|year=2001|title=A sensorimotor account of vision and visual consciousness|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=24|issue=5|pages=939–973|pmid=12239892|doi=10.1017/s0140525x01000115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a regular visual system, the data collected by the retina is converted into an electrical stimulus in the [[optic nerve]] and relayed to the brain, which re-creates the image and perceives it. Because it is the brain that is responsible for the final perception, sensory substitution is possible. During sensory substitution an intact sensory modality relays information to the visual perception areas of the brain so that the person can perceive sight. With sensory substitution, information gained from one sensory modality can reach brain structures physiologically related to other sensory modalities. Touch-to-visual sensory substitution transfers information from touch receptors to the visual cortex for interpretation and perception. For example, through [[fMRI]], one can determine which parts of the brain are activated during sensory perception. In blind persons, it is seen that while they are only receiving tactile information, their visual cortex is also activated as they perceive ''sight'' objects.&lt;ref&gt;Bach-y-Rita P. ''Brain Mechanisms in Sensory Substitution'', Academic Press New York:1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Touch-to-touch sensory substitution is also possible, wherein information from touch receptors of one region of the body can be used to perceive touch in another region. For example, in one experiment by Bach-y-Rita,touch perception was able to be restored in a patient who lost peripheral sensation due to leprosy.&lt;ref name = "six"&gt;Bach-y-Rita P. ''Nonsynaptic Diffusion Neurotransmission and Late Brain Reorganization'', Demos-Vermande, New York :1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological support===
In order to achieve sensory substitution and stimulate the brain without intact sensory organs to relay the information, machines can be used to do the signal transduction, rather than the sensory organs. This [[brain–machine interface]] collects external signals and transforms them into electrical signals for the brain to interpret. Generally, a camera or a microphone is used to collect visual or auditory stimuli that are used to replace lost sight and hearing, respectively. The visual or auditory data collected from the sensors is transformed into tactile stimuli that are then relayed to the brain for visual and auditory perception. This and all types of sensory substitution are only possible due to neuroplasticity.&lt;ref name ="six"/&gt;

===Brain plasticity===
''[[Neuroplasticity|Brain plasticity]]'' refers to the brain's ability to adapt to a changing environment, for instance to the absence or deterioration of a sense. It is conceivable that [[cortical remapping]] or reorganization in response to the loss of one sense may be an evolutionary mechanism that allows people to adapt and compensate by using other senses better. Functional imaging of congenitally blind patients showed a cross-modal recruitment of the [[occipital cortex]] during perceptual tasks such as Braille reading, tactile perception, tactual object recognition, sound localization, and sound discrimination.&lt;ref name = "Three"/&gt; This may suggest that blind people can use their occipital lobe, generally used for vision, to perceive objects through the use of other sensory modalities. This [[cross modal plasticity]] may explain the often described tendency of blind people to show enhanced ability in the other senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Boven|first=R.

===Perception versus sensing===
While considering the physiological aspects of sensory substitution, it is essential to distinguish between sensing and perceiving. The general question posed by this differentiation is: Are blind people seeing or ''perceiving'' to see by putting together different sensory data? While sensation comes in one modality – visual, auditory, tactile etc. – perception due to sensory substitution is not one modality but a result of cross-modal interactions. It is therefore concluded that while sensory substitution for vision induces visual-like perception in ''sighted'' individuals, it induces auditory or tactile perception in ''blind'' individuals.&lt;ref name = "eight"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Poirier C, De Volder AG, Scheiber C|year=2007|title=What neuroimaging tells us about sensory substitution|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1064–1070|pmid=17688948|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, blind people ''perceive'' to see through touch and audition with sensory substitution.

==Different applications==
Applications are not restricted to handicapped persons, but also include [[art]]istic presentations, [[game]]s, and [[augmented reality]]. Some examples are substitution of visual stimuli to audio or tactile, and of audio stimuli to tactile. Some of the most popular are probably Paul Bach-y-Rita's Tactile Vision Sensory Substitution (TVSS), developed with Carter Collins at [[Smith-Kettlewell Institute]] and [[Peter Bartus Leonard Meijer|Peter Meijer]]'s Seeing with Sound approach (The vOICe). Technical developments, such as [[miniaturization]] and [[electrical stimulation]] help the advance of sensory substitution devices.

In sensory substitution systems, we generally have sensors that collect the data from the external environment. This data is then relayed to a coupling system that interprets and transduces the information and then replays it to a stimulator. This stimulator ultimately stimulates a functioning sensory modality.&lt;ref name = "eight"/&gt; After training, people learn to use the information gained from this stimulation to experience a perception of the sensation they lack instead of the actually stimulated sensation. For example, a leprosy patient, whose perception of peripheral touch was restored, was equipped with a glove containing artificial contact sensors coupled to skin sensory receptors on the forehead (which was stimulated). After training and acclimation, the patient was able to experience data from the glove as if it was originating in the fingertips while ignoring the sensations in the forehead.&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt;

===Tactile systems===
To understand ''tactile sensory substitution'' it is essential to understand some basic physiology of the tactile receptors of the skin. There are five basic types of tactile receptors: [[Lamellar corpuscle|Pacinian corpuscle]], [[Meissner's corpuscle]], [[Bulbous corpuscle|Ruffini ending]]s, [[Merkel nerve ending]]s, and [[free nerve ending]]s. These receptors are mainly characterized by which type of stimuli best activates them, and by their rate of adaptation to sustained stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vallbo AB, Johansson RS|year=1984|title=Properties of cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the human hand related to touch sensation|journal=Human Neurobiology|volume=3|pages=3–14|pmid=6330008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the rapid adaptation of some of these receptors to sustained stimuli, those receptors require rapidly changing tactile stimulation systems in order to be optimally activated.&lt;ref name = "EV"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kaczmarek KA, Webster JG, Bach-y-Rita P, Tompkins WJ|year=1991|title= Electrotactile and vibrotactile displays for sensory substitution systems|journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|volume=38|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1109/10.68204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among all these mechanoreceptors Pacinian corpuscle offers the highest sensitivity to high frequency vibration starting from few 10s of Hz to a few kHz with the help of its specialized [[mechanotransduction]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TOH.2014.2369422 |title=Vibrotactile Sensitivity Threshold: Nonlinear Stochastic Mechanotransduction Model of the Pacinian Corpuscle |year=2015 |last1=Biswas |first1=Abhijit |journal=IEEE Transactions on Haptics |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=102–113 |pmid=25398183 |last2=Manivannan |first2=M. |last3=Srinivasan |first3=Mandyam A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TOH.2014.2369416 |title=Multiscale Layered Biomechanical Model of the Pacinian Corpuscle |year=2015 |last1=Biswas |first1=Abhijit |journal=IEEE Transactions on Haptics |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |pmid=25398182 |last2=Manivannan |first2=M. |last3=Srinivasan |first3=Mandyam A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two different types of stimulators: electrotactile or vibrotactile. Electrotactile stimulators use direct electrical stimulation of the nerve ending in the skin to initiate the action potentials; the sensation triggered, burn, itch, pain, pressure etc. depends on the stimulating voltage. Vibrotactile stimulators use pressure and the properties of the mechanoreceptors of the skin to initiate action potentials. There are advantages and disadvantages for both these stimulation systems. With the electrotactile stimulating systems a lot of factors affect the sensation triggered: stimulating voltage, current, waveform, electrode size, material, contact force, skin location, thickness and hydration.&lt;ref name = "EV"/&gt; Electrotactile stimulation may involve the direct stimulation of the nerves ([[percutaneous]]), or through the skin ([[transcutaneous]]). Percutaneous application causes additional distress to the patient, and is a major disadvantage of this approach. Furthermore, stimulation of the skin without insertion leads to the need for high voltage stimulation because of the high impedance of the dry skin,&lt;ref name = "EV"/&gt; unless the tongue is used as a receptor, which requires only about 3% as much voltage.&lt;ref name = "tong"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bach-y-Rita P, Kaczmarek KA, Tyler ME, Garcia-Lara J|title=Form perception with a 49-point electrotactile stimulus array on the tongue: a technical note|journal=J Rehabil Res Dev.|year=1998|volume=35|issue=4|pages=427–30|url=http://web.gc.cuny.edu/cogsci/private/bach-y-rita-tongue.pdf|pmid=10220221}} See also [[Brainport]]&lt;/ref&gt; This latter technique is undergoing clinical trials for various applications, and been approved for assistance to the blind in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/brainport2.htm|title=How BrainPort Works|work=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=July 21, 2016|author=Layton, Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wicab.com/media/Wicab%20Press%20Release%203-19-2013.pdf|title=Wicab Announces European Market Approval for its Non-Invasive Assistive Aid for the Blind|type=Press Release|publisher=Wicab, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507045650/http://www.wicab.com/media/Wicab%20Press%20Release%203-19-2013.pdf|archivedate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the roof of the mouth has been proposed as another area where low currents can be felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hui Tang |author2=D.

Vibrotactile systems use the properties of mechanoreceptors in the skin so they have fewer parameters that need to be monitored as compared to electrotactile stimulation. However, vibrotactile stimulation systems need to account for the rapid adaptation of the tactile sense.

Another important aspect of tactile sensory substitution systems is the location of the tactile stimulation. Tactile receptors are abundant on the fingertips, face, and tongue while sparse on the back, legs and arms. It is essential to take into account the spatial resolution of the receptor as it has a major effect on the resolution of the sensory substitution.&lt;ref name = "EV"/&gt; A high resolution pin-arrayed display is able to present spatial information via tactile symbols, such as city maps&lt;ref name="Zeng, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zeng|displayauthors=etal|year=2015|title=Interactive Audio-haptic Map Explorer on a Tactile Display|journal=Interacting with Computers|volume=27|issue=4|pages=413–429|doi=10.1093/iwc/iwu006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obstacle maps.&lt;ref name="Zeng, 2012"&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zeng|displayauthors=etal|year=2012|title=Exploration and avoidance of surrounding obstacles for the visually impaired|journal=Proc. of ACM ASSETS 2012|pages=111–118|doi=10.1145/2384916.2384936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below you can find some descriptions of current tactile substitution systems.

====Tactile–visual====
One of the earliest and most well known form of sensory substitution devices was Paul Bach-y-Rita's TVSS that converted the image from a video camera into a tactile image and coupled it to the tactile receptors on the [[back]] of his blind subject.&lt;ref name = "TVSS"/&gt; Recently, several new systems have been developed that interface the tactile image to tactile receptors on different areas of the body such as the on the chest, brow, fingertip, abdomen, and forehead.&lt;ref name = "bach"/&gt; The tactile image is produced by hundreds of activators placed on the person. The activators are [[solenoid]]s of one millimeter diameter. In experiments, [[blindness|blind]] (or [[blindfold]]ed) subjects equipped with the TVSS can learn to detect shapes and to orient themselves. In the case of simple geometric shapes, it took around 50 trials to achieve 100 percent correct recognition. To identify objects in different orientations requires several hours of learning.

A system using the tongue as the human-machine interface is most practical.  The tongue-machine interface is both protected by the closed mouth and the saliva in the mouth provides a good electrolytic environment that ensures good electrode contact.&lt;ref name = "tong"/&gt; Results from a study by Bach-y-Rita et al. show that electrotactile stimulation of the tongue required 3% of the voltage required to stimulate the finger.&lt;ref name = "tong"/&gt; Also, since it is more practical to wear an orthodontic retainer holding the stimulation system than an apparatus strapped to other parts of the body, the tongue-machine interface is more popular among TVSS systems.

This tongue TVSS system works by delivering electrotactile stimuli to the dorsum of the tongue via a flexible [[electrode array]] placed in the mouth. This electrode array is connected to a Tongue Display Unit [TDU] via a ribbon cable passing out of the mouth. A video camera records a picture, transfers it to the TDU for conversion into a tactile image. The tactile image is then projected onto the tongue via the ribbon cable where the tongue's receptors pick up the signal. After training, subjects are able to associate certain types of stimuli to certain types of visual images.&lt;ref name = "bach"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bach-y-Rita P, and Kaczmarek KA. (2002). ''Tongue placed tactile output device''. US Patent 6,430,450.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, tactile sensation can be used for visual perception.

Sensory substitutions have also been successful with the emergence of wearable haptic actuators like vibrotactile motors, solenoids, peltier diodes, etc. At the [[Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing]] at [[Arizona State University]], researchers have developed technologies that enable people who are blind to perceive social situational information using wearable vibrotactile belts&lt;ref name = "Haptic Belt"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=T.

Both technologies use miniature cameras that are mounted on a pair of glasses worn by the user who is blind. The Haptic Belt provides vibrations that convey the direction and distance at which a person is standing in front of a user, while the VibroGlove uses spatio-temporal mapping of vibration patterns to convey facial expressions of the interaction partner. Alternatively, it has been shown that even very simple cues indicating the presence or absence of obstacles (through small vibration modules located at strategic places in the body) can be useful for navigation, gait stabilization and reduced anxiety when evolving in an unknown space. This approach, called the "Haptic Radar"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/perception/HapticRadar/index-e.html|title=The Haptic Radar / Extended Skin Project|publisher=Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been studied since 2005 by researchers at the [[University of Tokyo]] in collaboration with the [[University of Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="Haptic Radar"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.

====Tactile–auditory====
While there are no tactile–auditory substitution systems currently available, recent experiments by Schurmann et al. show that tactile senses can activate the human auditory cortex. Currently vibrotactile stimuli can be used to facilitate hearing in normal and hearing-impaired people.&lt;ref name = "TASS"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schurmann M, Caetano G, Hlushchuk Y, Jousmaki V, Hari R |year=2006|title=Touch activates human auditory cortex|journal=NeuroImage|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1325–1331|pmid=16488157|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.11.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test for the auditory areas activated by touch, Schurmann et al. tested subjects while stimulating their fingers and palms with vibration bursts and their fingertips with tactile pressure. They found that tactile stimulation of the fingers lead to activation of the auditory belt area, which suggests that there is a relationship between audition and tactition.&lt;ref name = "TASS"/&gt; Therefore, future research can be done to investigate the likelihood of a tactile–auditory sensory substitution system. One promising{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=March 2016}} invention is the 'Sense organs synthesizer'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20020173823.pdf|title=Sense organs synthesizer United States Patent Application 20020173823}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims at delivering a normal hearing range of nine octaves via 216 electrodes to sequential touch nerve zones, next to the spine.

====Tactile–vestibular====
Some people with [[balance disorder]]s or adverse reactions to antibiotics suffer from bilateral vestibular damage (BVD). They experience difficulty maintaining posture, unstable gait, and [[oscillopsia]].&lt;ref name = "vest" &gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tyler M, Danilov Y, Bach-y-Rita P|year=2003|title=Closing an open-loop control system: vestibular substitution through the tongue|journal=Journal of Integrative Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=2|pages=159–164|pmid=15011268|doi=10.1142/S0219635203000263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler et al. studied the restitution of postural control through a tactile for vestibular sensory substitution. Because BVD patients cannot integrate visual and tactile cues, they have a lot of difficulty standing. Using a head-mounted [[accelerometer]] and a brain-machine interface that employs electrotactile stimulation on the tongue, information about head-body orientation was relayed to the patient so that a new source of data is available to orient themselves and maintain good posture.&lt;ref name = "vest" /&gt;

====Tactile–tactile to restore peripheral sensation====
Touch to touch sensory substitution is where information from touch receptors of one region can be used to perceive touch in another. For example, in one experiment by Bach-y-Rita, the touch perception was restored in a patient who lost peripheral sensation from leprosy.&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt; For example, this leprosy patient was equipped with a glove containing artificial contact sensors coupled to skin sensory receptors on the forehead (which was stimulated). After training and acclimation, the patient was able to experience data from the glove as if it was originating in the fingertips while ignoring the sensations in the forehead.&lt;ref name = "six"/&gt; After two days of training one of the leprosy subjects reported "the wonderful sensation of touching his wife, which he had been unable to experience for 20 years."&lt;ref name = "s"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bach-y-Rita P|year=1999|title=Theoretical aspects of sensory substitution and of neurotransmission-related reorganization in spinal cord injury|journal=Spinal Cord|volume=37|issue=7|pages=465–474|pmid=10438112|doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3100873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tactile feedback system for prosthetic limbs====
The development of new technologies has now made it plausible to provide patients with prosthetic arms with tactile and kinesthetic sensibilities.&lt;ref name="pros"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Riso RR|year=1999|title=Strategies for providing upper extremity amputees with tactile and hand position feedback – moving closer to the bionic arm|journal=Technology and Health Care|volume=7|issue=6|pages=401–409|pmid=10665673|url=http://www.smpp.northwestern.edu/savedLiterature/Riso(1999)TechAndHealthCare7p401-409.pdf|access-date=2016-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627025008/http://www.smpp.northwestern.edu/savedLiterature/Riso(1999)TechAndHealthCare7p401-409.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this is not purely a sensory substitution system, it uses the same principles to restore perception of senses. Some tactile feedback methods of restoring a perception of touch to amputees would be direct or micro stimulation of the tactile nerve afferents.&lt;ref name = "pros"/&gt;

Other applications of sensory substitution systems can be seen in function robotic prostheses for patients with high level quadriplegia. These robotic arms have several mechanisms of slip detection, vibration and texture detection that they relay to the patient through feedback.&lt;ref name = "s"/&gt;  After more research and development, the information from these arms can be used by patients to perceive that they are holding and manipulating objects while their robotic arm actually accomplishes the task.

===Auditory systems===
Auditory sensory substitution systems like the tactile sensory substitution systems aim to use one sensory modality to compensate for the lack of another in order to gain a perception of one that is lacking. With auditory sensory substitution, visual or tactile sensors detect and store information about the external environment. This information is then transformed by brain-machine interfaces into auditory signals that are relayed via the auditory receptors to the brain.

====Auditory vision substitution====
Auditory vision substitution aims to use the sense of hearing to convey visual information to the blind.

The [http://www.seeingwithsound.com vOICe Auditory Display] Technology is one of several approaches towards sensory substitution (vision substitution) for the blind that aims to provide synthetic [[Visual perception|vision]] analogous to seeing their surroundings using sound waves by means of a non-invasive [[visual prosthetic|visual prosthesis]].

The ultimate goal is to provide synthetic vision with truly visual sensations by exploiting the [[neural plasticity]] of the human brain. The system does not require any surgery. Its interface to the mind is simply headphones.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science {{!}} AAAS"/&gt; Over time with practice, the processing within the brain is gradually sent down to the [[subconscious]] levels and becomes automatic.&lt;ref name="Popular Science"/&gt;

The extent to which [[cortical plasticity]] indeed allows for functionally relevant rewiring or remapping of the human brain is still largely unknown and is being investigated in an open collaboration with research partners around the world.

One suggestion for increasing the relative efficiency of the resulting visual stimuli is to adjust the visual field by using an accelerometer to provide a steady image even if the head is moved, which is implemented in its Android edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vOICe.vOICe&amp;hl=en|title=The vOICe for Android - Android Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting an infrared sensor to adjust the camera position to match eye movements is an option for the Windows edition (though affordable mobile eye-trackers are not yet on the market).

===== Project Bat-eye =====
Unlike other models and prototypes aiming to do this particular task, this project is developed within a budget of 4 US dollars, and is aimed for the vast majority of partially or fully blind people living in developing and underdeveloped countries, who can't access equipment worth hundreds of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Article Detail - International Journal of Advanced Research|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.21474/IJAR01/2304#sthash.usFRrRuW.dpuf|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research|language=en-US|doi=10.21474/ijar01/2304#sthash.usfrrruw.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project BATEYE uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on to a wearable pair of glasses that measures the distance to the nearest object and relays it to an Arduino board. The Arduino board then processes the measurements and then plays a tone (150–15000&amp;nbsp;Hz) for the respective distance(2&amp;nbsp;cm to 4m) till the data from the second ultrasonic pulse (distance) comes in, and then the same process gets repeated. This cycle is repeated almost every 5 milliseconds. The person hears sound that changes according to the distance to the nearest object. The head provides a 195-degree swivel angle and the ultrasonic sensor detects anything within a 15-degree angle. Using systematic, cognitive and computational approach of neuroscience, with the hypothesis that the usage of the occipital lobe of blind people goes into processing other sensory feedback, and using the brain as a computational unit, the machine relies on the brain processing the tone produced every 14 mS to its corresponding distance and producing a soundscape corresponding to the tones and the body navigating using the same.During experimentation, the test subject could detect obstacles as far away as 2 – 3m, with horizontal or vertical movements of the head the blindfolded test subject could understand the basic shape of objects without touching them, and the basic nature of the obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=PROJECT BAT-EYE -Developing an Economic System that can give a Blind Person Basic Spatial Awareness and Object Identification (Updated ) (PDF Download Available)|url=http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.2.12296.62729|journal=ResearchGate|language=en|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.12296.62729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====EyeMusic=====
The EyeMusic, represents high locations on the image as high-pitched musical notes on a pentatonic scale, and low vertical locations as low-pitched musical notes on a pentatonic scale. The user wears a miniature camera connected to a small computer (or smartphone) and stereo headphones. The images are converted into "soundscapes", using a predictable algorithm, allowing the user to listen to and then interpret the visual information coming from the camera.
&lt;br /&gt;
The EyeMusic conveys color information by using different musical instruments for each of the following five colors: white, blue, red, green, yellow; Black is represented by silence. The EyeMusic currently employs an intermediate resolution of 30×50 pixels. 
An auditory cue is sounded at the beginning of each left-to-right scan of the image. (1) the higher musical notes represent pixels that are located higher on the y-axis of an image, (2) the timing of the sound after the cue indicates the x-axis location of the pixel (that is, an object located on the left of the image will be "sounded" earlier on than an object located further on the right), and (3) different colors are represented by different musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levy-Tzedek|first=Shelly|author2=Hanassy S. |author3=Abboud S. |author4=Maidenbaum S. |author5=Amedi A. |title=Fast, accurate reaching movements with a visual-to-auditory sensory substitution device|journal=Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience|date=January 1, 2012|volume=30|issue=4|pages=313–323|doi=10.3233/RNN-2012-110219|url=http://brain.huji.ac.il/publications/Levy-Tzedek_et_al_RNN_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abboud|first=Sami|author2=Hanassy S |author3=Levy-Tzedek S |author4=Maidenbaum S |author5=Amedi A. |title=EyeMusic: Introducing a "visual" colorful experience for the blind using auditory sensory substitution|journal=Restorative neurology and neuroscience|date=2014|volume=32|issue=2|pages=247–257|doi=10.3233/RNN-130338|url=http://brain.huji.ac.il/publications/Abboud_RNN_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====LibreAudioView=====
This project, presented in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ambard|first=Maxime|author2=Benezeth Y. |author3=Pfister P. |title=Mobile video-to-audio transducer and motion detection for sensory substitution|journal=Frontiers in ICT |date=2015|doi=10.3389/fict.2015.00020|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fict.2015.00020/full|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a new versatile mobile device and a sonification method specifically designed to the pedestrian locomotion of the visually impaired. It sonifies in real-time spatial information from a video stream acquired at a standard frame rate. The device is composed of a miniature camera integrated into a glasses frame which is connected to a battery-powered minicomputer worn around the neck with a strap. The audio signal is transmitted to the user via running headphones. This system has two operating modes. With the first mode, when the user is static, only the edges of the moving objects are sonified. With the second mode, when the user is moving, the edges of both static and moving objects are sonified. Thus, the video stream is simplified by extracting only the edges of objects that can become dangerous obstacles. The system enables the localization of moving objects, the estimation of trajectories, and the detection of approaching objects.

=====PSVA=====
Another successful visual-to-auditory sensory substitution device is the Prosthesis Substituting Vision for Audition (PSVA).&lt;ref name = "pvsa"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Capelle C, Trullemans C, Arno P, Veraart C | year = 1998 | title = A real-time experimental prototype for enhancement of Vision Rehabilitation–vision rehabilitation using auditory substitution. | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1279–1293 | doi=10.1109/10.720206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system utilizes a head-mounted TV camera that allows real-time, online translation of visual patterns into sound. While the patient moves around, the device captures visual frames at a high frequency and generates the corresponding complex sounds that allow recognition.&lt;ref name = "bach"/&gt; Visual stimuli are transduced into auditory stimuli with the use of a system that uses pixel to frequency relationship and couples a rough model of the human retina with an inverse model of the cochlea.&lt;ref name = "pvsa"/&gt;

===== The Vibe =====
The sound produced by this software is a mixture of sinusoidal sounds produced by virtual "sources", corresponding each to a "receptive field" in the image. Each receptive field is a set of localized pixels. The sound's amplitude is determined by the mean luminosity of the pixels of the corresponding receptive field. The frequency and the inter-aural disparity are determined by the center of gravity of the co-ordinates of the receptive field's pixels in the image (see "There is something out there: distal attribution in sensory substitution, twenty years later"; Auvray M., Hanneton S., Lenay C., O'Regan K. [[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] 4 (2005) 505-21). The Vibe is an Open Source project hosted by Sourceforge.

=====Other systems=====
Other approaches to the substitution of hearing for vision use binaural directional cues, much as natural [[human echolocation]] does.  An example of the latter approach is the "SeeHear" chip from Caltech.&lt;ref&gt;Nielson L, Mahowald M, Mead C (1989). "SeeHear," in ''Analog VLSI and Neural Systems,'' by C. Mead, Reading: Addison-Wesley, chapter 13, 207–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other visual-auditory substitution devices deviate from the vOICe's greyscale mapping of images. Zach Capalbo's Kromophone uses a basic color spectrum correlating to different sounds and timbres to give users perceptual information beyond the vOICe's capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppl.gordon.edu/sensory_substitution.php] {{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nervous system implants===
By means of stimulating electrodes implanted into the human nervous system, it is possible to apply current pulses to be learned and reliably recognized by the recipient. It has been shown successfully in experimentation, by [[Kevin Warwick]], that signals can be employed from force/touch indicators on a robot hand as a means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Warwick K, Gasson M, Hutt B, Goodhew I, Kyberd P, Schulzrinne H, Wu X |year=2004|title=Thought communication and control: A first step using radiotelegraphy|journal=IEEE Proceedings on Communications|volume=151|issue=3|pages=185–189|doi=10.1049/ip-com:20040409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
It has been argued that the term "substitution" is misleading, as it is merely an "addition" or "supplementation" not a substitution of a sensory modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Lenay C, Gapenne O, Hanneton S, Marque C, Geouelle C|year=2003|contribution=Sensory Substitution: limits and perspectives|title=Touching for Knowing, Cognitive psychology of haptic manual perception|pages=275–292|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~kathleea/docs/(A%20Guide%20to%20Sensory%20Substitution)%20-%20Sensory%20Substitution%20-%20limits%20and%20perspectives%20copy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensory augmentation==
{{See also|Human enhancement|Remote sensing}}
Building upon the research conducted on sensory substitution, investigations into the possibility of ''augmenting'' the body's sensory apparatus are now beginning. The intention is to extend the body's ability to sense aspects of the environment that are not normally perceivable by the body in its natural state.

Active work in this direction is being conducted by, among others, the e-sense project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esenseproject.info/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810201043/http://esenseproject.info/ |archivedate=2014-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Open University]] and [[Edinburgh University]], and the feelSpace project of the [[University of Osnabrück]].

The findings of research into sensory augmentation (as well as sensory substitution in general) that investigate the emergence of perceptual experience (qualia) from the activity of neurons have implications for the understanding of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Regan, JK 2001"/&gt;

===Magnetic perception===
In 2005, the feelSpace group conducted a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nagel SK, Carl C, Kringe T, Märtin R, König P|year=2005|title=Beyond sensory substitution – learning the sixth sense|journal=Journal of neural engineering|volume=2|issue=4|pages=R13–26|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1741-2552/2/4/R02/|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/2/4/r02}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sensory augmentation with a vibrotactile magnetic compass belt worn around the waist. In this study, the participants were provided with the direction of magnetic north as a vibration on their waist.

Significant performance improvements in navigational tests were observed (over and above those experienced by control subjects during the same period with the same training) and, for half of the participants, the perception of the belt's vibration underwent a profound change from simple tactile innervation to approach a genuine and direct sense of allocentric orientation: in other words, could ''perceive'' north as an entity distinct from the vibrating transducer on the waist, like one perceives a glass on a table as an entity distinct from the impact of reflected photons on the retina. Further, tests of the influence of the belt information on the rotational nystagmus effect suggested that, after training, the processing of the belt information became subcognitive.

}}{{main|Siege of Kobanî}} In October 2014, Shim was assigned by Press TV to Turkey on a mission to cover the ISIL conflict. She was based in [[Suruç]], [[Şanlıurfa Province]], Turkey, which is a rural area near the Syrian border.&lt;ref name="Today's Zaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_press-tv-reporter-dies-in-suspicious-car-crash-in-suruc_362107.html|title=Press TV reporter dies in 'suspicious' car crash in Suruç|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129094022/http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_press-tv-reporter-dies-in-suspicious-car-crash-in-suruc_362107.html|archivedate=November 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russia Today"/&gt;

===Apparent accusation of spying by Turkey===
On October 17, Shim told Press TV that the Turkish [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]] (MİT) had accused her of "spying".&lt;ref name="Russia Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/197512-serena-shim-iran-turkey/|title=Iranian TV reporter killed in Turkey car crash 1 day after 'spying accusations'|publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that it is "probably due to some of the stories she had covered about Turkey's stance on the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] militants in [[Kobanê]]".&lt;ref name="Hurriyet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/us-lebanese-reporter-dies-in-turkey-iranian-tv-calls-accident-suspicious.aspx?pageID=517&amp;nID=73214&amp;NewsCatID=352|title=US-Lebanese reporter dies in Turkey, Iranian TV calls accident 'suspicious'|work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had reported that ISIL militants were being smuggled over the Turkish border into Syria on trucks: "I’ve got images of them in World Food Organization [sic] trucks. It was very apparent that they were militants by their beards, by the clothes they wore, and they were going in there with NGO trucks".&lt;ref name="Russia Today"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Thomson "[https://www.channel4.com/news/by/alex-thomson/blogs/serena-shims-death-conclusions-evidence-stupid Serena Shim’s death: why conclusions without evidence are stupid]", Channel 4, 4 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Shim said [[wikt:on air|on air]] she's "a bit frightened" by what MİT "might use against me."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

== Death ==
Shim died on October 19, 2014 in a car crash on her way back to her hotel. She was returning to Suruç with her driver and camera operator, Judy Irish, in a rental car when the car collided with a [[cement mixer]].&lt;ref name="Hurriyet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sole culprit"/&gt; The Turkish crash report said that Irish, who was driving the car, was the only culprit, having “entered the junction too fast, violating a lane as well as traffic rules by turning right.”&lt;ref name="sole culprit"&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/lebanese-american-reporters-camerawoman-sole-culprit-in-car-crash-case-73398 Lebanese-American reporter’s camerawoman ‘sole culprit’ in car crash case], ''Hurriyet daily News'' 24 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The report also said that Şükrü Salan, the driver of the concrete mixer, was not in any way responsible.&lt;ref name="sole culprit"/&gt; He was released after being detained following the accident.&lt;ref name="up to 6 years"/&gt; It was later reported that both the expert report and traffic collision report agreed he was not at fault for the accident, but the Suruç Public Prosecutor Office sought a jail term of two to six years for him on manslaughter charges.&lt;ref name="up to 6 years"/&gt;

Irish was injured and taken to Suruç State Hospital.&lt;ref name="Today's Zaman"/&gt;

Salan was subsequently arrested.&lt;ref name=driver&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_6-years-in-jail-sought-for-driver-in-accident-that-killed-reporter-shim_367963.html|title=6 years in jail sought for driver in accident that killed reporter Shim|date=25 December 2014|work=TodaysZaman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="up to 6 years"&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/driver-faces-up-to-6-years-in-jail-for-us-lebanese-reporters-death--76100 Driver faces up to 6 years in jail for US-Lebanese reporter’s death], ''Hurriyet daily News'', December 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Press TV]] disputed this, alleging that both driver and vehicle "have disappeared" and her death is "suspicious".&lt;ref name="Russia Today"/&gt;

==Reactions==

Şanlıurfa Governor İzzettin Küçük denied Press TV's claims and called them "completely baseless" and "attempts to put Turkey in a difficult situation".&lt;ref name="Hurriyet"/&gt; Küçük said a detailed statement would be made after the investigations.&lt;ref name="Today's Zaman"/&gt;

'''''Teletubbies''''' is a British [[pre-school]] [[children's television series]] created by [[Ragdoll Productions]]' [[Anne Wood]] and [[Andrew Davenport]]. The programme focuses on four multi-coloured creatures known as "Teletubbies", named after the television screens implanted in their abdomens. Recognised throughout [[popular culture]] for the uniquely shaped antenna protruding from the head of each character, the Teletubbies communicate through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to toddlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bridging real world and toddler fantasy, Teletubbies reaches youngest audience|url=http://current.org/files/archive-site/ch/ch803t.html|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=Current.org|date=16 February 1998|last=Everhart|first=Karen|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817235434/http://current.org/files/archive-site/ch/ch803t.html|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The programme takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls audible in the background. The main shelter of the four Teletubbies is an [[earth house]] known as the "Tubbytronic Superdome" implanted in the ground and accessed through a hole at the top or an especially large semicircular door at the dome's foot. The creatures co-exist with a number of strange contraptions such as the Noo-noo, the group's anthropomorphic blue [[vacuum cleaner]], and the Voice Trumpets. The show's colourful, psychedelic setting was designed specifically to appeal to the attention spans of infants and unlock different sections of the mind while also educating young children of transitions that can be expected in life.

An assortment of rituals are performed throughout the course of every episode, such as the playful interactions between the Teletubbies and the Voice Trumpets, the mishaps caused by the Noo-noo, the footage of live children displayed on the screens in the Teletubbies' stomachs, and the magical event that occurs once per episode. The event differs each time; it is often caused inexplicably and is frequently strange yet whimsical. Each episode is closed by the Voice Trumpets and the narrator. The disappointed, reluctant, but eventually obedient Teletubbies bid farewell to the viewer as they go back to the Tubbytronic Superdome while the Sun Baby sets.

He is green and named after his antenna, which resembles a [[dipstick]]. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will occasionally refuse to go along with the others' group opinion. His face is notably darker than the rest of the Teletubbies, and the creators have stated that he is [[Black people|black]].&lt;ref name="16things"&gt;{{cite news| title=Teletubbies: 16 things you didn't know|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10903566/Teletubbies-16-things-you-didnt-know.html|date=24 December 2014|accessdate=5 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He hardly ever ventures outside the Tubbytronic Superdome, instead remaining indoors and constantly cleaning with his sucker-like nose.

=== Live events ===
To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the premiere of ''Teletubbies'', a series of events took place from March to April 2007.&lt;ref name="tenth anniversary"&gt;{{cite news | author=Rusak, Gary | date=12 March 2007 | title=Teletubbies celebrate 10th anniversary in high style | publisher=KidScreen Magazine | url=http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/daily/20070312/teletubbies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters headlined an invitation-only event in [[London]] on 21 March 2007. They appeared in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]], [[Grand Central Terminal]], and [[Apollo Theater]]. They were also interviewed on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' in an episode that included the first televised appearance of the actors without their costumes. A partnership was formed with [[Isaac Mizrahi]] in which Mizrahi designed Teletubbies-inspired bags to be [[auction]]ed off to benefit charities. A new line of clothing was launched at the Pop-Up Shop&lt;ref name="popup shop"&gt;{{cite news| title=Teletubbies Pop-Up Shop | url=http://www.taketheteletubbiestest.com/love_it/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other specialty stores. [[Mayor of New York City|New York City mayor]] [[Mike Bloomberg]] announced 28 March 2007 "Teletubbies Day" and gave the [[Key to the City|key to the city]] to the Teletubbies. Following their show in New York, the Teletubbies went on their first live European tour, performing in London, [[Paris]], [[Bremen]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Hamburg]], [[Köln]], and [[Hannover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Teletubbies reunite for free tour|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6014858/Teletubbies-reunite-for-free-tour.html|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, costumed ''Teletubbies'' characters appeared at the [[American International Toy Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=TOY FAIR 2016: Teletubbies join Character Options for toy unveiling|url=http://www.toynews-online.biz/news/read/toy-fair-2016-teletubbies-join-character-options-for-toy-unveiling/045926|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=17 April 2016|publisher=ToyNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the series' premiere on the Greek Nickelodeon channel was advertised with a series of appearances by the Teletubbies at malls throughout [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Eλάτε να γνωρίσετε τα Teletubbies από κοντά το Σάββατο 16/04 στο Avenue!|url=http://www.nickelodeon.gr/nea/story/3127/elate-na-gnorisete-ta-teletubbies-apo-konta-to-savvato-16-04-sto-avenue|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529191138/http://www.nickelodeon.gr/nea/story/3127/elate-na-gnorisete-ta-teletubbies-apo-konta-to-savvato-16-04-sto-avenue|archivedate=29 May 2016|date=13 April 2016|accessdate=29 May 2016|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|work=[[Nickelodeon (Greece)|Nickelodeon Greece]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ραντεβού με τα Teletubbies|url=http://www.athinorama.gr/child/article/rantebou_me_ta_teletubbies__-2513592.html|date=16 April 2016|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=Athinorama}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began with a live show at Avenue Mall on 16 April, which featured both the Teletubbies and a host from the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Τα TELETUBBIES αποκλειστικά για μια μέρα στην ΑΘήνα|url=https://pamebolta.gr/event/2016/04/14613/ta-teletubbies-apokleistika-gia-mia-mera-stin-athina|date=16 April 2016|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=Avenue Mall Athens|work=Pamebolta.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout May 2016, the characters appeared on various [[breakfast television|breakfast television programmes]] to promote the upcoming series' debut on Nickelodeon in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Teletubbies Takeover Chicago's WGN Morning News|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/community/chi-ugc-article-teletubbies-takeover-chicagos-wgn-morning-ne-1-2016-05-19-story.html|date=18 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=[[The Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Teletubbies return to TV|url=http://www.wtsp.com/entertainment/television/studio10/the-teletubbies-return-to-tv-1/198776346|date=18 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=[[Tegna, Inc.]]|work=[[WTSP|Tegna WTSP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the show was given its first ever live show/musical entitled Teletubbies Live!, which toured the UK beginning the weekend of November 17th, 2017.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
[[Common Sense Media]]'s Emily Ashby found that "while the show's examples of cooperative play, wonder, and simple joys are gentle and pleasing, the creatures can still be a little grating to parents watching along."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/teletubbies-2016|title=Teletubbies TV Review - Common Sense Media|work=[[Common Sense Media]]|last=Ashby|first=Emily|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated in her review that the episodes "offer a genuinely appealing combination: cute and slightly surreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=TELEVISION REVIEW; Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh, And Others Say Uh-Oh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/06/arts/television-review-teletubbies-say-eh-oh-and-others-say-uh-oh.html|date=6 April 1998|accessdate=5 June 2014|last=James|first=Caryn|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the show's release, some critics feared that the characters' use of babbling in place of complete sentences would negatively affect young viewers' ability to communicate. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported in 1997 that many parents objected to its "goo-goo style" and "said the show was a bad influence on their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TELETUBBIES: Are They Harmless Fun or Bad for Our Children?|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61096732.html|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=23 May 1997}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marina Krcmar, a professor of communication at the [[Wake Forest University]], told interviewers in 2007 that "toddlers learn more from an adult speaker than they do from a program such as ''Teletubbies''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Teletubbies can't beat people in teaching first words|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-education-toddlers-teletubbies-idUSL2889488920070701|date=1 July 2007|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul McCann of ''[[The Independent]]'' defended this aspect of the show, stating that "''Teletubbies'' upsets those who automatically assume that progressive and creative learning is trendy nonsense. Those who believe that education should be strictly disciplined and functional, even when you're 18 months old. Thankfully ''Teletubbies'' isn't for them. It's for kids."&lt;ref name="Tegna" /&gt;

=== Tinky Winky controversy ===
Tinky Winky started a controversy in 1999 because of his carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's handbag&lt;!--not "purse", which has a different meaning in UK English--&gt; (although he was first "[[outing|outed]]" by the academic and cultural critic [[Andy Medhurst]] in a letter of July 1997 to ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Outing of Tinky Winky|url=http://priceonomics.com/the-outing-of-tinky-winky/|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=Priceonomics}}&lt;/ref&gt; He aroused the interest of [[Jerry Falwell]] in 1999 when Falwell alleged that the character was a "[[gay]] role model". Falwell issued an attack in his ''[[National Liberty Journal]]'', citing a ''[[Washington Post]]'' "In/Out" column which stated that [[lesbian]] comedian [[Ellen DeGeneres]] was "out" as the chief national gay representative, while trendy Tinky Winky was "in". He warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a covert homosexual symbol, because "he is [[purple]], the [[gay pride]] colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle: the [[LGBT symbols|gay pride symbol]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Falwell Sees Gay in a Teletubby | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/11/us/national-news-briefs-falwell-sees-gay-in-a-teletubby.html|date=11 February 1999|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC made an official response, explaining that "Tinky Winky is simply a sweet, technological baby with a magic bag."&lt;ref name="Kraidy2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kraidy|title=Hybridity, OR the Cultural Logic of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7-c1qL_VMIC&amp;pg=PA106|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1100-2|pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Viselman of Itsy-Bitsy Entertainment commented, "He's not gay. He's not [[heterosexuality|straight]]. He's just a character in a children's series."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ms7azOI8UgC|pages=106–107|title=Hybridity, Or the Cultural Logic of Globalization|author=Marwan Kraidy|isbn=978-1-59213-144-0|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, [[Children's ombudsman#Poland|Polish Ombudsman for Children]], [[Ewa Sowińska]] revisited the matter, and planned to order an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6698753.stm|title=Poland targets 'gay' Teletubbies|author=Adam Easton|publisher=BBC News|date=28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I noticed that he has a woman's handbag, but I didn't realise he's a boy," Sowińska said in a public statement. She asked her office's [[psychologist]]s to look into the allegations. After the research in late 2007, she stated: "The opinion of a leading [[sexologist]], who maintains that this series has no negative effects on a child's psychology, is perfectly credible. As a result I have decided that it is no longer necessary to seek the opinion of other psychologists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Polish watchdog backs away from Teletubbies probe|publisher=CBC|date=30 May 2007|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/05/30/teletubby-poland-noprobe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the objections, the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]''{{'}}s editors included Tinky Winky as the only fictional character in the 2008 inaugural "[[Happy List]]", alongside 99 real-life adults recognised for making Britain a better and happier place.&lt;ref name=list2009&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-ios-happy-list-2008--the-100-816335.html|title=The IoS Happy List 2008 - the 100|work=The Independent|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cult following ===
Although the programme is aimed at children between the ages of one and four, it had a substantial [[cult following]] with older generations, mainly [[university]] and [[college]] [[student]]s.&lt;ref name="Company2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deconstructing Teletubbies: Differences between UK and US college students' reading of the children's television programme.|last=Gutenko|first=Gregory|publisher = College of Arts &amp; Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City|location=Kansas City, Missouri, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Brewer|title=Collecting Classic Girls' Toys|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J92wBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153|date=19 July 2010|publisher=Remember When|isbn=978-1-78337-521-9|pages=153–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of bright colours, unusual designs, repetitive non-verbal dialogue, ritualistic format, and occasional forays into physical comedy appealed to many who perceived the programme as having [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Uh-Oh! The 'Teletubbies' Are Making A Psychedelic Comeback|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/16/teletubbies-bbc-_n_5499988.html|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|last=Toomer|first=Jessica|publisher=[[Verizon Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
[[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] suggests that ''Teletubbies'' constitutes an example of radical [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian fiction]]. In this reading, the Teletubbies are an advanced culture which has eliminated all need to work, worry, or struggle in any way, and regressed into a childlike state. Roberts positions the Teletubbies as the endpoint of the science-fictional idea of paradise based on infantilisation – a more extreme version of the future humans in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' and the [[Eloi]] in [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (who are mentally childlike, but still physically and sexually adult). Following [[Sigmund Freud]]'s insight that adult pleasure must mediate [[Id, ego and super-ego|id and super-ego]] – gratification and anxiety – the only way to attain a completely stress-free life is to surrender the super-ego, including sex. It follows that the broadcasts shown on the Teletubbies' in-set televisions are historical documentaries suggesting infantile existence as the paradigm, with the baby in the sun likely being the society's central machine intelligence. Roberts concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, the toddler-oriented aspect of the show can be read not in clumsily production-intention terms (‘the show is designed to appeal to toddlers’), but as a commentary upon the necessary infantilisation implicit in any utopian fantasy. It poses a question: to achieve a total happiness for all on the planet, once technology has removed the practical barriers, how far along the road towards infantile consciousness will it be necessary to travel? Will we become like the citizens of Huxley’s Brave New World? Or more infantile, like Wells’s Eloi? Or will we go the whole hog, and subsume our angst-ridden adult consciousnesses completely in the bright colours and satisfying repetitions of Teletubbyland? The enduring appeal of the Teletubbies to adults suggests, perhaps, this latter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2011/11/time-for-teletubbies-radical-utopian-fiction/|title=Time for Teletubbies: Radical Utopian Fiction|last=Roberts|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Roberts (British writer)|publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]|date=22 November 2011|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Network architecture ==

The network consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, which gives it the u-shaped architecture. The contracting path is a typical convolutional network that consists of repeated application of [[convolutions]], each followed by a [[rectified linear unit]] (ReLU) and a [[max pooling]] operation. During the contraction, the spatial information is reduced while feature information is increased. The expansive pathway combines the feature and spatial information through a sequence of up-convolutions and concatenations with high-resolution features from the contracting path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U-Net code|url=https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{homicide}}
{{Violence against women}}
'''Uxoricide''' (from [[Latin]] ''uxor'' meaning "wife" and -cide, from ''caedere'' meaning "to cut, to kill") is murder of one's wife or romantic partner. It can refer to the act itself or the person who carries it out.

== Rates of uxoricide ==
Though overall rates of spousal violence and homicide in the US have declined since the 1970s,&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld1997/&gt; rates of uxoricide are much higher than rates of [[mariticide]] (the murder of a husband). Of the 2340 deaths at the hands of [[Intimate relationships|intimate partners]] in America in 2007, female victims made up 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Intimate Partner Violence|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/ipv-factsheet.pdf|publisher=cdc.gov|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBI data from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s found that for every 100 husbands who killed their wives in the United States, about 75 women killed their husbands.&lt;ref name=Wilson-Daley1992/&gt; However, wives were more likely to kill their husbands than vice-versa in some US cities including Chicago, Detroit and Houston.&lt;ref name=Wilson-Daley1992&gt;Wilson, M. I. &amp; Daley, M. (1992). Who kills whom in spouse killings?  On the exceptional sex ratio of spousal homicides in the United States.  Criminology, 30, 189-215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Titterington-Harper2005&gt;Titterington, V. B., &amp; Harper, L. (2005). Women as the aggressors in intimate partner homicide in Houston, 1980s to 1990s.  Journal of Offender Rehabilitation, 41 (4) 83-98&lt;/ref&gt; and in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld1997&gt;Rosenfeld, R. (1997). Changing relationships between men and women. A note on the decline in intimate partner violence.  Homicide Studies, 1, 72-83&lt;/ref&gt; Uxoricide rates varied among different demographic subgroups, being about 8.5 times more common among African-Americans than among white Americans, and about 7.5 times more common in interracial marriages.&lt;ref name=Mercy-Saltzman1989&gt;Mercy, J. A., &amp; Saltzman, L. E. (1989). Fatal violence among spouses in the United States, 1975-85.  American Journal of Public Health, 79, 595-599&lt;/ref&gt;

In the region of [[South-East Asia]], 55% of all murdered women died at the hands of their partner, followed by 40% in the African region and 38% in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global and regional estimates of violence against women: prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85239/1/9789241564625_eng.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary findings of an ongoing study estimate that globally, approximately 35% of murders of women are committed by intimate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stockl|first1=H.|title=The global prevalence of intimate partner homicide: a systematic review.|journal=World Health Organization|date=n.d.|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77421/1/WHO_RHR_12.38_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of uxoricide seem to fluctuate across western cultures, with approximately seven women being killed per month in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;ONS (2015), Crime Survey England and Wales 2013-14. London: Office for National Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; approximately four women per month in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Willow|last2=Cussen|first2=Tracy|title=Homicide in Australia: 2010–11 to 2011–12:  National Homicide Monitoring Program report|journal=Australian Institute of Criminology Monitoring Reports|date=2015|volume=83|issue=8|pages=1836–2095|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/mr/21-40/mr23.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 76 women per month in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Men Murder Women: An Analysis of 2011 Homicide Data|url=http://www.vpc.org/studies/wmmw2013.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that these data come from different years, and that the United States has a much higher population than the UK or Australia.

==Psychodynamic explanations==
===Unconscious conflict===
Proponents of psychodynamic theories have offered explanations for the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of uxoricide. It has been suggested that men who kill their partners experience both an unconscious dependence on their wife and a resentment of her. These men wish to leave the relationship, but unknowingly perceive themselves as too helpless to do so, which culminates into a belief that killing the wife is the only way to be free of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cormier|first1=B. M.|title=Psychodynamics of homicide committed in a marital relationship|journal=Corrective Psychiatry and Journal of Social Therapy|date=1982|volume=8|pages=114–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach also offers an alternative explanation for instances where a man commits uxoricide and subsequent immediate suicide – the man ends his life not due to guilt, but instead due to his perceived helplessness and dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malmquist|first1=Carl P.|title=Homicide : a psychiatric perspective|date=2006|publisher=American Psychiatric Publ.|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=9781585622047|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henry|first1=Andrew F.|last2=Jr|first2=James F. Short,|title=Suicide and homicide|date=1977|publisher=Arno Press|location=New York|isbn=9780405095733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense mechanisms===
Links have also been established between violence in childhood and likelihood of uxoricide occurring. Psychodynamic researchers argue that being the victim of abuse in childhood leads to being a perpetrator of domestic abuse in adulthood via the route of defence mechanisms – in this case, violence is an unconscious defensive adaption to childhood trauma and other adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=David|title=Predisposing Childhood Factors for Men Who Kill Their Intimate Partners|journal=Victims &amp; Offenders|date=30 June 2009|volume=4|issue=3|pages=215–229|doi=10.1080/15564880903048479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychodynamic researchers have reported that [[Thematic Apperception Test|Thematic Apperception tests]] reveal significant trends of rejection by a mother or wife in men who commit uxoricide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenzweig|first1=Saul|last2=Simon|first2=Benjamin|last3=Ballou|first3=Marjorie|title=The psychodynamics of an uxoricide.|journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|date=1942|volume=12|issue=2|pages=283–293|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1942.tb05906.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychoanalytic dream interpretation]] has also argued that unconscious conflict manifests into violent outbursts. For example, in one instance one man had experienced and recorded over 200 distressing, mostly violent dreams prior to murdering his wife.

== Risk factors ==
In slightly more than two-thirds of US spousal homicides, a verbal disagreement escalated to homicide.&lt;ref name=Mercy-Saltzman1989/&gt;

===Marital status===
Cohabiting women are at greater risk of domestic violence and uxoricide than married women. Research has found that cohabiting women are nine times more likely to be killed by their intimate partner than married women. A number of possible reasons for this finding have been studied. Cohabiting women are more likely to be younger, have a lower level of education and are more likely to bring children from a previous relationship into their home with their new intimate partner. In addition to this heightened risk to a mother with stepchildren, the genetically unrelated stepfather also poses a risk to the child; research has shown that children are at much greater risk of violence and [[filicide]] (murder of a child) from stepfathers compared to a genetic father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=G|last2=Hilton|first2=N|last3=Rice|first3=M|last4=Eke|first4=A|title=Children killed by genetic parents versus stepparents☆|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=March 2007|volume=28|issue=2|pages=85–95|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because investment from a stepfather reduces reproductive benefits. Research has found that the presence of stepchildren can significantly increase the risk of uxoricide for women. A large number of filicides are accompanied by uxoricide and [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daly|first1=Martin|last2=Wilson|first2=Margo I.|title=Some differential attributes of lethal assaults on small children by stepfathers versus genetic fathers|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|date=July 1994|volume=15|issue=4|pages=207–217|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(94)90014-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, cohabiting relationships have higher separation rates and males in these types of relationships may not feel in control of their intimate partners and may feel threatened by male sexual competitors. Research has found that a large proportion of uxoricide cases follow on from the male believing that his female intimate partner has been unfaithful or the female partner attempting to end the relationship. Research has shown that females often experience increased abuse following the termination of a relationship. An Australian study found that of a sample of uxoricide cases, 47% of women were murdered by their male intimate partner within two months of separating. [[Sexual jealousy]] may be a possible reason for this heightened risk following separation.

===Partner separation===
Another risk factor for uxoricide is estrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=M.|last2=Daly|first2=M.|title=Spousal homicide risk and estrangement.|journal=Violence and Victims.|date=1993|volume=8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who choose to leave their partner are at higher risk of spousal homicide.&lt;ref name="dalyev"/&gt; These crimes have been termed "abandonment homicides," and are most commonly committed by men with childhood histories of abandonment and trauma, in conjunction with markedly low [[serotonin]] levels and [[frontal cortex]] damage that contribute to poor [[impulse control]].&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, D.G. (2002). Personality dynamics of intimate abusiveness. Journal of Psychiatric Practive 8(4), pp. 216-228&lt;/ref&gt; The male is more likely to kill his mate before she has had the chance to form a new relationship with another man as he fears she will then devote her reproductive resources to a male rival's offspring.&lt;ref name=buss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buss|first1=D.M|last2=Duntley|first2=J.D|title=Evolved Homicide Modules|url=http://www.philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/AHRB-Project/Papers/Non-pdf-papers/Buss.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by killing his partner he will avoid the reputational damage associated with intrasexual competition and will eliminate the chances of another man having access to a high value mate.&lt;ref name="dalyev"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daly|first1=M|last2=Wilson|first2=M|title=Evolutionary social psychology and family homicide|journal=Science|date=28 October 1988|volume=242|issue=4878|pages=519–524|doi=10.1126/science.3175672|pmid=3175672}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also explains why those women who have had children from a previous relationship are at higher risk of spousal homicide compared with those who have only had children with their current partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewer|first1=V.E|last2=Paulsen|first2=D.J|title=A comparison of US and Canadian findings on uxoricide risk for women with children sired by previous partners|journal=Homicide Studies|date=1999|volume=3|pages=317–332|doi=10.1177/1088767999003004004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female partner has already devoted her reproductive resources to another man, therefore when she establishes a new relationship, the male becomes involved in the upbringing of another man's offspring which will damage his hierarchical status amongst intrasexual rivals.&lt;ref name=buss/&gt;

===Age===
The greater age disparity between spouses, the higher risk of spousal homicide.&lt;ref name=Mercy-Saltzman1989/&gt; For a male, the damage associated with infidelity is greater when the partner is younger.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackelford|first1=T.K|last2=Buss|first2=D.M.|last3=Peters|first3=J.|title=Wife killing: Risk to women as a function of age.|journal=Violence and Victims|date=2000|volume=15|pages=273–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman's fertility decreases as she gets older,&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David M.|last2=Schmitt|first2=David P.|title=Sexual Strategies Theory: An evolutionary perspective on human mating.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1993|volume=100|issue=2|pages=204–232|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} therefore, age is key indicator of reproductive success.&lt;ref name=mizey&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mize|first1=K.D.|last2=Shackelford|first2=T.K.|last3=Shackleford|first3=V.A.|title=Younger women incur excess risk of uxoricide by stabbing and other hands-on killing methods|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2011|volume=50|pages=1120–1125|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.01.038}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a man will place high levels of importance on a mate with greater reproductive value.&lt;ref name=sst/&gt;{{rp|208}} A man is more likely to engage in "hands on" killing methods when the mate has high reproductive value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mize|first1=K.D|last2=Shackelford|first2=T.K|last3=Shackelford|first3=V.A|title=Hands-on killing of intimate partners as a function of sex and relationship status/state|journal=Journal of Family Violence|date=2009|volume=24|pages=463–470|doi=10.1007/s10896-009-9244-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hands on" refers to more violent methods such as using weapons, drowning, stabbing and strangling.&lt;ref name=mizey/&gt;

===Culture===
Some instances of uxoricide are facilitated by the culture of the victim and the perpetrator. For example, [[honor killing]]s, whereby a man kills his wife because she has brought shame upon their family, are approved in some male-dominated, patriarchal societies.

Uxoricide can also be prevalent in countries where honor killings aren't considered acceptable. In [[South Africa]], for example, as many as five women are estimated to be killed each week by an intimate partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vetten|first1=L.|title="Man Shoots Wife". A pilot study detailing intimate femicide in Gauteng, South Africa|journal=People Opposing Women Abuse, Johannesburg|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this high rate of uxoricide is a result of the prevalence of violence in South African society, and how it is deemed socially acceptable in many circumstances – conservative attitudes towards women in this society have been suggested to facilitate uxoricide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewkes|first1=Rachel|last2=Levin|first2=Jonathan|last3=Penn-Kekanaa|first3=Loveday|title=Risk factors for domestic violence: findings from a South African cross-sectional study.|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=2002|volume=55|issue=9|pages=1603–1617|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies conducted in [[Italy]] exhibit similar findings, reporting that a man's cultural values concerning the position of women in society links to his likelihood of committing uxoricide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Girolamo|first1=F|last2=Nesci|first2=D A|title=Uxoricide in Italy (Article in Italian)|journal=Rass Penititenziaria Crim.|date=1981|volume=3|issue=4|pages=481–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on children==

When a parent kills another parent, children experience significant trauma. The other parent is likely to be in prison or may have committed suicide and therefore, the child will go through significant loss. The child has not only lost a parent but has also lost the other parent that would help and support them through this loss. This type of extreme traumatic event can have serious implications on wellbeing and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alisic|first1=Eva|last2=Krishna|first2=Revathi N.|last3=Groot|first3=Arend|last4=Frederick|first4=John W.|title=Children’s Mental Health and Well-Being After Parental Intimate Partner Homicide: A Systematic Review|journal=Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review|date=20 October 2015|volume=18|issue=4|pages=328–345|doi=10.1007/s10567-015-0193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Émilien Amaury''' (born [[Étampes]], France, 5 March 1909, died [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]] 2 January 1977{{r|Universalis}}{{r|Astrotheme}}{{r|Quid}}) was a French publishing magnate whose company now organises the [[Tour de France]]. He worked with [[Philippe Pétain]], head of the French government in the southern half of France during the second world war but used his position to find paper and other materials for the [[French Resistance]]. His links with [[Jacques Goddet]], the organiser of the Tour de France, led to a publishing empire that included the daily sports paper, ''[[L'Équipe]]''.{{r|Goddet p144}} Amaury died after falling from his horse; his will led to six years of legal debate.

==Background==
Emilien Amaury was born in modest circumstances in the town of Étampes. He left both his school and his family at 12.{{r|Valdepied}} (Other sources say he left at 10) He began work as a bicycle delivery boy, worked in a bar, then joined the army in compulsory military service. On leaving the army he became at 19 secretary to [[Marc Sangnier]], a journalist and politician,{{r|Universalis}}&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[Marc Sangnier]] founded a newspaper, ''La Démocratie'', which campaigned for equality for women, proportional representation at elections, and for pacifism. He was also one of the pioneers of the French youth-hostelling movement.&lt;/ref&gt; going from there in 1930 to found the OPG, the Office de Publicité Générale, which handled advertising for several Christian-Democrat newspapers. In 1937 he became technical adviser to the [[Minister of Overseas France|Minister for the Colonies]], Marius Moutet.

==War and Resistance==
France declared war against Germany in 1939. Amaury was conscripted into the cavalry in 1938 and was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]],{{r|Sppmo}} but he was captured when [[Battle of France|Germany invaded]] the [[Ardennes]] in 1940. He escaped soon afterwards and returned to Paris. The government collapsed with the invasion and a new state was declared, with its headquarters at [[Vichy]]. Its leader, Philippe Pétain, put Amaury in charge of propaganda for the well-being of the family. Amaury, however, had been in contact with an early ''Resistant'', [[Henri Honoré d'Estienne d'Orves]], and through him had helped start the Rue de Lille Group, a Parisian cell of the growing Resistance movement{{r|Bernard p33}}{{r|Sppmo}} in which Amaury took the code names Jupiter{{r|Valdepied}} and Champin.{{r|Sppmo}} He used his government position to procure paper – which was rationed – for Resistance newspapers and to supply other material. The paper he procured made it possible to print 30,000 and sometimes 100,000 copies of news sheets such as ''Résistance, [[L'Humanité]]'' and ''Témoignage Chrétien''.

The Rue de Lille Group – named after a street in Paris – also printed the text of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s broadcast to France on the [[BBC]] of 18 June 1940, and printed forged documents for Resistance members.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;De Gaulle had been promoted to acting general after leading tanks against the German invasion. He was then called to join the government, led by the [[Prime Minister of France]], [[Paul Reynaud]]. Reynaud's wish to resist the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German Occupation]] led him to send De Gaulle to London to meet [[Winston Churchill]]. It was on the last of several visits to London that [[Appeal of June 18|de Gaulle broadcast on the French service]] of the [[BBC]]. Few heard the broadcast and even fewer had heard of de Gaulle but his words, reminding France that it had lost a battle but that the war continued across the war and the French could be part of it, became a call to resistance. The speech was printed and circulated across France by Resistance movements and is today reproduced in many of the city's squares and on war memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of press empire==
Newspapers and magazines which had continued to publish during the Occupation were closed down and their possessions sequestrated by the State at the end of the war. The way was open to new entrepreneurs and to those whose reputations had survived the war years.

Among the newspapers closed had been the sports daily, ''[[L'Auto]]'', which had founded the Tour de France in 1903. The editor, [[Jacques Goddet]], had refused to run the race when the Germans invited him to but his paper printed news favourable to the occupiers, many of its shares were held by Nazi sympathisers, and Goddet himself had been a supporter of Pétain. He was able to show that ''L'Auto's'' print works, through its head, Roger Roux,{{r|Goddet p135}} had clandestinely produced news sheets for the Resistance generally and for Amaury in particular. An inquiry absolved Goddet of collaboration and, through Amaury's interest, allowed Goddet to open another newspaper, ''[[L'Équipe]]'', and to run the Tour de France. Both the paper and the race later became part of Amaury's business network.

Amaury's first publication, however, building on the wreckage of the collaborationist press, was a weekly, ''Carrefour'' ("crossroads"), in August 1944. His links with the Ligue Féminine d'Action Catholique led to the foundation of ''Marie-France'', which he later edited. He also created the Syndicat de la Presse Hebdomadaire Parisienne ("Parisian weekly press union", later known as the Syndicat Professionnel de la Presse Magazine et d'Opinion), and was elected its president for 33 successive years.{{r|Sppmo}}

Amaury founded a daily paper, ''[[Le Parisien|Le Parisien Libéré]]'' on 22 August 1944, three days before liberation of the capital. The first headline was "The victory of Paris is in progress!"(''La victoire de Paris est en marche!'') The paper changed name to ''Le Parisien'' in 1986. The paper grew from the ashes of ''Le Petit Parisien'', a paper founded in 1876{{r|PressRef}} but which had been tainted by collaboration during the second world war. The government closed it, along with other newspapers, and licensed ''Le Parisien Libéré'' and ''L'Humanité'' to take over the paper's headquarters in the rue d'Enghien.

==Strike==
Economic problems in the 1970s cost the popular press, including ''Le Parisien Libéré'', much of its readership.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The American magazine Time described ''Le Parisien-Libéré'' as a lowbrow daily.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|PressRef}} On 1 March 1975, ''Le Parisien Libéré'''s management told workers' representatives of a plan to cut 300 jobs, including those of 200 printers,{{r|Time 30 June 75}} and to print fewer papers.{{r|CineArc}} On 4 March the company closed one of its print works, in the rue d'Enghien in Paris. The unions said they had been given no notice and it led to one of the longest strikes in French newspaper history and to the murder of an innocent man confused with the paper's editor.{{r|Quid 2}}

Production of the paper was interrupted from 7 March. Amaury refused the claims of his workers. The printers stopped work, helped by colleagues elsewhere in the [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]] trade union who gave a tenth of their salary to a strike fund.{{r|CineArc}} The printers took over two of the newspapers' plants and barricaded themselves behind rolls of [[newsprint]]. After two weeks Amaury had the paper printed in Belgium. Printers hijacked two loads of papers being driven south and threw them into the fields. The rest of the delivery made it to Paris and the newspaper maintained some of its circulation after moving printing to a plant north of Paris  staffed partly by printers from ''Le Parisien Libéré'' who belonged to a different union.{{r|Time 30 June 75}}

Protesters occupied the liner, ''[[SS France (1961)|SS France]]'' and scaled the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in central Paris to scatter pamphlets and protested at the Tour de France, run by another part of Amaury's organisation.{{r|CineArc}}

The episode became more violent when a bomb killed the editor-in-chief of [[Agence France Presse]] at his apartment in Paris. An anonymous caller told a local radio station: "We have just blasted the home of Cabanes of ''Le Parisien Libéré''." Bernard Cabanes was unconnected with the dispute; police believed the bomb was intended for  the newspaper's editor, another journalist of the same name. Printers denied involvement.{{r|Time 30 June 75}} The dispute lasted 29 months.{{r|sglce}}

==Tour de France==
The Tour de France cycle race began in 1903 to promote the newspaper, ''[[L'Auto]]''. The paper was among those closed at Liberation, its property sequestrated by the state. Its editor, Jacques Goddet, had compiled a dossier to show how much his paper had contributed privately to the Resistance even if its public stance had favoured the Germans.{{r|Goddet p135}} Émilien Amaury was among his supporters.{{r|Goddet p145}}&lt;ref group="n"&gt;While Jacques Goddet could never be called a collaborator and insisted that he had done much to thwart the Germans, including refusing to organise the Tour despite the privileges they were offering (see [[Tour de France during the Second World War]]), his position was confused by the actions of his elder brother, Maurice. Like Jacques, Maurice had inherited their father's share in the publishing business. Maurice was eased out when his flamboyant policies came close to ruining the company and his final act was to sell shares to a consortium of Germans close to the Nazi party. The major holding in the paper was also sold to the Germans by Albert Lejeune, on behalf of his boss Raymond Petenôtre, who had taken refuge in the USA. L'Auto therefore fell to some extent under German control and the column of general news that Goddet had included to widen the appeal of ''L'Auto'' appeal became a propaganda tool for the occupants.&lt;/ref&gt; Goddet was forbidden to use the name ''L'Auto'', judged to give an unfair advantage over rival sports papers. The new paper took the name ''L'Équipe'' instead. It applied successfully to organise the Tour de France.

''L'Équipe's'' finances were never secure and in 1968 Amaury bought an interest but maintained Goddet as editor. Amaury's condition was that his own cycling reporter, [[Félix Lévitan]], should share organisation of the Tour. Lévitan slowly took over from Goddet, especially in arrangements for sponsorship and finance. He and Goddet were business partners rather than friends, and Lévitan came into his own when Amaury bought L'Équipe and the Tour. Amaury's death meant ownership passed, after a legal battle, to his son, [[Philippe Amaury|Philippe]]. Friction over inheritance (see below) meant Philippe was anxious to change some of the arrangements he had taken over and Lévitan fell out of favour. &lt;ref group="n"&gt;On 17 March 1987 Levitan found the locks of his office changed and a court official waiting to search and clear it amid claims, never proven, of financial mismanagement. Goddet became race director-at-large before leaving the following year.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tour de France is still run by [[Amaury Sport Organisation]], part of the general Amaury group, which also organises the [[Dakar Rally|Dakar car rally]] and the Paris marathon.

==Death==
Amaury died after falling from his horse in the forest near [[Chantilly, Oise]]. The left-wing newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' reflected the manner in which many of its readers perceived him by the headline ''Amaury falls from his horse: the horse is safe''{{r|Dunet}} His death led to a six-year legal battle over inheritance. Amaury left the bulk of his estate to his daughter, Françine. French law demands that offspring inherit equally and Amaury's son, Philippe, insisted on his share. The legal case was handled by [[Jacques Trémollet de Villers]] and six years later it settled amicably, Philippe taking the dailies and his sister magazines such as ''Marie-France'' and ''Point de Vue''.

Émilien Amaury is buried in the St-Pierre cemetery at Chantilly.
