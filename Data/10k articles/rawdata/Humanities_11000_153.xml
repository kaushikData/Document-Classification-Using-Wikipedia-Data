The '''1974 Arab League summit''' was a meeting of [[Arab]] leaders held in [[Rabat, Morocco]] in 1974. Leaders to twenty Arab countries were present, including [[King Hussein]] of [[Jordan]] and Anwar Sadat of Egypt, together with representatives of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO). A unanimous resolution was passed which, for the first time, declared the PLO to be the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people." Furthermore, the Arab League resolved that the "oil-rich Arab states ... [provide] multi-annual financial aid to the [states in confrontation with Israel] and the PLO."&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  "Arab Summit Conferences." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Sela.  New York: Continuum, 2002. pp.&amp;nbsp;158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

The summit shaped the future of the conflict in several ways.  First, it forced [[King Hussein]] to relinquish his claim to be able to speak for the Palestinians and to acknowledge that a future [[Palestinian state]] would have to be independent of Jordan.  Second, it "weakened the American position.  [[Henry Kissinger|[U.S. Secretary of State Henry] Kissinger]] agreed with the Israelis that it was preferable to negotiate with Hussein rather than with the PLO."&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, Ian J., and Carla L. Klausner.  ''A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict''.  4th ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002.  p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Fatah]] plot to assassinate Hussein upon his arrival to the summit was uncovered by Moroccan authorities.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=383}}

An '''Accession Day''' is usually the anniversary of the date on which a monarch or executive takes office. The earliest records of accession celebrations date from the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], and the custom is now observed in many nations.

Accession Day in India's [[Jammu and Kashmir]] commemorates the day in 1947 when the area joined the [[Dominion of India]].

==Belgium==
In Belgium there are local celebrations of the reigning monarch's accession, but the anniversary of the accession of the first King of modern Belgium, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], on 21 July 1831, is celebrated as a full national holiday, known as "Belgian National Day".&lt;ref&gt;See page 9 of [http://www.belgium.be/en/binaries/belgium_at_a_glance_tcm115-36271.pdf this] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421055822/http://www.belgium.be/en/binaries/belgium_at_a_glance_tcm115-36271.pdf |date=21 April 2013 }} document from the Belgian Federal Government website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian subcontinent==
[[Accession Day (Jammu and Kashmir)|Accession Day]] is a state holiday in India's northernmost state, [[Jammu and Kashmir]], commemorating 26 October 1947, when [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] signed off the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]], in which [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] joined the [[Dominion of India]]. This was part of the series of events in 1947 by which rule the Indian Empire was converted into the two new Dominions of India and Pakistan, the latter having two territories separated by the whole of northern India. As a Hindu ruler of a state with both Hindu and Muslim subjects, the Maharaja's decision was crucial.

Festivities of the day include holding rallies, lighting [[firecrackers]], singing [[National anthem of India|India's national anthem]], and raising the [[flag of India]].&lt;ref name="Greater Kashmir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2010/Oct/28/accession-day-is-our-national-day-jmu-bar-33.asp |title=Accession day is our national day: Jammu BAR |publisher=[[Greater Kashmir]] |accessdate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028221720/http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2010/Oct/28/accession-day-is-our-national-day-jmu-bar-33.asp |archivedate=28 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sify - Accession Day"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://sify.com/news/jammu-all-set-to-celebrate-accession-day-news-national-kkzsuicghgb.html|title=Jammu all set to celebrate Accession Day|publisher=[[Sify]]|accessdate =31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vijay Kumar - Accession Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groundreport.com/World/J-K-Accession-day-celebrations-in-J-K_7/2930440 |title=J&amp;K Accession Day celebrations in Jammu &amp; Kashmir |publisher=[[GroundReport]] |accessdate=31 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029163930/http://www.groundreport.com/World/J-K-Accession-day-celebrations-in-J-K_7/2930440 |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netherlands==
{{main|Koningsdag}} 
''Koninginnedag'' (Queen's Day) was, during the reign of Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]], celebrated on 30 April, the date of her accession in 1980 upon the abdication of her mother, Queen Juliana, whose birthday fell on 30 April). Beatrix abdicated on Koninginnedag 2013 which, led to the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]. As a result, the holiday became known as Koningsdag (King's Day) from 2014 and the celebration was moved three days ahead to 27 April, to instead mark the birthday of Willem-Alexander.

==United Arab Emirates==
The [[United Arab Emirates]] is unusual in celebrating the accession of its President, although the President is elected from amongst the seven hereditary [[Emir]]s (ruling Princes) of the constituent states of the UAE, and is therefore also a hereditary and monarchical leader. Accession Day is a national holiday in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the celebration on [http://aglobalworld.com/holidays-around-the-world/uae-hh-sheikh-zayed-accession/ 6 August].&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
&lt;!--Linked from [[Elizabeth II]]--&gt;

The custom of marking this day was inaugurated during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of England. Her accession day was celebrated in England and Wales during her reign and also, according to the 19th-century historian [[Thomas Lathbury]], during the reigns of her successors.&lt;ref&gt;"According to Lathbury, the 17th day of November, the day of the Queen's accession, was observed even after Elizabeth's death as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God for the gracious deliverance wrought out for the Church by her instrumentality." (Evan Daniel, ''The Prayer-Book; its history, language and contents''; 26th ed. Redhill: Wells Gardner (1948), p.&amp;nbsp;535.)&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving" to be used in churches on the anniversary of the queen's accession was published in 1576 and used until 1602.

In 1568, the tenth anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession was marked with the ringing of bells and 17 November became known as "Queen Elizabeth's Day" or "[[Queene's Day]]".&lt;ref name ="Chambers"&gt;''Chambers Book of Days'', Edinburgh: Chambers, 2004 ({{ISBN|0-550-10083-0}}) p.553&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt; As her reign progressed, it was celebrated with increased fervour and, long after her death, it continued to be observed as a day of Protestant rejoicing and expression of anti-Catholic feeling. The observances included triumphal parades and processions, sermons against populism and the burning of the Pope in effigy.&lt;ref name ="Chambers" /&gt; After the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666), "these rejoicings were converted into a satirical [[saturnalia]] of the most turbulent kind"; the greatest excesses occurred in the years 1679–81 when wealthy members of political clubs paid for processions and bonfires to arouse the populace to political fervour.&lt;ref name ="Chambers" /&gt; The inhabitants of [[Berry Pomeroy]] in south [[Devon]] reinstated the tradition of Queene's Day in 2005 with a special church service and bonfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=UKNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1156EAAD5DD84A10&amp;p_docnum=10&amp;p_queryname=2 |title=Queene's day revival continues |work=Western Morning News |location=Plymouth, Devon |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=23 June 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the accession of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]], a form of prayer and thanksgiving was issued for use in all churches "upon his entry to this kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel ''Prayer-Book'', p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1625, a new service was issued which was sanctioned by [[Convocation]] in 1640 but set aside by Parliament at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] when certain parts of it were included in the special service for 29 May. When [[James II of England|King James II]] acceded the throne, he ordered the preparation of a special form of prayer and thanksgiving for the anniversary of his accession day and a revised version of the old service was prepared and set forth by authority in 1685. The form of words "the day on which His Majesty began his happy reign" was first used in this service and has been retained ever since. After falling out of use during the reigns of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], the service was revised and used again during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel ''Prayer-Book'', p.&amp;nbsp;536.&lt;/ref&gt; King [[George V]]'s accession day (reigned 1910–36) was 6 May.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoe &amp; Co's Travellers' Diary for 1927''. [[Chennai|Madras]]: Hoe &amp; Co, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present monarch, [[Elizabeth II]]'s accession day is 6 February and is observed in the United Kingdom by the flying of specific flags and various [[official function]]s. In London, a [[21-gun salute#United Kingdom|Royal Salute]] is fired by the guns of the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]] in [[Green Park]] and by the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] at the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/GunSalutes/Gunsalutes.aspx |title=Gun Salutes |publisher=The official website of the British Monarchy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317070617/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/GunSalutes/Gunsalutes.aspx |archivedate=17 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salutes are also fired at [[Woolwich]], [[Colchester]], [[Edinburgh Castle]], [[Stirling Castle]], [[Cardiff]], [[Belfast]], [[York]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Dover]] Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchester.gov.uk/news_det.asp?art_id=8141&amp;sec_id=27 |title=Honour of Royal Salute switches to Colchester town centre |publisher=Colchester Borough Council}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special services are required by [[Canon law|canon]] in all cathedrals, churches, and chapels of the [[Church of England]]. The [[Book of Common Prayer]] provides options for a stand-alone Accession Day service, or for special [[Proper (liturgy)|proper]]s by which any or all of the services of Matins, Evensong and Holy Communion may be altered for the day.&lt;ref&gt;All these options are available on-line at [http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/accession-services.aspx here].&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's more recent prayer book [[Common Worship]] does not provide a full form of service, but refers the user to the Book of Common Prayer; it does, however, provide propers for the Eucharist on 6 February.&lt;ref&gt;See "Common Worship – Festivals", Church House Publishing, 2008, page 367, which may be viewed on-line [http://www.churchofengland.org/media/41176/festivalscommonofsaints.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a legal requirement, special services are also held in some churches of other denominations.

== Vatican City ==
The Vatican counts the ''Anniversario dell'Elezione del Santo Padre'', or the anniversary of the [[Papal conclave|election]] of the reigning pontiff, among its statutory public holidays. Since 2014, the city-state has observed this holiday on March 13, the anniversary of [[Pope Francis]]' election in 2013.

'''Adolf Tobler''' (24 May 1835 &amp;ndash; 18 March 1910) was a Swiss-German linguist and philologist. Born in [[Hirzel]] in Zürich, Switzerland, he was the brother of linguist [[Ludwig Tobler]] (1827–1895). Adolf Tobler died in [[Berlin]], Germany.

He studied [[Romance languages|Romance philology]] at the universities of [[University of Zürich|Zürich]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], receiving his doctorate in 1857. At Bonn, he was influenced by the teachings of [[Friedrich Christian Diez]] and [[Nicolaus Delius]]. After graduation, he worked as a schoolteacher at the [[Solothurn (canton)|Solothurn]] cantonal school, then at the gymnasium in [[Bern]]. In 1867, he relocated to the [[University of Berlin]], where from 1871 up until his death, he held the chair of Romance philology. In 1890/91, he served as [[rector (academia)|university rector]].&lt;ref name=HU&gt;[https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/ueberblick/geschichte/rektoren/tobler Adolf Tobler] Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (biography)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D46328.php Tobler, Adolf] Historischen Lexikon der Schweiz&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Tobler-Mussafia law", a grammatical rule applicable to Romance languages is named after Tobler and Austrian philologist [[Adolf Mussafia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tQCZU1OuBu0C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=%22Tobler-Mussafia%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hfQ7KgY9ae&amp;sig=nlTlZv3lwyY1vUKHgSqgoNt3ysg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKlIro-8rRAhUR3YMKHXQ_Bkw4ChDoAQgdMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tobler-Mussafia%22&amp;f=false Clause Structure and Language Change] by Adrian Battye, Ian G. Roberts&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his better written efforts was the five-volume ''Vermischte Beiträge zur französischen Grammatik'' ("Miscellaneous contributions to French grammar"; 1886–1912). His creation of an [[Old French]] dictionary was unfinished at the time of his death, being posthumously edited and published by [[Erhard Lommatzsch]] ("Tobler-Lommatzsch", ''Altfranzösisches wörterbuch''; 11 volumes).&lt;ref name=HU/&gt;&lt;ref name=HA&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?lookfor=%22Tobler,Adolf,1835-1910.%22&amp;type=author&amp;inst= HathiTrust Digital Library] (published works)&lt;/ref&gt; Other noted works by Tobler include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2618">'''Allow Natural Death''' ('''AND''') is a medical term defining the use of life-extending measures such as [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR). These orders emphasize patient comfort and [[pain management]] instead of life extension.&lt;ref name=Schlairet&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlairet|first=Maura C|title=Allow-Natural-Death (AND) Orders: Legal, Ethical, And Practical Considerations|journal=HEC Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, American medical communities utilize “[[do not resuscitate]],” (DNR) orders to define patients’ medical wishes. Those who propose to replace DNR with AND posit that DNR orders are ambiguous and require complex understanding between several parties, while AND orders are clearer.&lt;ref name=Schlairet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Venneman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venneman|first=S.S.|title='Allow Natural Death' Versus 'Do Not Resuscitate': Three Words That Can Change A Life|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|doi=10.1136/jme.2006.018317|volume=34|year=2008|pages=2–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNR orders range from solely prohibiting the use of resuscitation to prohibiting any action seen as life extending. Because there are many parties involved in a patient’s end of life care - significant others, family, personal doctors, specialists and nurses - DNR orders are not always completely clear, leaving open possible violation of the patient’s wishes.&lt;ref name=Schlairet /&gt;  “DNR orders may lead to conflict, unnecessary suffering, and inappropriate care at the EOL [end of life.]” Those who propose to replace DNR orders with AND orders posit that AND are less ambiguous, clearly instructing medical personnel to not use any artificial, life extending measures. This would be especially helpful in regards to emergency care, when medical personnel who are unfamiliar with the patient must decide what medical practices should be used. Furthermore, proponents of AND claim that because it contains “death” in the title it is more clear to the patient and family exactly what the patient is agreeing to.

Critics of AND claim it is simply the replacement of one ambiguous term with another. Just as DNR particulars vary so too would AND particulars vary. Thus, the change would be ineffective.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Y-Y|title='Allow Natural Death' Is Not Equivalent To 'Do Not Resuscitate': A Response|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|doi=10.1136/jme.2008.024570|volume=34|year=2008|pages=887–888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrzej Szczypiorski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈandʐeɪ̯ ʂt͡ʂɨˈpʲɔrski}}, {{Audio|Pl-Andrzej Szczypiorski.ogg|help=no|listen}}; 3 February 1928 – 16 May 2000) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[novelist]] and [[politician]]. He served as a member of the Polish legislature, and was a [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] activist interned during the [[Martial law in Poland|military crackdown of 1981]]. He was a secret police agent in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://polska.newsweek.pl/tajemnica-szczypiorskiego,14376,1,1.html | title=Tajemnica Szczypiorskiego (Szczypiorski's Secret) | publisher=''Newsweek.pl'' Polska | date=May 7, 2006 | accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was son of [[Adam Szczypiorski]], a political activist, historian and mathematician, and Jadwiga née Epsztajn. Szczypiorski had a sister Wiesława (1924-1945). He spent his childhood in [[Warsaw]].

During [[World War II]] Szczypiorski studied at [[Education in Poland during World War II|an underground university]] called the "flying university" due to the regular changing of its location for safety. He was a partisan of the Polish [[Armia Ludowa|People’s Army]], and a participant of the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. After the Uprising he was arrested and condemned to imprisonment at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], where he survived until 1945.

In 1946-1947 he studied political science in the Warsaw Consular Diplomatic Academy. In 1948-1956, Szczypiorski worked as an editor in the Katowice Silesian Theater.  During this period, in 1952, he made his literary debut in the magazine "Życie Literackie" using the pseudonym 'Maurice S. Andrews' and was inducted into the [[Polish Writers' Union]]. He won the [[Austrian State Prize for European Literature]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="1988prize"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oesterreich-bibliotheken.at/preistraegerinnen.php?preis=preise_euliteratur |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120529161211/http://www.oesterreich-bibliotheken.at/preistraegerinnen.php?preis=preise_euliteratur |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 May 2012 |title=Österreichische StaatspreisträgerInnen für Europäische Literatur |publisher=Oesterreich-Bibliotheken im Ausland |language=German |accessdate=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956-1958, he was selected to serve in the Polish Embassy to [[Denmark]], after which he returned to work as an editor on the radio and for publications. He later served as a member of the Polish legislature. He was also a [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]]. Prior to his death, Szczypiorski converted to [[Calvinism]], and is buried in the [[Protestant Reformed Cemetery in Warsaw]].

After his death it became known that Szczypiorski was a collaborator of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Polish communist secret police]] in the years of [[Stalinism in Poland]].&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt;

'''''The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine, or, Monthly Political and Literary Censor''''' (1798 to 1821), a conservative British political periodical, was founded by [[John Gifford]] [pseud. of John Richards Green] (1758–1818) after the demise of [[William Gifford]]'s ''[[Anti-Jacobin|The Anti-Jacobin, or, Weekly Examiner]]'' (1797–1798). Gifford and Robert Bisset were the chief writers, and the political philosopher [[James Mill]] wrote reviews.

May 2006. 7 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; the journal contained essays, reviews, and satirical engravings, notably by [[James Gillray]]. It grew out of the political ferment of the period and was a vocal element of the British Anti-[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] backlash against the ideals of the [[French Revolution]].

The first edition was published on 1 August 1798 and was advertised in ''[[The Times]]'' as "containing Original Criticism; a Review of the Reviewers; Miscellaneous Matter in Prose and Verse, Lists of Marriages, Births, Deaths and Promotions; and a Summary of Foreign and Domestic Politics."&lt;ref name="Times-1798-Jul-20"&gt;{{cite newspaper The Times|articlename=New Review and Magazine|section=Classified Advertising|date=20 July 1798|page_number=2|issue=4235|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors included Robert Bisset (1758/9–1805), [[John Bowles (author)|John Bowles]] (1751–1819), Arthur Cayley (1776–1848), [[George Gleig]], Samuel Henshall (1764/5–1807), [[James Hurdis]], [[John Oxlee]] (1779–1854), Richard Penn (1733/4–1811), [[Richard Polwhele]], [[John Skinner (bishop)|John Skinner]] (1744–1816), William Stevens (1732–1807), and [[John Whitaker (historian)|John Whitaker]] (1735–1808), though as items were frequently published anonymously attributions are often unclear.

It denounced reformers, especially the Evangelicals, and greatly angered them, as [[William Wilberforce]], a leader of the anti-slavery movement, made clear in 1800:
:It is a most mischievous publication, which, by dint of assuming a tone of the highest loyalty and attachment to our establishment in church and state, secures a prejudice in its favour, and has declared war against what I think the most respectable and most useful of all orders of men--the serious clergy of the Church of England. . . . Its opposition to the evangelical clergy is carried on in so venomous a way, and with so much impudence, and so little regard to truth, that the mischief it does is very great indeed. It accuses them in the plainest terms, and sometimes by name, as being disaffected both to church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ford K. Brown, ''Fathers of the Victorians: The Age of Wilberforce'' (1961) p 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|x|t}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Brecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|Brecht, Bertolt}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|bʁɛçt|lang}}; 10 February 1898&amp;nbsp;– 14 August 1956), known professionally as '''Bertolt Brecht''', was a German [[theatre practitioner]], [[playwright]], and [[poet]].

Living in [[Munich]] during the [[Weimar Republic]], he had his first successes with theatre plays, whose themes were often influenced by his [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought. He was the main proponent of the genre named [[epic theatre]] (which he preferred to call "dialectical theatre"). During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi period]] and [[World War II]] he lived in exile, first in Scandinavia and then in the United States.  Returning to [[East Berlin]] after the war, he established the theatre company [[Berliner Ensemble]] with his wife and long-time collaborator, actress [[Helene Weigel]].&lt;ref&gt;The introduction of this article draws on the following sources: Banham (1998, 129); Bürger (1984, 87–92); Jameson (1998, 43–58); Kolocotroni, Goldman and Taxidou (1998, 465–466); Williams (1993, 277–290); Wright (1989, 68–89; 113–137).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

=== Bavaria (1898–1924) ===
Eugen Berthold  Friedrich Brecht (as a child known as Eugen) was born in February 1898 in [[Augsburg]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], the son of Berthold Friedrich Brecht (1869–1939) and his wife Sophie, née Brezing (1871–1920). Brecht's mother was a devout [[Protestant]] and his father a [[Roman Catholic]] (who had been persuaded to have a Protestant wedding). The modest house where he was born is today preserved as a Brecht Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adk.de/de/archiv/gedenkstaetten/gedenkstaetten-brecht-weigel.htm|title=Brecht-Weigel-Gedenkstätte-Chausseestraße 125-10115 Berlin-Akademie der Künste – Akademie der Künste – Berlin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked for a paper mill, becoming its managing director in 1914.&lt;ref name="lives"&gt;Thomson (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his mother's influence, Brecht knew the Bible, a familiarity that would have a lifelong effect on his writing. From her, too, came the "dangerous image of the self-denying woman" that recurs in his drama.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994, 22–23). See also Smith (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht's home life was comfortably middle class, despite what his occasional attempt to claim peasant origins implied.&lt;ref&gt;See Brecht's poem "Of Poor B.B." (first version, 1922), in Brecht (2000b, 107–108).&lt;/ref&gt; At school in Augsburg he met [[Caspar Neher]], with whom he formed a lifelong creative partnership. Neher designed many of the sets for Brecht's dramas and helped to forge the distinctive visual iconography of their [[epic theatre]].

When Brecht was 16, the [[First World War]] broke out. Initially enthusiastic, Brecht soon changed his mind on seeing his classmates "swallowed by the army".&lt;ref name="lives"/&gt; Brecht was nearly expelled from school in 1915 for writing an essay in response to the line "''[[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]]''" from the Roman poet [[Horace]], calling it ''Zweckpropaganda'' ("cheap propaganda for a specific purpose") and arguing that only an empty-headed person could be persuaded to die for their country. His expulsion was only prevented through the intervention of his religion teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hässler |editor1-first=Hans-Jürgen |editor2-last=von Heusinger |editor2-first=Christian |date=1989 |title=Kultur gegen Krieg, Wissenschaft für den Frieden |trans-title=Culture against War, Science for Peace |language=German |location=Würzburg, Germany |publisher=[[Königshausen &amp; Neumann]] |isbn=978-3884794012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his father's recommendation, Brecht sought a loophole by registering for a medical course at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]], where he enrolled in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994, 24) and Sacks (xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; There he studied drama with [[Arthur Kutscher]], who inspired in the young Brecht an admiration for the iconoclastic dramatist and [[cabaret]]-star [[Frank Wedekind]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994, 24). In his ''[[Messingkauf Dialogues]]'', Brecht cites Wedekind, along with [[Georg Büchner|Büchner]] and [[Karl Valentin|Valentin]], as his "chief influences" in his early years: "he," Brecht writes of himself in the third person, "also saw the writer ''Wedekind'' performing his own works in a style which he had developed in cabaret. Wedekind had worked as a [[ballad]] singer; he accompanied himself on the lute." (1965, 69). [[Arthur Kutscher|Kutscher]] was "bitterly critical" of Brecht's own early dramatic writings (Willet and Manheim 1970, vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 1916, Brecht's newspaper articles began appearing under the new name "Bert Brecht" (his first theatre criticism for the ''[[Der Volkswille (Augsburg, 1919)|Augsburger Volkswille]]'' appeared in October 1919).&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994, 24) and Willett (1967, 17).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht was [[Conscription|drafted]] into military service in the autumn of 1918, only to be posted back to Augsburg as a medical orderly in a military [[Sexual health clinic|VD clinic]]; the war ended a month later.&lt;ref name="lives"/&gt;

In July 1919, Brecht and {{Interlanguage link multi|Paula Banholzer|de}} (who had begun a relationship in 1917) had a son, Frank. In 1920 Brecht's mother died.&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim (1970, vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time in either 1920 or 1921, Brecht took a small part in the political cabaret of the Munich comedian [[Karl Valentin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sacks (1994, xx) and McDowell (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht's diaries for the next few years record numerous visits to see Valentin perform.&lt;ref name=McDowell2000&gt;McDowell (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht compared Valentin to [[Charlie Chaplin]], for his "virtually complete rejection of mimicry and cheap psychology".&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim 1970, x.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in his ''[[Messingkauf Dialogues]]'' years later, Brecht identified Valentin, along with Wedekind and [[Georg Büchner|Büchner]], as his "chief influences" at that time:
:But the man he learnt most from was the clown ''Valentin'', who performed in a beer-hall. He did short sketches in which he played refractory employees, orchestral musicians or photographers, who hated their employers and made them look ridiculous. The employer was played by his partner, Liesl Karlstadt, a popular woman comedian who used to pad herself out and speak in a deep bass voice.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht (1965, 69–70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Brecht's first full-length play, ''[[Baal (play)|Baal]]'' (written 1918), arose in response to an argument in one of Kutscher's drama seminars, initiating a trend that persisted throughout his career of creative activity that was generated by a desire to counter another work (both others' and his own, as his many adaptations and re-writes attest). "Anyone can be creative," he quipped, "it's rewriting other people that's a challenge."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomson (1994, 25).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht completed his second major play, ''[[Drums in the Night]]'', in February 1919.

Between November 1921 and April 1922 Brecht made acquaintance with many influential people in the Berlin cultural scene. Amongst them was the playwright [[Arnolt Bronnen]] with whom he established a joint venture, the Arnolt Bronnen / Bertolt Brecht Company. Brecht changed the spelling of his first name to Bertolt to rhyme with Arnolt.

In 1922 while still living in Munich, Brecht came to the attention of an influential Berlin critic, [[Herbert Ihering]]: "At 24 the writer Bert Brecht has changed Germany's literary complexion overnight"—he enthused in his review of Brecht's first play to be produced, ''Drums in the Night''—"[he] has given our time a new tone, a new melody, a new vision. [...] It is a language you can feel on your tongue, in your gums, your ear, your spinal column."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Ihering's review for ''[[Drums in the Night]]'' in the ''[[Berliner Börsen-Courier]]'' on 5 October 1922. Quoted in Willett and Manheim (1970, viii–ix).&lt;/ref&gt; In November it was announced that Brecht had been awarded the prestigious [[Kleist Prize]] (intended for unestablished writers and probably Germany's most significant literary award, until it was abolished in 1932) for his first three plays (''Baal'', ''Drums in the Night'', and ''[[In the Jungle of Cities|In the Jungle]]'', although at that point only ''Drums'' had been produced).&lt;ref&gt;See Thomson and Sacks (1994, 50) and Willett and Manheim (1970, viii–ix).&lt;/ref&gt; The citation for the award insisted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Brecht's] language is vivid without being deliberately poetic, symbolical without being over literary. Brecht is a dramatist because his language is felt physically and in the round.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Ihering, quoted in Willett and Manheim (1970, ix).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That year he married the Viennese opera-singer [[Marianne Zoff]]. Their daughter—[[Hanne Hiob]] (1923–2009)—was a successful German actress.&lt;ref name="lives" /&gt;

In 1923, Brecht wrote a scenario for what was to become a short [[slapstick]] film, ''[[Mysteries of a Barbershop]]'', directed by [[Erich Engel]] and starring Karl Valentin.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lack of success at the time, its experimental inventiveness and the subsequent success of many of its contributors have meant that it is now considered one of the most important films in [[Cinema of Germany|German film history]].&lt;ref&gt;Culbert (1995). {{Page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of that year, Brecht's ''In the Jungle'' premiered in Munich, also directed by Engel. Opening night proved to be a "scandal"—a phenomenon that would characterize many of his later productions during the [[Weimar Republic]]—in which [[Nazism|Nazis]] blew whistles and threw stink bombs at the actors on the stage.&lt;ref name=McDowell2000/&gt;

In 1924 Brecht worked with the novelist and playwright [[Lion Feuchtwanger]] (whom he had met in 1919) on an adaptation of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' that proved to be a milestone in Brecht's early theatrical and dramaturgical development.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994, 26–27), Meech (1994, 54–55).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht's ''[[The Life of Edward II of England|Edward II]]'' constituted his first attempt at collaborative writing and was the first of many classic texts he was to adapt. As his first solo directorial début, he later credited it as the germ of his conception of "[[epic theatre]]".&lt;ref&gt;Meech (1994, 54–55) and Benjamin (1983, 115). See the article on ''[[The Life of Edward II of England|Edward II]]'' for details of Brecht's germinal 'epic' ideas and techniques in this production.&lt;/ref&gt; That September, a job as assistant [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] at [[Max Reinhardt]]'s [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]]—at the time one of the leading three or four theatres in the world—brought him to Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht was recommended for the job by [[Erich Engel]]; [[Carl Zuckmayer]] was to join Brecht in the position. See Sacks (1994, xviii), Willett (1967, 145), and Willett and Manheim (1970, vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weimar Republic Berlin (1925–33) ===
In 1923 Brecht's marriage to Zoff began to break down (though they did not divorce until 1927).&lt;ref&gt;Ewen (1967, 159) and Völker (1976, 65).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht had become involved with both [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]] and Helene Weigel.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994, 28).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht and Weigel's son, [[Stefan Brecht|Stefan]], was born in October 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman (104) and Völker (1976, 108).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his role as dramaturg, Brecht had much to stimulate him but little work of his own.&lt;ref&gt;According to Willett, Brecht was disgruntled with the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] at not being given a Shakespeare production to direct. At the end of the 1924–1925 season, both his and [[Carl Zuckmayer]]'s (his fellow dramaturg) contracts were not renewed. (Willett 1967, 145). Zuckmayer relates how: "Brecht seldom turned up there; with his flapping leather jacket he looked like a cross between a lorry driver and a Jesuit seminarist. Roughly speaking, what he wanted was to take over complete control; the season's programme must be regulated entirely according to his theories, and the stage be rechristened 'epic smoke theatre', it being his view that people might actually be disposed to think if they were allowed to smoke at the same time. As this was refused him he confined himself to coming and drawing his pay." (Quoted by Willett 1967, 145).&lt;/ref&gt; Reinhardt staged [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', [[Carlo Goldoni|Goldoni]]'s ''[[Servant of Two Masters]]'' (with the improvisational approach of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' in which the actors chatted with the prompter about their roles), and [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' in his group of Berlin theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1967, 145).&lt;/ref&gt; A new version of Brecht's third play, now entitled ''[[In the Jungle of Cities|Jungle: Decline of a Family]]'', opened at the Deutsches Theater in October 1924, but was not a success.&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim (1979, viii).&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: right;" |Bertolt Brecht, "Of Poor BB".
|}At this time Brecht revised his important "transitional poem", "Of Poor BB".&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim point to the significance of this poem as a marker of the shift in Brecht's work towards "a much more urban, industrialized flavour" (1979, viii).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, his publishers provided him with Elisabeth Hauptmann as an assistant for the completion of his collection of poems, ''Devotions for the Home'' (''Hauspostille'', eventually published in January 1927). She continued to work with him after the publisher's commission ran out.&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim (1979, viii, x).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 in [[Mannheim]] the artistic exhibition ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' ("[[New Objectivity]]") had given its name to the new post-[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] movement in the German arts. With little to do at the Deutsches Theater, Brecht began to develop his ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' project, which was to become the first product of "the 'Brecht collective'—that shifting group of friends and collaborators on whom he henceforward depended."&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim (1979, viii); Joel Schechter writes: "The subjugation of an individual to that of a collective was endorsed by the affirmations of comedy, and by the decision of the coauthors of ''[[Man Equals Man|Man is Man]]'' ([[Emil Burri]], [[Slatan Dudow]], [[Caspar Neher]], Bernhard Reich, [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]]) to call themselves 'The Brecht Collective'." (1994, 74).&lt;/ref&gt; This collaborative approach to artistic production, together with aspects of Brecht's writing and style of theatrical production, mark Brecht's work from this period as part of the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' movement.&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The collective's work "mirrored the artistic climate of the middle 1920s," Willett and Manheim argue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;with their attitude of ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' (or New Matter-of-Factness), their stressing of the collectivity and downplaying of the individual, and their new cult of [[Anglo-Saxon]] imagery and sport. Together the "collective" would go to fights, not only absorbing their terminology and ethos (which permeates ''Man Equals Man'') but also drawing those conclusions for the theatre as a whole which Brecht set down in his theoretical essay "Emphasis on Sport" and tried to realise by means of the harsh lighting, the boxing-ring stage and other anti-illusionistic devices that henceforward appeared in his own productions.&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim (1979, viii–ix).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1925, Brecht also saw two films that had a significant influence on him: [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim (1979, xxxiii).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht had compared [[Karl Valentin|Valentin]] to Chaplin, and the two of them provided models for Galy Gay in ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter (1994, 68).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht later wrote that Chaplin "would in many ways come closer to the [[Demonstration (acting)|epic]] than to the dramatic theatre's requirements."&lt;ref&gt;Brecht (1964, 56).&lt;/ref&gt; They met several times during Brecht's time in the United States, and discussed Chaplin's ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' project, which it is possible Brecht influenced.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter (1994, 72).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 a series of short stories was published under Brecht's name, though Hauptmann was closely associated with writing them.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks (1994, xviii).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the production of ''Man Equals Man'' in Darmstadt that year, Brecht began studying [[Marxism]] and socialism in earnest, under the supervision of Hauptmann.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994, 28–29).&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|reason=Brecht denied this charge at the McCarthy trials – which requires citation.|date=December 2014}} "When I read [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]''", a note by Brecht reveals, "I understood my plays." Marx was, it continues, "the only spectator for my plays I'd ever come across."&lt;ref&gt;Brecht (1964, 23–24).&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the developments in [[USSR]] Brecht wrote a number of [[agitprop]] plays, praising the [[bolshevik]] [[collectivism]] (replaceability of each member of the collective in ''[[Man Equals Man]]'') and [[red terror]] ([[The Decision (play)|''The Decision'']]).

In 1927 Brecht became part of the "[[Dramaturge|dramaturgical]] collective" of [[Erwin Piscator]]'s first company, which was designed to tackle the problem of finding new plays for its "epic, political, confrontational, documentary theatre".&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1998, 103) and (1978, 72). In his book ''The Political Theatre'', Piscator wrote: "Perhaps my whole style of directing is a direct result of the total lack of suitable plays. It would certainly not have taken so dominant form if adequate plays had been on hand when I started" (1929, 185).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht collaborated with Piscator during the period of the latter's landmark productions, ''[[Hoppla, We're Alive!]]'' by [[Ernst Toller|Toller]], ''Rasputin'', ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk|The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik]]'', and ''Konjunktur'' by [[Léo Lania|Lania]].&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 74).&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht's most significant contribution was to the adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic novel ''Schweik'', which he later described as a "montage from the novel".&lt;ref&gt;See Brecht's ''Journal'' entry for 24 June 1943. Brecht claimed to have written the adaptation (in his ''Journal'' entry), but Piscator contested that; the manuscript bears the names "Brecht, [Felix] Gasbarra, [[Erwin Piscator|Piscator]], [[George Grosz|G. Grosz]]" in Brecht's handwriting (Willett 1978, 110). See also Willett (1978, 90–95). Brecht wrote a sequel to the novel in 1943, ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Piscator productions influenced Brecht's ideas about staging and design, and alerted him to the radical potentials offered to the "[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]" playwright by the development of stage technology (particularly projections).&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1998, 104). In relation to his innovations in the use of theatre technology, Piscator wrote: "technical innovations were never an end in themselves for me. Any means I have used or am currently in the process of using were designed to elevate the events on the stage onto a [[Historicization|historical plane]] and not just to enlarge the technical range of the stage machinery. My technical devices had been developed to cover up the deficiencies of the dramatists' products" ("Basic Principles of a Sociological Drama" [1929]; in Kolocotroni, Goldman and Taxidou [1998, 243]).&lt;/ref&gt; What Brecht took from Piscator "is fairly plain, and he acknowledged it" Willett suggests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The emphasis on Reason and didacticism, the sense that the new subject matter demanded a [[Non-Aristotelian drama|new dramatic form]], the use of songs to [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interrupt]] and comment: all these are found in his notes and essays of the 1920s, and he bolstered them by citing such Piscatorial examples as the step-by-step narrative technique of ''Schweik'' and the oil interests handled in ''Konjunktur'' ('Petroleum resists the five-act form').&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 109–110). The similarities between Brecht's and Piscator's theoretical formulations from the time indicate that the two agreed on fundamentals; compare Piscator's summation of the achievements of his first company (1929), which follows, with Brecht's [[The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre|''Mahagonny'' Notes]] (1930): "In lieu of private themes we had generalisation, in lieu of what was special the typical, in lieu of accident causality. Decorativeness gave way to constructedness, Reason was put on a par with Emotion, while sensuality was replaced by didacticism and fantasy by documentary reality." From a speech given by Piscator on 25 March 1929, and reproduced in ''Schriften 2'' p.&amp;nbsp;50; Quoted by Willett (1978, 107). See also Willett (1998, 104–105).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Brecht was struggling at the time with the question of how to dramatize the complex economic relationships of modern capitalism in his unfinished project ''Joe P. Fleischhacker'' (which Piscator's theatre announced in its programme for the 1927–28 season). It wasn't until his ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'' (written between 1929–1931) that Brecht solved it.&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1998, 104–105).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 he discussed with Piscator plans to stage [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and Brecht's own ''[[Drums in the Night]]'', but the productions did not materialize.&lt;ref&gt;Willett (1978, 76).&lt;/ref&gt;

1927 also saw the first collaboration between Brecht and the young composer [[Kurt Weill]].&lt;ref&gt;The two first met in March 1927, after Weill had written a critical introduction to the broadcast on Berlin Radio of an adaptation of Brecht's ''[[Man Equals Man]]''. When they met, Brecht was 29 years old and Weill was 27. Brecht had experience of writing songs and had performed his own with tunes he had composed; at the time he was also married to an opera singer (Zoff). Weill had collaborated with [[Georg Kaiser]], one of the few [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] playwrights that Brecht admired; he was married to the actress [[Lotte Lenya]]. Willett and Manheim (1979, xv).&lt;/ref&gt; Together they began to develop Brecht's ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny|Mahagonny]]'' project, along thematic lines of the biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Cities of the Plain]] but rendered in terms of the ''[[New Objectivity|Neue Sachlichkeit]]'''s ''Amerikanismus'', which had informed Brecht's previous work.&lt;ref&gt;Willet and Manheim (1979, xv–xviii). In Munich in 1924 Brecht had begun referring to some of the stranger aspects of life in post-[[Beer Hall Putsch|putsch]] Bavaria under the codename "Mahagonny". The ''Amerikanismus'' imagery appears in his first three "Mahagonny Songs", with their Wild West references. With that, however, the project stalled for two and a half years. With Hauptmann, who wrote the two English-language "Mahagonny Songs", Brecht had begun work on an opera to be called ''Sodom and Gomorrah'' or ''The Man from Manhattan'' and a radio play called ''The Flood'' or 'The Collapse of Miami, the Paradise City', both of which came to underlie the new scheme with Weill. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv–xvi). The influence of ''Amerikanismus'' is most clearly discernible in Brecht's ''[[In the Jungle of Cities]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; They produced ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel|The Little Mahagonny]]'' for a music festival in July, as what Weill called a "stylistic exercise" in preparation for the large-scale piece. From that point on [[Caspar Neher]] became an integral part of the collaborative effort, with words, music and visuals conceived in relation to one another from the start.&lt;ref&gt;In this respect, the creative process for ''[[Mahagonny]]'' was quite different from ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', with the former being ''durchkomponiert'' or set to music right through, whereas on the latter Weill was brought at a late stage to set the songs. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv).&lt;/ref&gt; The model for their mutual articulation lay in Brecht's newly formulated principle of the "[[separation of the elements]]", which he first outlined in "[[The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre]]" (1930). The principle, a variety of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]], proposed by-passing the "great struggle for supremacy between words, music and production" as Brecht put it, by showing each as self-contained, independent works of art that [[Gestus|adopt attitudes]] towards one another.&lt;ref&gt;Willett and Manheim (1979, xvii) and Brecht (1964, 37–38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1988, MiNr Block 091.jpg|thumb|Stamp from the former [[East Germany]] depicting Brecht and a scene from his ''[[Life of Galileo]]'']]

In 1930 Brecht married Weigel; their daughter Barbara Brecht was born soon after the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/642308/Barbara-Brecht-Schall|title=Barbara Brecht-Schall&amp;nbsp;– About This Person|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also became an actress and would later hold the [[copyright]]s to all of Brecht's work.

Brecht formed a writing collective which became prolific and very influential. [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], Margarete Steffin, Emil Burri, [[Ruth Berlau]] and others worked with Brecht and produced the multiple [[Lehrstücke|teaching plays]], which attempted to create a new [[dramaturgy]] for participants rather than passive audiences. These addressed themselves to the massive worker arts organisation that existed in Germany and Austria in the 1920s. So did Brecht's first great play, ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'', which attempts to portray the drama in financial transactions.

This collective adapted [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', with Brecht's lyrics set to music by [[Kurt Weill]]. Retitled ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (''Die Dreigroschenoper'') it was the biggest hit in Berlin of the 1920s and a renewing influence on the musical worldwide. One of its most famous lines underscored the hypocrisy of conventional morality imposed by the Church, working in conjunction with the established order, in the face of working-class hunger and deprivation:

{|
|&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;''Erst kommt das Fressen''
''Dann kommt die Moral.''&lt;/poem&gt;
|&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;First the grub (lit. "eating like animals, gorging")
Then the morality.&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

The success of ''The Threepenny Opera'' was followed by the quickly thrown together ''Happy End''. It was a personal and a commercial failure. At the time the book was purported to be by the mysterious Dorothy Lane (now known to be Elisabeth Hauptmann, Brecht's secretary and close collaborator). Brecht only claimed authorship of the song texts. Brecht would later use elements of ''Happy End'' as the germ for his ''Saint Joan of the Stockyards'', a play that would never see the stage in Brecht's lifetime. ''Happy End'''s score by Weill produced many Brecht/Weill hits like "Der Bilbao-Song" and "Surabaya-Jonny".

The masterpiece of the Brecht/Weill collaborations, ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]'' (''Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny''), caused an uproar when it premiered in 1930 in Leipzig, with Nazis in the audience protesting. The ''Mahagonny'' opera would premier later in Berlin in 1931 as a triumphant sensation.

Brecht spent the last years of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] (1930–1933) in Berlin working with his "collective" on the ''Lehrstücke''. These were a group of plays driven by morals, music and Brecht's budding epic theatre. The ''Lehrstücke'' often aimed at educating workers on Socialist issues. ''[[The Decision (play)|The Measures Taken]]'' (''Die Massnahme'') was scored by [[Hanns Eisler]]. In addition, Brecht worked on a script for a semi-documentary feature film about the human impact of mass unemployment, ''[[Kuhle Wampe]]'' (1932), which was directed by [[Slatan Dudow]]. This striking film is notable for its subversive humour, outstanding [[cinematography]] by [[Günther Krampf]], and Hanns Eisler's dynamic musical contribution. It still provides a vivid insight into Berlin during the last years of the [[Weimar Republic]].

Fearing persecution, Brecht left [[Nazi Germany]] in February 1933, just after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] took power. After brief spells in Prague, Zurich and Paris he and Weigel accepted an invitation from journalist and author [[Karin Michaëlis]] to move to Denmark. The family first stayed with Karin Michaëlis at her house on the small island of [[Thurø]] close to the island of [[Funen]]. They later bought their own house in [[Svendborg]] on Funen. This house located at Skovsbo Strand 8 in Svendborg became the residence of the Brecht family for the next six years, where they often received guests including [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Ruth Berlau]]. During this period Brecht also travelled frequently to Copenhagen, Paris, Moscow, New York and London for various projects and collaborations.

When war seemed imminent in April 1939, he moved to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, where he remained for a year.&lt;ref&gt;german.wisc.edu&lt;/ref&gt; After Hitler invaded [[Norway]] and Denmark, Brecht left Sweden for [[Helsinki]], Finland, where he lived and waited for his visa for the United States until 3 May 1941.&lt;ref name="german.wisc.edu"&gt;[http://wiu.edu/users/brecht10/brecht_english/brecht_chronology.html Brecht Chronology, International Brecht Society]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he wrote the play ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]'' (''Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti'') with [[Hella Wuolijoki]], with whom he lived in {{Interlanguage link multi|Marlebäck|de}}.

During the war years, Brecht became a prominent writer of the [[Exilliteratur]].&lt;ref name="Exilliteratur"&gt;Exilliteratur.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exilliteratur" /&gt; He expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in his most famous plays: ''[[Life of Galileo]]'', ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'', ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'', ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'', ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'', ''[[Fear and Misery of the Third Reich]]'', and many others.

Brecht co-wrote the screenplay for the [[Fritz Lang]]-directed film ''[[Hangmen Also Die!]]'' which was loosely based on the 1942 assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] Deputy Reich Protector of the German-occupied [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s right-hand man in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], and a chief architect of the [[Holocaust]], who was known as "The Hangman of Prague." [[Hanns Eisler]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his musical score. The collaboration of three prominent refugees from Nazi Germany&amp;nbsp;– Lang, Brecht and Eisler&amp;nbsp;– is an example of the influence this generation of German exiles had on American culture.

''Hangmen Also Die!'' was Brecht's only script for a Hollywood film. The money he earned from writing the film enabled him to write ''[[The Visions of Simone Machard]]'', ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]'' and an adaptation of [[John Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Malfi (Brecht)|The Duchess of Malfi]]''.

In 1942 Brecht's reluctance to help [[Carola Neher]], who died in a [[gulag]] death camp in the [[USSR]] after being arrested during the 1936 [[Great Purge|purges]], caused much controversy among Russian emigrants in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Held|de}}: "Stalins deutsche Opfer und die Volksfront", in the underground magazine ''Unser Wort'', Nr. 4/5, October 1938, pp. 7 ff.; {{Interlanguage link multi|Michael Rohrwasser|de}}, ''Der Stalinismus und die Renegaten.

=== Cold War and final years in East Germany (1945–56) ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-24300-0049, Bertolt Brecht und Helene Weigel am 1. Mai.jpg|thumb|upright|Brecht and Weigel on the roof of the [[Berliner Ensemble]] during the [[International Workers' Day]] demonstrations in 1954]]
In the years of the [[Cold War]] and "[[Red Scare]]", Brecht was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by movie studio bosses and interrogated by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].&lt;ref name=HUAC2&gt;[[:File:Brecht HUAC hearing (1947-10-30).ogg|Brecht HUAC hearing]]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with about 41 other Hollywood writers, directors, actors and producers, he was subpoenaed to appear before the HUAC in September 1947. Although he was one of 19 witnesses who declared that they would refuse to appear, Brecht eventually decided to testify. He later explained that he had followed the advice of attorneys and had not wanted to delay a planned trip to Europe. On 30 October 1947 Brecht testified that he had never been a member of the [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=HUAC2/&gt; He made wry jokes throughout the proceedings, punctuating his inability to speak English well with continuous references to the translators present, who transformed his German statements into English ones unintelligible to himself. HUAC vice-chairman [[Karl E. Mundt|Karl Mundt]] thanked Brecht for his co-operation. The remaining witnesses, the so-called [[Hollywood Ten]], refused to testify and were cited for contempt. Brecht's decision to appear before the committee led to criticism, including accusations of betrayal. The day after his testimony, on 31 October, Brecht returned to Europe.

He lived [[Zürich|Zurich]] in Switzerland for a year. In February 1948 in [[Chur]], Brecht staged an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', based on a translation by [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]]. It was published under the title ''Antigonemodell 1948'', accompanied by an essay on the importance of creating a "[[Non-Aristotelian drama|non-Aristotelian]]" form of theatre. 

In 1949 he moved to [[East Berlin]] and established his theatre company there, the [[Berliner Ensemble]].  He retained his Austrian nationality (granted in 1950) and overseas bank accounts from which he received valuable hard currency remittances. The copyrights on his writings were held by a Swiss company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/authors/about_bertolt_brecht.html|title=Bertolt Brecht Biography – List of Works, Study Guides &amp; Essays|author=GradeSaver|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he drove a pre-war [[DKW]] car—a rare luxury in the austere divided capital.

Though he was never a member of the Communist Party, Brecht had been schooled in [[Marxism]] by the dissident communist [[Karl Korsch]]. Korsch's version of the [[Dialectic#Marxist dialectics|Marxist dialectic]] influenced Brecht greatly, both his aesthetic theory and theatrical practice. Brecht received the [[Stalin Peace Prize]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St. Petersburg Times|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19541221&amp;id=2Y4zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gHoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3712,12840|date=December 21, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brecht wrote very few plays in his final years in East Berlin, none of them as famous as his previous works. He dedicated himself to directing plays and developing the talents of the next generation of young directors and dramaturgs, such as Manfred Wekwerth, [[Benno Besson]] and [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]]. At this time he wrote some of his most famous poems, including the "Buckow Elegies".

At first Brecht apparently supported the measures taken by the East German government against the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], which included the use of Soviet military force. In a letter from the day of the uprising to [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] First Secretary [[Walter Ulbricht]], Brecht wrote that: "History will pay its respects to the revolutionary impatience of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The great discussion [exchange] with the masses about the speed of socialist construction will lead to a viewing and safeguarding of the socialist achievements. At this moment I must assure you of my allegiance to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Letter published in the ''Neues Deutschland'', 21 June 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brechtgrave.jpg|thumb|Graves of Helene Weigel and Bertolt Brecht in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]]]]
Brecht's subsequent commentary on those events, however, offered a very different assessment—in one of the poems in the ''Elegies'', "[[Die Lösung]]" (The Solution), a disillusioned Brecht writes a few months later:
:{|
|&lt;poem&gt;
After the uprising of the 17th of June
The Secretary of the Writers Union
Had leaflets distributed in the [[Stalinallee]]
Stating that the people
Had forfeited the confidence of the government
And could win it back only
By redoubled efforts.

Would it not be easier
In that case for the government
To dissolve the people
And elect another?&lt;ref&gt;Brecht (2000b, 440). The poem was first printed in the West-German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' in 1959 and subsequently in the ''Buckow Elegies'' in the West 1964. It was first published in the GDR in 1969 after Helene Weigel had insisted on its inclusion in a collected edition of Brecht's works.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

=== Death ===
Brecht died on 14 August 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|78614}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a heart attack at the age of 58. He is buried in the Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery on Chausseestraße in the [[Mitte]] neighbourhood of Berlin, overlooked by the residence he shared with Helene Weigel.

According to Stephen Parker, who reviewed Brecht's writings and unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted rheumatic fever as a child, which led to an enlarged heart, followed by lifelong chronic heart failure and [[Sydenham's chorea]]. A report of a radiograph taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding [[aortic knob]] and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues described him as being very nervous, and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with [[emotional lability]], personality changes, [[obsessive-compulsive]] behavior, and hyperactivity, which matched Brecht's behavior. "What is remarkable," wrote Parker, "is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, arrhythmia into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama."&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal | title =Diagnosing Bertolt Brecht.| journal =Lancet| date =2 April 2011| author =Parker S.| volume =377| issue =9772| pages =1146–7.| url =http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960453-4/fulltext#| doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60453-4| pmid =21465701| pmc =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and practice of theatre ==
From his late twenties Brecht remained a lifelong committed [[Marxism|Marxist]] {{citation needed|reason=Brecht denied this charge at the McCarthy trials – which also requires citation.|date=December 2014}} who, in developing the combined theory and practice of his "[[epic theatre]]", synthesized and extended the experiments of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] to explore the theatre as a [[Political theatre|forum for political ideas]] and the creation of a [[Marxist aesthetics|critical aesthetics]] of [[dialectical materialism]].

[[File:Cremer Brecht.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Brecht outside the Berliner Ensemble's theatre in Berlin]]

Epic Theatre proposed that a play should not cause the spectator to identify emotionally with the characters or action before him or her, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action on the stage. Brecht thought that the experience of a [[Climax (narrative)|climactic]] [[catharsis]] of emotion left an audience complacent. Instead, he wanted his audiences to adopt a critical perspective in order to recognise social injustice and exploitation and to be moved to go forth from the theatre and effect change in the world outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Critical Response to Heidi M. Silcox's "What's Wrong with Alienation?"|last = Squiers|first = Anthony|date = 2015|journal = Philosophy and Literature|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, Brecht employed the use of techniques that remind the spectator that the play is a [[Metatheatre|representation of reality]] and not reality itself. By highlighting the constructed nature of the theatrical event, Brecht hoped to communicate that the audience's reality was equally constructed and, as such, was changeable.

Brecht's [[Modernism|modernist]] concern with drama-as-a-[[Medium specificity|medium]] led to his refinement of the "[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic form]]" of the drama. This dramatic form is related to similar modernist innovations in other [[The arts|arts]], including the strategy of divergent chapters in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s evolution of a [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] "[[Soviet montage theory|montage]]" in the cinema, and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s introduction of [[Cubism|cubist]] "collage" in the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;On these relationships, see "autonomization" in Jameson (1998, 43–58) and "non-organic work of art" in Bürger (1984, 87–92).  Willett observes: "With Brecht the same [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] technique spread to the drama, where the old [[Procrustes|Procrustean]] plot yielded to a more "[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]" form of narrative better able to cope with wide-ranging modern socio-economic themes. That, at least, was how Brecht theoretically justified his choice of form, and from about 1929 on he began to interpret its penchant for "[[contradiction]]s", much as had [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]], in terms of the [[dialectic]]. It is fairly clear that in Brecht's case the practice came before the theory, for his actual composition of a play, with its switching around of scenes and characters, even the physical cutting up and sticking together of the typescript, shows that montage was the structural technique most natural to him. Like [[Jaroslav Hašek|Hašek]] and Joyce he had not learnt this scissors-and-paste method from the Soviet cinema but picked it out of the air" (1978, 110).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Brecht's most important principles was what he called the ''[[Verfremdungseffekt]]'' (translated as "defamiliarization effect", "distancing effect", or "estrangement effect", and often mistranslated as "alienation effect").&lt;ref&gt;Brooker (1994, 193). Brooker writes that "the term 'alienation' is an inadequate and even misleading translation of Brecht's ''Verfremdung''. The terms 'de-familiarisation' or 'estrangement', when understood as more than purely formal devices, give a more accurate sense of Brecht's intentions. A better term still would be 'de-[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]'".&lt;/ref&gt; This involved, Brecht wrote, "stripping the event of its self-evident, familiar, obvious quality and creating a sense of astonishment and curiosity about them".&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, quoted by Brooker (1994, 191).&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Brecht employed techniques such as the actor's direct address to the audience, harsh and bright stage lighting, the use of songs to [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interrupt]] the action, explanatory placards, the transposition of text to the [[Grammatical person|third person]] or [[past tense]] in rehearsals, and speaking the stage directions out loud.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht (1964, 138).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to many other [[avant-garde]] approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to [[Anti-art|destroy art]] as an institution; rather, he hoped to "[[Refunctioning|re-function]]" the theatre to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] debates of his era—particularly over the "[[High culture|high art]]/popular culture" dichotomy—vying with the likes of [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]], [[György Lukács|Lukács]], [[Ernst Bloch]], and developing a close friendship with [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]. Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant-garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its [[Realism (theatre)|psychological]] and [[Socialist realism|socialist]] varieties. "Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]," [[Raymond Williams]] argues, while [[Peter Bürger]] dubs him "the most important [[Materialism|materialist]] writer of our time."&lt;ref&gt;The quotation from Raymond Williams is on page 277 of his book (1993) and that from Peter Bürger on page 88 of his (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Brecht was also influenced by Chinese theatre, and used its aesthetic as an argument for ''Verfremdungseffekt''. Brecht believed, "Traditional Chinese acting also knows the alienation [sic] effect, and applies it most subtly.&lt;ref&gt;"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 91&lt;/ref&gt;... The [Chinese] performer portrays incidents of utmost passion, but without his delivery becoming heated."&lt;ref&gt;"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 92&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht attended a Chinese opera performance and was introduced to the famous Chinese opera performer [[Mei Lanfang]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=40246399|title=Bertolt Brecht in China and His Impact on Chinese Drama|first=Adrian|last=Hsia|journal=[[Comparative Literature Studies]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=&lt;!-- [northern] Summer --&gt; 1983|pages=231–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Brecht was sure to distinguish between Epic and Chinese theatre. He recognized that the Chinese style was not a "transportable piece of technique,"&lt;ref&gt;"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; and that Epic theatre sought to historicize and address social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Brecht used his poetry to criticize European culture, including [[Nazis]], and the German [[bourgeoisie]]. Brecht's poetry is marked by the effects of the First and [[Second World War]]s. Many of the poems take a [[Marxism|Marxist]] {{citation needed|reason=Brecht denied this charge at the McCarthy trials – which also requires citation.|date=December 2014}} outlook.

Throughout his theatric production, poems are incorporated into this plays with music. In 1951, Brecht issued a recantation of his apparent suppression of poetry in his plays with a note titled ''On Poetry and Virtuosity''. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We shall not need to speak of a play's poetry ... something that seemed relatively unimportant in the immediate past. It seemed not only unimportant, but misleading, and the reason was not that the poetic element had been sufficiently developed and observed, but that reality had been tampered with in its name ... we had to speak of a truth as distinct from poetry ... we have given up examining works of art from their poetic or artistic aspect, and got satisfaction from theatrical works that have no sort of poetic appeal ... Such works and performances may have some effect, but it can hardly be a profound one, not even politically. For it is a peculiarity of the theatrical medium that it communicates awarenesses and impulses in the form of pleasure: the depth of the pleasure and the impulse will correspond to the depth of the pleasure.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Brecht's most influential poetry is featured in his ''Manual of Piety (Devotions)'', establishing him as a noted poet.

== Impact ==
Brecht's widow, the actress [[Helene Weigel]], continued to manage the Berliner Ensemble until her death in 1971; it was primarily devoted to performing Brecht's plays.

Besides being an influential dramatist and poet, some scholars have stressed the significance of Brecht's original contributions in political and social philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Social and Political Philosophy of Bertolt Brecht|last = Squiers|first = Anthony|publisher = Rodopi|year = 2014|isbn = 9789042038998|location = Amsterdam|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brecht's collaborations with Kurt Weill have had some influence in rock music. The "[[Alabama Song]]" for example, originally published as a poem in Brecht's ''Hauspostille'' (1927) and set to music by Weill in ''Mahagonny'', has been recorded by [[The Doors]], on their self-titled debut album, as well as by [[David Bowie]] and various other bands and performers since the 1960s.

Brecht's son, [[Stefan Brecht]], became a poet and theatre critic interested in New York's [[Experimental theatre|avant-garde theatre]].

== Brecht in fiction, drama and film ==
* In the 1930 novel ''Success'', Brecht's mentor [[Lion Feuchtwanger]] immortalized Brecht as the character Kaspar Pröckl.
* In the [[Günter Grass]] play ''The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising '' (1966), Brecht appears as "The Boss", rehearsing [[Coriolanus (Brecht)|his version]] of Shakespeare's ''[[Coriolanus]]'' against the background of [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|worker unrest in East Berlin in 1953]].
* Cuban songwriter [[Silvio Rodríguez]] started his song Sueño con serpientes from the album Días y flores (1975) with a phrase of Brecht.
* Brecht appears as a character in [[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''Tales from Hollywood'', first produced in 1982, dealing with German expatriates in Hollywood at the time of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] hearings on supposed Communist infiltration of the motion picture industry and the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist.
* In [[Peter Weiss|Peter Weiss's]] monumental novel of 1981 ''Die Ästhetik des Widerstands'' ([[The Aesthetics of Resistance]]) Brecht is a teacher for the narrator who aspires to become a writer.
* In the 1999 film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' Brecht appears as an inspiration to [[Marc Blitzstein]].
* The 2000 German film ''[[The Farewell|Abschied – Brechts letzter Sommer]]'' (''The Farewell''), directed by [[Jan Schütte]], depicts Brecht ([[Josef Bierbichler]]) shortly before his death, attended to by Helene Weigel ([[Monica Bleibtreu]]) and two former lovers.
* In the 2006 film ''[[The Lives of Others]]'', a [[Stasi]] agent played by [[Ulrich Mühe]] is partially inspired to save a playwright he has been spying on by reading a book of Brecht poetry that he had stolen from the artist's apartment. In particular, the poem "[[Reminiscence of Marie A.]]" is read.
* ''Brecht at Night'' by [[Mati Unt]], transl. Eric Dickens ([[Dalkey Archive Press]], 2009)
* In Robert Cohen's historical novel ''Exil der frechen Frauen'' (2009) Brecht is a major character.
* The 2013 film ''[[Witness 11]]'' draws upon historical events exploring the justice-thirsty courtroom through the eyes of Brecht as he is called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
* In the 2013 Italian film ''[[Viva la libertà]]'' the Brecht poem ''To a Waverer'' forms the text for an important and moving speech.
* In the 2014 novel ''Leaving Berlin'' by [[Joseph Kanon]], Brecht appears as a cynical returnee to Soviet Berlin, lauded by the authorities as a symbol of communist German culture and willing to ignore moral issues to pursue his art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/books/review/joseph-kanons-leaving-berlin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collaborators and associates ==
Collective and collaborative working methods were inherent to Brecht's approach, as [[Fredric Jameson]] (among others) stresses. Jameson describes the creator of the work not as Brecht the individual, but rather as 'Brecht': a collective subject that "certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or [[Individualism|individualistic]] sense." During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, [[scenographer]]s, directors, [[dramaturg]]s and actors; the list includes: [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], [[Margarete Steffin]], [[Ruth Berlau]], [[Slatan Dudow]], [[Kurt Weill]], [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Paul Dessau]], [[Caspar Neher]], [[Teo Otto]], [[Karl von Appen]], [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]], [[Lotte Lenya]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Therese Giehse]], [[Angelika Hurwicz]], [[Carola Neher]] and Helene Weigel herself. This is "theatre as collective experiment [...] as something radically different from theatre as expression or as experience."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson (1998, 10–11). See also the discussions of Brecht's collaborative relationships in the essays collected in Thomson and Sacks (1994). John Fuegi's take on Brecht's collaborations, detailed in ''Brecht &amp; Co.'' (New York: Grove, 1994; also known as ''The Life and Lies of Bertolt Brecht'') and summarized in his contribution to Thomson and Sacks (1994, 104–116), offers a particularly negative perspective; Jameson comments "his book will remain a fundamental document for future students of the ideological confusions of Western intellectuals during the immediate post-Cold War years" (1998, 31); Olga Taxidou offers a critical account of Fuegi's project from a feminist perspective in "Crude Thinking: John Fuegi and Recent Brecht Criticism" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'' XI.44 (Nov. 1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;381–384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brecht wrote hundreds of poems throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Several of Brecht's poems were set by his collaborator [[Hanns Eisler]] in his ''[[Deutsche Sinfonie]]'', begun in 1935, but not premiered until 1959 (three years after Brecht's death).&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing poetry as a young boy, and his first poems were published in 1914. His poetry was influenced by folk-ballads, French ''chansons'', and the poetry of [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[François Villon|Villon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A '''chansonnier''' ({{lang-ca|cançoner}}, {{lang-oc|cançonièr}}, [[Galician language|Galician]] and {{lang-pt|cancioneiro}}, {{lang-it|canzoniere}} or ''canzoniéro'', {{lang-es|cancionero}}) is a [[manuscript]] or printed book which contains a collection of [[chanson]]s, or [[polyphonic]] and [[Monophony|monophonic]] settings of songs, hence literally "[[songbook|song-books]]," although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the [[Cancioneiro da Vaticana]] and [[Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional]], which contain the bulk of [[Galician-Portuguese lyric]]). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the [[troubadour]]s and [[trouvère]]s of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in [[France]], but also in [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and in the [[Iberian peninsula]].

Command-and-control management is categorised by systems thinkers as the dominant method of management in the Western world. Key influences are said to include [[Alfred P. Sloan]], [[Henry Ford]], [[James O. McKinsey|James McKinsey]] of the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|eponymous accounting firm]], and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. A well-known modern exponent is [[Michael Barber (educationist)|Michael Barber]], himself a partner in McKinsey &amp; Company.

It is characterised by some systems thinkers according to the following attributes:

'''Perspective''': Top-down and hierarchical&lt;br /&gt;
'''Design''': Organisations divided into (ostensibly) independent functional silos. A practice propagated by Alfred Sloan and James McKinsey&lt;br /&gt;
'''Decision-making''': Separated from work. A separation spearheaded by Frederick Winslow Taylor&lt;br /&gt;
'''Measures''': Arbitrary targets analysed by binary comparison&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ethos''': Control of staff&lt;br /&gt;
'''Change''': Plans delivered by Prince II methodology&lt;br /&gt;
'''Motivation''': Control-by-seduction (carrot) and control-by-fear (stick)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Attitude to suppliers and customers''': Contractual.

Key critics of the command-and-control management ethos and techniques include members of the systems-thinking community and associated thinkers, including [[W. Edwards Deming]],&lt;ref&gt;''Out of the Crisis'', W. Edwards Deming, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Seddon]],&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom from Command and Control'', John Seddon, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kōnosuke Matsushita]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vanguard-method.net/library/management-thinkers/konosuke-matsushita/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiichi Ohno]], [[Russell L. Ackoff]],&lt;ref&gt;''Management f-Laws'', Russell Ackoff, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donella Meadows]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thinking in Systems'', Donella Meadows, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfie Kohn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Punished by Rewards'', Alfie Kohn, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and the outspoken [[The Vanguard Method|Vanguard Method]] practitioner John Little.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/11/snouts-in-the-trough-outsourcing-farm.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century John Seddon in particular has been deeply critical of successive [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK governments]]' propagation of command-and-control thinking in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], local authorities, and other public services.

Organisations credited with having moved away from the command-and-control paradigm to a systems-thinking philosophy include [[Harley Davidson]] and [[Aviva]], in addition to many Japanese companies, such as [[Toyota]], [[Honda]], and [[Panasonic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11675">[[File:Boys King Arthur - N. C. Wyeth - p306.jpg|thumb|Conflict in narrative comes in many forms. "Man versus man", such as is depicted here in the battle between [[King Arthur]] and [[Mordred]], is particularly common in traditional literature, [[fairy tale]]s and [[Mythology|myths]].&lt;ref name="Nikolajeva2005"/&gt;]]

In works of [[narrative]], '''conflict''' is the challenge [[main character]]s need to solve to achieve their [[goal]]s.

Traditionally, conflict is a major [[literary element]] that creates challenges in a story by adding uncertainty to if the goal would be achieved. A narrative is not limited to a single conflict. While conflicts may not always resolve in narrative, the resolution of a conflict creates [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] or fulfillment, which may or may not occur at a story's end.

==Basic nature==
Conflict in literature refers to the different drives of the characters or forces involved. Conflict may be [[internal conflict|internal]] or external—that is, it may occur within a character's mind or between a character and exterior forces, (or point(s) of view). Conflict is most visible between two or more characters, usually a [[protagonist]] and an [[antagonist]]/[[enemy]]/[[villain]], but can occur in many different forms. A character may as easily find himself or herself in conflict with a natural force, such as an animal or a weather event, like a hurricane. The literary purpose of conflict is to create tension in the story, making readers more interested by leaving them uncertain which of the characters or forces will prevail.&lt;ref name="Roberts86"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Edgar V.|author2=Henry E. Jacobs|title=Literature: An Introduction to Reading and Writing|year=1986|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=013537572X|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be multiple points of conflict in a single story, as characters may have more than one desire or may struggle against more than one opposing force.&lt;ref name="Abbott2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=H. Porter|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative|date=7 April 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71515-7|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a conflict is resolved and the reader discovers which force or character succeeds, it creates a sense of closure.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott (2008), 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts may resolve at any point in a story, particularly where more than one conflict exists, but stories do not always resolve every conflict. If a story ends without resolving the main or major conflict(s), it is said to have an "open" ending.&lt;ref name=Toscan&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |section-url=http://www.vcu.edu/arts/playwriting/openending.html |title=Playwriting Seminars 2.0 |section=Open Endings |first=Richard |last=Toscan |publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open endings, which can serve to ask the reader to consider the conflict more personally, may not satisfy them, but obvious conflict resolution may also leave readers disappointed in the story.&lt;ref name=Toscan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/feb/10/some-conclusions-about-endings | title = Some conclusions about endings | first = Stephen | last = Emms | work = The Guardian | date = February 10, 2010 | accessdate = 26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
The basic types of conflict in fiction have been commonly codified as "man against man", "man against nature", and "man against self."&lt;ref name="Simpson2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Judith|title=Foundations of Fiction|date=1 August 2001|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-19791-0|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Irvin Ross|title=Write Now|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-0-7607-4178-8|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although frequently cited, these three types of conflict are not universally accepted.

"Man against man" conflict involves stories where characters are against each other.&lt;ref name="Ross1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb2008"/&gt; This is an external conflict. The conflict may be direct opposition, as in a gunfight or a robbery, or it may be a more subtle conflict between the desires of two or more characters, as in a romance or a family epic. This type of conflict is very common in traditional literature, fairy tales and myths.&lt;ref name="Nikolajeva2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolajeva|first=Maria|title=Aesthetic Approaches to Children's Literature: An Introduction|date=12 May 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5426-0|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of the "man against man" conflict is the relationship struggles between the protagonist and the antagonist stepfather in ''[[This Boy's Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Ballon2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ballon|first=Rachel|title=Breathing Life Into Your Characters|date=21 January 2011|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-59963-342-8|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s struggles with the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Tom Sawyer]]'s confrontation with Injun Joe in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''.&lt;ref name="Nikolajeva2005"/&gt;

===Man against nature===
"Man against nature" conflict is an external struggle positioning the hero against an animal or a [[natural phenomenon|force of nature]], such as a storm or tornado or snow.&lt;ref name="Ross1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb2008"/&gt; The "man against nature" conflict is central to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', where the protagonist contends against a [[marlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballon (2011), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common in adventure stories, including ''[[Robinson Crusoe]].&lt;ref name="Nikolajeva2005"/&gt; [[Man vs. Wild]]'' not only takes its name from this conflict, but it is also a great example, featuring [[Bear Grylls]] and his attempts to keep nature at bay.

===Man against self===
With "man against self" conflict, the struggle is internal.&lt;ref name="Ross1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb2008"/&gt; A character must overcome her/his own nature or make a choice between two or more paths—good and evil; logic and emotion. A serious example of "man against himself" is offered by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]]'s 1978 novel ''[[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|Requiem for a Dream]]'', which centers around stories of [[substance dependence|addiction]].&lt;ref name=Ballon133&gt;Ballon (2011), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]], published in 1994, as well as in its 1999 [[Fight Club|film adaptation]], the unnamed protagonist struggles against himself in what is revealed to be a case of [[dissociative identity disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pallotta |first=Frank |date=20 May 2014 |title='Fight Club' Has A Bunch Of Hidden Clues That Give Away The Film's Big Twist Ending |location=Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' also focuses on internal conflict, as the titular character deals with her own [[neuroses]] and self-doubts.&lt;ref name=Ballon133/&gt;

===Man against society===
Where man stands against a man-made institution (such as slavery or bullying), "man against man" conflict may shade into "man against society".&lt;ref name="Morrell2009"/&gt;  In such stories, characters are forced to make moral choices or frustrated by social rules in meeting their own goals.&lt;ref name="Nikolajeva2005"/&gt; ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' are examples of "man against society" conflicts.&lt;ref name="Morrell2009"/&gt; So is ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', in which the pig Wilbur fights for his survival against a society that raises pigs for food.&lt;ref name="Nikolajeva2005"/&gt;

== History ==
As with other literary terms, these have come about gradually as descriptions of common narrative structures.  Conflict was first described in ancient [[Greek literature]] as the ''agon'', or central contest in tragedy.&lt;ref name="Abbott2008"/&gt;  According to [[Aristotle]], in order to hold the interest, the hero must have a ''single'' conflict.  The agon, or act of conflict, involves the [[protagonist]] (the "first fighter") and the antagonist (a more recent term), corresponding to the hero and villain. The outcome of the contest cannot be known in advance, and according to later critics such as [[Plutarch]], the hero's struggle should be [[Ennoblement|ennobling]].

Even in modern non-dramatic literature, critics have observed that the agon is the central unit of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].  The easier it is for the protagonist to triumph, the less value there is in the drama.  In internal and external conflict alike, the antagonist must act upon the protagonist and must seem at first to overmatch him or her.  For example, in [[William Faulkner]]'s ''The Bear'', nature might be the antagonist.  Even though it is an abstraction, natural creatures and the scenery oppose and resist the protagonist.  In the same story, the young boy's doubts about himself provide an [[internal conflict]], and they seem to overwhelm him.

Similarly, when godlike characters enter (e.g. [[Superman]]), correspondingly great villains have to be created, or natural weaknesses have to be invented, to allow the narrative to have drama. Alternatively, scenarios could be devised in which the character's godlike powers are constrained by some sort of code, or their respective antagonist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8386">The '''conservation and restoration of glass objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[glass]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].
[[File:Roman Brown Glass during and after conservation - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Brown Glass during and after conservation]]

Glass was discovered in the third millennium B.C.E. and is still a relatively new material. The art of glassworking did not occur until long after [[metalworking|metalwork]] or [[pottery]].&lt;ref name= "Koob"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koob |first=Stephen |title=Conservation and Care of Glass Objects |publisher=Archetype Publications |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=1-904982-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. [[Water]] is the primary cause of deterioration in glass materials.&lt;ref name = "Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Newton |first=Roy |author2=Sandra Davison |title= Conservation of Glass |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1989 |isbn=0-408-10623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of deterioration==
'''Weathering'''

[[Weathering]] is a broad definition for any form of deterioration which appears on the surface of the glass and is caused by exposure to adverse conditions.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  Below are the seven typical forms of weathering.

''Dulling'' is the simplest form of weathering. It occurs when glass loses its clarity and transparency and becomes translucent.&lt;ref name= "Tennent"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Tennent |first= Norman, ed. |title= The Conservation of Glass and Ceramics: Research, Practice and Training |publisher= James &amp; James (Science Publishers) Ltd. |year= 1999 |location= London |isbn= 1-873936-18-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Strain cracking'' describes the presence of minuscule cracks running through the glass in all directions, giving it a sugary appearance and causing the glass to disintegrate.

''Frosting''

''[[Iridescence]]'' is caused by continuous flaking of a glass surface causing a multi-colored sheen to appear on the surface of formerly transparent glass.&lt;ref name= "Tennent" /&gt;

''Milky''

''Enamel-like''

'''Devitrification'''
{{Main article|Devitrification}}

Devitrification is the process of converting glass into a crystalline substance by heating it to a temperature just below its melting point then cooled. By doing this, the randomly situated molecules in the glass, when cooled, will attempt to settle in a less random and more crystalline form.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt; This technique is used to create an opaque appearance in the glass. Due to the high level of stress this technique places on the glass, it may cause the glass to deteriorate.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  For more information on devitrification as an artistic technique, see the main article above.

The term "devitrification" is used by archaeologists and art historians to refer to a glass object which has lost it [[vitreous lustre|vitreous nature]], giving the glass a weathered appearance.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  This is first caused by the loss of [[alkali]] then followed by the loss of other materials of the glass, and finally the creation of a silica gel, indicating the change in the glass's chemical composition.

'''Crizzling'''
{{Main article|Crizzling}}

Atmospheric deterioration, commonly referred to as crizzling, weeping or glass disease is primarily caused by a chemical imbalance in specific types of glass, though it can occur in almost any glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;  This form of deterioration is a basic defect in glass caused by incorrect proportions of ingredients, particularly an excess of alkali in the glass composite.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt; Crizzling occurs in 5 main stages.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

''Stage One''

:The "initial stage" of crizzling occurs when alkali is present on the glass, giving the glass a cloudy or hazy appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/article/crizzling |title=Crizzling |author= |date=April 26, 2012 |work= |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If neglected, crizzling's initial stage may occur within five or 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. Indications of crizzling may be seen as tiny droplets in high (above 55%) humidity or as fine crystals in low (below 40%) relative humidity.&lt;ref name = "Koob" /&gt; A feeling of slippery or slimy glass is another possible indication of stage one crizzling. The initial stage is treatable. Washing the glass removes the alkali and will keep the glass looking new.:

''Stage Two''

:"Incipient crizzling" has similar characteristic symptoms as stage one, however, the haziness seen on the glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks, which appear as tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt; A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks.  These cracks are the first sign of deterioration in the glass. The cracks are caused by a combination of the cycling of the glass through humid and dry environments and the loss of alkali, leaving microscopic voids in the glass.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

''Stage Three''

:"Full-blown crizzling" occurs when the fine cracks in the glass during stage two of deterioration have progressed and are visible to the naked eye. In some cases, the crazing also gains a more uniform appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;  The deeper cracks are indicative of higher amounts of alkali leaching from the glass composition. Crizzling may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass. Crizzling is far more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow. Symptoms of stage one and two may also be present on the glass if this advanced form of deterioration has not affected all of the glass's surface.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

''Stage Four''

:"Advanced crizzling" shows distinctive cracks on the surface of the glass. The fissures may be so deep that some surface material may be lost from flaking of chipping, this is referred to as spalling.:&lt;ref name="Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

''Stage Five''

:The "fragmentation stage" of crizzling is the final stage of deterioration and occurs when the structural integrity of the glass is no longer present causing the glass to separate into pieces.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

'''Brittleness'''

== Preventive conservation ==
{{Main article|Collections care}}

'''Storage and handling'''

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

'''Crow Canyon Archaeological Center'''  is a {{convert|170|acre|adj=on}} research center and "living classroom" located in southwestern [[Colorado]], USA, which offers experiential education programs for students and adults.

Crow Canyon is a center for archaeological research, education, and preservation of the history of the [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]], who lived on and in the cliff dwellings of [[Mesa Verde]] more than seven centuries ago. Established by private cultural initiatives that continue the work of American benefactors, the center provides hands-on programs for people to experience archaeological excavation of Native American sites.

== Brief history ==

Crow Canyon is the result of work in experiential and hands-on education started in 1967 by Edward F. Berger, a history teacher with the Cherry Creek Schools near Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Edward|title=Crow Canyon: Pioneering Education and Archaeology on the Southwestern Colorado Frontier|date=1st Edition 1993; 2nd Edition 2009|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington Indiana|isbn=978-1-4389-6009-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger brought students to SW Colorado  and involved them in building community and programs that increased motivation and accelerated learning.  Because of the rich prehistoric cultural base in the area, archaeology was added to the curricula and Berger, with the help of Dr. Art Rohn (then of Wichita State University) supported Rohn’s graduate students to teach and supervise high school students doing original research excavating ancient pueblo sites.  The development of this arrangement with academic scholars and the involvement and teaching of high school age students is believed to be first of its kind.

In 1972, Berger began working through the University of Northern Colorado on a doctoral program designed to create and field test experiential, motivational, and accelerated learning programs. These programs were interdisciplinary, supplemental high school credit courses . In 1972, Berger wrote the non-profit corporation Crow Canyon operates under today. Then it was called I-S Education Programs. 
In 1974, Berger purchased 80 acres of land west of Cortez, Colorado on Crow Canyon and began designing a year round campus . He earned his Ed.D. in 1975. His research into learning continued and from 1975 until 1986, Berger, now joined by his wife Joanne, pioneered new and effective learning and teaching techniques. The challenge was taking a student from zero knowledge about SW history and archaeology to working alongside of an academic scholar – and being effective – in two days. The accelerated learning techniques he developed made this possible.

The original campus facilities were basic, but “better than tents.” Educational programs were expanded to age groups 10 – 80 years of age. Dr. Ron Gould was the first staff archaeologist and teacher. Significant involvement with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe resulted in special Native American programs on campus and deep and lasting relationships with Ute Neighbors. Survey work in the areas west of the campus resulted in the identification and naming of sites (Smithsonian Numbers). Many bear the names of the schools across the US whose students identified them.

By the early 80s, Crow Canyon was well known for its educational programs and its archaeological research. The Bergers needed capital to improve the campus and to free them of 24/7/365 responsibility. They learned of the Foundation for Illinois Archaeology and its fledgling program at Kampsville, Illinois. A young and dynamic man, Clark Hinsdale, was building an educational component. Bergers contacted professor Struever at Northwestern University who headed the FIA. Struever was a successful fundraiser and promoter. By 1983, negations resulted in a merger of the two non-profit corporations note that Non-profit corporations are not bought and sold. FIA then changed its name to The Center for American Archaeology (at Northwestern University). CAA paid off I-SEP’s debts and Bergers donated 70 acres of land. A new lodge designed to house 40 students was built. A lab building was provided. Additional research archaeologists were hired, and Bergers identified two major sites for research: Sand Canyon Pueblo, and the Duckfoot Site. Southwest archaeologists coordinated the research design and standards, academic supervision, and selection of staff archaeologists.

In the spring of 1986, knowing that the center was on firm ground, Jo and Ed Berger resigned their positions of executive director and associate director respectively. They were able to pick their successor, Ian Sandy Thompson. So much had been accomplished and the model that drives Crow Canyon today had been tested and functioning for almost 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Edward|title=Crow Canyon: Pioneering Education and Archaeology on the Southwestern Colorado Frontier|date=1st Edition 1993; 2nd Edition 2009|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington Indiana|isbn=978-1-4389-6009-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crow Canyon Today ==

Since its foundation, the mission of Crow Canyon has been to preserve and protect the rich heritage of the ancient Pueblo Indians (or Anasazi) of the American Southwest[3]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crow Canyon Website|url=http://www.crowcanyon.org/index.php/about-us|website=Crow Canyon's Mission|publisher=Crow Canyon Archaeological Center|accessdate=19 June 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and to educate the public of the need to preserve and protect archaeological resources. Archaeological research has been conducted in the Mesa Verde region with the goal of teaching archaeology through hands-on experience. Students and teachers alike are invited to participate in research in the archaeological camp.

Key initiatives include education, research, and cultural programs. President and CEO Deborah Gangloff defines Crow Canyon's programs as an opportunity: " to not only learn archaeology and do archaeology...but also to have some fun ".[2]

An '''ethics committee''' is a body responsible for ensuring that medical experimentation and human research are carried out in an ethical manner in accordance with national and international law.

==Specific regions==
An [[Ethics committee (European Union)|ethics committee in the European Union]] is a body responsible for oversight of medical or human research studies in EU member states. Local terms for a European ethics committee include:
* A Research Ethics Committee (REC) in the United Kingdom
* A Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC) in the Netherlands.
* A Comités de Protection des Personnes (CPP) in France.

In the United States, an ethics committee is usually known as an [[institutional review board]] and is dedicated to overseeing the rights and well-being of research subjects participating in scientific studies in the US. Similarly in Canada, the committee is called a Research Ethics Board (REB).

In Australia, an ethics committee in medical research refers to a [[National Health and Medical Research Council|Human Research Ethics Committee]] (HREC).

==History==
[[File:Herta Oberheuser sentencing.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Herta Oberheuser]] being sentenced at Nuremberg]]
One of the most fundamental ethical principles in human experimentation is that the experimenter should not subject the participants in the experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves.  This idea was first codified in the [[Nuremberg Code]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/nurcode.html The Nuremberg Code], U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, accessed and archived, 20 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, which was a result of the [[Doctors' trial|trials of Nazi doctors]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments.  Several of these doctors were hanged.  Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part.  The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Altman, pp. xv-xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ethical principle is that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting.  Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an [[AIDS]] vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

An important element of an ethics committee's oversight is to ensure that [[informed consent]] of the subjects has been given. Informed consent is the principle that the volunteers in the experiment should fully understand the procedure that is going to take place, be aware of all the risks involved, and give their consent to taking part in the experiment beforehand.  The principle of informed consent was first enacted in the [[U.S. Army]]'s research into [[Yellow fever]] in [[Cuba]] in 1901.  However, there was no general or official guidance at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Gandevia, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  That remained the case until the yellow fever program was referenced in the drafting of the Nuremberg Code.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, pp. xvi,157&lt;/ref&gt;  This was further developed in the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] in 1964 by the [[World Medical Association]] which has since become the foundation for ethics committees' guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Gandevia, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

The convening of ethics committees to approve the research protocol in human experiments was first written into international guidelines in the first revision to the Declaration of Helsinki (Helsinki II, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Riis, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  A controversy arose over the fourth revision (1996) concerning placebo trials in [[developing country|developing countries]]. It was claimed that US trials of the anti-[[HIV]] drug [[zidovudine]] in India was in breach of this requirement. This led the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] to cease incorporating new revisions of Helsinki and refer instead to the 1989 revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Carlson, Boyd &amp; Webb, pp. 698-699|Levine, p. 170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics committees are also made a requirement in ''[[International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects]]'', produced by the [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences]] (CIOMS), a body set up by the [[World Health Organization]].  First published in 1993, the CIOMS guidelines have no legal force but they have been influential in the drafting of national regulations for ethics committees.  The COIMS guidelines are focused on practice in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Largent, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expectancy violations theory''' ('''EVT''') is a theory of [[communication]] that analyzes how individuals respond to unanticipated violations of social [[Norm (social)|norms]] and expectations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgoon|first1=J.K.|last2=Hale|first2=J.L.|title=Nonverbal Expectancy Violations: Model Elaboration and Application to Immediacy Behaviors|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1988|volume=55|pages=58–79|doi=10.1080/03637758809376158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed by [[Judee K. Burgoon]] in the late 1970s and continued through the 1980s and 1990s as "nonverbal expectancy violations theory", based on Burgoon's research studying [[proxemics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgoon 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgoon|first=Judee|title=Applying a comparative approach to nonverbal expectancy violations theory|year=1992|publisher=Sage|pages=53–69|url=}} In J. Blumler, K. E. Rosengren, &amp; J. M. McLeod (Eds.), Comparatively speaking: Communication and culture across space and time (pp. 53–69). Newbury Park, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; Burgoon's work initially analyzed individuals' allowances and expectations of personal distance and how responses to personal distance violations were influenced by the level of liking and relationship to the violators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgoon|first1=J.K.|last2=Jones|first2=S.B.|title=Toward a Theory of Personal Space Expectations and their Violations|journal=Human Communication Research|date=1976|volume=2|issue=2|pages=131–146|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00706.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was later changed to its current name when other researchers began to focus on violations of social behavior expectations beyond nonverbal communication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Relational quality and relationships: An expectancy violations analysis|last = Guerrero|first = L.K.|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|doi = 10.1177/0265407506070476|pmid = |first2 = G.F.|last2 = Bachman |volume=23 |issue = 6|pages=943–963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory sees communication as an exchange of behaviors, where one individual's behavior can be used to violate the expectations of another. Participants in communication will perceive the exchange either positively or negatively, depending upon an existing personal relationship or how favorably the violation is perceived.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J.

Beyond proxemics and examining how people interpret violations in many given communicative contexts, EVT also makes specific predictions about individuals' reaction to given expectation violations: individuals reciprocate or match someone's unexpected behavior, and they also compensate or counteract by doing the opposite of the communicator's behavior.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Mark|last2=Stukas|first2=Arthur A.|year=1999|title=Interpersonal Processes: The Interplay of Cognitive, Motivational, and Behavioral Activities in Social Interaction|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=50|pages=273–303|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.273|pmid=10074680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
The expectancy violations theory examines three main components in interpersonal communication situations:  Expectancies, communicator reward valence, and violation valence.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|last1=Griffin|first1=Em|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-0073534305|edition=8|location=|pages=84–92|chapter=Chapter 7: Expectancy Violations Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expectancy ===

Expectancy refers to what an individual anticipates will happen in a given situation. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] of the communicators.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=M. B.|last2=Yuhua|first2=J. L.|year=2007|title=Students' Reactions to Teachers' Management of Compulsive Communicators|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=56|issue=|pages=18–33|doi=10.1080/03634520601016178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoon (1978) notes that people do not view others' behaviors as random. Rather, they have various expectations of how others should think and behave. EVT proposes that observation and interaction with others leads to expectancies. The two types of expectancies noted are predictive and prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Houser"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Are We Violating Their Expectations? Instructor Communication Expectations of Traditional and Nontraditional Students|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=2005|volume=53|issue=2|pages=217–218|doi=10.1080/01463370500090332|url=|author=M. L. Houser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive expectations are "behaviors we expect to see because they are the most typical," (Houser, 2005) and vary across cultures.&lt;ref name="Houser" /&gt; They let people know what to expect based upon what typically occurs within the context of a particular environment and relationship.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; For example, a husband and wife may have an evening routine in which the husband always washes the dishes. If he were to ignore the dirty dishes one night, this might be seen as a predictive discrepancy. Prescriptive expectations, on the other hand, are based upon "beliefs about what behaviors should be performed" and "what is needed and desired" (Houser, 2005).&lt;ref name="Houser" /&gt; If a person walks into a police department to report a crime, the person will have an expectation that the police will file a report and follow up with an investigation.

When the theory was first proposed, EVT identified three factors which influence a person's expectations:  Interactant variables, environmental variables, and variables related to the nature of the interaction.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K.|author2=S. B. Jones|title=Toward a Theory of Personal Space Expectations and Their Violations|journal=Human Communication Research|year=1976|volume=2|issue=2|pages=131–146|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00706.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactant variables are the traits of those persons involved in the communication, such as sex, attractiveness, race, culture, status, and age.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nonverbal Expectancies and the Evaluative Consequences of Violations|url = |journal = Human Communication Research|date = 1990-12-01|issn = 1468-2958|pages = 232–265|volume = 17|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1990.tb00232.x|first = Judee K.|last = Burgoon|first2 = Joseph B.|last2 = Walther}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental variables include the amount of space available and the nature of the territory surrounding the interaction.  Interaction variables include [[social norms]], purpose of the interaction, and formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Jones, 1976" /&gt;

These factors later evolved into communicator characteristics, relational characteristics, and context.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  Communicator characteristics include personal features such as an individual's appearance, personality and communication style.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; It also includes factors such as age, sex and ethnic background.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4129-7737-1|page=91|author=L. K. Guerrero|edition=3rd |author2=P. A. Anderson |author3=V. A. Afifi|chapter=Making Sense of Our World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational characteristics refer to factors such as similarity, familiarity, status and liking.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt; The type of relationship one individual shares within another (e.g. romantic, business or platonic), the previous experiences shared between the individuals, and how close they are with one another are also relational characteristics that influence expectations.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson" /&gt; Context encompasses both environment and interaction characteristics.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Anderson" /&gt;  Communicator characteristics lead to distinctions between males and females in assessing the extent to which their nonverbal expressions of power and dominance effect immediacy behaviors.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Silent Messages|last = Mehrabrian|first = A.|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Belmont, CA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediacy cues such as conversational distance, lean, body orientation, gaze, and touch may differ between the genders as they create psychological closeness or distance between the interactants.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

[[Behavioural]] expectations may also shift depending on the environment one is experiencing. For example, a visit to a church will produce different expectations than a social function. The expected violations will therefore be altered. Similarly, expectations differ based on culture. In [[Europe]], one may expect to be greeted with three kisses on alternating cheeks, but this is not the case in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebenius|first=James K.|title=Assess, Don't Assume, Part I: Etiquette and National Culture in Negotiation|date=2009|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=37171}} Harvard Business School Working Paper, No. 10-048.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communicator reward valence  ===

The communicator reward valence is an evaluation one makes about the person who committed a violation of expectancy. Em Griffin summarizes the concept behind Communicator Reward Valence as "the sum of positive and negative attributes brought to the encounter plus the potential to reward or punish in the future".&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt;  The [[social exchange theory]] explains that individuals seek to reward some and seek to avoid punishing others.&lt;ref name="West &amp; Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=R. L.|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year=2007|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|isbn=9780073135618|page=188|edition=3rd|author2=L. H. Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one individual interacts with another, Burgoon believes he or she will assess the "positive and negative attributes that person brings to the encounter".&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  If the person has the ability to reward or punish the receiver in the future, then the person has a positive reward valence. Rewards simply refer to the person's ability to provide a want or need. The term 'communicator reward valence' is used to describe the results of this assessment.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;  For example, people will feel encouraged during conversation when the listener is nodding, making eye contact, and responding actively. Conversely, if the listener is avoiding eye contact, yawning, and texting, it is implied they have no interest in the interaction and the speaker may feel violated.

When examining the context, relationship, and communicator's characteristics in a given encounter, individuals will arrive at an expectation for how that person should behave. Changing even one of these expectancy variables may lead to a different expectation.&lt;ref name=Dainton2010/&gt;

=== Violation valence ===

Behavior violations arouse and distract, calling attention to the qualities of the violator and the relationship between the interactants.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = W. A. | last2 = Metts | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Characteristics and Consequences of Expectation Violations in Close Relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 365–392 | doi=10.1177/0265407598153004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key component of EVT is the notion of violation [[Valence (psychology)|valence]], or the association the receiver places on the behavior violation.&lt;ref name="Houser, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Houser | first1 = M. L. | year = 2005 | title = Are We Violating Their Expectations? Instructor Communication Expectations of Traditional and Non Traditional Students | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 213–228 | doi=10.1080/01463370500090332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A violatee's response to an expectancy violation can be positive or negative, and is dependent on two conditions:  positive or negative interpretation of the behavior and the nature (rewardingness) of the violator.  Rewardingness of the violator is evaluated through many categories – attractiveness, prestige, ability to provide resources, or associated relationship.  For instance, a violation of one's personal distance might have more positive valence if committed by a wealthy, powerful, physically appealing member of the opposite sex than a filthy, poor, homeless person with foul breath. The evaluation of the violation is based upon the relationship between the particular behavior and the valence of the actor.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998" /&gt;  A person's preinteractional expectancies, especially
personal attributes, may cause a perceiver to evaluate the communication behavior
of a target differently in terms of assigning positive and negative valenced expectancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1993.tb00316.x|title = Effects of Communication Expectancies, Actual Communication, and Expectancy Disconfirmation on Evaluations of Communicators and Their Communication Behavior|journal = Human Communication Research|volume = 20|pages = 67–96|year = 1993|last1 = Burgoon|first1 = Judee K.|last2 = Le Poire|first2 = Beth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective of violation valence is that the perceived positive or negative value assigned to a breach of expectations is inconsequential of who the violator is.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt; This perspective places much greater weight on the act of the breach itself than the violator.  The difference between the negative violation and the negative confirmation do not appear significant. Dis-confirmations tend to intensify the outcomes, especially in the positive violation condition.&lt;ref name=Dainton2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dainton|first1=Marianne|last2=Zelley|first2=Elaine D.|title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life: A Practical Introduction|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1412976916|pages=48–49|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arousal ===
Expectancy violations refer to actions which are noticeably discrepant from an expectancy and are classified as outside the range of expectancy. The term 'arousal value' is used to describe the consequences of deviations from expectations. When individuals' expectations are violated, their interests or attentions are aroused.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;

When [[arousal]] occurs, one's interest or attention to the deviation increases, resulting in less attention paid to the message and more attention to the source of the arousal.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Le Poire|first1=Beth A.|last2=Burgoon|first2=Judee K.|year=1996|title=Usefulness of differentiating arousal responses within communication theories: Orienting response or defensive arousal within nonverbal theories of expectancy violation|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=63|issue=3|pages=208–230|doi=10.1080/03637759609376390}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of arousals. Cognitive arousal is an idea that people will be mentally aware of the violation. Physical occurs when people have body actions and behaviors in response to the deviations from their expectations.&lt;ref name="West &amp; Turner" /&gt;

=== Threat threshold ===
The occurrence of arousal is aligned with threats. Burgoon introduced the term "threat threshold" to explain that people have different levels of tolerance about distant violations. The threat threshold is high when people feel good even if they keep a very close distance with the violator, whereas people with low threat threshold will be sensitive and uncomfortable about the closeness of distance with the violator.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978" /&gt;

== Theoretical assumptions and viewpoints ==

=== Propositions ===
After assessing expectancy, violation valence, and communicator reward valence of a given situation, it becomes possible to make rather specific predictions about whether the individual who perceived the violation will reciprocate or compensate the behavior in question. Guerrero (1996) and Burgoon (2000) noticed that predictable patterns develop when considering reward valence and violation valence together.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L. K. | last2 = Burgoon | first2 = J. K. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment Styles and Reactions to Nonverbal Involvement Change in Romantic Dyads Patterns of Reciprocity and Compensation | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 335–370 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00371.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if the violation valence is perceived as positive and the communicator reward valence is also perceived as positive, the theory predicts individuals will reciprocate the positive behavior. For example, your boss gives you a big smile after you have given a presentation. Guerrero and Burgoon would predict that you would smile in return. Similarly, if you perceive the violation valence as negative and perceive the communicator reward valence as negative, the theory again predicts that you reciprocate the negative behavior. Thus, if a disliked coworker is grouchy and unpleasant towards you, you will likely reciprocate and be unpleasant in return.

Conversely, if one perceives a negative violation valence but views the communicator reward valence as positive, it is likely that the person will compensate for his or her partner's negative behavior. For example, one day your boss appears sullen and throws a stack of papers in front of you. Rather than grunt back, EVT predicts that you will compensate for your boss' negativity, perhaps by asking if everything is OK (Guerrero &amp; Burgoon, 1996). More difficult to predict, however, is the situation in which a person who is viewed unfavorably violates another with positive behavior. In this situation, the receiver may reciprocate, giving the person the "benefit of the doubt."&lt;ref name="Dainton2010" /&gt;

The assumptions discussed thus far can be summarized into six major propositions posited by Expectancy Violations Theory:&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Burgoon, J. K., Stern L. A., &amp; Dillman, L. (1995). Interpersonal adaptation. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# People develop expectations about verbal and nonverbal [[communication]] behavior from other people.
# Violations of these expectations cause arousal and distraction, further leading the receiver to shift his or her attention to the other, the relationship, and the meaning of the violation.
# Communicator reward valence determines the interpretation of ambiguous communication.
# Communicator reward valence determines how the behavior is evaluated.
# Violation valences are determined by three factors:  (1) The evaluation of the behavior; (2) whether or not the behavior is more or less favorable than the expectation; and (3) the magnitude of the violation.  A positive violation occurs when the behavior is more favorable than the expectation.  A negative violation occurs when the behavior is less favorable.
# Positive violations produce more favorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations, and negative violations produce more unfavorable outcomes than behavior that matches expectations.

=== Needs for personal space and affiliation ===

Expectancy violations theory builds upon a number of communication [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; EVT assumes that humans have two competing needs:  A need for personal space and a need for [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; Specifically, humans all need a certain amount of personal space, also referred to as distance or privacy.&lt;ref name=Burgoon,1978 /&gt; People also desire a certain amount of closeness with others, or affiliation.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt; EVT seeks to explain 'personal space', and the meanings that are formed when expectations of appropriate personal space are infringed or violated.&lt;ref name="Dainton2010"/&gt;

Another feature of personal space is [[territoriality]]. Territoriality refers to behavior which "is characterized by identification with a geographic area in a way that indicates ownership" (Hall, 1966).&lt;ref name=Hall,1966&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=E. T.|title=The Hidden Dimension|year=1966|publisher=Anchor Books|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0385084765|pages=113–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, territoriality refers to an individual's sense of ownership over physical items, space, objects or ideas, and defensive behavior in response to territorial invasions.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Territoriality involves three territory types:  Primary territories, secondary territories and public territories.&lt;ref name=Altman,1975&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=I.|title=Environment and social behavior: Privacy, personal space, territory, and crowding|year=1975|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|location=Monterey, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary territories are considered exclusive to an individual.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Secondary territories are objects, spaces or places which "can be claimed temporarily" (Hall, 1966), but are neither central to the individual's life nor are exclusively owned.&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt;  Public territories are "available to almost anyone for temporary ownership".&lt;ref name="Hall,1966"/&gt; Territoriality is frequently accompanied by prevention and reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction|year=2005|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0534625634|page=124|author=M. L. Knapp|edition=6th|author2=J. A. Hall|chapter=The Communication Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an individual perceives one of their needs has been compromised, EVT predicts that they will react. For instance, when an offensive violation occurs, the individual tends to react as though protecting their territory.

=== Proxemics ===
EVT offers an opportunity to study how individuals communicate through personal space. This part of the theory explains the notion of "[[personal space]]" and our reactions to others who appear to "violate" our sense of personal space.&lt;ref name="Burgoon 89"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgoon|first=J.|title=Nonverbal communication|year=1989|publisher=Harper&amp;Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; What we define as personal space, however, varies from culture to culture and from person to person. The "success" or "failure" of violations are linked to perceived attraction, credibility, influence and involvement. The context and purpose of interaction are relevant, as are the communicator characteristics of gender, relationships, status, social class, ethnicity and culture.&lt;ref name="Burgoon 89" /&gt; When it comes to different interactions between people, what each person expects out of the interaction will influence their individual willingness to risk violation. If a person feels comfortable in a situation, they are more likely to risk violation, and in turn will be rewarded for it.

Introduced by [[Edward T. Hall|Edward Hall in 1966]], [[Proxemics]] deals with the amount of distance between people as they interact with one another.&lt;ref name="Edward Hall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Edward|title=The Hidden Dimension|year=1966|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-0-385-08476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial distance during an interaction can be an indication of what type of relationship exists between the people involved.

[[File:Proxemics.png|thumb|
Personal Space Expectations diagram
]]

There are 4 different personal zones defined by Hall. These zones include:

# '''Intimate Distance:''' ''(0-18 inches)'' - This distance is for close, intimate encounters. Normally core family, close friends, [[Sexual partner|lovers]], or [[pet]]s. People will normally share a unique level of comfort with one another.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://proxemics.weebly.com/types-of-proxemics.html | title=Proxemics - Types of Proxemics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Personal Distance:''' ''(18 inches – 4 feet)'' - Reserved for conversations with [[friendship|friends]], [[extended family]], associates, and group discussions. The personal distance will give each person more space compared with the intimate distance, but is still close enough to involve touching one another.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com" /&gt;
# '''Social Distance:''' ''(4–10 feet)'' - This distance is reserved for newly formed groups, and new acquaintances and colleagues you may have just met. People generally do not engage physically with one another within this section.&lt;ref name="proxemics.weebly.com" /&gt; 
# '''Public Distance:''' ''(10 feet to infinity)'' - Reserved for a public setting with large [[audience]]s, strangers, [[Public speaking|speeches]], and [[theater]]s. 
&lt;ref name="Edward Hall" /&gt;

Many different cultures are influenced by [[Proxemics]] in different ways and respond differently to the same situation. In some cultures, those who have not formed close relationships may greet each other with kisses on the cheek, engaging one another well within the intimate range of proxemics.  In other cultures, a custom greeting is a handshake which maintains a physical separation but is well within personal distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://proxemics.weebly.com/proxemics-and-culture.html | title=Proxemics - Proxemics and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the [[Proxemics|Proxemic]] Zones, actions can be interpreted differently among different cultures. For example, Japanese people do not address others by their first names unless they have been given permission. Calling someone by their first name in Japan without permission is considered an insult. In the Japanese culture, they address people using their last name and [[Japanese honorifics|'san']], which is equivalent to 'Mr.','Mrs.' and 'Ms.' in the English language. The way Japanese people address each other is an example of a verbal [[Proxemics|Proxemic]] zone. A Japanese person allowing another to call them by their first name is an example of intimate distance, because this is a privilege extended only someone very close to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://maki.typepad.com/justhungry/2009/08/when-to-use-chan-or-san-and-other-ways-to-address-people-in-japan-.html | title=When to use -chan or -san, and other ways to address people in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Interpersonal communication ===
It is important to note that EVT can apply to both non-relational interaction and close relationships.  In 1998, more than twenty years after the theory was first published, several studies were conducted to catalog the types of expectancy violations commonly found in close relationships.&lt;ref name="Afifi &amp; Metts, 1998" /&gt; Expectations with friends formulate over time and are usually brought together by a series of observations of behavior and predictions on how that friend will act in the future. When these expectations are violated, it often can be damaging and dangerous for a close friendship. It can cause an end to the friendship and bring a strong negative experience in that person's life. After time and experiences with that friend we might suspect them to act consistently around me in the way they have always acted, that is until a violation to this expectation takes place. For example, when they begin “breaking promises or even acting in an inauthentic manner to impress others, can have aversive consequences for close relationships” (Cohen 2010).  The fact is, we expect our friends to act in a social manner where they are adhere to all of our personal rules we set in our minds. That includes being nice, kind, considerate, and refraining from any comment that puts another down. This is a part of the personal rules we set within ourselves with a personal friendship, that is until we are in a different setting with that individual and they are around different people and the rules are broken. While this might be an offense in one’s eyes, it may not be offensive in the others. Each negative experience can deteriorate the relationship and allow more experiences where expectations are continually violated until the relationship is dissolved.   Cohen said “the more that a friendship is voluntary, easily replaceable, and disconnected from external pressures to continue, the more vulnerable it is to expectancy violation damage” (Cohen, 2010). Someone will always look for the better option if a negative experience has taken place. The more you are invested in a friendship with someone the stronger the effect will have on the individual when expectations are violated. There is also an interesting perspective of expectation violation when you throw gender into the picture. A friend that shares the same sex as you usually has a completely different feel to the relationship than a friendship with members of the opposite sex. Women are generally less tolerant with members of the opposite sex when violations have taken place. Relationships over time, whether it be with the same sex or not, tend to fail when the other will fall away from the behaviors and norms that the other is used to. This can be shown with hostile attitudes, sharp comments, distancing away from the other, etc. Both parties are also capable of violating each other's expectations at the same time. It is not just one person in the relationship that perceives behavior as unusual. One can respond to a violation with another social violation, leaving the friendship in confusion of direction it is going. 
 Participants in friendships and romantic relationships were asked to think about the last time their friend or partner did or said something unexpected. It was emphasized that the unexpected event could be either positive or negative. Participants reported events that had occurred, on average, five days earlier, suggesting that unexpected behaviors happen often in relationships. Some of the behaviors reported were relatively mundane, and others were quite serious. The outcome of the list was a list of nine general categories of expectation violations that commonly occur in relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Afifi|first=Walid|title=Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=Sage Publication|pages=93|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JCDc0f4AGb0C&amp;pg=PA92|isbn=9781412977371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Support or confirmation'' is an act that provides social support in a particular time of need, such as sitting with a friend who is sick.
# ''[[Criticism]] or accusation'' is critical of the receiver and accuse the individual of an offense.  These are violations because they are accusations not expected.  An example is a ball player telling a teammate he should have caught the ball rather than supportively giving him or her a slap on the back and offering words of encouragement.  
# ''Relationship intensification or escalation'' intensifies the commitment of the communicator.  For instance, saying "I love you" signifies a deepening of a romantic relationship.
# ''Relationship de-escalation'' signifies a decrease in commitment of the communicator.  An example might be spending more time apart.
# ''[[Relational transgressions]]'' are violations of the perceived rules of the relationship.  Examples include having an affair, deception, or being disloyal.
# ''Acts of devotion'' are unexpected overtures that imply specialness in the relationship.  Buying flowers for no particular occasion falls into this category.
# ''Acts of disregard'' show that the partner is unimportant.  This could be as simple as excluding a partner or a friend from a collective activity.
# ''Gestures of inclusion'' are actions that show an unexpected interest in having the other included in special activities or life.  Examples include invitations to spend a special holiday with someone, disclosure of personal information, or inviting the partner to meet one's family.
# ''Uncharacteristic relational behavior'' is unexpected action that is not consistent with the partner's perception of the relationship.  A common example is one member of an opposite-sex friendship demanding a romantic relationship of the other.

In later review of the studies, the ''support or confirmation'' category was inserted into ''acts of devotion'' and included another category, ''uncharacteristic social behavior''.  These are acts that aren't relational but are unexpected, such as a quiet person raising his or her voice.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2001"&gt;Guerrero, L. K., Andersen, P. A., &amp; Afifi, W. A. (2001). Close Encounters: Communicating Relationships. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the response to expectancy violations, the sensitivity of expectancy violations varies from genders. Research found that women are less tolerant than men when their expectation are violated by negative behaviors, regardless of the types of violations such as dishonesty and immorality.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elizabeth L.|date=2010-05-07|title=Expectancy Violations in Relationships with Friends and Media Figures|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=27|issue=2|pages=97–111|doi=10.1080/08824091003737836|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Romantic relationships ====
[[File:Romantic sunset Couple romance - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Application in interpersonal relationships-romantic relationships]]
Expectancy violations happen frequently in [[Romance (love)|romantic relationships]]. In relationships there is an unspoken expectation when interacting and that is the significant other will give their full undivided attention when in the presence of their significant other. As the new generation evolves we can see the face to face contact has changed. Unfortunately, with the access use of phones and social media the attention of individuals has shifted to their devices and continues to become worse. With the access to many mobile devices there has been an increase of lack of communication face to face. This has made it difficult for some relationships to grow and or has created conflict because the expectation of attention has been shifted. "Individuals expect conversational partners to be moderately involved in an interaction (Burgoon, Newton, Walther, &amp; Baesler, 1989). Within existing relationships, partners rely on one another to show interest and immediacy in interactions (White, 2008). However, the presence of cell phones and the expectation to be constantly available (Ling, 2012) impacts partners' abilities to give full attention to one another" (Miller-Ott, A., &amp; Kelly, L. 2015).

When romantic partners spend time together, both prefer gaining attention, intimacy, and feeling a close connection with each other. However, the usage of cell phones acts as a distractive behavior that drives romantic partner's attention to absent elements. Although romantic partners are more likely to be viewed as high reward communicators, their cell phone usage behaviors will be evaluated as negative in certain conditions and contexts.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Lynne|last2=Miller-Ott|first2=Aimee E.|last3=Duran|first3=Robert L.|date=2017-10-20|title=Sports Scores and Intimate Moments: An Expectancy Violations Theory Approach to Partner Cell Phone Behaviors in Adult Romantic Relationships|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=81|issue=5|pages=619–640|doi=10.1080/10570314.2017.1299206|issn=1057-0314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of where the romantic relationship takes place, people are likely to have negative valence about cell phone usage if their demand of attention and intimacy are violated.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The negative behaviors include texting, viewing news and playing games. In addition, large quantity of annoying cell phone usage during the date has great impact on romantic partner's negative valence towards the violated behaviors.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, Miller-Ott and Kelly found that small amount of cell phone usage during date is acceptable, such as responding to a text message and quickly bringing attentiveness back to the date partner.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller-Ott|first=Aimee|last2=Kelly|first2=Lynne|date=2015-08-08|title=The Presence of Cell Phones in Romantic Partner Face-to-Face Interactions: An Expectancy Violation Theory Approach|journal=Southern Communication Journal|volume=80|issue=4|pages=253–270|doi=10.1080/1041794x.2015.1055371|issn=1041-794X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same behavior in different occasions and contexts is viewed differently in terms of the degree of valence. Research found that same behavior is viewed as more negative in a restaurant than at home.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Since people are more likely to have higher expectations for undivided attention during formal contexts, using cell phone in formal dates will more negatively violate partner's expectations. Divided attention is acceptable in casual contexts – therefore, the degree of expectancy violations is low under a hanging out context.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===== Cell phone usage =====
Cell phone usage behaviors that do not contradict intimate moment are viewed as positive violations, including sharing interesting messages and playing online games together. People have less negative valence on cell phone usage if they gain more reward from the behaviors.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Research also found the most common response to the violated cell phone usage is to do nothing.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, people have different reactions to the violations under different stages of romantic relationships. In the early stage of [[dating]], people are more likely to respond by indirect messages and silence. While there are direct verbal responses when expectations are violated in established relationships.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===== Sexual resistance =====
Sexual resistance is viewed as a typical expectancy violation in romantic relationships. In 2003, Bevan used EVT to evaluate the impact of sexual resistance on close relationships. The research focused on two considerations: relational contexts and directness of the messages.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Jennifer L.|date=March 1, 2013|title=Expectancy violation theory and sexual resistance in close, cross-sex relationships|url=|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=70 |issue=1|pages=68–82|doi=10.1080/0363775032000104603|issn=0363-7751|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research concluded that people who are resisted in a romantic relationship perceived the violation of sexual resistance as more negative and unexpected than those resisted in a regular cross-sex friendship. The reason might because romantic partners believe that they have clearer and deeper understanding of each other's expectations and degree of acceptance and tolerance. When it comes to message directness of sexual resistance, although the study did not find any significant difference of levels of violation valence and expectedness between direct and indirect messages, direct sexual resistance messages in close relationships proved to be more relationally important than indirect messages. Therefore, direct sexual resistance messages will be a harmful factor that affects the continuity of a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

=== Computer-mediated communication and social media ===
As has previously been addressed, EVT has evolved tremendously over the years, expanding beyond its original induction when it focused on FtF communication and proxemics. The advancement of [[information and communications technology]] has provided tools for expressing oneself and conveying messages beyond just typing in text.  As already discussed, arousal can divert one's attention or interest from a message
to the source of the arousal.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Virtual realities
created online through [[computer-mediated communication]], especially those which evoke
strong visual presence through media, can increase arousal levels, such as those
with high violent or sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = At the Heart of It All: The Concept of Presence|url = |journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date = 1997-09-01|pages = 0|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00072.x|first = Matthew|last = Lombard|first2 = Theresa|last2 = Ditton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just
as people may use television viewing to increase or decrease arousal levels, people
may use media in online communication to increase or decrease arousal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Responding to the Screen: Reception and reaction processes|last = Zillmann|first = D.|publisher = Erlbaum|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Hillsdale, NJ|pages = 103–134|work = Television and physiological arousal|editor-last = Bryant|editor-first = J.|editor-last2 = Zillmann|editor-first2 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People may interact with others online by assuming
the identities of [[Avatars United|avatars]] which may take on completely different, alternate personalities.
The differences in perceived intimateness, co-presence, and emotionally-based trust can very significantly between avatar communication and other communication modalities such as text chat, audio, and audio-visual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Avatar-Mediated Networking: Increasing Social Presence and Interpersonal Trust in Net-Based Collaborations|url = |journal = Human Communication Research|date = 2008-04-01|issn = 1468-2958|pages = 287–318|volume = 34|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.2008.00322.x|first = Gary|last = Bente|first2 = Sabine|last2 = Rüggenberg|first3 = Nicole C.|last3 = Krämer|first4 = Felix|last4 = Eschenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The media options available to users when communicating
with others online present a host of potential expectancy violations unique to CMC.

The introduction of social media networks such as [[Facebook Home|Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as dating social networks such as [[Match.com]] and [[eHarmony]], has greatly contributed to the increased use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) which now offers a context for studying communication devoid of nonverbal information. Though these media are relatively new, they have been in existence long enough for users to have developed norms and expectations about appropriate behaviors in the online world.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/98060925|title = When You Stalk Me, Please Don't Tell Me About It: Facebook and Expectancy Violation Theory|last = Fife|first = Eric M.|date = Spring 2009|journal = The Kentucky Journal of Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015|last2 = Nelson|first2 = C. Leigh|issue = 1|volume = 28|pages = 41–54|issn = 1533-3140|first3 = Kristine|last3 = Bayles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there has been a lag by researchers to study and understand these new established norms, which makes CMC rich with heuristic possibilities from a communications theory perspective.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Ramirez and Wang studied the occurrence and timing of modality switching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.020 | volume=29 | issue=4 | title=When online meets offline: A field investigation of modality switching | journal=Computers in Human Behavior | pages=1565–1571| year=2013 | last1=McEwan | first1=Bree | last2=Zanolla | first2=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; or shifts from online communication to FtF interaction, from the perspective of EVT.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When Online Meets Offline: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective on Modality Switching|url =|journal = Journal of Communication|date = 2008-03-01|issn = 1460-2466|pages = 20–39|volume = 58|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00372.x|first = Artemio|last = Ramirez|first2 = Zuoming|last2 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research documented inconsistent findings which revealed in some instances relationships were enhanced and in others they were dampened, indicating the expectations, evaluations, and outcomes associated with initial modality switches varied amongst individuals.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Additionally, studies have found that when individuals who meet online meet face-to-face for the first time, the length of time spent communicating online can determine whether individuals will rate physical characteristics of each other positively or negatively.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Unlike FtF communication, CMC allows people to pretend to be connected with a person who violates their expectancy by ignoring violations or filtering news feed. Meanwhile, people can also cut the connection completely with someone who is not important by deleting friendship status when a serious violation occurs. A confrontation is much more likely for close friends than for acquaintances, and compensation is much more likely for acquaintances, a finding which contrasts typical EVT predictions.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Norm evolution and violation on Facebook|url = |journal = New Media &amp; Society|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 1461-4448|pages = 299–315|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1461444811412712|first = Caitlin|last = McLaughlin|first2 = Jessica|last2 = Vitak}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, EVT on the Internet environment is strongly related to online privacy issues.

==== Facebook ====
[[File:Facebook logo.png|thumb|Application in computer-mediated communication and social media-Facebook]]
In social media such as Facebook, people are connected online with friends and sometimes strangers. Norm violations on Facebook may include too many status updates, overly emotional status updates or Wall posts, heated interactions, name calling through Facebook's public features, and tags on posts or pictures that might reflect negatively on an individual.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Research has also shown that the act of unfriending on Facebook is perceived as a highly negative expectancy violation, with the duration of the Facebook friendship and personal ties to the unfriending party dictating how negatively the act is perceived. Moreover, the importance of the violation was also found to dictate whether the unfriending person informed the other individual of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Being unfriended on Facebook: An application of Expectancy Violation Theory|url = |journal = Computers in Human Behavior|date = 2014-04-01|pages = 171–178|volume = 33|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.029|first = Jennifer L.|last = Bevan|first2 = Pei-Chern|last2 = Ang|first3 = James B.|last3 = Fearns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Fife, Nelson, and Bayles of focus groups from a Southeastern liberal arts university, five themes were ascertained regarding Facebook use and expectancy violations:&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* ''""Don't stalk' – and when you do, don't talk about it"''
** Though an understanding exists among Facebook participants that users will use the site to keep track of the behavior of others in a number of ways, excessive monitoring is likely to be perceived as an expectancy violation.
* "''Don't embarrass me with bad pictures''"
** Users may have the ability to control which pictures they post on their own Facebook page, but they do not have the ability to control what others post.  Posting and "tagging" unflattering pictures of others may create expectancy violations.
* "''Don't mess up my profile''"
** Several participants expressed annoyance of others who alter their profiles knowing that their alterations could be perceived negatively, though they did not mention changing their passwords or protecting themselves in other ways.
* "''Choose an appropriate forum for messages''"
** Messages can be sent between Facebook participants through 'Facebook messages', which are not public, or 'wall postings', which can be viewed by anyone specified in the user's privacy controls.  Posting messages which may be perceived as private, embarrassing, or inappropriate to a wall posting can create expectancy violations.
* "''Don't compete over number of friends''"
** Facebook users maintain a running total of 'friends' on their profile which is viewable to others.  Engaging in comparisons with others over this statistic can create expectancy violations. 
In 2010, Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield examined college undergraduates' motivations to have friends-only profiles on Facebook. Having a friends-only profile is a practical method to enhance privacy management on Facebook. The two authors made distinctions between intended audience, to whom one hopes to disclose the Facebook profile, and expected audience, a group of people by whom one thinks the Facebook profile has been viewed.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stutzman|first=Fred|last2=Kramer-Duffield|first2=Jacob|date=2010|title=Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-enhancing Behavior in Facebook|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1553–1562|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753559|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicated that "expectancy violations were identified as instances where an expected audience was not jointly identified as an intended audience".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Facebook networks were categorized into different levels: strong ties of family and intimate friends, weak ties comprising "casual friends and campus acquaintances", and outsiders such as "faculty or administrators". According to the study, expectancy violations by weak ties showed greater relevance to the establishment of a friends-only profile among college undergraduates, compared to other Facebook network ties.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==== Electronic mail ====
[[Email]] has become one of the most widely used methods of communication within [[Organizational communication|organizations]] and workplaces.  When discussing expectancy violations
with electronic e-mail, just as with other modes of communication, a distinction
must be made between inadvertent violations of norms and purposeful violations,
referred to as '[[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]'.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Sullivan|first=Patrick B.|last2=Flanagin|first2=Andrew J.|date=2003|title=Reconceptualizing 'flaming' and other problematic messages|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|edition=1|volume=5|pages=69–94|doi=10.1177/1461444803005001908|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date = November 13, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Flaming
is defined as hostile and aggressive interactions via text-based CMC.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

One form of expectancy violation in email is the length of time between the sending of the initial email and the receiver's reply. Communicator reward valence plays a large part in how expectancy violations are handled in email communications. In computer-mediated communication, people have expectations to others’ online behaviors based on individual identity. In online contexts, violations are not simply assessed as positive or negative. Some violations are ambiguous such as e-mail response latency. In 2017, Nicholls and Rice stated that “when deviation is ambiguous, the communicator’s reward value will mediate the perceptions of the deviation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Spencer Byron|last2=Rice|first2=Ronald E.|date=2017-08-01|title=A Dual-Identity Model of Responses to Deviance in Online Groups: Integrating Social Identity Theory and Expectancy Violations Theory|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=243–268|doi=10.1111/comt.12113|issn=1468-2885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chronemics|Chronemic]] studies on email have shown that in organizations, responder status played a large part in how individuals reacted to various lapses in response to the previously sent email.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal
|title = When timeliness matters: The effect of status on reactions to perceived time delay within distributed collaboration|date = 2006|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.6.1385|pmid = 17100492|volume = 91|issue = 6|pages = 1385–1395|last1 = Sheldon|first1 = Oliver J.|last2 = Thomas-Hunt|first2 = Melissa C.|last3 = Proell|first3 = Chad A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long pauses between responses for high-status responders produced positive expectancy violation valence and long pauses from low-status responders produced a negative expectancy violation valence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Online Pauses and Silence: Chronemic Expectancy Violations in Written Computer-Mediated Communication|last = Kalman|first = Y.M.|date = 2010|journal = Communication Research|doi = 10.1177/0093650210378229 |pmid = |last2 = Rafaeli|first2 = Sheizaf |volume=38 |pages=54–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of [[Interview|job interviews]], long pauses between email for high-status candidates reflected negatively on their reviews. Expectations for email recipients to respond within a normative time limit illustrate the medium's capacity for expectancy violations to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Academic environment ===

==== Teacher anger ====
[[File:Urban Affairs classroom.jpg|thumb|Application in academic environment]]
McPherson, Kearney, and Plax examined teacher anger in college classrooms through the lens of norm violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of norm violations|url=http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/social/examples_of_norm_violations.htm|publisher=Radford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Dark Side of Instruction: Teacher Anger as Classroom Norm Violations|url = |journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 0090-9882|pages = 76–90|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00909880305376|first = Mary B.|last = McPherson|first2 = Patricia|last2 = Kearney|first3 = Timothy G.|last3 = Plax}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturally, teachers will become frustrated and angry with students in classrooms from time to time.  How teachers express themselves and convey those
emotions will determine how students respond and interpret those emotional demonstrations.
The students judged the appropriateness of teachers' anger in classrooms in the modal expressions of distributive aggression, passive aggression, integrative assertion, and nonassertive denial.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Students rated the aggressive expressions as
highly intense, destructive, and inappropriate (or non-normative), including such behaviors as [[sarcasm]] or putdowns (most
frequently cited), [[verbal abuse]], rude and condescending behaviors toward students, and acts intended to demoralize students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advice for New Faculty Members|last = Boice|first = R.|publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Needham Heights, MA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Classroom incivilities|last = Boice|first = R.|date = 1996|journal = Research in Higher Education|doi = 10.1007/bf01730110|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|issue = 4|pages = 453–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Faculty development via field programs for middle-aged,  disillusioned faculty|last = Boice|first = R.|date = 1986|journal = Research in Higher Education|doi = 10.1007/bf00991486|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 115–135|publication-date = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students described assertive displays as appropriate and less intense.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Although anger is often considered to be a negative emotion, teacher anger is not necessarily a violation of classroom norms.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Based on the study, intense and aggressive displays of teacher anger are considered socially inappropriate by students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  These perceived norm violations result in negative evaluations of the teacher and the course.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Because only integrative-assertive expressions of teacher anger were positively related to students' perceptions of appropriateness, the study concluded that teachers should avoid intense, aggressive anger displays and should rather assertively and directly discuss the problem with students.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

==== Teacher dress ====
[[Clothing]] is considered a form of nonverbal communication. [[Dress]] communicates status, [[hierarchy]], [[credibility]], and attractiveness. Specific social codes dictate what forms of dress are appropriate in various cross-cultural contexts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Clothing and Teacher Credibility: An Application of Expectancy Violations Theory|last = Dunbar|first = Norah|date = 2011|journal = ISRN Education|accessdate = |doi = 10.5402/2012/140517|pmid = |volume = 2012|last2 = Segrin|first2 = Chris |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Influence of Dress on Perceptions of Intelligence and Expectations of Scholastic Achievement|last = Behling|first = D.U.|date = 1991|journal = Clothing and Textiles Research Journal|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0887302x9100900401|pmid = |last2 = Williams|first2 = E.A.|volume = 9|issue = 4|pages = 1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals wear clothing that is deemed inappropriate for a given situation, or when an individual's clothing does not seem to match their perceived status or attractiveness, this can constitute an expectancy violation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Studies on clothing and teacher perceptions have shown that when teachers wear [[Formality|formal]] attire, students rate their credibility higher. However, for high-reward teachers, clothing formality did not raise perceptions of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Appropriateness and Promotability of Clothing Behavior of Women Teachers|last = Fitch|first = E.M.|publisher = Yeshiva University|year = 1984|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Effects of Source Attire on Judgments of Credibility|last = Bassett|first = R.E.|date = 1984|journal = Central States Speech Journal|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/10510977909368022|pmid = |volume = 30|issue = 3|pages = 282–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students seem to retain information best when teachers are dressed moderately, and teacher value appears to derive from what grade students predict they will get from a teacher more so than clothing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Instructor credibility in college classroom ====
Generally, students have expectations to their instructors in college classroom. According to Sidelinger and Bolen, students might be dissatisfied about instructors who talk a lot during class.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidelinger|first=Robert J.|last2=Bolen|first2=Derek M.|date=2016-01-02|title=Instructor Credibility as a Mediator of Instructors' Compulsive Communication and Student Communication Satisfaction in the College Classroom|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–31|doi=10.1080/08824096.2015.1117438|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they did the research about the compulsive communication and communication satisfaction, they concluded that if an instructor is evaluated as credible by the students, his credibility decreases students’ dissatisfaction despite of his talkativeness. Particularly, instructor’s goodwill such as [[politeness]] and care for students is the most effective characteristic to alleviate students’ negative feelings towards a talkative instructor.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

==== Course ratings ====
Most American colleges and universities employ course rating surveys as a method to gauge teacher effectiveness and the degree to which students are satisfied with the pedagogy of their professors. Expectancy violation and violation valence play a part in course ratings because a wide range of expectancies exist for students while taking a course.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Expectations, Observations, and Violations: Comparing Their Effects on Course Ratings|last = Gigliotti|first = R.J.|date = 1987|journal = Research in Higher Education|accessdate = |doi = 10.1007/bf00992374|pmid = |volume = 26|issue = 4 |pages=401–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common expectancies for students include stimulation and interest, instructor behavior, relevance of the course, and the student's expected and actual success in the course. A higher education study on EVT and course ratings analyzed 228 students in seven introductory sociology classes at a university of 25,000 students.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Since the courses were required for most students, were open to all students, used the same textbook, and met for the same length of time during the semester, expectancy violations in the classroom could be reported more accurately.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some factors used to report the data included instructor personality, interestingness and informativeness of textbook materials, difficulty of lectures, lecturer speaking ability, and the ability to answer questions. At the end of the study, the only factor that affected course ratings was relevance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Expectancies had virtually no effect otherwise on course evaluations. This reason could be attributed to the fact that students who found a course highly relevant were already interested in the subject area and were more motivated to do well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Nontraditional college students ====
EVT has been used to study the experiences of [[Non-traditional student|non-traditional]] [[college]] and [[university]] students who begin an [[undergraduate education]] over the age of 25.  The study focused on the students' expectations of their professors and how they should behave in the classroom. Since nontraditional students often feel that they are different from their academic peers, and since the traditional university setting focuses on the 18-23-year-old [[Demographics|demographic]], studying nontraditional student classroom experiences can help higher education institutions instruct teachers on how to behave in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Expectancy Violations as Predictors of Motivation and Learning: A Comparison of Traditional and Nontraditional Students|last = Houser|first = Marian|date = 2006|journal = Communication Quarterly|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/01463370600878248|pmid = |volume = 54|issue = 3|pages = 331–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Adult Learner: A Neglected Species, 2nd Edition|last = Knowles|first = M.S.|publisher = Gulf Publishing|year = 1978|isbn = |location = Houston, TX|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional and non-traditional students have been shown to expect teachers to make use of examples, provide feedback, and adequately prepare them for exams.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Both traditional and non-traditional students have been found to have their expectations for instructor clarity negatively violated.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Surprisingly, non-traditional students differed from traditional students by responding negatively to affinity-seeking behaviors and believed that instructors should be less concerned with making class more fun and enjoyable.

==== Student disclosures in college classroom ====
In 2013, Frisby and Sidelinger conducted a research about student disclosures in college classroom, which discussed about what kinds of student disclosures would violate peers’ expectations and their perceptions about the disclosers.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frisby|first=Brandi N.|last2=Sidelinger|first2=Robert J.|date=2013-07-01|title=Violating Student Expectations: Student Disclosures and Student Reactions in the College Classroom|journal=Communication Studies|volume=64|issue=3|pages=241–258|doi=10.1080/10510974.2012.755636|issn=1051-0974}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, those who make inappropriate disclosures violate others’ expectations most in a classroom environment. Inappropriate disclosures are described as high frequent, negative, offensive and irrelevant topics. Disclosers of inappropriate information are more likely to be described as incompetent students, and they are less likeable than students who disclose appropriate information that are related to course materials.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==== College admissions ====
A 2008 study of the top 500 US colleges by Kaplan found that 10% of admissions offices checked applicants' social networking site (SNS) profiles, and 38% of those saw information that reduced the applicants' prospects for admission.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;  In 2011, a college student was cited for underage drinking after campus police found pictures on Facebook of
the student holding a beer.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
[[File:Profaneco.png|thumb|Application in profanity use]]

=== Profanity use ===
Swearing and cursing are some of the most readily observable instances of verbal expectancy violations. Examples of swearing expectancy violations include U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney telling Patrick Leahy, Senator of Vermont, to "go fuck yourself",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==== In workplaces ====
Swearing is common among many workplaces. Swearing has been identified functionally as one of several ways to express emotion in response to workplace stress, to convey verbal aggression, or to engage in deviant workplace behavior (Johnson, 2012). In formal work settings, people have much stronger feelings that their expectations are violated by swearing than in casual occasions. Expletives are more prevalent in unstructured conversations than in more structured, task-oriented ones (Johnson, 2012). The use of [[profanity]] has been shown to influence the perceptions of speakers. It may also have emotional impact on the user and the audience.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reactions to Obscene Language|last = Hamilton|first = M.A.|date = 1989|journal = Communication Research Reports|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/08824098909359835|pmid = |volume = 6|pages = 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What the ____ Is Your Problem?: Attribution Theory and Perceived Reasons for Profanity Usage During Conflict|last = Young|first = S.L.|date = 2004|journal = Communication Research Reports|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/08824090409359998|pmid = |volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 338–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that profanity users appear less trustworthy, less sociable, and less educated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Why We Curse|last = Jay|first = T.|publisher = John Benjamins|year = 1999|isbn = 9781556197581|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more swearing messages one expresses that violate respondent's expectations in workplaces, the more negative evaluations the respondent will generate about the speaker's incompetency.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Danette Ifert|last2=Lewis|first2=Nicole|date=2010-10-13|title=Perceptions of Swearing in the Work Setting: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective|journal=Communication Reports|volume=23|issue=2|pages=106–118|doi=10.1080/08934215.2010.511401|issn=0893-4215}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traits are likely to appear as fixed among profanity users.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Moreover, the content of the swearing messages also poses great impact on the extent of expectancy violations in formal work settings. The verbal messages include words related to sex, [[excretion]] and profaneness. Research found that respondents experience highest level of surprise about the swearing with sexual expressions. Thus their expectations are more likely to be violated by sexual swearing than excretory and profane words. A more productive approach than focusing on whether a specific word is offensive may be to make sure that those engaging in workplace swearing are aware of how they and their messages might be perceived in multiple ways (Johnson, 2012).&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Evaluation of media figures ===
Expectancy violations are tightly related to the changes of people's evaluation on their relationships with media figures. In 2010, Cohen made comparisons between relationships with friends and media figures in order to find similarities and differences of people's reactions when their expectations are violated in these two relationships. Violations were generally divided in three categories: social violations such as making offensive comments, trust violations such as making up stories about their life experience, and moral violations such as cheating in a marital relationship or drunk driving.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Research indicated that in both friendships and relationships with media figures, social and trust violations are more offensive than moral violations. Specifically, people are more intolerable about moral violations from media figures than from their friends. According to the study, the reason for the intolerance is because relationships with media figures are relatively weak that people invest less on the relationships with media figures than on friendships.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;
The type of media figures is also an important factor to determine the changes of closeness with media figures. People have different expectations to various types of media figures. Research discussed that moral violations negatively influence relationships with athletes, damaging their positive and energetic appearance expected by the public. Social violations reduce closeness with TV hosts, whom people expect as amiable public figures.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Health and self-improvement ===
Expectancy violation theory has even been applied to encouraging healthy habits and changing bad ones. In a study by Karolien van den Akker,  Myrr van den Broek, Remco C. Havermans, and Anita Jansen, expectancy violation theory was tested to see if it was successful in changing ingrained cravings for chocolate. Although researchers did not find that expectancy violation mediated responses to chocolate cravings, they believe more research is needed to determine whether this theory is profitable for this kind of application to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Akker|first=Karolien|last2=Broek|first2=Myrr van den|last3=Havermans|first3=Remco C.|last4=Jansen|first4=Anita|title=Violation of eating expectancies does not reduce conditioned desires for chocolate|journal=Appetite|volume=100|pages=10–17|doi=10.1016/j.appet.2016.02.004|pmid=26853599|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metatheoretical assumptions ==

=== Ontological assumptions ===

EVT assumes that humans have a certain degree of free will.  This theory assumes that humans can assess and interpret the relationship and liking between themselves and their conversational partner, and then make a decision whether or not to violate the expectations of the other person. The theory holds that this decision depends on what outcome they would like to achieve.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K.|author2=White, C. H.|title=Adaptation and communicative design|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2001|volume=27|issue=1|pages=9–37|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00774.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assumption is based on the ''interaction position''. The interaction position is based on a person's initial stance toward an interaction as determined by a blend of personal Requirements, Expectations, and Desires (RED). These ''RED'' factors meld into our interaction position of what's needed, anticipated, and preferred.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2001"/&gt;

=== Epistemological assumptions ===

EVT assumes that there are norms for all communication activities and if these norms are violated, there will be specific, predictable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"/&gt; EVT does not fully account for the overwhelming prevalence of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] that has been found in interpersonal interactions. Secondly, it is silent on whether communicator valence supersedes behavior valence or vice versa when the two are incongruent, such as when a disliked partner engages in a positive violation.&lt;ref name="Guerrero,1996"/&gt;

=== Axiological assumptions ===

This theory seeks to be value-neutral as supporting studies have been conducted empirically and sought to objectively describe how humans react when their expectations are violated.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,1978"/&gt;

== Critique ==

=== Predictability and testability ===
Expectancy violations theory has undergone scrutiny for its attempt to provide a covering law for certain aspects of interpersonal communication. Some critics of EVT believe most interactions between individuals are extremely complex and there are many contingencies to consider within the theory. This makes the prediction of behavioral outcomes of a particular situation virtually impossible to consistently predict.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts|last=Miller|first=K.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2005|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique of the theory is the assumption that expectancy violations are mostly highly consequential acts, negative in nature, and cause uncertainty to increase between communicators.  In actuality, research shows expectancy violations vary in frequency, seriousness, and valence.  While it is true that many expectancy violations carry a negative [[Valence (psychology)|valence]], numerous are positive and actually reduce uncertainty because they provide additional information within the parameters of the particular relationship, context, and communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Characteristics and Consequences of Expectation Violations in Close Relationships|last = Afifi|first = Walid|date = 1998|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0265407598153004|pmid = |first2 = Sandra|last2 = Metts|volume = 15|issue = 3 |pages=365–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''A First Look at Communication'' ====
Emory Griffin, the author of ''A First Look at Communication Theory'', analyzed unpredictability in expectancy violations theory.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt; His test consisted in analyzing his interaction with four students who made various requests from him. The students were given the pseudonyms Andre, Belinda, Charlie and Dawn. They start with the letters A, B, C and D to represent the increasing distance between them and Griffin when making their requests.

[[File:Expectancy Violations in a Classroom Setting.jpg|thumb|
Adapted from Griffin's diagram in the book A first look at communication theory.
]]

Andre needed the author's endorsement for a graduate scholarship, and spoke to him from an intimate eyeball-to-eyeball distance. According to Burgoon's early model, Andre made a mistake when he crossed Griffin's ''threat threshold''; the physical and psychological discomfort the lecturer might feel could have hurt his cause. However, later that day Griffin wrote the letter of recommendation.

Belinda needed help with a term paper for a class with another professor, and asked for it from a 2-foot distance. Just as Burgoon predicted, the narrow gap between Belinda and Griffin determined him to focus his attention on their rocky relationship, and her request was declined.

Charlie invited his lecturer to play water polo with other students, and he made the invitation from the right distance of 7 feet, just outside the range of interaction Griffin anticipated. However, his invitation was declined.

Dawn launched an invitation to Griffin to eat lunch together the next day, and she did this from across the room. According to the nonverbal expectancy violations model, launching an invitation from across the room would guarantee a poor response, but this time, the invitation was successful.

Griffin's attempt to apply Burgoon's original model to conversational distance between him and his students didn't meet with much success. The theoretical scoreboard read:
: Nonverbal expectancy violations model: '''1'''
: Unpredicted random behavior: '''3'''

However, when Grifffin applied the revised EVT standards on his responses to "the proxemic violations of Andre, Belinda, Charlie, and Dawn," the scorecard "shows four hits and no misses."&lt;ref&gt;A First Look at Communication Theory, 9th edition, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

Because EVT is [[Social psychology|sociopsychological]] in nature and focuses on social codes in both [[Intrapersonal communication|intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal communication]], it is closely related to communication theories such as [[cognitive dissonance]] and [[uncertainty reduction theory]]. Recently, this theory has undergone some reconstitution by Burgoon and her colleagues and has resulted in a newly proposed theory known as [[Interpersonal adaptation theory|interaction adaptation theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/52575_Gamble_%28IC%29_Chapter_1.pdf|title=Interpersonal Communication: Building Connections Together|last1=Gamble|first1=Teri Susan Kwal|last2=Gamble|first2=Michael W.|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452220130|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a more comprehensive explanation of adaptation in interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;

As mentioned above, EVT has strong roots in [[uncertainty reduction theory]].  The relationship between violation behavior and the level of uncertainty is under study.  Research indicates that violations differ in their impact on uncertainty. To be more specific, incongruent negative violations heightened uncertainty, whereas congruent violations (both positive and negative) caused declines in uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2000.tb00756.x|title=The impact of violations on uncertainty and the consequences for attractiveness|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=203–233|year=2000|last1=Afifi|first1=WA|last2=Burgoon|first2=JK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also borrows from social exchange theory in that people seek reward out of interaction with others.

Two other theories share similar outlooks to EVT – Discrepancy-Arousal Theory and Patterson's [[Social facilitation|social facilitation model]] (SFM).  Like EVT, DAT explains that a receiver becomes aroused when a communicative behavior does not match the receiver's expectations.  In DAT, these differences are called discrepancies instead of expectancy violations. [[Cognitive dissonance]] and EVT both try to explain why and how people react to unexpected information and adjust themselves during communication process.

The social facilitation model has a similar outlook and labels these differences as unstable changes.  A key difference between the theories lies in the receiver's arousal level.  Both DAT and SFM maintain that the receiver experiences a physiological response whereas EVT focuses on the attention shift of the receiver.  EVT posits that expectancy violations occur frequently and are not always as serious as perceived through the lenses of other theories.

[[Anxiety/uncertainty management|Anxiety/uncertainty management theory]] is the uncertainty and Anxiety people have towards each other, relating to EVT this anxiety and uncertainty can differ between cultures. Causing a violation for example violating someones personal distance or communicating ineffectively can cause uncertainty and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Em Griffin"/&gt;

The popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as means of conducting task-oriented and socially oriented interactions is a part of the [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) theory. Coined by Joseph Walther, the theory explores CMC's ability to fulfill many of the same functions as the more traditional forms of interaction, especially face-to-face (FtF) interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interpersonal Effects in Computer-Mediated Interaction A Relational Perspective|url = http://crx.sagepub.com/content/19/1/52|journal = Communication Research|date = 1992-02-01|issn = 0093-6502|pages = 52–90|volume = 19|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/009365092019001003|first = Joseph B.|last = Walther}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cues Filtered Out, Cues Filtered In: Computer-Mediated Communication and Relationships|last = Walther|first = J.B.|date = 2002|journal = Handbook of Interpersonal Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |edition = 3rd|pages = 529–563|editor-last = Knapp|editor-first = M.L.|editor2-last = Daly|editor2-first = J.A.|last2 = Parks|first2 = M.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SIP can be used in conjunction with EVT to examine interpersonal and hyperpersonal relationships established through CMC.

== Further use and development of the theory ==

The concept of [[social norms marketing]] follows expectancy violation in that it is based upon the notion that messages containing facts that vary from perception of the norm will create a positive expectancy violation.  Advertising, strategic communications, and public relations base social norms campaigns on this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campo | first1 = S. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Brossard | first3 = D. | last4 = Frazer | first4 = M. S. | year = 2004 | title = Social Norms and Expectancy Violation Theories: Assessing the Effectiveness of Health Communication Campaigns | url = | journal = Communication Monographs | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 448–470 | doi=10.1080/0363452042000307498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction adaptation theory further explores expectancy violations.  Developed by [[Judee K. Burgoon|Burgoon]] to take a more comprehensive look at social interaction, IAT posits that people enter into interactions with requirements, expectations, and desires.  These factors influence both the initial behavior as well as the response behavior.  When faced with behavior that meets an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, the response behavior will be positive.  When faced with behavior that does not meet an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, he or she can respond either positively or negatively depending on the degree of violation and positive or negative valence of the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, K. &amp; Ray, G. (2005). [http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/1/4/0/6/pages14068/p14068-1.php Adaptation to Expressed Liking and Disliking in Initial Interactions: Nonverbal Involvement and Pleasantness Response Patterns]. Conference Papers -- International Communication Association Annual Meeting, 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgoon | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Le Poire | first2 = B. A. | last3 = Rosenthal | first3 = R. | year = 1995 | title = Effects of Preinteraction Expectancies and Target Communication on Perceiver Reciprocity and Compensation in Dyadic Interaction | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 287–321 | doi=10.1006/jesp.1995.1014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectancies exert significant influence on people's interaction patterns, on their impressions of one another, and on the outcomes of their interactions. People who can assume that they are well regarded by their audience are safer engaging in violations and more likely to profit from doing so than are those who are poorly regarded.&lt;ref name="Burgoon,2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J. K. |author2=D. A. Coker |author3=R. A. Coker|title=Communicative Effects of Gaze Behavior|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2006|volume=12|issue=4|pages=495–524|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1986.tb00089.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the violation act is one that is likely to be ambiguous in its meaning or to carry multiple interpretations that are not uniformly positive or negative, then the reward valence of the communicator can be especially significant in moderating interpretations, evaluations, and subsequent outcomes.

EVT also applies to international experience in the workplace. “A foreign newcomer who has the necessary education, work experience, and international experience will be perceived as having the ability to make valuable contribution to the group’s task. Consequently, education, work experience and international experience will influence a foreign newcomer’s initial task-based group acceptance (Joardar, 2011). It can be argued that a person with significant international experience will be perceived as having had the opportunity to learn how to build valuable relationships in a cross-cultural setting. Hence, international experience will have effects on initial relationship-based group acceptance as well. Meaning, this will make for a more positive expectancy violation, in the workplace especially. 
EVT is also used as a framework to analyze the negative impact of mind reading expectations on romantic relationships. In 2015, Wright and Roloff explained the idea of mind reading expectations (MRE) that romantic partners should clearly know about each other's feelings even though they are not being informed. When relational partners have done something wrong without [[self-consciousness]], people's expectations are violated. Particularly those who hold high value of MRE are more likely to become distressful once their relational partners are unaware of their violations to expectations. The study asserted that such kinds of violations related to MRE result in responses such as combative attitude and silent treatment, which is harmful to long-term romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Courtney N.|last2=Roloff|first2=Michael E.|date=2015-01-02|title=You Should Just Know Why I'm Upset: Expectancy Violation Theory and the Influence of Mind Reading Expectations (MRE) on Responses to Relational Problems|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=32|issue=1|pages=10–19|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.989969|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HatfieldClan.jpg|thumbnail|350px|The Hatfield Clan of West Virginia, in 1897, carried on a long-standing feud with the Kentucky-based [[Randolph McCoy|McCoy Clan]].]]
'''Feuds in the United States''' deals with the phenomena of historic [[Feud|blood feud]]ing in America. These feuds have been numerous and some became quite vicious. Often, a conflict which may have started out as a rivalry between two individuals or families became further escalated into a [[clan]]-wide feud or a [[range war]], involving dozens—or even hundreds—of participants.&lt;ref name=legends&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-feuds.html|title=Legends of America: Feuds and Range Wars|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are listed some of the most notable blood feuds in [[United States]] history, most of which occurred in the [[American Old West|Old West]].

==Hamilton–Burr==
{{Main|Burr–Hamilton duel}}

[[Aaron Burr]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were two noted [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]] as famous for their feud-ending [[duel]] as their politics.&lt;ref name= toptenz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-ten-famous-feuds-and-vendettas.php|title=Top Ten Feuds and Vendettas|work=Toptenz.net|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trouble began in 1791 when the [[Democrat-Republican]] Burr was elected [[United States Senator|senator]] for [[New York (state)|New York]], replacing the [[Federalist Party|Federalist]], and Hamilton-backed, [[Philip Schuyler]]. This began the political feud between the two which culminated in the July 11, 1804 duel.

Hamilton had been actively fighting against Burr’s campaign for [[New York Governor|governor of New York]]; helping to ensure that a rival politician, [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], won. Burr took this personally. After several months marked by heated personal correspondence, published accusations, and verbal sparring between the two, he challenged Hamilton to a duel. As dueling had been outlawed in the state of New York, the two, along with their [[Code Duello|seconds]], traveled to [[Weehawken, New Jersey]] for their final confrontation. Mortally wounded in the abdomen by Burr, Hamilton died the next day.

==Early–Hasley==
{{Main|Early–Hasley feud}}

A family feud that took place immediately following the [[American Civil War]], in [[Bell County, Texas]] from 1865 to 1869; where the two families and their allies found themselves extending the ideological battle of that recent conflict.&lt;ref name=THndBk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jgf01|title=Handbook of Texas Online: Feuds|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Early, a supporter of the federal officials then occupying Texas, was an early member of the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Texas Home Guard]]. He was having repeated run-ins with Drew Hasley, an older local citizen who had been a staunch [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] backer. When Hasley’s son, Samuel, returned from service in the war, he became active in the conflict with Early, escalating the feud. When the younger Hasley brought a local outlaw, Jim McRae, into the fight, Early sought federal troop intervention, which was granted. On July 30, 1869, McRae was ambushed and killed. Dr. Calvin Clark, an Early ally, was gunned down shortly afterward in [[Arkansas]]. The Hasley supporters soon disbanded and the feud faded.

==Hatfield–McCoy==
{{Main|Hatfield–McCoy feud}}

Perhaps the most infamous feud in the history of the U.S., the Hatfield–McCoy conflict is now an icon of American [[folklore]].&lt;ref name=THndBk/&gt; The Hatfields, of [[West Virginia]], were led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield|William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield]]. The McCoys, of [[Kentucky]], were under the leadership of [[Randolph McCoy|Randolph "Ole Ran’l" McCoy]].

The feud began after the killing of Asa Harmon McCoy, an ex-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier, who was gunned down on January 7, 1865, while hiding in a cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=John Ed |title= Days of Darkness: The Feuds of Eastern Kentucky |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Vn2bGYkXSIIC |year=1994 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-1874-3 |pages=227 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCoy died at the hands of a group of Hatfield allies, and Confederate irregulars (named the "Logan Wildcats"), who had tracked him to his hiding place. The conflict was renewed thirteen years later when two McCoy family members killed a witness (who was related to both families) and who had testified against them in a court case involving ownership of a stray pig.

The simmering feud escalated soon afterward, when Roseanna McCoy began a courtship with Johnson "Johnse" Hatfield, Devil Anse’s son. Roseanna left her family to live with the Hatfields in West Virginia. In 1881, when Johnse abandoned the pregnant Roseanna, marrying her cousin instead, the bitterness between the two families grew. In 1882, Ellison Hatfield, brother of Devil Anse Hatfield, was killed in an election-day dispute by three of Roseanna’s brothers, who themselves were killed by a Hatfield-led mob while in the custody of the law.

Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families, becoming headline news around the country.

The feud reached its peak during the so-called 1888 New Years Night Massacre. Several of the Hatfield gang surrounded the McCoy [[Log cabin|cabin]] and opened fire on the sleeping family. The cabin was set on fire in an effort to drive Randolph McCoy into the open. He escaped by making a break, but two of his children were murdered, and his wife was beaten and left for dead.

In 1888, Wall Hatfield and eight others were arrested and ordered to stand trial for the New Years Night murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rice |first=Otis K |title= The Hatfields and McCoys |year=1982 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-1459-4 |pages=150 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven received [[life imprisonment]], while the eighth, Ellison "Cottontop" Mounts, was executed by [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="Rice pg 111"&gt;Rice p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts. Trials, however, continued for several years, with the trial of Johnse Hatfield the last, in 1901.

==Lee–Peacock==
The Lee–Peacock feud took place in the four-corners area of the Texas counties of [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin]], [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson]], [[Collin County, Texas|Collin]], and [[Hunt County, Texas|Hunt]].&lt;ref name=THndBk/&gt; It became a local, four-year extension of the American Civil War  - lasting from 1867 to 1871 - in which an estimated 50 men lost their lives.

When the war broke out, a resident of the area, Bob Lee, immediately joined the Confederate Army, leaving his wife, three children, and his home in the care of his father Daniel. Near the end of the war, word reached Lee that a Union sympathizer, Lewis Peacock, had set up an organization in his home which was actively working for the protection of blacks and Union sympathizers. This was "The Union League", in Pilot Grove, Texas, less than seven miles from Lee’s home. By the time that Lee and other ex-Confederate soldiers of the area returned to their homes in northeast Texas, the region was already roiling in conflict, as most area residents resented the intrusion of the Reconstruction soldiers stationed throughout the state.

One night in late 1866, Peacock and several of his followers allegedly "arrested" Lee, but instead kidnapped him, robbed him, and forced him to sign a $2,000 promissory note to secure his release. The Lee clan subsequently refused to honor the note. Shortly thereafter, in February 1867, an assassination attempt on Lee took place was perpetrated by Peacock ally Jim Maddox. A few days later, as he lay convalescing in the next room, Lee’s doctor was murdered by Hugh Hudson, another Peacock sympathizer, and the feud immediately escalated.

Hudson, the doctor’s killer, was himself quickly killed, as were other combatants. Many were wounded, including Peacock. By the summer of 1868, the conflict had become so heated that Peacock requested help from the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], which promptly posted a $1,000 reward for Bob Lee's capture. The U.S. Cavalry, acting on a tip from an informant, shot Lee down on May 24, 1869; however, the fighting still continued. It wasn’t until Lewis Peacock was himself killed, on June 13, 1871, that the feud ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/tx-leepeacock.html|title=Legends of America: The Lee-Peacock Feud|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sutton–Taylor== &lt;!--This section is linked from [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Lon Oden]], [[Leander H. McNelly]], [[Texas State Police]] and [[Jaxon]] --&gt;
[[File:John Wesley Hardin.gif|thumb|200px|John Wesley Hardin joined the Sutton-Taylor Feud at the behest of his cousin, Emanuel "Mannen" Clements.]]
{{Main|Sutton–Taylor feud}}

This notorious range war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoutlaws.com/ghosts1.htm|title=The Outlaw Cowboys|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; began as a county law enforcement issue between the Taylor family, headed by Pitkin Taylor, brother of Creed Taylor, a renowned Texas Ranger, and local lawman William E. Sutton, a former Confederate soldier, who had moved with his family to [[DeWitt County, Texas]], originally intending to simply raise cattle. The feud, which lasted a decade and cost at least 35 lives, has been called the longest and bloodiest in Texas history. It eventually involved the Texas State Police, the Texas Rangers, and the outlaw [[John Wesley Hardin]].&lt;ref name="The Sutton-Taylor Feud: The Deadliest Blood Feud in Texas "&gt;{{cite book | last =Parsons | first =Chuck | title =The Sutton-Taylor Feud: The Deadliest Blood Feud in Texas | publisher =University of North Texas Press | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-57441-257-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutton had become a deputy sheriff in Clinton, Texas, and on March 25, 1868, he shot and killed a Taylor kinsman, [[Charley Taylor]], whom he was trying to arrest for horse theft. The following Christmas Eve, Sutton killed [[Buck Taylor]] and Dick Chisholm in a saloon in Clinton, after an argument regarding the sale of some horses. On August 23, 1869, the Sutton faction was suspected of the ambush and killing of Jack Hays Taylor.

In July 1870, Sutton was appointed to the [[Texas State Police|State Police Force]], serving under Captain [[Jack Helm]] (sometimes Helms). The police force was tasked with enforcing the "Reconstruction" policies of the federal government, but operated with somewhat of a free-hand, and more often than not returned with wanted suspects dead.&lt;ref name=t-s&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/tx-suttontaylor.html|title=Legends of America|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 1870, the Suttons were allegedly sent to arrest Henry and his brother William Kelly, who were both related by marriage to Pitkin Taylor, on a trivial charge. However, rather than arresting the men, the Suttons shot the Kellys. Due to his handling of the affair, Helm was dismissed from the State Police Force, though cleared of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=t-s/&gt;

===John Wesley Hardin joins the feud===
In early 1872, on-the-run outlaw John Wesley Hardin joined his cousin, Mannen Clements, in neighboring [[Gonzales County, Texas]]. There, Clements and his brothers were active in the [[cattle raiding|cattle rustling]] or herding business working for Taylor family friends.

On May 15, 1873, Sutton family allies Jim Cox and Jake Christman were killed by the Taylor faction during a gunfight at Tomlinson Creek. Hardin later admitted that there were reports that he had led the fight in which these two men were killed, but would neither confirm nor deny his involvement.&lt;ref name="Hardin Autobiography"&gt;{{cite book | first = John W. |last = Hardin | title = The Life of John Wesley Hardin: As Written By Himself | isbn = 978-0-8061-1051-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jLM-AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+wesley+hardin#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | work = Smith &amp; Moore, Seguin, Texas | year = 1896 | accessdate = October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, in a May 17, 1873, gunfight, Hardin killed Dewitt County deputy sheriff, J.B. Morgan—serving under Helm, who was now sheriff of DeWitt County.&lt;ref name="Hardin Autobiography" /&gt; Hardin played a part in the assassination later that same day of Sheriff Helm in [[Ghost town#United States of America|Albuquerque, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jcs03| title=Handbook of Texas Online: Helm Article| publisher=| accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin, Helm and Sam McCracken, Jr. were gathered together talking in front of a blacksmith shop. Helm was unarmed, having left his revolvers at Mrs. McCracken's boarding house, where he was then residing. James Taylor advanced on Helm from behind and attempted to discharge his revolver, but it misfired. As Helm turned, Taylor fired again, this time striking Helm in the chest. Helm rushed Taylor with the intent to grapple with him, but Hardin discharged a double barrel shotgun, shattering his arm. As Helm attempted to flee into the blacksmith shop, Hardin held townspeople at gunpoint while Taylor unloaded the remaining five bullets from his revolver into him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Trial of John Wesley Hardin |url=http://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Texas_Bar_Journal&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=17328|last=Wise |first=Ken |date=March 2012 |journal=Texas Bar Journal |volume=75 |series= |issue=9 |page=202 |location=Austin, TX |publisher=State Bar of Texas |editor1-first=Michelle |editor1-last=Hunter |accessdate=March 4, 2015 | quote=Helm was formerly a captain in the infamous Texas State Police force under the Reconstruction Government.

A shouted truce was arranged and both sides signed a peace treaty in Clinton, Texas. However, within a year, violence once again broke out between the two sides.

The feud reached its apex when Jim and his cousin Bill Taylor gunned down Billy Sutton and a friend, Gabriel Slaughter, as they waited on a steamboat platform, in [[Indianola, Texas]] on March 11, 1874. Tired of the feud, Billy Sutton had been planning to leave the area for good.&lt;ref name=THndBk/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Texas Vendetta"&gt;{{cite book | first = | last = | title = The Texas Vendetta, or, the Sutton-Taylor Feud | isbn = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YgBkoOJ5ntIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sutton-taylor+feud#v=onepage&amp;q=dOUGHBOY&amp;f=false | work = J.J.

Jim Taylor was killed January 1, 1875. On November 17, 1875, Reuben H. Brown, the new leader of the Suttons and ex-marshal of [[Cuero, Texas]], was shot down in the Exchange Saloon by Hardin, his last known action in the feud.&lt;ref name=t-s/&gt;

In October 1876, after another outbreak of violence, Texas Ranger, Captain [[Jesse Lee Hall]], led a force into Cuero, Texas to break up the feud for good. By January 1877, he and his supporting troop had put an end to the conflict.

==Horrell–Higgins==
[[File:Edmund Davis.jpg|thumb|200px|Governor Edmund J. Davis founded the Texas State Police to combat lawlessness.]]
{{Main|Horrell Brothers}}

The Horrell and Higgins families had both settled in the [[Lampasas County, Texas]] area several years before the American Civil War. By all accounts, the two families got along well for over a decade. However, by the early 1870s, the five 'Horrell boys': Mart, Tom, Merritt, Ben and Sam had been involved in numerous lawless activities. In January 1873, Lampasas County [[Sheriff]], Shadrick T. Denson, attempted to arrest two brothers, Wash and Mark Short, who were friends of the Horrell family. Intervention by the Horrell brothers resulted in a gunfight in which Sheriff Denson was shot and killed. A county judge appealed to Texas Governor, [[Edmund J. Davis]], for help. The [[Texas State Police]] dispatched a number of lawmen to the area to maintain order.

On March 14, 1873, state officers Wesley Cherry, Jim Daniels, and Andrew Melville arrested Bill Bowen, a brother-in-law to the Horrell brothers, for carrying a firearm (which Governor Davis had recently outlawed in the area). The officers then entered Jerry Scott's Saloon with Bowen in tow. After a verbal exchange with the Horrell brothers, who had been inside the saloon, a gunfight ensued. Four of the officers were killed, including Capt. Williams. Williams had managed to shoot and badly wound Mart Horrell, and his brother, Tom Horrell, was also among the wounded. Following the gunfight, more state police were sent to the county. Mart Horrell and three friends were arrested and taken to the [[Georgetown, Texas]] jail. However, a large crowd of Horrell family friends broke into the jail and freed them.

The brothers fled to [[Lincoln County, New Mexico]], where later that same year, Ben Horrell was himself killed after he murdered a local law enforcement officer. In early February 1874, the brothers returned to Lampasas, but were no longer welcome. Shortly after their return, local rancher, [[John Higgins (gunman)|John "Pink" Higgins]], accused the Horrell brothers of [[Cattle raiding|rustling]] some of his cattle. The brothers were arrested, but were quickly acquitted. Although things were tense between the two families, no actions were taken by either side at that time.

The feud quickly escalated, when, on January 22, 1877 (while in the Wiley and Toland's Gem Saloon in Lampasas), John Higgins shot and killed Merritt Horrell in a gunfight. The three remaining Horrell brothers vowed revenge. On March 26, 1877, Tom and Mart Horrell were shot and wounded in an ambush, but both survived. John Higgins and Bob Mitchell were arrested for the action, but later acquitted.

===Shootout at the Lampasas town square===
On June 7, 1877, John Higgins rode into Lampasas accompanied by: brother-in-law, Bob Mitchell; Mitchell's brother, Frank; a friend, Bill Wren; and another brother-in-law, Ben Terry. The Horrell brothers and several friends were already in town, gathered at the town square. It is unknown who fired first, but it is believed that someone within the Horrell faction opened fire on the Higgins group. When the gunfight ended, Bill Wren had been wounded, Frank Mitchell had been killed, and Horrell faction members, Buck Waltrup and Carson Graham, had been killed.

All three Horrell brothers were arrested, and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], Major John B. Jones, acted as a mediator between the remaining members of the two factions. Less than one year later, Mart and Tom Horrell were arrested in [[Meridian, Texas]] for armed robbery and murder. While confined to the local jail, vigilantes broke in and shot and killed them both. Sam was the only remaining Horrell brother. He moved his family to Oregon in 1882, thus marking an end to the feud.

==Lincoln County Feud==
{{Main|Lincoln County Feud}}

The [[Lincoln County Feud]] occurred in the [[Harts, WV|Harts Creek]] community of [[Lincoln County, WV|Lincoln]] and [[Logan County, WV|Logan]] counties, [[West Virginia]], between 1878 and 1890. Initially a personal vendetta between prominent residents Paris Brumfield and Canaan Adkins, the feud culminated in a bitter war between local timber barons and businessmen, including Allen Brumfield, John W. Runyon, and Benjamin Adams. The feud resulted in at least four deaths, numerous injuries and scuffles between factions, nationwide press coverage, and the extermination/out-migration of several key participants. It has been memorialized in at least one ballad and play, as well as through music recorded by [[John Hartford]]. Feud descendant and author Brandon Ray Kirk has written a history of the feud titled ''Blood in West Virginia: Brumfield v. McCoy'', which draws primarily upon twenty years of research including oral histories with other feud descendants, newspaper accounts, and courthouse documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Park| first1=Edwards| title=Fatal Feuds and Futile Forensics| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-tale-of-fatal-feuds-and-futile-forensics-101021286/| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earp–Clanton==
[[File:Mclauriesclanton.jpg|200px|thumb|Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton (left to right) in the window of the undertakers following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.]]

The Earp vendetta ride arose as a result of coordinated attacks (in December 1881 and again in March 1882) against the Earp brothers. These ambushes were in retaliation for their involvement in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in [[Tombstone, Arizona]].

===Gunfight at the O.K. Corral===
{{Main|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral}}

The noted gun-battle had occurred on October 26, 1881, and was itself the climax of the Earp–Clanton family feud, simmering since the summer of 1880. Tensions between the Earps and both the Clantons and McLaurys increased through 1881, culminating in the historic gunfight. At the O.K. Corral, three deputized Earp brothers, [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]] and [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]], along with [[Doc Holliday]], had killed [[Billy Clanton]], [[Frank McLaury]] and [[Tom McLaury]]. The Clanton and McLaury families were aligned with the "[[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Outlaw Cowboys]]", a loosely knit outlaw group of families, friends and acquaintances then living in surrounding [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise]] and [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kjensli|first=Jan|title=Wyatt Earp - Wyatt Earp - man, life and legend|url=http://www.wyatt-earp.info/english/|accessdate=November 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323124602/http://www.wyatt-earp.info/english/|archivedate=March 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earp Vendetta Ride===
{{Main|Earp Vendetta Ride}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The Earp Vendetta ride was a manhunt for the "Outlaw Cowboys" that Wyatt Earp held responsible for the maiming of his brother Virgil (the [[marshal|police chief]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona]] as well as a Deputy U.S. Marshal) the previous December,&lt;ref&gt;NOTE: Wyatt Earp, another target of the December ambush, was unharmed.&lt;/ref&gt; and the recent assassination of his brother Morgan (also an assistant U.S. Marshal) the week before. When several suspects in the attacks were set free by the court − some owing to legal technicalities and others based on the strength of alibis provided by sympathetic confederates – Wyatt Earp decided he could not rely on civil justice, and took matters into his own hands.&lt;ref name=dodge&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Fred|last2=Lake|first2=Carolyn|title=Under Cover for Wells Fargo The Unvarnished Recollections of Fred Dodge|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, Oklahoma|isbn=978-0-8061-3106-1|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8-tmFvI7wC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 1882, a newly deputized [[United States Marshal]] Wyatt Earp formed a federal [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] that began to scour Cochise and Pima counties for the purpose of hunting down and killing the men he thought guilty of the attacks. Wyatt and [[Warren Earp]], Doc Holliday, [[Texas Jack Vermillion|John "Texas Jack" Vermillion]], Dan Tipton, Charlie Smith, Fred Dodge, Johnny Green, and Lou Cooley made up the federal posse.

The killing began with the March 22, 1882, shooting of [[Frank Stilwell]] as he and several Outlaw Cowboys – including [[Ike Clanton]] – lay in ambush at the [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] rail station. The Earp group was escorting the still invalid Virgil Earp, and his wife, to safety so they could be removed from the now dangerous Arizona Territory.

Cowboy confederate and Wyatt Earp rival, Cochise County [[Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]], then formed his own posse and deputized a number of the outlaws, including [[Johnny Ringo]], [[Phineas Clanton]], Johnny Barnes and about 18 more men to ride after the federal posse and the five men "wanted" for the shooting of Stilwell.

Carrying federal arrest warrants for the assassins, the federal posse killed four men. The vendetta ride ended with the killing of [[William Brocius|"Curly Bill" Brocius]] and [[Johnny Ringo]] on April 15, 1882. The Earps and their associates then quickly headed for the [[New Mexico Territory]], leaving Arizona Territory, and the feuding behind.

==Brooks–McFarland==
{{Main|Brooks–McFarland Feud}}

A family feud taking place between 1896 and 1902, centered in the [[Creek Nation]] of the old [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]). It began with the death of Thomas Brooks on August 24, 1896. Brooks was killed during a botched holdup which was to originally include some members of the McFarland family in its execution. The Brooks family blamed the McFarland family for the death, and there followed a series of confrontations between the two clans that culminated in the historic shootout at [[Dustin, Oklahoma|Spokogee]] (now Dustin), Oklahoma on September 22, 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/1902-gunfight-at-spokogee.htm|title=1902 Gunfight at Spokogee|work=History Net: Where History Comes Alive - World &amp; US History Online|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the gunfight, family patriarch, Willis Brooks, and his son, Clifton were killed, as well as McFarland family associate, George Riddle. John Brooks, brother of Clifton, lay seriously wounded. Survivors Jim and Joe McFarland, Alonzo Riddle (George's brother), and the wounded John Brooks, were arrested pending murder charges, though all were quickly released on bail.

The feud ended on October 10, 1902 when Jim McFarland was ambushed and killed near his home, possibly at the hands of Sam Baker, a Brooks ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Butler | first= Ken | authorlink= | title= Oklahoma Renegades: Their Deeds and Misdeeds | publisher= Pelican Publishing | series= | year= 1997 | doi= | isbn= 978-1-56554-231-0| id= {{ISBN|1-56554-231-2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Brooks left the area after recuperating from his wounds. Remaining Brooks brother, Henry, left the area soon after serving time for a subsequent arrest for horse theft. He died violently in a shootout with Alabama law enforcement in 1911. Sam Baker was killed October 7, 1911 by the son of an irate shopkeeper he had previously confronted. Willis Brooks' widow and family matriarch, "Old Jenny" Brooks, died on March 29, 1924, at the age of ninety-eight, and is said to have been proud that all of her sons had "''died like men, [[Boot Hill|with their boots on]].''''&lt;ref&gt;Butler, pg. 50-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of McFarland faction were acquitted of any wrongdoing after the fight and continued living in the Dustin area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freestateofwinston.org/auntjenny.htm|title=Mountain Feuds of Aunt Jenny Johnson and the Brooks Boys|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reese–Townsend==
[[File:Mcdonald2 Capt. Bill McDonald.jpg|thumb|200px|Captain Bill McDonald of the Texas Rangers helped put an end to the Reese-Townsend feud.]]
{{Main|Reese–Townsend feud}}

The Reese–Townsend conflict, also called the ''Colorado County Feud'', was a politically motivated feud which took place in the closing days of the Old West. The events of the conflict were centered in [[Columbus, Texas]], but involved other parts of [[Colorado County, Texas|Colorado County]] before it was over. The feud ran from 1898 through 1907.&lt;ref name=THndBk/&gt; The feud resulted from a local political race that placed [[incumbent]] Sheriff Sam Reese against a former deputy sheriff, Larkin Hope. Former [[U.S. senator]], Mark Townsend, was a power-broker who had been the deciding factor for several past contests for sheriff. He had pulled his support away from Reese, supporting Hope instead. This led to tensions between those in support of Reese, and the Townsend faction. When Hope was assassinated in downtown Columbus before the election was held, suspicion immediately fell on the Reese allies. Townsend's hand-picked replacement candidate, Will Burford, won the election.

On March 16, 1899, Reese was killed in a gunfight (provoked by him) with Townsend allies, and Reese's family vowed revenge.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.io.com/~xeke/columbushistory.htm Columbus Texas Online History] Columbus, TX History&lt;/ref&gt; From May 17, 1899 to May 17, 1907, five additional gunfights took place in the area, with the results that Dick Reese (Sam's brother), Arthur Burford, Hiram Clements and Jim Coleman lost their lives in the violence. Legendary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], [[Police captain|Captain]] [[Bill McDonald (Texas Ranger)|Bill McDonald]], along with officer [[James Brooks (Texas Ranger)|James Brooks]] and others, were dispatched to the area to restore order, and ended the fighting.&lt;ref name=THndBk/&gt;

'''Freedom Flotilla III''' ('''#FF3''') was a [[flotilla]] that planned to break the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)|blockade]] of the [[Gaza Strip]] by [[Israel]] by sailing to Gaza. It started from [[Sweden]] on 10 May 2015 and stopped in several European cities along the way to Gaza. It started officially from [[Athens]], [[Greece]] on 25 June 2015.&lt;ref name="MEM-2015"/&gt; Few details were released in advance.&lt;ref name="JP-2015"/&gt;

On 29 June 2015 the Swedish-flagged vessel "Marianne" was intercepted by the Israeli navy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli Navy Peacefully Intercepts Gaza-Bound Vessel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/29/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-gaza.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in international waters about 100 nautical miles from the Palestinian coast of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. The Israeli military reported that no force was needed during the operation. However, eye-witness video published by Israeli [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] TV shows people being tasered by [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] commandos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDF violence against passangers [sic] of Ship to Gaza boat Marianne|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3GficMbVlQ|website=YouTube|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Marianne'' was boarded by Israeli forces and taken to the [[port of Ashdod]], while the rest of the ships turned back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Freedom Flotilla III: Marianne approaches Gaza, sailing boats return back |date=June 29, 2015 |publisher=[[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]] |url=https://www.freedomflotilla.org/2-uncategorised/23-freedom-flotilla-iii-marianne-approaches-gaza-sailing-boats-return-back |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Organizers of the flotilla have repeatedly stated the boat was carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza. According to Israel’s defense minister [[Moshe Yaalon]] “there was no aid on board”. The activists supplied a picture with two boxes containing a single [[solar panel]] and a [[nebulizer]] and added the boat was to be donated to Gazan fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ‘humanitarian aid’ aboard a recent flotilla to Gaza fit in two cardboard boxes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/07/01/did-the-flotilla-to-gaza-have-humanitarian-aid-aboard-or-not/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 30 June 2015, Israel began releasing some detainees.

* Vice Chairman of [[Hamas]] political bureau [[Ismail Haniyeh]] condemned the Israeli piracy against Freedom Flotilla 3. Haniya stated that such piracy highlights the Israeli policy of violation of the International law, and reflects the Israeli terrorism that prevents freedom of sailing to and from the Strip. Haniya slammed the Israeli interception of prominent figures participating in Freedom Flotilla 3, including the former Tunisian President [[Moncef Marzouki]], stressing that such Israeli act breaches diplomatic and international norms. Haniya praised Marzouki as a defender of the [[Arab Spring]] and Arab revolutions that support the Palestinian cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haniya condemns Israeli piracy against Freedom Flotilla 3|url=http://hamas.ps/en/post/83/haniya-condemns-israeli-piracy-against-freedom-flotilla-3|publisher=[[Hamas]]|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GEICO Cavemen''' are trademarked characters of the [[auto insurance]] company [[GEICO]], used in a series of television [[advertisement]]s that aired beginning in 2004. The campaign was created by [[Joe Lawson (writer)|Joe Lawson]] and Noel Ritter while working at [[The Martin Agency]]. According to an episode of the public radio show ''99% Invisible'', "It's so easy a caveman could do it" was first coined by Ritter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saunders|first1=George|last2=Ritter|first2=Noel|title=99% Invisible #57-What Gave You That Idea (Standard 4:30 version)|url=https://beta.prx.org/stories/84066|website=PRX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration for the campaign came from ''Pastoralia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=George|title=Pastoralia|date=May 2000|publisher=Riverhead Books|location=United States|isbn=1-57322-161-9|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralia_(short_story_collection)}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', a short story by George Saunders – the story revolves around two employees, a man and a woman, who work as "cave-people" for a failing theme park. In 2004, GEICO began an advertising campaign featuring [[Neanderthal]]-like [[Caveman|cavemen]] in a modern setting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=geico+caveman&amp;search=Search Geico Caveman Commercials] at youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the commercials is that GEICO advertises that using their website is "so easy, a caveman could do it"; and that this slogan offends several cavemen, who not only still exist in modern society but live as intelligent, urbane bachelors. The first three GEICO commercials to feature cavemen were "Apartment", "Apology", and "Boom Mic".

[[Jeff Daniel Phillips]] and [[Ben Weber (actor)|Ben Weber]] played the two earliest cavemen and continuously reprise their roles. Actor [[John Lehr]] appears most frequently as the caveman, while [[Ben Wilson (actor)|Ben Wilson]] has also portrayed one of the characters. The makeup effects for the caveman include facial prosthetics, dental veneers, lace hairpieces, and body hair, and were designed and created by [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his special effects company [[Alterian, Inc.]]  In an online interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Joe Lawson said that one aspect of the ads is a critique of modern [[political correctness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/the-side/geico032007 The Evolution of the Postmodern Caveman - Esquire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cavemen have been honored by the [[Madison Avenue]] Advertising Walk of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/business/local/article/MART24_20091223-222005/313354/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100107112742/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/business/local/article/MART24_20091223-222005/313354/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-01-07 |title=Martin Agency rolling out new ads for GEICO |last=Llovio |first=Louis |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television advertisements==
# As a fake, caveman-insensitive commercial is being filmed, the [[boom operator (media)|boom operator]] turns out to be a Neanderthal caveman who stops the filming and yells "Not cool!"
# Two cavemen in their apartment watch the ad from commercial # 1 on TV, and take offense at its condescending tone, as it makes cavemen seem less intelligent.
# A spokesman meets with two cavemen in a restaurant to apologize for the promotion, explaining that "we had no idea you guys were still around." One of the cavemen tells the waiter, "I'll have the roast [[duck]] with the [[mango]] [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]]." Considered as a subtle jab at  [[AFLAC]], for its duck mascot (AFLAC once televised a humorous commercial; having duck served in an Asian restaurant to potential buyers of the insurance programs). The other caveman informs the waiter that "I don't have much of an appetite, thank you."  (Writer [[Ron Rosenbaum]] called the roast-duck line "the iconic moment" of the ad series, due to "the surreal contradictions" of cavemen "au courant enough to be unimpressed by now antiquated nouvelle cuisine.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://pajamasmedia.com/xpress/ronrosenbaum/2007/01/26/the_geico_caveman_finally_jump.php The Geico Caveman Finally Jumps the Shark], [[Pajamas Media]], January 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
# A caveman on a [[moving walkway|moving sidewalk]] at an airport spots a GEICO billboard featuring an overly silly representation of a caveman, along with the insulting phrase. The album-version of the [[Röyksopp]] song "[[Remind Me (Röyksopp song)|Remind Me]]" plays in the background.
# A follow up to the fourth commercial shows the same caveman talking on his cell phone, complaining about the offending billboard, saying "I'm looking right at it!".
# A caveman in a psychotherapy session complains to his therapist, played by [[Talia Shire]], about GEICO's attitude towards cavemen. The therapist says that an ad that said "So easy a therapist could do it" wouldn't make sense to her.
# Continuing the therapy session, the therapist says "No one said it was going to be easy." The caveman replies that if Geico had taken that attitude, "I wouldn't be having an existential meltdown right now." Another concurrent psychotherapy commercial has the caveman role playing with a stuffed doll caveman. He says, "He's just a doll!"
# All three cavemen are at a high-rise-apartment party. On the balcony, two of them discuss one caveman's decision to purchase GEICO's insurance because of its low price.  The second caveman doesn't entirely fault him, but states that "a little loyalty would be nice" in their opposition to the company. During their discussion, the third caveman interrupts from inside, exclaiming excitedly "Tina's here; we're getting back together!" The first caveman quickly snaps at him, exclaiming, "Hey! Give us a minute!"
# A caveman on a news-type talk show debates a human expert about whether or not cavemen "have failed to adapt." The expert insults the caveman by saying, "It looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the rock."
# The continuation to the tenth commercial, the woman on the bottom right says about how ego in our society is at the forefront. The man on the left asks the caveman, "Response?". The caveman's response is "Uhhhh, what?!?!"
# The cavemen watch the show ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]'', and ridicule the series. This ad premiered during [[Super Bowl XLII]]; the show itself had already been canceled.
# A caveman dances in various styles in a rather ridiculous manner, remarking how hard it is to dance in such a style, making such exclamations as "GEICO probably thinks ''this'' is easy, too!"
# "Match": Focusing on GEICO's sports marketing efforts, a caveman faces [[Billie Jean King]] in a [[tennis]] match. The caveman is winning handily, but when he looks at the scoreboard he realizes that it shows him losing 0-6, 0-6, 0-5. He doesn't understand, until he realizes the tournament is sponsored by GEICO. Feeling set up and humiliated by GEICO, he stands up and says "I get it! I quit, but I get it!" He then notices the chair he was just sitting in also bears a bold GEICO logo.
# "Plane Banner": A caveman and his [[girlfriend]] arrive at the beach. As the lady begins to disrobe to her bikini a plane flies by with a GEICO banner. The distraught caveman takes his sunglasses off and says "I'll be in the car".
# "Walkin'": Two cavemen ride up to an outdoor bar on motorcycles. At the bar, they see two typically beautiful girls who are clearly impressed by the bikers. The bikers then see a billboard similar to the one in ad #4 (although, since this ad targets motorcycle insurance, the caveman is on a motorcycle). They suddenly lose interest in the women, heading back to their bikes; the women seem confused by the sudden change in the cavemen's demeanor. The song "Hurt You" by [[The Sounds]] plays in the background.
# "Number 1 Fan": A caveman is shown on a [[Jumbotron]] at a basketball game as the "GEICO Ultimate Fan." He rejects the congratulations of those sitting around him, although he just won court-side seats. As the commercial ends, the arena announcer plugs GEICO, using the "so easy" phrase.
# "Metal Detector": A caveman is walking on the beach with his [[girlfriend]], looking for treasure with a metal detector. The device beeps, exciting the couple. The caveman digs into the sand with a net and pulls out a set of car keys with a GEICO key chain attached. He throws the keys and metal detector on the ground and walks away in disgust.
# "Breaking Point": A caveman who is dressed as a caricature of Modern Man sees an advertisement for Geico on many televisions through a window and can't take it anymore; he takes off his glasses, unties his ponytail, and takes off his coat, and runs away acting like his former caveman-self set to "[[Let Me Be Myself]]" by [[3 Doors Down]].  This scene was used in part for the music video of the same song.
# "Bowling": The continuation of the 19th commercial, the caveman comes across a bowling alley and sees two of his caveman buddies there and joins the game with them. The caveman who just came in went first, and one of his buddies went second. While the second caveman's pin sweeper is sweeping the pins, it shows on the pin sweeper an advertisement for Geico with the "So easy" phrase, along with the GEICO logo on the pinsetter.  This was also set to "Let Me Be Myself" by 3 Doors Down.  This video served as the ending to the music video of the same song.
# "Glovebox": This is a commercial for a Geico iPhone App called "Glovebox" which is demonstrated by a hand model (with an unusually hairy hand). The end of the commercial's script states the app is "So Easy a Caveman Can Do It", which angers the hand model, who is revealed to be a Caveman as he storms off, saying, "Where's my coat? It was suede, with the fringe!"
# "Fire": Part of a separate series of Geico commercials where in which actor [[Mike McGlone]] walks into an empty room and asks a rhetorical and/or obvious question. In the commercial, his question is "Could switching to GEICO really save you 15 percent or more on car insurance? Did the Cavemen invent fire?" The scene then cuts to one of the Cavemen on a bed reading with a woman, he looks at the camera and sighs, then picks up his remote and turns his fireplace on.

Also, at the time of the launch of the Caveman's Crib website, a short advertisement featuring all cavemen at the "hip party" featured on the website was added after every Caveman commercial that was currently airing.

Recently, one of the Cavemen was spotted filming a new commercial (or series of commercials) in Homer, Alaska on the [[FV Time Bandit|Time Bandit]] boat (from [[The Deadliest Catch]] TV series).  The Mayor of the city presented the caveman with a key to the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homernews.com/stories/031710/news_1_002.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television sitcom spin-off==
{{main|Cavemen (TV series)}}

On March 2, 2007, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that a [[sitcom]] based on the cavemen characters, simply titled ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]'', was being developed for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,256188,00.html GEICO Cavemen Will Be Focus of New ABC Sitcom], ''FOXNews.com'', March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine reported, "'Cavemen' will revolve around three pre-historic men who must battle prejudice as they attempt to live as normal thirtysomethings in modern [[Atlanta]]." ABC announced this series for their fall schedule in May 2007. Originally it featured none of the Cavemen from the commercials, but Jeff Daniel Phillips later agreed to join the cast.  It premiered on October 2, 2007. In the face of sagging ratings, it was quietly cancelled, automatically being the shortest lived ABC sitcom of the season. In February 2008, a new series of Caveman commercials featured two of the characters spoofing the premise of the show.

'''George Nicolas de Roerich''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Юрий Николаевич Рёрих, {{IPA-ru|ˈjʉrʲɪj nʲɪkəˈlajɪvʲɪtɕ ˈrʲɵrʲɪx|pron}}; August 16, 1902 in [[Okulovka (town), Novgorod Oblast|Okulovka]], [[Novgorod Governorate]] – May 21, 1960 in [[Moscow]]) was a prominent 20th century [[Tibetologist]]. His name at birth was '''Yuri'''&lt;ref&gt;Variant spellings of Yuri: Yury, Yuriy, or Iurii. The name "George" is a commonly used English equivalent of the Russian name "Yuri". Another variant of his name is spelled thusly: ''Ūrij Nikolaevič Rerih''.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Nikolaevich Rerikh'''. George's work encompassed many areas of Tibetan studies, but in particular he is known for his contributions to Tibetan dialectology, his monumental translation of the ''[[Blue Annals]]'', and his 11-volume Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary (published posthumously).

George was the son of the painter and explorer [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]].

==Early life==
Much of Roerich's early life was spent in Saint Petersburg. His brother, [[Svetoslav Roerich]], was born in 1904. Both sons' interests were nurtured by their mother, who wrote of her oldest son's childhood: "The elder one showed love for history and tin soldiers. He had thousands of them. His passion for the art of war has survived until now. Strategy is his pet subject. By the way, this talent is inborn, and he is very proud of his ancestor — [[field marshal]] of the [[Russian Empire]] [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], the hero of [[French Invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Aunovsky |first2=O.

Roerich's letter dated February 25, 1953 // The ICR Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
By the time Roerich was 15, he had already begun studying [[Egyptology]] with [[Boris Turayev]] and Mongolian language and history with Andrei Dmitryevich Rudnyev. He was a student with broad interests and many talents. After finishing his studies at [[Karl May School]], he entered the Indian and Iranian department of Oriental Languages at [[London University]] in 1918. Under Indologist Professor [[Edward Denison Ross]] he studied Sanskrit and Pali.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was recognized for his language abilities and was introduced as the best Sanskrit student to the Secretary of State for Indian Affairs who visited the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of his study at London University in 1920, he moved to America with his parents. He studied in the Indian Philology Department of [[Harvard University]] and also studied {{clarify|text=Pali Chinese languages|date=June 2015}} during his time there. At the age of 18, Roerich was already firmly rooted in his passion for Oriental studies. He mastered Sanskrit during his time at Harvard under the direction of Professor [[Charles Rockwell Lanman]], whose comparative grammar lessons made a lifelong impact on George's future studies. Roerich also attended lectures by Professor [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] on Middle Asia influences in the art of southern Russia. During his years at Harvard, he wrote his first essay on Buddhism and studied classical Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He received both a bachelor's and master's degree from Harvard University, then continued his education in Paris, France.

He spent the years 1922-1923 at Paris University in Sorbonne, working in the Department of Middle Asian, Indian and Mongol-Tibetan Studies and studying in the Military Department as well as the Department of Law and Economy. During his time here, he cooperated with such famous orientalists as [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Sylvain Lévi]]. He learned Mongolian and Tibetan while also continuing his study of Chinese and Persian languages. He graduated with his M.A. in Indian Philology in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early work===
Roerich began his independent research at the age of 21. In November 1923 he left for Bombay with his family.  After years of study and preparation, his dream of going to India came true.  By December 1923, he had arrived at the base of the Himalayas as a member of a scientific expedition to Sikkim.  The purpose of this expedition was to visit ancient monuments and Buddhist monasteries, as well as to record local legends, beliefs and artistic traditions.  In Darjeeling, George polished his colloquial Tibetan with scholar Lama L.M. Dorje, who also guided him in the study of [[Tibetan Art]]. Roerich found strong similarities between ancient Russian icon painting and the art of tankha painting in both technique and in the treatment of the subject. He wrote: "Indeed, it seems that the Russian icon art and the Tibetan pictorial art derive their methods of work from a common source...... Thus we often see on Tibetan paintings the principal figures enthroned on an island (this being usually the case when Buddha or Bodhisattva is represented).  Similar images are frequently found on Russian icons......"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Roerich published his first book entitled 'Tibetan Paintings' in which he attempted to define Tibetan art, its history, and the three existing schools of art in Tibet. David Jackson in his 'A history of Tibetan painting' acknowledged that in the Western scholarship, "the  earliest account of Tibetan paintings styles.... was that of George Roerich".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Asian Expedition===
The Roerich family embarked on an ambitious journey throughout Central Asia in 1925. This journey began in India and lasted four years. It was a crucial time in George Roerich's career as a scientist and he began his study of ancient pre-Buddhist doctrine of Bon and the translation of its manuscript. Despite the difficulties of travel and political instability, Roerich managed to make several important discoveries during this expedition, including previously unknown materials about the Tibetan [[Epic of King Gesar]]. Another important discovery was that the [[animal style]] that was used by nomads who had migrated from Central Asia to South Russia in the 7th and 8th centuries B.C.E. could also be found amongst Northern Tibetan nomads. Roerich believed that, "All art objects made in animal style found and described by the expedition clearly proved the existence of ancient Central Asian art amongst nomads of Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

His role as translator was invaluable to the group as they traveled. Roerich could speak Mongolian and Tibetan fluently, in addition to many other Central Asian languages. Despite his young age, he was given the task of guarding the group's safety. Here, his knowledge of military tactics from his university study proved useful and his tactical skills and courage saved their caravan on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; His study of the geography, archeology, ethnology, and linguistics during the expedition formed the basis of his work "Trails to Inmost Asia", which was published in 1930. This publication put the young orientalist on par with the famous researchers of Central Asia, such as [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]], [[Grigory Potanin]], [[Pyotr Kozlov]], and [[Sven Hedin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Of this lengthy and challenging journey, Roerich later said, "The expedition headed by Professor Nicholas Roerich, organized by the Roerich Museum in New York and International Centre of Art “Corona Mundi” had as its main task creation of the unique pictorial panorama of the lands and nations of Inmost Asia.
The second task, was research of the possibilities of the new archaeological excavations, and thus, preparation of the ways for the future expeditions in this region. The third task was research of the languages and dialects of Central Asia, and gathering a big collection of objects, that depict spiritual culture of these nations. Central Asia has been a cradle and a meeting place of many Asian civilizations, and inaccessible mountain valleys till our days preserved many invaluable linguistic and ethnographic materials, which can help to reconstruct the past of Asia."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Himalayan Research Institute===
The plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named 'Urusvati' in Darjeeling in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to Naggar in Kulu Valley. The center engaged in scientific exchange with 285 institutes, universities, museums, and libraries around the world. Roerich collaborated with Tibetan scholars and published the Tibetan English Dictionary in 1934. One of his main focuses for the center was to bring people to the institute who practiced and lived the cultures being examined by the center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was the director of the institute for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/02.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchuria Expedition===
In 1934 – 1935, Roerich undertook an expedition with his father to Manchuria and Inner Mongolia which was organized by the US Department of Agriculture for the purpose of collecting seeds of drought resistant plants that would help prevent erosion of soils and the spreading of pests. In addition to gaining purely scientific knowledge, this expedition also had a social and cultural aim: to create wider agricultural cooperation and public collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/02.php&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Nicholas Roerich]] led the expedition while George Roerich was the assistant and responsible for the medicinal research. They gathered a collection of drought resistant plants, herbs, and soil, as well as a valuable list of traditional medicinal treatments. Roerich made maps and conducted a photo survey of the region in which the expedition took place. In 1935, the research from the expedition was transferred back to India and the Roerichs returned to Kulu Valley in October 1935.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Скумин Виктор Андреевич.jpg |thumb |left |190 px| [[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] at the grave of George de Roerich ([[Novodevichy Cemetery]], [[Moscow]])]]
After the Manchuria expedition, Roerich spent many years living in India. His father, [[Nicholas Roerich]], died in 1947. Due to political unrest in the area Roerich moved with his mother, [[Helena Roerich]], from their home in Nagger to Kalimpong where he lived until 1956. Helena Roerich died in 1955 and in 1957 Roerich returned to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roerichtrust.org/Roerich%20family_files/grpersonal/GRpersonal1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Before his return to his homeland, Roerich participated in several important projects.

He collaborated with [[Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark]] and R. Sanskrtyayana to translate the Buddhist text ''Pramanavaartikam'' from Tibetan into Sanskrit. Working with Tse-Trung Lopsang Phuntshok he wrote ''Textbook of Colloquial Tibetan''. Together with [[Gendün Chöphel]], he translated the lengthy pioneering work on Tibetan history, ''[[Blue Annals]]'', which was published in two volumes by the Asiatic Society in 1949 and 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
After spending almost 30 years in India Roerich returned in 1957 to Soviet Russia, where he made efforts to revive the Russian School of Oriental Studies. As the Head of the Indology Department in the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, he resumed editing of ''Bibliotheca Buddhica''. This was a series devoted to the publication of Buddhist texts and monographs on the subject, started in 1897 by Prof. S.F. Oldenburg. In this same series A.I. Vostrikov's ''Tibetan Historical Literature'' and ''[[Dhammapada]]'' were also translated from [[Pali]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignca.nic.in/nl002501.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

His return to Russia and acquisition of Soviet citizenship was courageous as the USSR's opinion of his family was rather distorted. Because of his effort, bans were lifted on everything associated with the Roerich family name and the legacy of research left by the family was preserved. The first of his father's exhibitions was organized in Moscow in 1958, then spread to [[Leningrad]], [[Riga]], [[Kiev]], [[Tbilisi]], and other cities. He was able to dispel myths about the family's philosophy of [[Agni Yoga]] and start a cultural movement using this philosophy to spread [[Living Ethics]] in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/j9.html |title=Удрая — наш Духовный Наставник |trans-title=Udraia (George Roerich's spiritual name) is our Guru |author=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin VA]] |year=2003 |journal=To Health via Culture |volume=9 |pages=3–12 |issn=0204-3440 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/02.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Roerich died on May 21, 1960, at the age of 58 and his ashes were placed in Moscow, at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]]. [[Svetoslav Roerich]] is the author of the memorial to this outstanding [[List of Russian linguists and philologists|Russian scientist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/index.php|title=George Roerich /Yuri Nikolayevich Roerich/ (1902—1960)|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icr.su/rus/katalog/09.php?i=2257 Sketch of the Tombstone on G.N.Roerich’s Grave at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to corner the local market on [[gas station]]s, Dhinsa defrauded customers, [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|evaded taxes]], committed at least two murders, and is believed to have ordered eight others. He is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release in a federal prison.

==Early life==
Dhinsa was born a [[Sikh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jan/05us.htm|date=5 January 1999 |title= Rags-to-riches Sikh businessman charged with murder |publisher= Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and expatriated to [[the Bronx]] in 1982. He worked as a [[Petroleum engineer]] until he was able procure a filling station of his own. As business improved, Dhinsa's holding company, Citygas Gasoline Corp &lt;ref&gt;[http://appsext8.dos.state.ny.us/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=1580441&amp;p_corpid=1479346&amp;p_entity_name=citygas&amp;p_name_type=%25&amp;p_search_type=BEGINS&amp;p_srch_results_page=0 Entity Information for Citygas Gasoline Corp.], New York State Department of State Division of Corporations&lt;/ref&gt; "City Gas" opened more stations in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. At its height, City Gas had 51 locations and 300 employees, with annual revenues of $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filling Stations' Owner Held in Fraud and Killings|author=|date=9 July 1997|publisher=The New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/nyregion/filling-stations-owner-held-in-fraud-and-killings.html?pagewanted=all | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal activities==
When Dhinsa leased his first gas station in 1984, neighborhood residents were illegally and forcibly using the lot to park their cars. According to a witness, Dhinsa smashed every windshield with a [[baseball bat]]. The cars were moved, and the gas station became profitable.&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|date=10 July 1997|author=Dan Barry|title=Police Say Man Stopped at Nothing for Gasoline Empire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/10/nyregion/police-say-man-stopped-at-nothing-for-gasoline-empire.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he expanded his business, Dhinsa modified gas pumps, evaded taxes on gasoline bought in bulk, and kept his employees silent with death threats. He was arrested in 1990 on suspicion of kidnapping, robbery, and assault, but served only 90 days by pleading guilty to a weapons charge.&lt;ref name=barry/&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99feb25/world.htm#6|title=Jury awards life term to Dhinsa|date=11 March 1999|publisher=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he was convicted of weapons charges again and served a year in prison.&lt;ref name=barry/&gt;

In July 1995, Dhinsa ordered associates to kidnap an employee he suspected of stealing. When the victim's brother came looking for him in early 1997, Dhinsa ordered his murder. This killing was reported to police by several residents of the neighborhood. Police discovered that Dhinsa's brother Gurdip, who had fled to India to avoid prosecution for a 1991 murder, was back in the U.S. and was working at City Gas. On May 16, 1997, police surrounded the City Gas headquarters and arrested three employees, including Gurdip. When Gurmeet Dhinsa arrived at the scene, he was held for questioning and released. Although Dhinsa was released, a task force was formed to look into his operation, including the investigation of several disappearances and unsolved homicides.&lt;ref name=barry/&gt; The kidnapped employee was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|title=Owner of Gas Station Chain is Described as Killer in Trial|date=5 January 1999|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDB143EF936A35752C0A96F958260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 1997, police were called by a man who claimed Dhinsa had threatened him and his family. Later that day, investigators stopped Dhinsa and searched the car he was driving. When Dhinsa opened the trunk, the police discovered circuit boards for gas pumps.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;This evidence, along with other evidence obtained from Dhinsa's car, was suppressed during pretrial motions due to doubts of [[probable cause]]. Dhinsa claimed that the traffic stop was unconstitutional, and that the seizure of his car six days later constituted an unreasonable search. This decision was overturned before trial; see "Docket No. 98-1605" from U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
Police arrested Dhinsa on July 7. At the same time, Dhinsa's car was seized and inventoried. Evidence of gas pump tampering, including Department of Consumer Affairs metal seals and inspection stickers, was found during the search.&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt;

On August 22, 1997, Dhinsa was indicted by a grand jury on 29 counts including racketeering, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, and witness intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=2nd&amp;navby=case&amp;no=981605|publisher=U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals|title=Docket No. 98-1605|date=December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhinsa was represented by high-profile defense attorney [[Gerald Shargel]], but was found guilty of murder and racketeering after an eight-week trial. Although the prosecution sought the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], the jury turned down the request and Dhinsa was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; In addition, Dhinsa was forced to pay $1.75 million in restitution and fines&amp;mdash;$625,000 to the family of each victim as well as a separate $500,000 fine to the city&amp;mdash;and his businesses were auctioned by the government to cover civil fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E4D91639F934A25753C1A96F958260|title=Businessman Is Fined In Two Contract Killings|publisher=The New York Times|date=17 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the police investigation and prosecution of Dhinsa is the subject of an episode of [[The FBI Files]] entitled "Deadly Business" [[List of The FBI Files episodes|(Season 3, Episode 9)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9280">{{about|the linguistic and pragmatic description of Information structure within a sentence|the concept as it relates to webdesign|Information architecture}}

In [[linguistics]], '''information structure''', also called information packaging, describes the way in which information is formally packaged within a sentence.&lt;ref name="lambrecht"&gt;Lambrecht, Knud. 1994. ''Information structure and sentence form.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This generally includes only those aspects of information that “respond to the temporary state of the addressee’s mind”, and excludes other aspects of linguistic information such as references to background (encyclopedic/common) knowledge, choice of style, [[politeness]], and so forth.&lt;ref name="krifka"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krifka|first=Manfred|authorlink=Manfred Krifka|title=Basic notions of information structure|journal=Acta Linguistica Hungarica|volume=55|issue=3–4|pages=243–276|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|location=Budapest|year=2008|issn=1216-8076|doi=10.1556/ALing.55.2008.3-4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the difference between an active clause (e.g., ''the police want him'') and a corresponding passive (e.g., ''he is wanted by police'') is a syntactic difference, but one motivated by information structuring considerations. Other structures motivated by information structure include preposing (e.g., ''that one I don't like'') and inversion (e.g., ''"the end", said the man'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoff K|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic notions of information structure are [[focus (linguistics)|focus]], [[givenness]], and [[topic-comment|topic]],&lt;ref name="krifka"/&gt; as well as their complementary notions of background, newness, and comment respectively.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kučerová|first1=Ivona|last2=Neeleman|first2=Ad|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|title=Contrasts and positions in information structure|location=[[Cambridge]]|year=2012|pages=1–23|isbn=978-1-107-00198-5|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9781107001985}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Focus''' “indicates the presence of alternatives that are relevant for the interpretation of linguistic expressions”, '''givenness''' indicates that “the denotation of an expression is present” in the immediate context of the utterance, and '''topic''' is “the entity that a speaker identifies, about which then information, the comment, is given”.&lt;ref name="krifka"/&gt; Additional notions in information structure may include contrast and exhaustivity, but there is no general agreement in the linguistic literature about extensions of the basic three notions.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt; There are many different approaches, such as generative or functional architectures, to information structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Mechanisms in various languages ==
Information structure can be realized through a wide variety of linguistic mechanisms.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman" /&gt; In the spoken form of [[English language|English Language]], one of the primary methods of indicating information structure is through [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], whereby [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is modified from some default pattern. Other languages use syntactic mechanisms like [[dislocation (syntax)|dislocation]], [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], and [[gapping]]; morphological mechanisms like specialized focus or topic-marking [[affix]]es; and specialized [[discourse particle]]s. English in fact uses more than intonation for expressing information structure, so that [[cleft sentence|clefts]] are used for exhaustive focus, and [[grammatical particle]]s like ''only'' also induce contrastive focus readings.

Cross-linguistically, there are clear tendencies that relate notions of information structure to particular linguistic phenomena. For instance, focus tends to be [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] prominent, and there do not seem to be any languages that express focus by [[metrical phonology|deaccenting]] or destressing.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman" /&gt;

The following German sentences exhibit three different kinds of syntactic ‘fronting’ that correlate with topic.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt;

: a. _Diesen Mann_ habe ich noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man have I not yet seen.’ '''(movement)'''
b. _Diesen Mann_, den habe ich noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man, that I have not yet seen.’ '''(left dislocation)'''
: c. _Diesen Mann_, ich habe ihn noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man, I have not yet seen him.’ '''(hanging topic)'''

It is often assumed that answers to questions are focused elements. Question and answer pairs are often used as diagnostics for focus, as in the following English examples.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt;

:Q: What did John do with the book yesterday?
:A: He SOLD the book yesterday.
:A: *He sold the book YESTERDAY.

:Q: When did Jane sell the book?
:A: She sold the book YESTERDAY.
:A: *She SOLD the book yesterday.

== Concepts ==

=== Focus and background ===
{{Main|Focus (linguistics)}}
''Focus'' is a grammatical category or attribute that determines indicating that part of an utterance contributes new, non-derivable, or contrastive information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notes on transitivity and theme in English: Part 2|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022226700016613|accessdate = 2015-07-08|last = Halliday|first = M. A. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories (in line with work by Mats Rooth) link focus to the presence of ''alternatives'' (see [[Focus (linguistics)#Alternative semantics|Focus: Alternative Semantics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A theory of focus interpretation|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02342617|journal = Natural Language Semantics|date = 1992|issn = 0925-854X|pages = 75–116|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF02342617|first = Mats|last = Rooth}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternatives theory of focus would account for the stress pattern in the example from the previous section (When did Jane sell the book? She sold the book YESTERDAY), saying that YESTERDAY receives focus because it could be substituted with alternative time periods (TODAY or LAST WEEK) and still serve to answer the question the first speaker asked.

''Background'' is a more difficult concept to define; it's not simply the complement of focus. Daniel P. Hole gives the following framework: "‘Focus’ is a relational notion, and the entity a focus relates to is called its background, or presupposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Focus and Background Marking in Mandarin Chinese: System and theory behind cái, jiù, dōu and ye.|url = http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/ilg/institut/mitarbeiter/hole/schriften/Hole2004a.pdf|website = www.uni-stuttgart.de|accessdate = 2015-07-15|last = Hole|first = Daniel P.|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topic and comment ===
{{Main|Topic and comment}}
The ''topic'' (or theme) of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the ''comment'' (or rheme, or sometimes focus) is what is being said about the topic. That the information structure of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme depends on grammatical theory. Topic is grammaticized in languages like Japanese and Korean, which have a designated [[Topic marker|topic-marker]] morpheme affixed to the topic.

Some diagnostics have been proposed for languages that lack grammatical topic-markers, like English; they attempt to distinguish between different kinds of topics (such as "aboutness" topics and "contrastive" topics).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Craige (2001). "Topics". In ''Semantics: An international handbook of natural language meaning''. Vol. 33. (Eds. Claudia Maienborn, Klaus von Heusinger, and Paul Portner). Walter de Gruyter. pp.1908-1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostics consist of judging how felicitous it is to follow a discourse with either questions (''What about x?'') or sentences beginning with certain phrases (''About x, ... Speaking of x,'' ... ''As for x'', ...) to determine how "topical" ''x'' is in that context.

=== Given and new ===
Intuitively, ''givenness'' classifies words and information in a discourse that are already known (or given) by virtue of being common knowledge, or by having been discussed previously in the same discourse ("anaphorically recoverable").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Certain theories (such as Roger Schwarzschild's GIVENness Constraint) require all non-focus-marked constituents to be given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = GIVENNESS, AVOIDF AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS ON THE PLACEMENT OF ACCENT*|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008370902407|journal = Natural Language Semantics|date = 1999|issn = 0925-854X|pages = 141–177|volume = 7|issue = 2|doi = 10.1023/A:1008370902407|first = Roger|last = Schwarzschild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words/information that are not given, or are "textually and situationally non-derivable"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are by definition ''new''.

'''Joseph Andoni Massad''' ({{lang-ar|جوزيف مسعد}}; born 1963) is Professor of Modern Arab Politics and Intellectual History in the [[MESAAS|Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies]] at [[Columbia University]], whose academic work has focused on [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian]], [[Jordan]]ian, and [[Israeli nationalism]]. He is also known for his book ''Desiring Arabs'', about representations of [[sexual desire]] in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== ''Colonial Effects'' (2001) ==
Massad's first book, ''Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan'', was published in 2001 by [[Columbia University Press]].  The book is based on Massad's PhD dissertation, which won the [[Middle East Studies Association]] Malcolm Kerr Dissertation Award in 1998.

Over the course of a detailed history of the Jordanian state, from its inception in 1921 to 2000, he argues that state institutions are central to the fashioning of national identity. Massad focuses on institutions of law, the military, and education as key components of nationalism, and elaborates on the production not only of national identity but also of national culture including food, clothes, sports, accents, songs, and television serials.

''Colonial Effects'' was critically praised both by several senior academics in Middle East Studies, including [[Edward Said]] who described the book as "a work of genuine brilliance," and by scholars of nationalism such as [[Partha Chatterjee (scholar)|Partha Chatterjee]], Amr Sabet, and Stephen Howe, the last of whom called the book "among the most sophisticated and impressive products" of recent studies in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/023112323X|title=Colonial Effects|first=Joseph A.|last=Massad|date=15 October 2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was extensively reviewed in academic journals and, according to [[Betty Anderson]], one of the book's reviewers, it has become staple reading on syllabi of nationalism and Middle East politics university courses across the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Betty Anderson.

== ''The Persistence of the Palestinian Question'' (2006) ==
''The Persistence of the Palestinian Question: Essays on Zionism and the Palestinians'', Massad's second book, was published in 2006 by [[Routledge]].

''The Persistence of the Palestinian Question'' analyzes [[Zionism]] and [[Palestinian nationalism]] from a variety of angles, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[culture]], [[ethnicity]], [[colonialism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[nationalism|nationalist ideology]].  Massad's analysis of the discourse on [[terrorism]] in the introduction deals with the dynamics of power relations between Zionism and the Palestinians and traces the history of Zionist and Israeli violence which the British called "terrorism" in Palestine before 1948 and after, while his title chapter on the persistence of the Palestinian question argues that the Palestinian and the Jewish questions are one and the same and that "both questions can only be resolved by the negation of anti-Semitism, which still plagues much of Europe and America and which mobilizes Zionism's own hatred of Jewish Jews and of the Palestinians."

The book has received praise from scholars [[Ilan Pappé]] and [[Ella Shohat]] as well as from Palestinian historian [[Walid Khalidi]]. Shohat praised the book as a "timely and engaging volume" that "makes an invaluable contribution to the ongoing debate over Zionism and Palestine." Pappé saw the book as a "courageous intellectual exercise" and as "a thought provoking book that forces us to reverse our conventional images and perceptions about Palestine's history and future."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415770106 Ella Shohat review of ''The Persistence of the Palestinian Question'' at Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars situated the book's contribution in relation to European history and to the work of Edward Said.  [[University of Pennsylvania]] political science professor [[Anne Norton]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Massad's brilliant and scholarly work is profoundly illuminating not only for the history of Palestine and the discourses surrounding it, but for the history of Europe and the United States and, finally, as an account that raises compelling theoretical questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his review in ''Nations and Nationalism'', Israeli scholar Ephraim Nimni wrote that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;like his intellectual mentor, Massad reminds us of a long and honourable tradition of Jewish Intellectuals who could only envisage the solution to the Jewish Question through universal emancipation. It seems that Massad, and the late Edward Said, are existential Diaspora Jews of the old kind ... The book is also fastidiously referenced, showing the erudition of the author and his command of the voluminous Israeli and Palestinian literature as well as the classics of Jewish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== ''Desiring Arabs'' (2007) ==
Massad's third book, ''Desiring Arabs'', was published in 2007 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. ''Desiring Arabs'' won Columbia University's 2008 Lionel Trilling Book Award, awarded by a jury of students on the grounds that it "offers a probing study of representations of Arab sexuality" and is "an important and eloquent work of scholarship that the committee feels will have a lasting impact on the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/node/30777|title=- Columbia Daily Spectator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Desiring Arabs'' is an intellectual history of the Arab world and its Western representations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The book makes contributions to a number of academic and theoretical fields. It extends Said's study of Orientalism by analyzing the latter's impact on Arab intellectual production; it links Orientalism to definitions and representations of sex and desire and in doing so provides a colonial archive to the sexual question that has hitherto been missing; it approaches the literary as the limits of imagining the future; and puts forth the question of translation as a central problem in Euro-American studies of the other.

Massad argues that "Western male white-dominated" gay activists, under the umbrella of what he terms the "Gay International," have engaged in a "missionary" effort to impose the binary categories of heterosexual/homosexual into cultures where no such subjectivities exist, and that these activists in fact ultimately replicate in these cultures the very structures they challenge in their own home countries. Massad writes that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The categories gay and lesbian are not universal at all and can only be universalized by the epistemic, ethical, and political violence unleashed on the rest of the world by the very international human rights advocates whose aim is to defend the very people their intervention is creating.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Academic impact ===

''Desiring Arabs'' has received critical praise from academics for its contributions both to the analysis of Arab culture and to the theory of sexuality.

[[Talal Asad]], professor of Anthropology at [[City University of New York|CUNY]], described it as a "remarkable book, at once a fascinating history of ideas and a brilliantly analyzed case study of cultural imperialism. ... [It] is quite stunning."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226509583|title=Desiring Arabs|first=Joseph A.|last=Massad|date=15 June 2007|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Shammas]], professor of Arabic Literature at the [[University of Michigan]], praised the book as an "elaborate, relentless, and unabashed" critique of Arab intellectual production on the question of sex and desire, "the most interesting and equally illuminating commentaries on modern Arab culture to be published in the past decade."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], Avalon Foundation Professor of the Humanities, [[Columbia University]] blurbed the book in the following terms. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This compendious study of the discursive production of an Arab sexuality incorporates new readings of the modernity/tradition debates that go well beyond a specifically Arab context, and moves all the way from historical research into the history of literature and literary criticism. Even as it supplements [[Edward Said]]'s work by its consideration of Arab Orientalism, Desiring Arabs boldly looks forward to an unscripted future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ferial Ghazoul]] reviewed the book in the ''Journal of Arabic Literature'', stating that ''Desiring Arabs'' 

&lt;blockquote&gt;is a brilliant text with a breadth of knowledge and sophisticated analytical techniques ... Massad's interdisciplinary approach, dense prose, impeccable research, and above all the thought-provoking issues he raises make his book a scholarly landmark ... As a student of the late Edward W. Said and as Desiring Arabs was dedicated to Said ... , Massad has certainly learned the lessons of Said, his critical innovation, his scholarly meticulousness, and his virtuoso style.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Arabic Literature (no.39 (2008) 424-430)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feminist scholar [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], a professor of history at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, describes the book as "an inspired and erudite intellectual history, complex, nuanced, critical, and deeply engaged."  Scott comments that Massad refuses both an essentialized opposition between Arab and Western civilization and an all-embracing universalism offered in the name of human rights. Instead, she writes, Massad insists that representations of Arab sexuality must be understood historically, as the outcome of the encounter between Arab and Orientalist writers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  In her review of the book in the ''Arab Studies Journal'', feminist scholar Marnia Lazreg, a professor of sociology at CUNY, wrote, "This truly monumental book is a corrective to Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality that inexplicably omitted the role played by the cultural effects of colonial systems on conceptions and constructions of sexuality ... [Desiring Arabs] is an epoch-making book".&lt;ref&gt;Arab Studies Journal, Vol XV No. 2 /Vol XVI No. 1, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Khaled El-Rouayheb of Harvard University called the book, "A pioneering work on a very timely yet frustratingly neglected topic. ... I know of no other study that can even begin to compare with the detail and scope of [this] work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://merip.org/mer/mer245/mer245.html|title=About the Middle East Report - Middle East Research and Information Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samia Mehrez, a professor of Arabic Literature at the American University in Cairo writes in the ''[[Journal of Gender Studies]]'', 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Desiring Arabs by Joseph Massad is an impressive project that ventures into uncharted territory and can be read as a complement to both Edward Said's Orientalism and Michel Foucault's work on sexuality. Like all of Massad's work, Desiring Arabs investigates the discursive and institutional continuum through which culture is 'invented' under both colonial rule through colonial practices that sought to reify racial and religious differences as well as through the cultural politics of the post-colonial nation state and its efforts to consolidate the nation, national identity, and national belonging.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Gender Studies]]'', Vol. 18, No. 1, March 2009, 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While there has been a clear consensus on the book's significant scholarly contributions, some of the book's theses have also been criticized by Rayyan Al-Shawaf, a freelance writer and reviewer living in Beirut, who concedes that Massad makes a few good points, but observes that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Massad's relativism – stemming from his accurate observation that 'homosexuality' is alien to Arab same-gender sexual traditions – is so extreme that he refuses to support a call for universal freedom of sexual identity.&lt;ref name="Shawaf-D"&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Al-Shawaf argues that, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In postulating the inevitability of (heterosexual) Arab violence wherever there is gay and lesbian assertiveness, Massad pre-emptively exonerates the perpetrators – whether individuals or the state – of any wrongdoing. However regrettable their behaviour, those Arabs who react violently to the gay rights campaign are not perceived by Massad as responsible for their actions, but as caught up in a broader struggle against 'imperialism', to which the gay rights movement is wedded.&lt;ref name="Shawaf-D" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== ''Islam in Liberalism'' (2015) ==
''Islam in Liberalism'' is Joseph Massad's fourth book, published by University of Chicago Press in 2015. A review in the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]] states that the thesis of the book is that "American and European missionaries of liberalism are trying to proselytize Muslims — and the entire world writ large — to the only sane system of values that exists on the planet: those of Western liberalism". The book deals with the "instrumentalization of Islam in the West" and responds to critiques of his earlier book ''Desiring Arabs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Political views ==

=== On antisemitism ===

Following arguments made by [[Edward Said]] in his 1978 book [[Orientalism]], Massad asserts that 19th Century European [[antisemitic]] characterizations of Jews have transformed in the present era to target Arabs, while maintaining the same racialist characterizations, and thus, [[racism]] towards Arabs and Muslims today is a form of "Euro-American Christian anti-Semitism and ... Israeli Jewish anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name="MassadSemitesAntiSemites"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Massad|first1=Joseph|title=Semites and anti-Semites, that is the question|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2004/720/op63.htm|accessdate=29 March 2018|work=Al-Ahram Weekly|issue=720|date=9-15 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Massad bases this belief on an understanding of antisemitism as a specific historical phenomenon originating in Europe, rather than simply as hatred of Jews; he writes: "... the claims made by many nowadays that any manifestation of hatred against Jews in any geographic location on Earth and in any historical period is 'anti-Semitism' smack of a gross misunderstanding of the European history of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name="MassadSemitesAntiSemites" /&gt;

=== On Israel and Zionism ===

Massad has characterized Israel as "a [[racist]] Jewish state."&lt;ref name="MassadLegacyOfSartre"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Massad's view, Zionism is not only racist but antisemitic, and antisemitic not only towards Arab Palestinians, but also towards Jews.  Massad writes that after Europeans invented the racialist conception of the "Semite," the Zionist movement "adopted wholesale anti-Semitic ideologies",&lt;ref name="MassadSemitesAntiSemites" /&gt; and describes Zionism as an "anti-Semitic project of destroying Jewish cultures and languages in the diaspora", which has ultimately led to "the transformation of the Jew into the anti-Semite, and the Palestinian into the Jew."&lt;ref name="MassadLegacyOfSartre" /&gt;  Massad further accuses Zionists of unjustly "appropriating the fruit of the land that Palestinian peasants produced," and specifies the renaming of "Palestinian rural salad (now known in New York delis as [[Israeli salad]])" as an example of Israeli "racism."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Massad, "The Persistence of the Palestinian Question,"  in ''Empire &amp; Terror: Nationalism/postnationalism in the New Millennium,''  Begoña Aretxaga, University of Nevada, Reno Center for Basque Studies,  University of Nevada Press, 2005   p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Massad has spoken of genetic links being established between 19th-century European Jews and the ancient [[Israelite]] kingdom and the creation of a "semitic" identity for Jews at that time as actually a European, racist construction designed to portray European Jews as foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwog.net/publicate/index.php?page=post&amp;article_id=3115 The Bwog: Lecture Hop: Right to be Racist edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220181531/http://www.bwog.net/publicate/index.php?page=post&amp;article_id=3115 |date=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Massad considers claims to Israel made by the Zionists movement based on that connection to be "problematic." In a debate with Israeli historian [[Benny Morris]], Massad said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The claim made by the Zionists, and by Professor Morris, that late nineteenth-century European Jews are direct descendants of the ancient Palestinian Hebrews is what is preposterous here. This kind of anti-Semitic claim that European Jews were not European that was propagated by the racist and biological discourses on the nineteenth century, that they somehow descend from first-century Hebrews, despite the fact that they look like other Europeans, that they speak European languages, is what is absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Massad, quoted in Andrew Whitehead, "History on the Line, 'No Common Ground': Joseph Massad and Benny Morris Discuss the Middle East," ''History Workshop Journal'' 53:1 (2002), pp. 214-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== On the United States ===

Massad argues that [[American imperialism|US imperialism]] is ultimately behind Israeli actions.  He has problematized the mainstream criticisms of the [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel Lobby]] by explaining the underlying imperialist affinities that tie Israel and the US together: "the lobby is powerful in the United States because its major claims are about advancing US interests and its support for Israel is contextualised in its support for the overall US strategy in the Middle East."&lt;ref name="MassadIsraelLobby"&gt;{{cite web

Massad views US culture as deeply infected with racism and misogyny, tying the [[Abner Louima]] case to torture in [[Abu Ghraib]], and arguing that in Iraq, "American male sexual prowess, usually reserved for American women, [was] put to military use in imperial conquests", with "Iraqis ... posited.. as women and feminised men to be penetrated by the missiles and bombs ejected from American warplanes."  Massad concludes that "the content of the word 'freedom' that American politicians and propagandists want to impose on the rest of the world is nothing more and nothing less than America's violent domination, racism, torture, sexual humiliation, and the rest of it."&lt;ref name="MassadImperialMementos"&gt;{{cite web

===On the Palestinian Authority===

Massad  refers to the [[Palestinian Authority]] as the "Palestinian Collaborationist Authority," calls [[Mahmoud Abbas]] the "chief Palestinian collaborator," and accuses the PA of collaborating with Israel and the United States to crush Palestinian resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article10110.shtml|title=The Gaza Ghetto Uprising|first=|last=matthew|date=4 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Columbia Unbecoming'' ==

In 2004, a pro-Israel activist organization, the [[David Project]], produced a film, ''Columbia Unbecoming'', interviewing students who claimed that Massad and other Columbia professors had intimidated or been unfair to them for their pro-Israel views.  This eventually sparked the appointment of an Ad Hoc Grievance Committee by the university to investigate the complaints. In response to the film, [[United States Representative]] [[Anthony Weiner]] called on Columbia to fire Massad for what Weiner characterized as "anti-Semitic rantings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ad Hoc Grievance Committee, which concluded its work in April 2005, dismissed most of the allegations against Massad, writing in its report that it had "no basis for believing that Professor Massad systematically suppressed dissenting views in his classroom." and stated that they "found no evidence of any statements made by the faculty that could reasonably be construed as anti-semitic."&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web

In response to the investigation of Massad and other professors by Columbia, Donna Lieberman, executive director of the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]], expressed concern that it would become an inquisition into the political views of professors, and that there was a "political agenda" motivating the complaints. Lieberman previously had met with some of the Columbia students who have made the allegations featured in ''Columbia Unbecoming'' and said in an interview that it was "wrong to accept these allegations at face value".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Gershman [http://www2.nysun.com/article/6826?page_no=2 Civil Liberties Official Defends Columbia Professors.]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The New York Sun''. December 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massad continues to deny the one allegation that the report found "credible." Two students beside his accuser said that they witnessed the incident, but a teaching assistant said on [[WNYC]] in April 2005 that she was present and that Massad did not angrily criticize the student in question; after the release of the report, 20 students signed a letter stating that they were in class on the day of the alleged incident, and that the incident had never happened.&lt;ref name="MEALAC" /&gt;

In an editorial discussing the case one week after the release of the Committee report,&lt;ref name="nytpanel" /&gt; the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that, while it believed Massad had been guilty of inappropriate behavior, it found the controversy overblown and professors such as Massad themselves victimized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no evidence that anyone's grade suffered for challenging the pro-Palestinian views of any teacher or that any professors made anti-Semitic statements. The professors who were targeted have legitimate complaints themselves. Their classes were infiltrated by hecklers and surreptitious monitors, and they received hate mail and death threats. The panel had no mandate to examine the quality and fairness of teaching. That leaves the university to follow up on complaints about politicized courses and a lack of scholarly rigor as part of its effort to upgrade the department.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial.

==Ankori threat of libel suit==

A review by Massad of the book ''Palestinian Art'', written by Israeli art history professor [[Gannit Ankori]], was  threatened  by a [[English defamation law|libel suit in Britain]].&lt;ref name=GoldbergForward&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13747/|title=Neutrals, Caught in the Crossfire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the review, Massad accused Ankori of illegitimately appropriating the work of [[Kamal Boullata]], a Palestinian artist and art historian, a charge which Ankori viewed as defamatory.

The review appeared in [[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]], a publication of the [[College Art Association]] of America, (CAA).  To avoid a libel suit, the CAA agreed to issue an apology to Ms. Ankori, to pay her $75,000.00  and to send a letter to its institutional subscribers, stating that the Massad review "contained factual errors and certain unfounded assertions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/daily/2008/06/3426n.htm|title=Scholarly Association Settles 'Libel Tourism' Case|first=Jennifer|last=Howard|date=18 June 2008|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardChronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/4719/art-association-paid-75000-to-avoid-libel-lawsuit|title=Art Association Paid $75,000 to Avoid Libel Lawsuit|date=22 June 2008|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13627/|title=Art Journal Pays Israeli Scholar $75K After Libel Lawsuit Threat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Massad acknowledged "minor errors", but not libel, and accused the CAA of cowardice.&lt;ref name=HowardChronicle /&gt;  CAA executive director Linda Downs told the ''Forward'' that, while "there were mistakes" in the review, the journal agreed to pay only because it could not afford to fight out the case.&lt;ref name=GoldbergForward /&gt;

[[File:CourtGavel.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Philosopher]]s of law ask "what is law, and what should it be?"]]

'''Jurisprudence''' or '''legal theory''' is the theoretical study of [[law]], principally by [[philosophy of law|philosophers]] but, from the twentieth century, also by [[social science|social scientists]]. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as [[jurist]]s or legal theorists, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of [[Reason#Logical reasoning methods and argumentation|legal reasoning]], [[list of national legal systems|legal systems]], [[Law#Legal institutions|legal institutions]], and the role of law in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisprudence|title=Jurisprudence|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2007-08-06|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the [[natural law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and the [[Public international law|law of nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=Black's law dictionary|year=2009|publisher=West|location=Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|isbn=0-314-19949-7|pages=Jurisprudence entry|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution as law relates to the larger political and social situation in which it exists.&lt;ref name="Shiner"&gt;Shiner, "Philosophy of Law", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

This article distinguishes three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. To begin with, ancient [[#Natural law|natural law]], as a major branch and theory of jurisprudence, is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human-created laws gain whatever force they have.&lt;ref name="Shiner" /&gt; Secondly, 'clarificatory' or [[#Analytic jurisprudence|analytic jurisprudence]] rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"/&gt; It comprises different theories of jurisprudence. For example, ''legal positivism'', holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from some basic social facts.&lt;ref name="Soper_CDoP"&gt;Soper, "Legal Positivism", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; And ''legal realism'' argues that the real world practice of law is what determines what law is; the law has the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers and judges do with it. Thirdly, [[#Normative jurisprudence|normative jurisprudence]] is concerned with "evaluative" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. Besides the question "What is law?", it tries to answer what the proper function of law was, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.

== Etymology ==
The English word is based on the Latin maxim ''jurisprudentia'': ''juris'' is the [[genitive]] form of ''jus'' meaning "law", and ''prudentia'' means "prudence" (also: discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection; refers to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and even caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters). The word is first attested in English in 1628,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition 1989&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the word ''prudence'' had the meaning of "knowledge of or skill in a matter". The word may have come via the French ''jurisprudence'', which is attested earlier.

== History ==
Ancient Indian jurisprudence is available in various [[Dharmaśāstra]] texts starting from the Dharmasutra of Bhodhayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mmak/resent_article/JusticeKatjusLec.pdf|title=ANCIENT INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE|first=Markandey|last=Katju|year=2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence already had this meaning{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in [[Ancient Rome]] even if at its origins the discipline was a (''periti'') in the ''[[Ius|jus]]'' of ''[[mos maiorum]]'' (traditional law), a body of [[oral law]]s and customs verbally transmitted "by father to son". Praetors established a workable body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the edicta, the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offense, or in extraordinary situations, additions made to the edicta. An iudex then would judge a remedy according to the facts of the case.

Their sentences were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs, but effectively it was an activity that, apart from formally reconsidering for each case what precisely was traditionally in the legal habits, soon turned also to a more equitable interpretation, coherently adapting the law to the newer social instances. The law was then implemented with new evolutive ''Institutiones'' (legal concepts), while remaining in the traditional scheme. Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of ''prudentes''. Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], schools of law were created, and the activity constantly became more academic. In the age from the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century, a relevant literature was produced by some notable groups including the Proculians and [[Sabinians]]. The scientific depth of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times.

After the 3rd century, ''Juris prudentia'' became a more bureaucratic activity, with few notable authors. It was during the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (5th century) that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth, and it is from this cultural movement that [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] was born.

=={{Anchor|Natural law}}Natural law==
In its general context, natural law theory may be compared to both state-of-nature law and general law understood on the basis of an analogy to the physical laws of science. Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition.

Another approach to natural law jurisprudence generally asserts that human law may be supported by decisive reasons for action. In other words, there must be a compelling rationale behind following human law. There are two readings of the natural law jurisprudential stance.
# '''The Strong Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it is not properly called a "law" at all. This is captured, imperfectly, in the famous maxim: ''[[Lex iniusta non est lex|lex iniusta non est lex']] (an unjust law is no law at all).'' 
# '''The Weak Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it can still be called a "law", but it must be recognised as a defective law. 
Notions of an objective moral order, external to human legal systems, underlie natural law. What is right or wrong can vary according to the interests one is focused upon. Natural law is sometimes identified with the maxim that "an unjust law is no law at all", but as [[John Finnis]], the most important of modern natural barristers{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} has argued, this maxim is a poor guide to the classical [[Thomism|Thomist]] position. Strongly related to theories of natural law are classical theories of [[justice]], beginning in the West with [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]].

===Aristotle===
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]], by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Like his philosophical forefathers [[Socrates]] and Plato, Aristotle posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαίον φυσικόν'', [[Latin]] ''[[ius naturale]]''). His association with natural law is largely due to the way in which he was interpreted by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, ''Thomism and Aristotelianism''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on Aquinas' conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (= Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages,&lt;ref&gt;H. Rackham, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Loeb Classical Library; J. A. K. Thomson, trans. (revised by Hugh Tedennick), ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; though more recent translations render them more literally.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sachs, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Focus Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Indeed, his treatment of what he calls "political justice" derives from his discussion of "the just" as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices, just like every other virtue he describes.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics" Bk. II ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is. He argues that the term "justice" actually refers to two different but related ideas: general justice and particular justice.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Irwin, trans. ''Nicomachean Ethics, 2nd Ed.'', Hackett Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; When a person's actions are completely virtuous in all matters in relation to others, Aristotle calls them "just" in the sense of "general justice;" as such this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics", Bk. V, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; "Particular" or "partial justice", by contrast, is the part of "general justice" or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice, by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence. Of political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists. But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality, not a system of law, and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law, not the laws themselves. The passage here is silent as to that question.

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of this remark, however, suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was adverse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law," 75–81&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, moreover, considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law suggested in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Law," ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]] was the most influential Western medieval legal [[scholar]]]]
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Thomas Aquinas, [Thomas of Aquin, or Aquino] (c. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian philosopher and theologian in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, known as "Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis". He is the foremost classical proponent of [[natural theology]], and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The work for which he is best known is the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. One of the thirty-five [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian. Consequently, many [[Institutions named after Thomas Aquinas|institutions of learning]] have been named after him.

Aquinas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, natural, human and divine:

* Eternal law refers to divine reason, known only to God. It is God's plan for the universe. Man needs this, for without it he would totally lack direction.
* Natural law is the "participation" in the eternal law by rational human creatures, and is discovered by reason.
* [[Divine law]] is revealed in the scriptures and is God's positive law for mankind.
* [[Human law]] is supported by reason and enacted for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pojman]], ''Ethics'' ([[Belmont, California|Belmont]], [[California|CA]]: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural law, of course, is based on "first principles":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...&amp;nbsp;this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FS/FS094.html#FSQ94A2THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic (natural) human values on which all other human values are based.

===School of Salamanca===
{{Main|School of Salamanca|ius gentium}}
[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was perhaps the first to develop a theory of ''[[ius gentium]]'' (the rights of peoples), and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity. He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to society at the international level, concluding that this scope as well ought to be ruled by just forms respectable of the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice. Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law, which emphasises the seminal text ''De iure belli ac pacis'' by Grotius, and argued for Vitoria and, later, Suárez's importance as forerunners and, potentially, founders of the field.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. James Brown Scott, cited in Cavallar, The Rights of Strangers: theories of international hospitality, the global community, and political justice since Vitoria, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.&lt;ref&gt;Koskenniemi: International Law and raison d'état: Rethinking the Prehistory of International Law in Kingsbury &amp; Strausmann, The Roman Foundations of the Law of Nations, p. 297–339&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Suárez]], regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas, subdivided the concept of ''ius gentium''. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished ''ius inter gentes'' from ''ius intra gentes''. ''Ius inter gentes'' (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although, being positive law, not natural law, was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, ''ius intra gentes'', or civil law, is specific to each nation.

===Thomas Hobbes===
{{Main|Thomas Hobbes}}
In his treatise ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, (1651)]]'', Hobbes expresses a view of natural law as a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved. Hobbes was a [[social contract]]arian&lt;ref&gt;Basically meaning: the people of a society are prepared give up some rights to a government in order to receive social order.&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the law gained peoples' tacit consent. He believed that society was formed from a [[state of nature]] to protect people from the state of war between mankind that exists otherwise. Life is, without an ordered society, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". It is commonly commented that Hobbes' views about the core of human nature were influenced by his times. The [[English Civil War]] and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place, and he felt absolute authority vested in a monarch, whose subjects obeyed the law, was the basis of a civilized society.

===Lon Fuller===
{{Main|Lon L. Fuller}}
Writing after [[World War II]], Lon L. Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law. He notably emphasised that the (natural) law must meet certain formal requirements (such as being impartial and publicly knowable). To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements, Fuller argues, we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law, or to give it our respect. Thus, law has an internal morality that goes beyond the social rules by which valid laws are made.

===John Finnis===
{{Main|John Finnis}}
Sophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other more than the above descriptions might suggest, and they may concede certain points to the other "side". Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree, and the particular influences on the theorist's work. In particular, the older natural lawyers, such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence. But modern natural lawyers, such as John Finnis claim to be positivists, while still arguing that law is a basically moral creature. His book ''[[Natural Law and Natural Rights]]'' (1980, 2011) is a restatement of natural law doctrine.

=={{Anchor|Analytic jurisprudence}}Analytic jurisprudence==
{{Main|Analytic jurisprudence}}

Analytic, or 'clarificatory', jurisprudence means the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"&gt;See H L A Hart, 'Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals' (1958) 71 ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 593&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ Etext] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820100015/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ |date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that people invariably slip between describing that the world ''is'' a certain way to saying therefore we ''ought'' to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ''ought'' to do something merely because something ''is'' the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world ''is'' must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative ''ought'' questions.

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "What are laws?"; "What is ''the'' law?"; "What is the relationship between law and power/sociology?"; and "What is the relationship between law and morality?" Legal positivism is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations.

===Historical School===
Historical jurisprudence came to prominence during the German debate over the proposed codification of German law. In his book ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'' (Abraham A. Hayward trans., 1831)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. The Historicists believe that the law originates with society.

===Sociological Jurisprudence===
{{Main|Sociology of Law}}
The effort to inform jurisprudence systematically with sociological insights developed strongly from the beginning of the twentieth century, as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science, especially in the United States and in continental Europe. In Germany the work of the 'free law' theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, [[Hermann Kantorowicz]] and [[Eugen Ehrlich]]) encouraged the use of sociological insights in judicial development of law and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy of a 'sociological jurisprudence' occurred in the United States, where [[Roscoe Pound]], for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In the United States many later writers followed Pound's lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, [[Julius Stone]] strongly defended and developed Pound's ideas.  In the 1930s a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of Anglophone legal philosophy in the present century it has attracted renewed interest.

===Legal positivism===
{{Main|Legal positivism}}
Positivism simply means that law is something that is "posited": laws are validly made in accordance with socially accepted rules. The positivist view on law can be seen to cover two broad principles: Firstly, that laws may seek to enforce justice, morality, or any other normative end, but their success or failure in doing so does not determine their validity. Provided a law is properly formed, in accordance with the rules recognized in the society concerned, it is a valid law, regardless of whether it is ''just'' by some other standard. Secondly, that law is nothing more than a set of rules to provide order and governance of society. No legal positivist, however, argues that it follows that the law is therefore to be obeyed, no matter what. This is seen as a separate question entirely.
* What the law ''is'' ([[lex lata]]) - is determined by historical social practice (resulting in rules)

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham's]] utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the twentieth century]]
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham|John Austin (legal philosopher)}}
One of the earliest legal positivists was Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept (along with Hume), an avid prison reformer, advocate for [[democracy]], and strong [[atheist]]. Bentham's views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student, [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]. Austin was the first chair of law at the new [[University of London]] from 1829. Austin's [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer to "what is law?" was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref&gt;John Austin, ''The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary legal positivists have long abandoned this view, and have criticised its oversimplification, H. L. A. Hart particularly.

====Hans Kelsen====
{{Main|Hans Kelsen}}
Hans Kelsen is considered one of the prominent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America, although less so in common-law countries. His [[Pure Theory of Law]] aims to describe law as binding norms while at the same time refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, 'legal science' is to be separated from 'legal politics'. Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a 'basic norm ([[Grundnorm]])'—a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the jurist, from which in a hierarchy all 'lower' norms in a [[legal system]], beginning with [[constitutional law]], are understood to derive their authority or 'bindingness'. In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.

====H. L. A. Hart====
{{Main|H. L. A. Hart}}
In the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was [[H. L. A. Hart]], who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules. Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, like law, can not be grounded in non-normative social facts. Hart revived analytical jurisprudence as an important theoretical debate in the twentieth century through his book ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the professor of jurisprudence at [[Oxford University]], Hart argued that law is a 'system of rules'.

Rules, said Hart, are divided into primary rules (rules of conduct) and secondary rules (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). The "rule of recognition" is a customary practice of the officials (especially barristers and judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. A pivotal book on Hart was written by Neil MacCormick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |title=The University of Edinburgh |access-date=24 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601221401/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |archive-date=1 June 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 (second edition due in 2007), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his recently published ''Institutions of Law'', 2007). Other important critiques have included that of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and [[Joseph Raz]].

In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate is within legal positivism. One school is sometimes called ''exclusive legal positivism'', and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness. A second school is labeled ''inclusive legal positivism'', a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow, and it is associated with the view that moral considerations ''may'' determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.

====Joseph Raz====
{{Main|Joseph Raz}}
Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is "no necessary connection" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).

Joseph Raz defends the positivist outlook, but criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. Any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;ch. 2, Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal realism===
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] was a self-styled legal realist]]
{{Main|Legal realism}}
Legal realism was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers. Skeptical in tone, it held that the law should be understood and determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises. It had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by human beings and, thus, is subject to human foibles, frailties and imperfections.

It has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as the main precursor of American Legal Realism (other influences include [[Roscoe Pound]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn|Karl Llewellyn]] and Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]]). Karl Llewellyn, another founder of the U.S. legal realism movement, similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;"Jurisprudence". West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Ed. Jeffrey Lehman, Shirelle
Phelps. Detroit: Thomson/Gale, 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt; The chief inspiration for Scandinavian legal realism many consider to be the works of [[Axel Hägerström]].

Despite its decline in popularity, realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today, including [[critical legal studies]], [[feminist legal theory]], [[critical race theory]], [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295–360''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical legal studies====
[[Critical legal studies]] are a younger theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s. It can be generally traced to American legal realism and is considered "the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective".&lt;ref name = Hunt86&gt;Alan Hunt, "The Theory of Critical Legal Studies," Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1986): 1-45, esp. 1, 5. See [http://ojls.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/1/1.extract]. DOI, 10.1093/ojls/6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that the law is largely contradictory, and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, "Critical Legal Studies", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical rationalism===
[[Karl Popper]] originated the theory of [[Jurisprudence#critical rationalism|critical rationalism]]. According to [[Reinhold Zippelius]] many advances in law and jurisprudence take place by operations of critical rationalism. He writes, "daß die Suche nach dem Begriff des Rechts, nach seinen Bezügen zur Wirklichkeit und nach der Gerechtigkeit experimentierend voranschreitet, indem wir Problemlösungen versuchsweise entwerfen, überprüfen und verbessern" (that we empirically search solutions of problems, which harmonise fair with the reality: by projecting, testing and improving the solutions).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, Rechtsphilosophie, 6. Aufl. 2011 Vorwort.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal interpretivism===
{{Main|Interpretivism (legal)}}

Contemporary philosopher of law [[Ronald Dworkin]] has advocated a more constructivist theory of jurisprudence that can be characterized as a middle path between natural law theories and positivist theories of general jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, "Review of Dworkin and His Critics with Replies by Dworkin", ''Modern Law Review'', vol. 69 no. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'' (1986) [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin attacked [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. He argues that law is an 'interpretive' concept, that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal. It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society. It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that ''no-one'' in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best justification for its practices.

Interpretation, according to Dworkin's ''integrity theory of law'', has two dimensions. To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of ''fit''. Of those interpretations that fit, however, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them ''the best that they can be''. But many writers have doubted whether there ''is'' a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.

===Therapeutic jurisprudence===
{{Main|Therapeutic jurisprudence}}

Consequences from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges)—may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic) to people. [[Therapeutic jurisprudence]] ("TJ") studies law as a social force (or agent) and uses [[social science]] methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects.&lt;ref&gt;David B Wexler, Michael L Perlin, Michel Vols et al. 'Editorial: Current Issues in Therapeutic Jurisprudence' (2016) 16(3) ''QUT Law Review'' pp. 1-3. ISSN: Online- 2201-7275 https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/692/616&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|Normative jurisprudence}}Normative jurisprudence==
{{Main|Political philosophy}}

In addition to the question, "What is law?", legal philosophy is also concerned with normative, or "evaluative" theories of law. What is the goal or purpose of law? What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law? What is the proper function of law? What sorts of acts should be subject to [[sanctions (law)|punishment]], and what sorts of punishment should be permitted? What is justice? What rights do we have? Is there a duty to obey the law? What value has the rule of law? Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are as follows.

===Virtue jurisprudence===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'']]
{{Main|Virtue jurisprudence}}
Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary [[virtue ethics]] emphasize the role of character in morality. Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens. Historically, this approach is associated mainly with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas later. Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.

===Deontology===
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
Deontology is "the theory of duty or moral obligation."&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 378 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin.

===Utilitarianism===
[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] believed law should create happiness]]
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{See also|Lysander Spooner}}
Utilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people possible. Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham's and was the torch bearer for [[Utilitarianism (book)|utilitarian]] philosophy through the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;see, [http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ Utilitarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505231025/http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ |date=5 May 2007 }} at Metalibri Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

===John Rawls===
{{Main|John Rawls|A Theory of Justice}}
John Rawls was an [[United States|American]] philosopher, a [[professor]] of [[political philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] and author of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', ''[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]]'', and ''[[The Law of Peoples]]''. He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. His theory of justice uses a device called the original position to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a 'veil of ignorance.' Imagine we do not know who we are - our race, sex, wealth status, class, or any distinguishing feature - so that we would not be biased in our own favour. Rawls argues from this 'original position' that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone, like freedom of speech, the right to vote and so on. Also, we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic well-being of all society, especially the poorest. This is Rawls's famous 'difference principle'. Justice is fairness, in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position.

There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including critical legal studies and [[libertarian theories of law]].

== Recommendation algorithm and the "Netflix Prize" ==
{{Main|Netflix Prize}}
In 2006, Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system, known as Cinematch, by at least 10%. CEO Hastings did not necessarily expect a lot of quick progress towards the prize,&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation /&gt; "We thought we built the best darn thing ever."&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/31leonhardt.html|title=You Want Innovation? Offer a Prize|date=January 31, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by June 2007, Hastings said the competition is "three-quarters of the way there in three-quarters of a year."&lt;ref name=PCOLNewyorktimes2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/technology/04netflix.html|title=Netflix Prize Still Awaits a Movie Seer|date=June 4, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three teams – an [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] Research Team called BellKor, commendo's team BigChaos, and Pragmatic Theory – combined to win the 2009 grand prize competition for $1 million. The winning team, called BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, used [[machine learning]] techniques to find that, for example, the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw. The mood of the day made a difference also; for example, Friday ratings were different from Monday morning ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/ |title=BelKor Home Page |publisher=AT&amp;T Labs, Inc. – Research |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company's recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns: under the terms of the competition, contestants were given access to customer rental data, which the company had purportedly anonymized. However, it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could, in fact, identify a user personally. Netflix was sued by KamberLaw L.L.C. and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the FTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html | title=Netflix Cancels Contest After Concerns Are Raised About Privacy | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=March 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Throttling of DVDs by mail ==
Netflix's DVD allocation policy – referred to by many as "[[DVD-by-mail#"Throttling"|throttling]]" – gives priority shipping and selection to customers who rent fewer discs per month.

In September 2004, a consumer [[class action lawsuit]], ''Frank Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 Class action suit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205730/http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was brought against Netflix in [[San Francisco Superior Court]]. The suit alleged [[false advertising]] in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery." In January 2005, Netflix changed its [[terms of use]] to acknowledge "throttling" (Mike Kaltschnee, owner of the Hacking Netflix blog, says Netflix calls this practice "smoothing" internally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2005/09/blockbuster_thr.html|title=Blockbuster Throttling|publisher=Hacking Netflix|accessdate=December 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with [[negative option billing|customers being charged accordingly]] unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Trial Lawyers for Public Justice|title=Court Urged To Strike Down Proposed Netflix Class Action Settlement in Deceptive Advertising Case|url=http://www.tlpj.org/pr/netflix_class_action_010506.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms, requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month. The final settlement hearing took place on March 22, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Netflix|title=Netflix Claim Form Process|url=http://www.netflix.com/Settlement?mqso=60178549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal in the California Appellate Courts.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;[http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=1&amp;doc_id=194535 California Appellate Courts] Chavez v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The summary notice and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial ... Using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case ... The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/04/23/attorneys-in-netflix-suit-take-home-2-million-in-fees/ |title=Court Orders Netflix to Deliver $2 million in Attorneys Fees |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Slater |first=Dan |date=April 23, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal Law Blog |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/130003/solutions_for_digital_annoyances.html |title=Solutions for Digital Annoyance |author=Spring, Tom |date=March 27, 2007 |work=PC World |accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Releasing this week ===
The Netflix website at one time featured a list of titles, "Releasing This Week" (RTW), that enabled customers to easily view new DVDs the company planned for rental release each week.&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.netflix.com/AllNewReleases?lnkctr=NavAllNewReleases| title=All DVDs Releasing This Week| publisher=Netflix| accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2007, the company removed the link to the page without notice and replaced it with a slider system showing only four previously released movies at a time. The new page, called "Popular New Releases", does not list newly released DVDs for rental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2007/12/netflix-removes.html| title=Netflix Removes New Releases Page – Customers Complain |publisher=Hacking Netflix |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing of new releases is still active,&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week" /&gt; although there is no menu option that links to the page.

On January 1, 2008, a Netflix employee unofficially stated on the Netflix Community Blog that customers used the RTW page to add newly released movies to the top of their queues, then complained about delays in receiving them after demand outstripped the supply of DVDs on hand. By removing the page, Netflix sought to quell complaints that these movies were not readily available. Critics, however, have suggested this was just another Netflix attempt at throttling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Happy New Year |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2008/01/happy-new-year.html |publisher=Netflix Community Blog |accessdate=March 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamic queue, subscription, and delivery methods ==
On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a [[patent infringement]] lawsuit in which it demanded a [[jury trial]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], alleging that Blockbuster's [[online DVD rental]] subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first [[cause of action]] alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=7024381|y=2006|m=04|d=04|inventor=Hastings; W. Reed (Santa Cruz, CA), Randolph; Marc B.

The company had already closed 290 stores in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2007/06/25/daily54.html Blockbuster to close 282 stores this year – San Francisco Business Times]. Bizjournals.com (June 29, 2007). Retrieved on December 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2006, Blockbuster signed a deal with The Weinstein Company that gave it the exclusive rental rights to the studio's films beginning on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |title=Blockbuster, Weinsteins sign exclusive deal |work= Video Business |publisher= Reed Business Information |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070103065726/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |archivedate= January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement forced Netflix to obtain copies from mass merchants or retailers, instead of directly from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |title=How The Weinstein Company ruined Home Entertainment |author=Sciretta, Peter |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109161945/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix has speculated that the effect of the Blockbuster-Weinstein agreement could result in higher rental costs and/or fewer copies of the studio's movies, which would limit the number of each movie's DVDs that would be available to subscribers at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Annual Report |url=http://ir.netflix.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-07-42689 |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|6}}, Netflix continues to make available Weinstein movies, including ''[[Unknown (2006 film)|Unknown]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School For Scoundrels]]'' and ''[[Harsh Times]]'', among others. The [[first-sale doctrine]] allows Netflix and other video rental businesses to offer movies released by The Weinstein Company.

=== Removal of social networking feature ===
Beginning in 2004, Netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members. This feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of [[social networking]]. With this feature, users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie's page; view what DVDs their friends were renting; and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1583922/netflix-offers-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-a-redesign |title= 5 Ways Netflix Could Have Avoided an Ugly User Backlash |first= Cliff |last= Kuang |date= March 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.betanews.com/article/Netflix-axes-friends-feature-due-to-unpopularity/1268941363 |title= Netflix axes 'friends' feature due to unpopularity |first= Tim |last= Conneally |date= March 18, 2010 |publisher=Betanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, as part of a redesign of its movie-details pages, the Friends feature began to be phased out. Users could no longer see their friends' ratings on movie pages, and what remained of the friends section was moved to a small link at the bottom of each page. The initial announcement about the redesign on Netflix's official blog made no reference to any changes to the Friends feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/new-movie-details-page-rolled-out.html |title= New Movie Details Page Rolled Out |date= March 4, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of angry users posted negative comments, and the feedback prompted Netflix's Vice President of [[Product Management]], Todd Yellin, to post a follow-up statement. While apologizing for poor communication about the changes, Yellin stated that the Friends feature would continue to be phased out, citing figures that only 2% of members used the feature and the company's limited resources to maintain the service.&lt;ref name="fastcompany" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html |title= Friends Update |date= March 17, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix users also began using the movie-reviews section of the website to post comments protesting against the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/03/unhappy-netflix-customers-using-netflix-movie-reviews-to-protest-friends-feature-removal.html |title= Unhappy Netflix Customers using Netflix Movie Reviews to Protest Friends Feature Removal |date= March 14, 2010 |publisher=Hacking Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linux support ==
Netflix formerly supported online streaming only on Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS and Android, relying on Microsoft Silverlight. Partly due to digital rights management issues, despite the open-source implementation of Silverlight known as Moonlight, this has created problems for users of fully [[open-source software|open source]] versions of [[Linux]] and similar operating systems.&lt;ref name=TechRepublic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/the-netflix-linux-conjecture-how-netflix-snubs-the-linux-community/1745|title=The Netflix Linux Conjecture: How Netflix snubs the Linux community |author=Wallen, Jack |date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Google's partially proprietary Android and [[Chrome OS]] platforms are essentially based upon Linux and other free software infrastructure, Netflix did not provide any crossover support for using its proprietary components to stream any of its content upon more free systems, such as Ubuntu and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], although this changed in October 2014.

On August 9, 2011, Netflix released a Google Chrome web store item for Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Windows; however, it did not initially enable Netflix streaming on Linux machines. On Linux systems running the Chrome browser, the extension simply redirects users to view Netflix.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deceagebecbceejblnlcjooeohmmeldh?hl=en-US&amp;hc=hp&amp;hcp=new|title= Netflix – Chrome Web Store}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Netflix chose to switch from Silverlight to HTML5 playback using [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] (EME), since then, the extensions were added to Microsoft's Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1 and Apple's Safari on OS X Yosemite.&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/html5-video-in-ie-11-on-windows-81.html|title=The Netflix Tech Blog: HTML5 Video in IE 11 on Windows 8.1|work=netflix.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com" /&gt; It was implemented in Google Chrome on all platforms shortly afterward.

As of October 10, 2014 multiple versions of Linux including Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS claim support for Netflix in Google Chrome version 37 or newer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://insights.ubuntu.com/2014/10/10/watch-netflix-in-ubuntu-today/ |title=Watch Netflix in Ubuntu today |publisher=Ubuntu |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pclinuxos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pclinuxos.com/netflix-streaming-comes-to-chrome-for-pclinuxos/|title=Netflix streaming comes to PCLinuxOS » PCLinuxOS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website for PCWorld also states that users of other Linux distributions such as version 17 of [[Linux Mint]] have been successfully using Netflix via Google Chrome without any special workarounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2824623/ubuntu-linux-gets-netflix-without-weird-workarounds.html|title=Netflix comes to Linux via Ubuntu and Chrome|author=Jared Newman|date=October 10, 2014|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party solutions ===
{{As of|2011|5|9|df=US}}, Google had initially released plans for a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for the Chrome browser and Chrome OS which would allow Netflix streaming, including traditional Linux users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechromesource.com/netflix-plug-in-for-chrome-and-chrome-os-is-on-the-way/|title= Netflix Plug-in for Chrome and Chrome OS is on the way |author=West, Jullian|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2012, patches to the Wine compatibility layer to make viewing of Netflix on Linux and similar systems were made available.&lt;ref name="iheartubuntuannounce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |title=Netflix on Ubuntu Is Here |work=iheartubuntu.com |date=November 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=iheartubuntu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308111726/http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix, 600 Fed. Appx. 508 (Ct. App. Ninth Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Netflix increased the number of programs that are closed captioned. Almost all Netflix-ready devices in distribution today (including AppleTV, BD players, the Roku set-top box, and all the [[game console]]s, phone apps, tablet apps, and TVs) are capable of rendering captions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Blog.Netflix.com |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2012/02/update-on-captioning-for-our-members.html |date=February 2012|title=An Update on Captioning for our Members|accessdate= March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Netflix formed an experimental project to [[crowdsourcing|crowdsource]] the closed-captioning effort using the Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) platform.&lt;ref name=amara1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/netflix-amara-closed-captions-crowdsourcing/|title=Netflix experiments with crowd-sourced captioning|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=[[GigaOM]]|last=Roettgers|first=Janko}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this proved problematic in the face of claims that crowdsourced subtitles, regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations, are [[derivative work]]s which [[copyright infringement|infringe copyright]] if created or distributed without consent from the film's copyright owner.&lt;ref name=amara2&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444592404578033301429532328| title=Lost in Translation, Found in Subtitles| last=Paletta| first=Anthony| date=October 3, 2012| accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amara operates under [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] safe-harbor provisions which indemnify it from secondary copyright infringement [[lawsuit]]s over user-uploaded content, and presumably Netflix would not publish any subtitles produced by this effort without authorization. Netflix was careful to say it is not committed to using any subtitles produced by the crowdsourcing project.&lt;ref name=amara1 /&gt;

In October 2012, Netflix was found to be offering the television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' to customers in [[Finland]] with unauthorized subtitles from the [[fansub]] scene.&lt;ref name=tfOct19&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-caught-using-pirated-subtitles-in-finland-121019/|title=Netflix Caught Using "Pirated" Subtitles in Finland|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such subtitles, and motion pictures incorporating them, have long been traded online, resulting in [[cease and desist]] notices, [[notice and take down|takedowns]], and copyright infringement lawsuits against traders, website operators, and search engines; even criminal prosecution happened in one Norwegian case involving the distribution of fan-created subtitles alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/student-fined-for-running-movie-tv-show-subtitle-download-site-120608/|title=Student Fined For Running Movie &amp; TV Show Subtitle Download Site|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|author=Enigmax|publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted, Netflix apologized and promised to remove the unauthorized translations but did not explain how the content came to be offered in the first place, or whether other potentially copyright-infringing subtitles exist in the company's repertoire.&lt;ref name=tfOct19 /&gt;

On January 20, 2014, Jon Christian published an article in ''The Week'', titled "How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions", which catalogues Netflix's various technical and legal issues regarding closed captioning, including the poor quality of the subtitles that are provided. For example, he states: "But for all the service's strengths, one aspect is still decidedly twentieth century: The bizarrely low standards for Netflix's closed captions, which continue to alienate subscribers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or simply have difficulty understanding dialogue." The article was updated the following day to publish Netflix's response: "Update: The day after this article was published, a representative from Netflix contacted the author of this piece with an additional comment: 'While we don't have the rights to make edits to subs/captions we do, in fact, request redelivery of subtitles or captions when we discover errors. The titles in your piece are now under investigation.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Week|title=How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions| date=January 20, 2014| url=http://theweek.com/article/index/255618/how-netflix-alienated-and-insulted-its-deaf-subscribers |author=Christian, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' in 2015, disability rights advocates pointed out that Netflix had not yet included content with [[described video|audio descriptions]] of visual content for those who are blind or visually impaired. One critic considered it "terribly laughable PR" for Netflix to not include audio descriptions on a series that focuses on a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|character]] who himself is blind. On April 14, 2015, director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix would begin to work with studios to add audio descriptions to its original content.&lt;ref name=wp-blindsuperhero&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix makes a blind superhero accessible to blind audiences|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/04/14/netflix-makes-a-blind-superhero-accessible-to-blind-viewers/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-descriptions&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Adding Audio Description Tracks for Visually Impaired, Starting with 'Marvel's Daredevil'|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-adding-audio-description-tracks-for-visually-impaired-starting-with-marvels-daredevil-1201472372/|website=Variety|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circumvention of geoblocking ==
More than 30 million Netflix subscribers use the service via a [[proxy server]] or [[virtual private network]] (VPN); doing so can make a user appear to be located in a country other than the one they are actually in, thus allowing them to use the service to access content that Netflix [[Geo-blocking|cannot offer in their region]], due to geographical licensing restrictions. It is unclear whether accessing geo-blocked content via VPN violates local copyright laws, but content providers and other broadcasters have asserted that it is illegal because it infringes local rights to content that may have been sold to a competitor.&lt;ref name=telcoreviewnz-globalblock&gt;{{cite web|title=Global mode spat: We've got the legal paperwork|url=http://telcoreview.co.nz/story/Global-mode-spat-weve-got-the-legal-paperwork/|website=TelcoReview|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode /&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-globalmodelegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Mode "completely legal" as CallPlus dismisses industry backlash|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/572164/global-mode-completely-legal-callplus-dismisses-industry-backlash/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-riftcourt&gt;{{cite web|title=Streaming TV rift heads to court in New Zealand|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/573022/streaming-tv-rift-heads-court-new-zealand/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobalWebIndex showed about 20 million of such VPN users came from China alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/09/why-netflix-wont-block-vpn-users |title=Why Netflix won't block VPN users – it has too many of them, Part II |last=Hern |first=Alex |publisher=The Guardian|date=24 June 2015 |website=The Guardian |access-date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn /&gt; As of November 2013, Canadian Netflix offered 3,600 titles compared to the U.S. service which had more than 10,000 which results in Canadians using VPNs so they can access the larger U.S. content selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/13/netflix-canada-vs-us_n_4435459.html|title=Netflix Canada vs. Netflix USA: Why Do We Get The Shaft?|first=Michael|last=Bolen|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2013-12-13|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a leaked e-mail revealed by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]] in 2014, [[Sony Pictures Television]]'s president of international distribution, Keith LeGoy, described VPN usage of Netflix as being "semi-sanctioned" [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and he criticized the company for not taking further steps to detect these users and restrict their access to content Netflix had not licensed for their region.&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand ISPs may be sued for letting users bypass geoblocks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/new-zealand-internet-service-providers-face-legal-action-over-copyright-breach|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Pictures mad at Netflix's failure to block overseas VPN users|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/sony-pictures-mad-at-netflixs-failure-to-block-overseas-vpn-users/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on January 14, 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to restrict access to unlicensed material, by viewers using VPNs or proxies.&lt;ref name=verge-netflixproxy&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix says it will do more to stop customers from bypassing country restrictions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/14/10767982/netflix-blocking-proxies-vpn-country-restrictions|website=The Verge|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other controversies ==
=== Price increase lawsuit ===
A lawsuit was filed agented Netflix in 2016 by George Keritsis. The suit alleged that Netflix broke the contract it made with millions of customers who have "grandfathered" subscription plans with price guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-user-lawsuit-class-action-rate-hike-1201807561/|title=Netflix User Sues Over Rate Hike, Claiming Breach of Contract|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-07-01|work=Variety|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit over Fox contracts ===

=== Firing of Jonathan Friedland ===
On June 2018, Netflix [[Chief Communications Officer|CCO]] Jonathan Friedland was fired for saying the word [[nigger]] during a company meeting about offensive words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17495364/netflix-pr-chief-jonathan-friedland-fired-n-word-racial-slur|title=Netflix PR chief fired for repeatedly using the n-word|first=Nick|last=Statt|publisher=The Verge|date=2018-06-22|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memo released by Reed Hastings, which stated that he should have used a [[euphemism]], mentioned that Friedland said the word again during a follow-up meeting with [[human resources]].

'''Leon Levy''' (September 13, 1925 – April 6, 2003)&lt;ref name=NYTMartin&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/obituaries/08LEVY.html Douglas Martin, "Leon Levy, Philanthropist, Dies at 77", ''The New York Times''], April 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American investor, [[Mutual fund|mutual fund manager]], and philanthropist.

==Early life and education==
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;Silbiger, Steve [https://books.google.com/books?id=2CAGE9yJcm8C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=leon%20levy&amp;f=false The Jewish Phenomenon: Seven Keys to the Enduring Wealth of a People] p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Levy attended [[Townsend Harris High School]] and studied psychology at [[City College of New York]]. After serving in the [[U.S. Army]], he began working as a research analyst. He was strongly influenced in his business approach by his father, Jerome Levy, an economist and business executive who emphasized the role corporate profits play in charting the economy's direction.&lt;ref name=NYTMartin /&gt;

== Investment career ==
In 1956 he became a partner of [[Oppenheimer Holdings|Oppenheimer &amp; Co.]] Inc, then in 1959 Levy co-founded the Oppenheimer [[mutual funds]]. There he started dozens of mutual funds that, at his death, had grown to manage more than $120 billion. In 1982, he sold both companies to the U.K.'s Mercantile House for $162 million and co-founded Odyssey Partners, a private investment partnership. It grew to be a $3 billion hedge fund before it was dissolved in 1997.

== Investment philosophy ==
Levy's financial philosophy stressed common sense and the psychology of investors.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
In 1986, to honor his father, he founded the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, now the [[Levy Economics Institute|Levy Institute]], at [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levyinstitute.org/about/ About the Levy Economics Institute.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Levy Institute has established itself as a sponsor of extensive work in [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] and [[post-Keynesian economics]]. In the last year of his life, Levy commuted up the [[Hudson River]] from New York City to teach a class at the Levy Institute, "Contemporary Developments in Finance", in which he focused on his belief that investing is as much a psychological as it is an economic act.

When he died in his late seventies, Levy was estimated to be worth a billion dollars, though his personal wealth might have been substantially higher were it not for his philanthropic interests.

Levy's philanthropy began in the 1950s, when he established the Jerome Levy Foundation, which still exists, giving grants to human rights and land preservation organizations. His donations grew steadily, and during his lifetime, Levy and his wife, Shelby White, gave away more than $200 million, becoming well known for their philanthropic efforts. They donated $20 million to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] for the construction of the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/arts/design/10coll.html?pagewanted=all Hugh Eakin and Randy Kennedy, "Doubts on Donors' Collection Cloud Met Antiquities Project",] ''The New York Times'', December 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; a gallery hosting the largest selection of [[Hellenistic]] and [[Roman art|Roman]] artwork ever exhibited at that museum. The gallery included a number of pieces from Levy and White's substantial art collection, which also includes art from the [[Near East]]. Between 1997 and 2003, Levy and White donated nearly $5 million to 107 scholars for the publication of archaeological excavations that had been completed but never published. The projects funded by their program, the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, include excavations at some of the highest profile archaeological sites throughout [[Greece]] and the [[Middle East]], including [[Knossos]], [[Aphrodisias]], [[Kition]], [[Ras Shamra]], [[Sarepta]], [[Mt. Gerizim]], [[Ekron]], [[Lachish]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Pella]], [[Jerash]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], [[Assur]], [[Nineveh]], [[Nuzi]], and [[Tepe Hissar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/grantees.html Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922000854/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/grantees.html |date=2012-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also funded the Leon Levy Excavation at [[Ashkelon]], [[Israel]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://digashkelon.com/expedition/ The Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon.]&lt;/ref&gt; created the Leon Levy Visitor Center at the [[New York Botanical Garden]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybg.org/press_releases/visitor_center_release.pdf "Leon Levy Visitor Center, Dramatic New Gateway to Garden, Opens to Public May 1, 2004".] Press release, April 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and financed the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind Brain and Behavior at [[Rockefeller University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2008/03/25/4-5-million-grant-funds-interdisciplinary-fellowships-at-rockefeller/ "$4.5 million grant funds interdisciplinary fellowships at Rockefeller", The Rockefeller University.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708021704/http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2008/03/25/4-5-million-grant-funds-interdisciplinary-fellowships-at-rockefeller/ |date=2012-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Levy was a member of the Board. Levy also served as President of the Board of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Vice Chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at [[New York University]], and was a director of [[Bard College]], and many other not-for-profit boards.

The Leon Levy Foundation and Shelby White, as Chairman of the Friends of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], provided the funds for conserving the extraordinarily well-preserved [[Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center|Lod Mosaic]] and established the Shelby White and Leon Levy Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center, which will house the mosaic once it returns from its 2010-2016 international exhibition tour.&lt;ref name="mfa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-07-01 |url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early+History+-+Archaeology/Lod_mosaic_to_be_re-exposed_1-Jul-2009.htm |title= Lod mosaic to be re-exposed |work= [[Cabinet of Israel|Government of Israel]] website |publisher= [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)]] |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lodmosaic.org/schedule.html |title=The Lod Mosaic: Exhibition Schedule, accessed 9 April, 2016 |access-date=2016-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409161134/http://www.lodmosaic.org/schedule.html |archive-date=2016-04-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations.

After his death in 2003, Levy’s philanthropy was continued through the [[Leon Levy Foundation]], and one of its earliest initiatives was the fulfillment of that plan. In spring, 2006, the Leon Levy Foundation pledged $200 million to New York University for the creation of the [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]], a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, intended to cultivate cross-cultural study of the ancient world, from the western [[Mediterranean]] to [[China]].

===Antiquities controversy===
The donation created controversy among some academics who believe that collectors of antiquities encourage the looting of ancient sites. In their 2006 book ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities &amp;ndash; From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'', [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and Cecelia Todeschini lay out the dynamics of the illegal trade in [[antiquities]] and use Leon Levy and Shelby White as an example of collectors whose purchases may have led to unethical dealing in artifacts.

One [[NYU]] professor, Randall White, resigned from NYU’s existing Center for Ancient Studies &amp;ndash; which is independent of the new [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]] &amp;ndash; saying that he opposed the acceptance of a donation from a foundation whose benefactor had sometimes been associated with such questionable practices and trafficking. Several scholars outside NYU, notably from [[Bryn Mawr College]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Cincinnati]], also commented negatively on NYU's acceptance of the gift. Many other scholars, however, supported the institute and the gift. Professor James McCredie, of the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU's graduate teaching and advanced research center for art history, wrote a letter to Provost David McLaughlin endorsing the project. It was signed by IFA's seven professors of ancient art and architecture, and the controversy soon died out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elginism.com/similar-cases/academic-backlash-against-leon-levy-foundation/20060401/379/ | title=Academic backlash against Leon Levy foundation donation | publisher=Elginism |work=Science, 31 Mar 2006: Vol. 311, Issue 5769 | date=April 1, 2006 | accessdate=September 28, 2016 | author=[[Michael Balter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pogrebin, Robin]] (April 1, 2002) [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/01gift.html?pagewanted=all "$200 Million Gift Prompts a Debate Over Antiquities"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and awards ==
In 2008, he was inducted into [[Institutional investor|Institutional Investors Alpha]]'s Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with [[David F. Swensen|David Swensen]], [[Louis Bacon]], [[Steven A. Cohen|Steven Cohen]], [[Kenneth C. Griffin|Kenneth Griffin]], [[Paul Tudor Jones]], [[George Soros]], [[Michael Steinhardt]], [[Jack Nash (businessman)|Jack Nash]], [[James Harris Simons|James Simmons]], [[Alfred Winslow Jones|Alfred Jones]], [[Seth Klarman]], [[Julian Robertson|Julian Roberston]], and [[Bruce Kovner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.institutionalinvestorsalpha.com/article/3259269/research-and-rankings/the-alpha-hedge-fund-hall-of-fame.html|title=The Alpha Hedge Fund Hall of Fame {{!}} Institutional Investor's Alpha|website=www.institutionalinvestorsalpha.com|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and works==
In 2002, Levy published a memoir, written with Eugene Linden, called ''The Mind of Wall Street: A Legendary Financier on the Perils of Greed and the Mysteries of the Market'' (Perseus Book Group).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Wall-Street-Alan-Abelson/dp/1587991764 ''The Mind of Wall Street '' at Amazon.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Melody at Hand''''' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist [[India Cruse-Griffin]] located on the [[Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital|Eskenazi Health]] campus, near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], and is part of the [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection]].

== Description ==
''Melody at Hand'' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist India Cruse-Griffin, which depicts a woman in a yellow dress playing a guitar, an open book lying nearby.  Behind her, a fence separates her from rich green landscape and white houses. The work, which measures 37.25" x 49.25", framed, is made from collaged paper gathered from magazines, upon which Cruse-Griffin then paints, often allowing the underlying magazine paper to show through.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/melody-hand|title=Melody at Hand {{!}} Public Art Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publicartarchive.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiacg.wix.com/artist#!artist-spotlight|title=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST {{!}} Wix.com|work=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her subjects are often clear and straightforward, this collage technique serves as a reminder of the accumulation of lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2536">'''Political dissent''' refers to any expression designed to convey dissatisfaction with or opposition to the policies of a governing body. Such expression may take forms from vocal disagreement to [[civil disobedience]] to the use of [[violence]]. In most democratic countries, non-violent demonstration and disagreement with the government are regarded as fundamental human rights.&lt;ref name="NCAC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncac.org/issue/political-dissent |title=Political dissent |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[National Coalition Against Censorship]] |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[Political repression|repressive]] governments have sought to punish political dissent. The protection of freedoms that facilitate peaceful dissent has become a hallmark of free and [[Open society|open societies]]. Repression of political dissent is considered as an attempt to stifle public discourse about government lies, corruption, or ineptitude.&lt;ref name="NCAC" /&gt;

A report on the [[World Socialist Web Site]] from 2013 lists several cases of oppression of political dissent in the [[United States]]. For example, a high school student was arrested and charged under "terrorism" laws for posting lyrics on [[facebook]] that make references to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/05/14/pers-m14.html |title=The criminalization of political dissent in America |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=14 May 2013 |website=[[World Socialist Web Site]] |publisher= |access-date=6 July 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious alienation''' is a term some use to describe how religion creates an impediment to human self-understanding.

== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ==
Although the roots of alienation lie far back in the [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], the concept of alienation first gained prominence in the philosophy of [[Hegel]], and particularly in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in his earlier works, but it is not until the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) that alienation occupies a central place in his writings.

In the opening sections of the ''Phenomenology'', Hegel attacked the views of [[common sense]] and simplified [[natural science]] that the world consisted of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness. Truth, for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was stripped of any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately, Hegel considered that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with the ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was their truth. The supposed [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of the world of nature was in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover, behind these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view everything as a facet of his own [[self-consciousness]]. The same principle applied to the world of culture in which such spheres as art and religion, if viewed as independent of man, constituted so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the final understanding and recapitulation which was [[Absolute Knowledge]].

== Bruno Bauer ==
Hegel had created a system; and all his followers believed that it was the final one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular problems, they conceived his system to be ambivalent. The fact that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be overcome, led them to put the emphasis on the concepts of [[dialectic]] and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they challenged, first in religion and then in politics, his view that the problem of alienation had, at least in principle, been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of Hegel, [[Bruno Bauer]], applied the concept of alienation to the religious field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=bauer |title=Bruno Bauer |last=Moggach |first=Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer, who lectured in [[theology]] and made his name as a [[Gospel]] critic, considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity, caused a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this consciousness as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards the essence of self-consciousness that had become estranged from itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the use of the expression "self-alienation" that soon became current among the [[Young Hegelians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons| editors = Philip  Wiener (ed.)| last = McLellan| first = David| author-link = David McLellan (academic)| title = ALIENATION IN HEGEL AND MARX| encyclopedia = The Dictionary of the History of Ideas| location = New York| accessdate = 2009-09-28| year = 1973| url = http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907110351/http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| archivedate = 2009-09-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ludwig Feuerbach ==
For [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] (''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841)), people alienate their essential being by attributing their human qualities to a god who is then worshipped on account of these qualities. In worshipping god, therefore, people are unconsciously worshipping themselves. Thus Feuerbach argues that religion is a form of alienation which prevents people from attaining realisation of their own species-being. Feuerbach’s thinking has been described as [[Christian humanism|humanist]] in that his theory of alienation is based on a theory of human nature as [[species-being]], as innate to the human species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/education/alienation.html Worldsocialism.org Alienation study case]&lt;/ref&gt; This position would later be examined by [[Karl Marx]] in his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".

:Romantic writers were far better read in medicine than we tend to remember: Byron consulted popular health manuals by Adair and Solomon; Coleridge read deeply in his physician, James Gillman's, library; Percy Shelley ordered Spallanzani's complete works and immersed himself in the vitalist controversy, while Mary Shelley read Gall and Spurzheim; Blake engraved plates for medical literature published by Joseph Johnson; and Keats, of course, was trained as a physician.&lt;ref name="Romanticism and Sexuality"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sha|first=Richard C.|title=Romanticism and Sexuality|journal=Romanticism on the Net|date=August 2001|volume=23|doi=10.7202/005994ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{whose quote|numerous other quotes in this article also need in-article attribution}}

The impetus for Romantic ideas in medicine came from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and more specifically Scotland - John Hunter (1728–93) - and the idea of life as a principle not reducible to material constructs, and John Brown (1735–88), founder of the [[Brunonian system of medicine]] (''see also'', [[Romanticism in Scotland#Science]]). The nexus for Romantic Medicine was Germany, largely nurtured and guided by German natural scientific inquiries regarding the vital aspects of nature, such as that of [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] (1752–1840) and his influential ideas regarding a life principle (''Bildungstrieb''), a formative drive (''nisus formatives'') as well as a philosophical tradition that emphasized the dynamic aspects of man and nature, and their essential relationship as part of a unity - [[German idealism]] and ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' - all guided by Immanuel Kant's (1724–1804) challenge calling for critical inquiry as the basis for science.

The essence of romantic medicine was to overcome the deep crisis that Western medicine found itself in during the latter half of the 1700s by means of a science of life (pathology and physiology grounded in history) that went beyond the simple application of the method of the inertial sciences (physics and chemistry, grounded in mathematics) that had worked so well for inert nature, but was found wanting when applied to vital nature, but also a science of life that went beyond the idea of medicine as a subjective art largely to be left to individual practice. The ''Zeitgeist'' of Romantic medicine sought to unite the uneasy partnership of material natural science and subjective clinical practice to create a true scientific foundation for Western medicine (see also [[Romanticism and epistemology]])

== The question of life ==
The issue of life – what ''is'' life? – or the scientific inquiry and quest (''questio'') regarding vital nature was one that increasingly drew the attention of philosophers and scientists in the 1700s, following the great advances concerning the laws and principles of inert nature - the Copernican, Galilean and Newtonian revolutions in celestial and earthly mechanics - astronomy and physics. With great confidence and optimism, philosophy and science turned to the mystery of life, or rather, that of health - how to restore and maintain it. Those most immediately drawn to this field were those who had some concern with health issues, physicians in particular. Thus, a natural alliance formed between natural philosophy and science on the one hand and medicine on the other. What they had in common was to advance the discipline of the study of living functions or physiology.

== Irritability ==
Because of the influence of the inertial sciences and the success of the method used to gain knowledge of the laws and principles applying to inert nature, the initial approach was to apply the same method to vital nature. What emerged from this was the extensive study in the first part of the 1700s of ‘irritability’, this being based on the central nervous system and involving physical forces such as electricity and magnetism. However, the mechanico-material explanation was not fruitful when it came to actually dealing with life in the case of healthcare practitioners. Albrecht Von Haller's (1708–77) [[Hallerian physiology|'irritability' hypothesis]] and its failure adequately to explain the phenomenon of life, as well as the waning capacity of the Western mentality to participate living nature that lay at the root of the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] [[Humorism|system of humours]] (or noetic capacities), led to a split between those who clung to the ancient tradition, but in name only (becoming routinists or empiricists), and those, largely in the universities, who sought a (material-mechanical) scientific basis regarding life and medicine. This split led to a widely acknowledged crisis in Western ‘medicine’ in the latter half of the 1700s.

:That medicine c. 1800 was caught in the throes of a foundational crisis is testified to by numerous sources and above all by the documented collective striving of all leading European countries to totally reform medicine. No later than the 1780s – as the sources clearly show – were the leading doctors aware of the critical situation.&lt;ref name=Nelly /&gt;

== Romantic medicine and dynamics ==
The attempt on the part of philosophers and scientists to come to grips with the question of ''life'' led to an emphasis away from mechanics or statics, to dynamics. Life was action, living movement, a manifestation of an underlying polarity in nature and the universe. Instead of seeing nature from a ‘one-eyed, color blind’ spectator perspective, what was needed was a perspective that was binocular and participative. Inertial science had advanced in man's understanding of inert nature, her outer form or shell, what Francis Bacon termed ''natura naturata'' (outer form or appearance).  However, it was not capable of going beyond this to a more dynamic discernment or apperception of the living inner content of nature, the domain of life – life in general, not just ''life biological'' as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, at the philosophic core of the scientific effort to penetrate to natura naturans, put it, asking further “what is not life?” based on the understanding of life as a dynamic polarity between powers, forces and energies. As one observer wrote "Die eigentliche Lebenslehre der Romantik aber war: Polarität." But as he promptly adds: "Sie klingt uns überall entgegen, nicht nur in der Naturphilosophie."&lt;ref name=Hirschfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirschfeld|first=E.|title=Romantische Medizin.

=== The foundations ===
=== Bacon's ''Novum Organum'' ===
The groundwork for this intensive search to understand life was laid down by [[Francis Bacon]], who sought to sweep clean the Augean stables of late medieval Scholasticism, with its increasingly obtuse and confused attempts to approach ''natura naturans'' (nature becoming or 'naturing') using the old Greek noetic capacity, already long lost to the Western mind and having gone underground into the arts, but also the nominalist straying into abstractions and refractions in their study of ''natura naturata'' via secondary phenomena as in Newton's study of color (cf. [[Goethe|Goethe's]] ''Farbenlehre'' or Study of Color). Neither the Realists nor the Nominalists of late medieval [[scholasticism]] could handle the task before them, and Bacon sought, at the start of the Age of Science, to provide a method to approach nature's outer form rationally, but by means of a conscious use of man's higher faculty in the form of the ‘forethoughtful inquiry’ (‘lux siccum’), that is, an inquiry that brought a particular idea, itself evinced through the mind and the domain of true philosophy, namely, the "mind’s self-experience in the act of thinking" (Coleridge's ''Biographia Literaria''), or epistemology. The Baconian approach was further developed by C.S. Peirce who made a distinction between induction and abduction: the latter being the method of discovering hypotheses, the former that of testing them.&lt;ref name="Peirce article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burks|first=Arthur W.|title=Peirce's Theory of Abduction|journal=Philosophy of Science|date=October 1946|volume=13|issue=4|pages=301–306|jstor=185210| doi = 10.1086/286904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coleridge and the role of philosophy ===
Bacon's work provided what Coleridge termed ‘method’ – the derivation of laws or ideas to guide the mind (''mens'') in its observation of nature, out of which emerges understanding (concepts) and principles (reason). It is also the task of philosophy, as Coleridge emphasized, to "settle the nomenclature," as the key to science is terminology where one term is not synonymous with something else, as is the case in demotic language, but instead the term discloses its meaning and increases understanding and knowledge. This was further developed by Heidegger and phenomenology (such as with the term ''Veranlassung'').&lt;ref name=Heidegger&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojcewicz|first=Richard|title=The Gods and Technology: A Reading of Heidegger|year=2006|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany, New York|isbn=0-7914-6642-6}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek philosophy (love of wisdom or ''sophia'') later emerged as philology (love of the Logos) to interpret philosophical works. It is this penetration of nature using both the eductive (as opposed to the projective) arts (innate wisdom) and (Logos-backed) sciences to achieve a rational, conscious understanding of nature, both outer form and inner essence that those who became part of the Romantic movement in England and Germany in particular, were seeking. It is not surprising that Romanticism, a scientific endeavor and quest, involved the cultural sciences or humanities (epistemology, philology, literature, poetry, music, etc.), as well as the natural sciences.

=== Search for method for vital nature ===
Romanticism rejected the application of the method that had worked so well for inert nature to the realm of living nature, or life biological. While living organisms contained a degree of a mineral, material nature amenable to being approached via the laws of material physics and chemistry, life itself could not thereby be satisfactorily explained. On the one side, the material scientists sought a solution in reducing the non-material or metaphysical to ‘just’ a manifestation of the material, essentially thereby ignoring that this did not at all account for life. On the other side, a part of the ‘Old School’, drawing from the Hippocratic humoral theory (involving non-mechanical, etheric concepts), sought to emphasize the non-physical or vital aspect of nature, which somehow existed above and outside of nature and directed its activities. The Romantic scientists and philosophers rejected both reductionist mechano-materialism (material natural science) and conflationist mystical-idealism ([[vitalism]]).

=== Locke, Fichte and German Idealism ===
Romanticism also involved a fundamental understanding of functional polarities as the basis for and essence of life as Idea, Law and Principle. One of these polarities in cultural history involved the seminal influence of the English genius and the germinal or gestational genius of German-language culture. Coleridge mentions this in his ''Essays on Method'', and the theme is explored in D.E. Faulkner-Jones' The English Spirit.&lt;ref name="English Spirit"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faulkner-Jones|first=D.E.|title=The English Spirit|origyear=1935|year=1982|publisher=Rudolf Steiner Press|isbn=978-0-85440-389-9}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seminal ideas came from Francis Bacon regarding scientific method and from [[John Locke]] regarding the ideas of self-consciousness and mind. Locke set up a relationship between mind (subject) and outer world (object) wherein the mind is set in motion by objects producing sensations but also has an internal activity of its own (reflection) that acts on the sensations to create perception and conceptions. For Locke, the activity of mind is paramount, as for Bacon, and it is only through the activity of mind (consciousness) that the outer world can be ‘realized’ as causative and as actual. Identity for Locke lay in the capacity for the ‘I’ (consciousness) to unite disparate ‘deeds’ or actions of nature (as cognized by the mind), into a meaningful unity. For Locke, identity of self exists in nothing other than participation in life (the etheric) by means of fluctuating particles of matter rendered meaningful and real by acts of the mind and consciousness.&lt;ref name=Nelly&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsouyopoulos|first=Nelly|title=Andreas Röschlaub und die Romantische Medizin|journal=Medicin in Geschichte und Kultur|year=1982|volume=14|pages=259|editor1-first=Rothschuh|editor1-last=K.E.|publisher=Fischer|location=Stuttgart/New York|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantics, as Locke, refused to accept the view that life is a product of “the chance whirlings of unproductive particles” (Coleridge).

Locke's ideas were taken up by [[Johann Fichte]] in Germany and developed into a philosophy of nature and natural science based on mind and consciousness, which he termed ''[[Gnosology|Wissenschaftslehre]]''. Fichte, as so many of that time, was also inspired to challenge Kant's views on human freedom (constraints by material forces) and the limits to cognition, and sought this in Locke's emphasis on the mind and consciousness as the pivotal actor and creator of reality. For Fichte, selfhood (''Ichheit'') is an act not a thing or a substance, and being or identity consists in the acts of mind and self-consciousness, such that being and identity are co-operant. Fichte's work heavily influenced German philosophy and science, leading to a general system of thought known as German Idealism (including Schelling and Hegel), though this idealism would either end paradoxically in accepting the methods of material science for natural science (''Naturphilosophie'' – Schelling), or in academic and lifeless dialectics (Hegel) that negate life rather than support it and used for political ends (Marxism).

=== The Idea of the living principle ===
Prior to Fichte's writings, the idea of life as a power and principle independent of and not reducible to matter or substance had been put forward in England and Scotland in the mid-1700s, by the philosopher, [[Thomas Reid]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)]], a highly influential anatomist and surgeon as well as an observational scientist in the true Baconian tradition. Hunter rested the idea of the life principle on solid observation of nature. For him, anatomy and structure, matter and form were simply outer expressions of a vital dynamics.&lt;ref name="Britannica 1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hunter, John 
|volume=13 |page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea found a receptive soil in German philosophy and eclectic medicine, as represented by [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland|Christoph Hufeland]] (1762–1836), which had developed the concept of a life force or energy (''Lebenskraft'')&lt;ref name=Nelly /&gt;  as well, but one that had remained largely speculative or metaphorical. In 1781, Johan Friedrich Blumenbach, a natural philosopher and researcher published his thoughts regarding the  ''Bildungstrieb'', a dynamic power that was evolutive, progressive, and creative.  Blumenbach's work provided for the later important distinction (by [[Samuel Hahnemann]]) between a sustaining power (''homeostasis'') and a generative power (''Erzeugungskraft''), not just for procreation in all its myriad forms, but also creative acts of the mind, which Coleridge said involved the imagination (as opposed to fancy), both primary (unconscious figuration) involving perception, and secondary, the latter leading to apperceptive concepts as a result of conscious acts of the mind (ideas applied to perceptions).

All of this set up a climate for ideas and concepts that went beyond the mechanistic method of inertial science, one that allowed a role for creative actions of the mind (works of art) as well as reactions to sensations involving objects. Equally, the climate was conducive to considering a dynamic between subject (self and mind/consciousness) and object, one in which the mind is both receptive and pro-active, and also one in which the mind is critical to determining the meaning and reality of any given stimulation from the world outside.

=== Crisis in medicine ===
By the end of the 1700s, medicine, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, was in a deep crisis. This widely acknowledged crisis was brought into stark relief in 1795 in a famous critical essay by a German physician and philosopher, {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Benjamin Erhard|de}} (1766–1827),&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Ignaz Ježower|de}}, ''Das Buch der Träume'', 1928, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; in the ‘shot’ that was heard around the medical world. "Erhard's attack focused on what he called the "uncertainty" of medical knowledge and its failure to measure up to the criteria of a philosophical ''Wissenschaft''. He located the central problem in doctors' lack of a clear idea either of illness in general or of particular diseases."&lt;ref name="Chapter 5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Broman|first=Thomas H.|title=The Transformation of German Academic Medicine|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0521524571|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ‘elements’ of a new system ==
Johann B. Erhard’s essay, coupled with the earlier introduction of the Brunonian system into German medical circles, almost immediately triggered a remarkable surge of writings by a graduating medical student, [[Andreas Röschlaub]]. Röschlaub wrote his doctoral dissertation on the work of a rather obscure and then little known Scottish physician, John Brown, ''Elementa Medicinae''. Almost at the same time, in 1796, a German physician., Samuel Friedrich Hahnemann, who had been highly critical of the medical practices of his day, published a remarkable essay on the treatment of disease that became the foundation for the homeopathic approach to medicine, as part of a more comprehensive scientific approach for therapeutics he termed Heilkunde, and then later Heilkunst. (Lesser Writings, p. 251)&lt;ref name="Lesser Writings 1796"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hahnemann|first=Samuel|title=Essay on a New Principle (Lesser Writings)|year=1796|publisher=Google Books|location=Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwTZzl_fk74C |oclc=10284650}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Brown’s work had been available in Germany for almost 15 years, since its publication in 1780, it had been mostly ignored or rejected, as in England itself, because the method outlined by Brown was seen as a mechanical approach, which hardly endeared it to the German philosophical tradition and mindset seeking a more dynamic, vital approach. However, Röschlaub grasped, where no one else had been able, even Schelling with his ''Naturphilosophie'', that Brown had provided the very elements of an approach to health and sickness that were dynamic in nature and by means of a synthetic concept – ‘excitation’ – that was the practical application of a Lockean and Fichtean approach to the problem of cognition due to subject/object or observer/observed, to the problem of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative, and also to the very problem of life itself. "Brunonian doctrine therefore fulfilled Erhard's call for a medical practice based on the "real" causes of disease rather than on divination of the meaning of symptoms. ... where Erhard had offered only criticism, Brunonianism offered an alternative. Brunonianism now stood ready to complete what Erhard had begun, and to inaugurate a revolution in German medicine."&lt;ref name="Chapter 5" /&gt;

=== Röschlaub and the general theory of disturbance and disorder ===
Through Röschlaub’s writings, mainly between 1795 and 1806, Brown’s conception of life was brought out: as a potential in us that is brought into action and reality as a result of the workings of the actual (excitants or stimulants) on us, and of the living principle as a receptive potentiality (‘excitability’, or the capacity to be impinged upon) and pro-active (‘excitement’, or the capacity to respond to impingements), that is, as a dynamic power.

Brown's use in the original Latin of ‘incitability’ (rather than the more restricted term used in the English – ‘excitability) contained the germ of a distinction between the sustentive (Lebenskraft) and generative (Bildungstrieb) powers, as Coleridge astutely noted: “Brown has not proved that the Incitability itself cannot be altered – not merely thro’ incitement – but unmittlebar [unmediated]– Says the Jena recensent, Feb. 1799, No. 48 (Notebooks 1:38). He might have been thinking of Brown's discussion of contagious diseases wherein we see this interplay between the general action (‘affection’) of the sustentive power (excitability/excitement) and the more specific and different action of ‘contagions’ (e.g., LXXVI: “Contagious diseases are] not an exception...because...no general affection follows the application of contagion, if no undue excess or defect of excitement is the consequence..."), or his reference to a pro-creative as well as sustaining power as in CCCXXVI (“every living system lives in that which it procreates…that the system of nature remains and maintains an eternal vigour”).

When added to his distinction between beneficial (‘agreeable’) and harmful (malignities) ‘excitants’, Brown provided the basis for understanding how the level of excitability/incitability (potential) can be shifted upwards (potentiated). Finally, Brown introduced the powerful idea that pathology (unhealthy function) was simply physiology (healthy function) extended beyond a certain range of sustainable variability or pulsation (a function of the polarities that constitute life).&lt;ref name=Nelly /&gt;

Röschlaub worked initially with Fichtean insights and then Schelling and his ''Naturphilosophie'', establishing a dynamic philosophical basis in natural science for medicine. However, he realized that medicine could not be restricted to natural science, even a dynamic science grounded in physiology (the germ of which was provided by Dr. [[s:Saumarez, Richard (DNB00)|Richard Saumarez]] in England in 1798, ''A New System of Physiology''&lt;ref name=Saumarez group=http://www.bookdepository.com/New-System-Physiology-Comprehending-Laws-by-Which-Animated-Beings-General-Human-Species-Particular-Are-Governed-Their-Several-States-Health-Disease-Second-Edition-Two-Volumes-1-2-Richard-Saumarez/9781171030492?b=-3&amp;t=-26#Bibliographicdata-26&gt;{{cite book|last=Saumarez|first=Richard|title=A New Physiology, 2nd Edition, 2 vols.|year=2010|publisher=Gale Ecco Print Editions|location=USA|isbn=1171030495}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but had an artistic/aesthetic side. In this regard, he made a distinction first between ''Wissenschaftslehre'' (natural science) and ''Heilkunde'' (the practical, clinical side of therapeutics), in which latter work he established the first teaching clinic, in concert with Dr. Markus, in Bamberg, Germany.

Röschlaub made a further distinction between biophysical (''Heilkunde'') and biomedical (''Heilkunst''). The second took him into the very dimension of life itself, the etheric, that is, beyond the physical, a dimension that required an entirely different organ of knowledge from the intellect or ''Sinn'' (''mens'') that was the foundation of both ''WissenschaftsHeillehre'' and ''Heilkunde'', as the construction of a protocol entails ''arte''. Unbeknownst to him, one of his countrymen had been working on the development and understanding of this new cognitive capacity, called the ''Gemüt''. As a result, Goethe was able to ‘see’ (''anschauende Erkenntnis'') into the dynamic realm of nature (''natura naturans'') and comprehend the very movement behind the forms, and the very functions that determined a given form, including the dynamic archetype (''Kraftwesen'') out of which all forms of a given Idea (such as ‘plant’ or ‘animal’) emanated. It was Goethe who founded the science of morphology. Although Goethe termed this study ''Metamorphosenlehre'', it was, more accurately stated, a pleomorphic process.

This new cognitive capacity is what was needed for the physician or ''Leibarts'' to go beyond the inner  symptomatics and outer semiotics of a case as a basis for assessment and evaluation used by the Old School, and to avoid the pitfalls of the merely empirical approach. It was the task of the physician to draw out (‘educe’), and allow ‘to come forth’ (Heidegger's ''Veranlassung'' and ''Hervorbringung''),&lt;ref name=Heidegger /&gt; the natural state of health of the individual so as to enable him to undertake his individualized higher purpose in life.
''Heilkunst'' was not simply another projective art form such as painting, music, sculpture or poetry, but an educative art, in which the artist, the ''Heilkünstler'' (Hahnemann), seeks to bring forth out of the tangle of illness and disease at all levels, the true physiological selfhood, the fully liberated (at liberty to follow his higher purpose or aspiration) and conscious (a super-conscious mind higher than ordinary or waking consciousness) man or mensch.

Röschlaub also realized that Brown had only provided the basic ‘elements’ of a method for the science of life, and that what was still needed was the overarching or archetypal function from which all other functions were derivable and given meaning and direction, and which would also then provide the very goal and purpose of medicine and health, the ‘positive’ as well as the ‘negative’ (removal of suffering) sides of healthcare. However, this overarching, archetypal function would have to wait until the 20th century for its discovery and elucidation by Dr. [[Wilhelm Reich]] (Super-imposition or ''Überlagerung'') and Rudolf Steiner's Metamorphosis, the exponents of the underlying ''Kraftwesen''.

=== Hahnemann and the special theory of disease ===
At the same time that Röschlaub embarked on his quest for a true science of life and health, a compatriot, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, who had quit his medical practice earlier in protest against the lack of science and efficacy of the Old School and the empty ‘metaschematisms’ of the academic ‘doctors’, had also begun a similar quest for a true system of medicine. Hahnemann's essay of 1796 and subsequent writings, all part of an extended ''Organon der Heilkunst'', laid down the basic foundation for a distinction between the sustentive (''Lebenserhaltungskraft'') [Aphorism 63, 205 fn., 262) and generative (''Erzeugungskraft'') [Aphorism 21-22] sides of the living principle, between physic, operating under the natural healing law of opposites (''contraria contrarius''), and medicine proper, operating under the natural curative law of similars (similia similibus), and between disease, a dynamica impingement on the generative power (degeneration), a derangement of the sustentive power, or disturbance of ''homeostasis''.

Hahnemann further established various principles for the application of the law of similars, including a crucial distinction between diseases of a fixed nature (tonic diseases), and those of a variable nature, the basis for the later discovery by some of his followers of a dual remedy prescribing, each remedy addressing one ‘side’ of disease, the tonic and pathic sides. Hahnemann set out a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disease, including a nosology.&lt;ref name=DL&gt;{{cite web|last=Verspoor|first=Rudi|title=The Dynamic Legacy: from Homeopathy to Heilkunst|url=http://www.homeopathiceducation.com|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Details of Heilkunst ====
Hahnemann argued, logically, that the material effects of disease could not be their own cause (''causa morbii''). Disease was instead a dynamic affection of the generative power occasioned by a spirit-like morbid entity (Krankheitswesen) [Aphorisms 22, 28] that had the power to impinge upon the generative power of a human (Menschenkraftwesen) [Aphorism 289 fn.], acting as malignant ‘excitants’ in the Brunonian sense. However, this power depended on a susceptibility or receptivity (negative resonance) caused by weakening of the life force from various malignities (Brown's underlying diathesis).

The disease process consists of a dual action: the initial action (''Eerstwirkung'') [Aphorisms 70,62,64,65] of the disease agent, which impinges upon the generative power, which is generally imperceptible (such as the initial infection by the measles microbe), and the counter or after-action (''Gegenwirkung'' [Aph. 63,112, 115], ''Nachwirkung'') [Aph. 62,70, 71] of the sustentive power, which produces the various sufferings the patient complains about.

While the fixed nature of tonic diseases could be identified by ''discerning'' the underlying causal state of mind, along with a curative medicine based on fixed principles, the variable or pathic diseases could only be identified, along with their curative medicine, through the symptoms (suffering or ''pathos'') produced by the disease in the patient. However, such an approach was problematic as a person could have more than one disease at a time (Aph. 40-44). This then required a principle to organize the symptoms into an identifiable ''complex'' (''Inbegriff'') correspondent to a given disease state. Just as each tonic disease has a unique state of mind disturbance, so does each pathic disease contain a unique disturbance of the thermal organization in man. This approach to pathic diseases Hahnemann termed ''homeopathy'' (from the Greek ''homoios'' and ''pathos'', or similar suffering). This approach expanded empiricism from its limitation within the bounds of ''Erfahrung'' (experience of outer forms or ''natura naturata'') to ''Erlebnis'' provings (experience via the life body of ''natura naturans'').

The tonic diseases were to be found in various jurisdictions: homotoxic (toxins), homogenic (physical and emotional traumas), pathogenic, iatrogenic and ideogenic (spiritual diseases engendered by false belief, which he termed the "highest diseases" - as compared to the ‘deepest’ pathic diseases). The pathic diseases are found in reversible layers (‘layers prescribing’).&lt;ref name=Eizayaga&gt;{{cite book|last=Eizayaga|first=Francisco|title=Treatise On Homeopathic Medicine|year=1991|publisher=Editiones Maricel|location=Buenes Aires|pages=260|url=http://www.minimum.com/b.asp?a=treatise-medicine-eizayaga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the pathic diseases generally arise out of the more primary constant (tonic) diseases, such as the chronic diseases that arise out of the chronic miasms, Hahnemann also laid down the principle that the tonic diseases should be treated first, and second any remaining pathic diseases.
:In order to treat successfully the other cases of disease occurring in man, and which, be they acute or chronic, differ so vastly among each other [pathic], if they cannot be referred to some primary  disease which is constant in its character [tonic], they must each be regarded as peculiar diseases, and a medicine which in its pure effects on the healthy body shows symptoms similar to those of the case before us, must be administered. (Lesser Writings, p. 693)&lt;ref name="Lesser Writings 1796" /&gt;

While the curative medicines for the tonic diseases could be largely determined by the principle linking disease and medicinal agent for the relevant jurisdiction, pathic disease treatment required a corresponding image of derangement of the ''Lebenskraft'' or ''Leib'' (executive organ of the ''Kraftwesen'') so that this could be matched to the image presented by the patient. The problem lay in that a patient could present with more than one disease, each with a particular grouping of symptoms, but how could the practitioner link which symptoms manifest disorder(s) and of those ascribable to disease, and to which disease of the several possible at a given time in the patient, and finally, how could one trace any symptoms so identified to their origins? Here Hahnemann's genius adduced a living experience (''Erlebnis'') of the essence of a natural substance (''Naturwesen'') by way of a human prover, and in doing so, also provided the very practical scientific basis for removing the barrier set up by Kantian intellect between observer and observed, by invoking the cognitive capacity of Goethe's ''Gemüt'' (Aphorism 253 of the ''Organon der Heilkunst''). Goethe himself, later in his life, recognized that Hahnemann had found a way to apply to and through human nature what he was doing with Mother Nature.&lt;ref name=Haehl113&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haehl|first1=Richard|title=Samuel Hahnemann, His Life and Work|date=1922|publisher=Homeopathic Publishing Company|location=London|page=113|edition=Vol. I|url=https://archive.org/details/samuelhahnemannh01haehuoft|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the light of difficulties treating more complex cases, Hahnemann undertook further research and developed a theory of chronic miasms, which are fixed nature diseases of the pathogenic type (originally infectious, but also inherited) which give rise to all the (secondary) chronic diseases, which are pathic in nature (cf. Röschlaub's ''Pathogenesis'').  Hahnemann also gave indications as to when the practitioner could tell that the disease had been cured by the similar medicine and healing was underway (the complete process termed "heilen" or remediation). Constantine Hering, often called the Father of Homeopathy in the US, further developed these guidelines, which are often referred to as "Hering's Law or Principles" :
*from less vital to more vital organs
*in the case of pain, from above down
*in the same direction as the natural disease process.

This was later expanded in the latter half of the 19th century by Dr. James Tyler Kent who noticed that when disease was suppressed or several groups of symptoms (diseases) developed in a patient over time, that the remedial process proceeded in the reverse order of their emergence. This provides the basis for a sequential treatment of diseases.&lt;ref name=Kent&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=James Tyler|title=Lectures on Homeopathic Philosophy|pages=121|url=http://www.minimum.com/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; If some symptoms become worse some time after the similar medicine or there is even a return of old symptoms, essentially in chronic, complex cases, this Hahnemann identified as part of the healing process, which involves the counteraction of the sustentive power of the ''Kraftwesen'' against the medicine (similar ‘disease’).[Aph. 63-64]

While medicine had historically recognized, even into Hahnemann's time, the law of similars (similia similibus), it was also wary of its use because of risk of harm with the improper dose, and had largely abandoned it in favor of the other approach set out by Hippocrates involving the law of opposites, that is, acting to support the ''physis'' or sustentive power. Dr. Hahnemann discovered a way to attenuate the dose so that it could be rendered harmless but remain therapeutically active, what is often referred to as ‘dynamization’. Later he also discovered a way in which to sublimate, or the increase in dynamic power, of medicines (cf. Brown's sthenic enhancement).

Because of the use of these two laws, we have two great realms of therapeutics: medicine proper, (medic-al) which is the application of the law of similars, and physic-al, which is the application of the law of opposites. This gives us the mutually interactive and supportive jusrisdictions of the true ''Heilkundiger'' and ''Heilkünstler'' – physician and medician, involving respectively a "physic" approach based on the law of opposites and a "medic" approach based on the law of similars.

=== Compeers, not rivals ===
Dr. Brown provided the essential elements for a new, functional (actions of powers, forces and energies) approach to understanding life and health, which insights were elaborated by Drs. Röschlaub and Hahnemann. Through their work, a fundamental set of dynamic polarities emerged with which to understand the essential polaric nature of life itself:
* sustentive and generative sides of the living power
* disturbances that lead first to disorders which can render one susceptible to contracting disease
* physical and medical interventions – physician and medician
* regimen and remedial agents for physic
* tonic and pathic diseases/chronic miasms and chronic diseases
* ''Erfahrung''/''Erlebnis''
* Healing and curing
* Disease process: direct action of disease wesen and counteraction of human wesen
* Remedial process: curative action and healing reaction

At the same time, Goethe's scientific work on the underlying living functions in nature and Dr. Saumarez's new physiology of functions provided the necessary basis for understanding health and life. Underneath it all lay the elements of the Brunonian system, with its dynamic interplay of impression and response, positive or negative in terms of health (physiology) and divergences therefrom (pathology).

=== Goethe and Hahnemann ===
Goethe's approach to Mother Nature provided the theoretical foundation for and found a practical application in human nature in the works of Samuel Hahnemann. Goethe was aware of Hahnemann and his new approach to disease, and was treated using Hahnemann's system of medicine, ''Heilkunst''. On one occasion Goethe wrote:

:...Dr. Samuel Hahnemann...certainly a world-famous physician...I believe more than ever in this wonderful doctor’s theory as I have experienced...and continue to experience so clearly the efficacy of a very small administration.” And in another letter he strongly proclaimed himself a “Hahnemannian disciple”...&lt;ref name=Haehl113/&gt;

In his famous play, Faust, Goethe has the lead character, Mephistopheles, assert the homeopathic principle of similars: “To like things like, whatever one may ail; there’s certain help.”

:In his later life and in his writing and diaries, Goethe writes in Faust: ‘Similia Similibus applies to all disorders‘, identifying the central theme of homeopathy and elaborating his sympathy and understanding of homeopathy, as illustrated in Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship and his Tower Society which ‘adopts the homeopathic approach to its own psychological methods by using the irrational beliefs of its patients to cure them‘, portraying the ‘mistaken ideas as illness’, and using sickness to combat sickness. [also ''Werthe'']&lt;ref name="Sue Young"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Sue|title=Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|url=http://sueyounghistories.com/archives/2008/06/02/johann-wolfgang-von-goethe-and-homeopathy/|website=Sue Young Histories|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe wrote several letters in 1820 mentioning and supporting ‘Hahnemann’s method’, ‘Hahnemann’s terminology’, and declaring his ‘confession of faith of a Hahnemannian disciple’, and indicating that he had read his works and looked forward to reflecting on ‘the wonder physician’.&lt;ref name=Haehl113/&gt;

Goethe was also aware of and followed Hahnemann's dietary rules. In 1826, he wrote to the Grand Duke Karl August that his diet was ‘almost Hahnemannian in its strictness’.&lt;ref name=Haehl113/&gt;

Hahnemann grasped and worked directly with Goethe's key contribution to Romantic epistemology, the ''Gemüt'', or emotional mind and resonance organ, as well as its polarity to the ''Geist'' or spiritual mind, the directive organ: ''Geistes oder Gemüths Zustandes des Kranken''; ''Geistes- oder Gemüths-Krankheiten''; ''gemüthlicher und geistiger Charakter''; ''Gemüthsart''; ''Gemüths- und Denkungs- Art''; ''Geistes- und Gemüths-Organe'', ''Gemüths-Verstimmung''.

Hahnemann undertook in the human realm what Goethe had explored in the plant realm with his morphology, that 'adventure of reason' Kant had stated was not possible, and observed first hand, through a living experience (''Erlebnis'') the impact of a natural ''Wesen'' (dynamic, living essential power) on a human ''Wesen'' (initially himself, and later other volunteers), producing a systematic image of the disturbance it produced in terms of pathology (alterations in feelings, functions and sensations) and semiology (outwardly perceptible signs), both over time in the one person, and then over time in a number of people giving an image (''Bild'') of the disturbance through its various expressions and manifestations, a Goethean approach.
Indeed, the entire series and progression of provings or living experiences of medicinal substances by overtly healthy people constitutes an example of what Goethe was promoting as true scientific research:

:The only way for a scientist to establish connections between seemingly isolated ''Erfahrungen'' or phenomena is through the "Vermannigfaltigung eines jeden einzelnen Versuches." [cf. Hahnemann's Materia Medica derived from a plurality of provers for each medicament and the plurality of provings comprising the whole] The scientist must work "indefatigably" through the manifold permutations and forms of a particular experiment (Naturlehre 35). The scientist must first conduct a series [''Reihe''] of experiments and, second, serialize them, i.e. consider them as one continuous and complete series of experiments. Studied in this manner—a method that I laid out above as the first step in the practice of morphology—these serialized experiments can represent "einen Versuch, nur eine Erfahrung" (''Naturlehre'' 34) [cf. Hahnemnn's ''Arzneiversuche'']. The serialization and subsequent reflection [meditation] on singular experiments and ''Erfahrungen'', writes Goethe, produces an "Erfahrung [Phenomenon] von einer höhern Art."&lt;ref name=Wellmon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellmon|first1=Chad|title=Goethe's Morphology of Knowledge|journal=Goethe Yearbook|date=2010|volume=17|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/goethe_yearbook/v017/17.wellmon.html|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his approach to disease diagnoses and treatment, Hahnemann avoided what Goethe considered the ‘greatest failure’ (''Unheil'') and fault of material science, namely the separation of experimenter from nature, producing abstract hypotheses (notions) and artificial (''künstlich'') approaches/treatments based on an accumulation of disparate facts, rather than seeing nature as a complex web of associations, and understanding, as did Hahnemann and Goethe that "scientific knowledge emerges out of relationships and historical contexts."&lt;ref name="Wellmon"/&gt;

Hahemann also sought to understand disease in its historical progression, as in the case of his ''Wesensgeschichte'' of Psora, the archetype (tonic) of inherited chronic disease, as well as its pleomorphic unfolding via numerous (gradated) levels of secondary (pathic) diseases, which then required a sequential (scalar) approach to treatment. Goethe's morphological insights provide the theoretical basis for Hahnemann's empirical discoveries and living experiments ('provings' or ''Erlbenisse''). In these provings, Hahnemann sought to contemplate the movement, the flow and transformation of a disease state (''Gestalt''), not just an abstract image. Hahnemann also had a Goethean understanding of the sequential nature or unfolding of a disease phenomenon.

In Hahnemann's distinction between the two sides of the ''Lebenskraft'' – the sustentive or ''Erhaltungskraft'' and the generative or ''Erzeugungskraft'' (''Bildungstrieb''), we find the polar logic identified in Goethe's ''Chromatology'' – ‘the sufferings and deeds of light’ via a turbid medium, in the struggle between light energy (''Licht'') and the now identified 'dark' energy (''Finsternis''). We also find this polarity, as well as Goethe's distinction between the spectrum of dark and of light, in the distinction Hahnemann made between primary or tonic disease (based on a super-sensible knowing of psychic states involving alterations in circumstances, occurrents and behaviors via the Goethean ''Gemüt'' or super-sensible cognitive organ) and secondary or pathic disease (based on the sensible manifestation of life energy at the somatic level in terms of feelings, functions and sensations, as well as signs). For Goethe the turbid medium is the atmosphere (airy realm), for Hahnemann it is the living organism (fluid or etheric realm). Goethe's interplay of ''Licht'' and ''Finsternis'' can also be seen in Hahnemann's polarity between ''Geist'' (Spirit) and ''Wesen'' (Dynamis).

The objections that Goethe leveled against the taxonomy of Linnaeus in botany can be found in the medical sphere in Hahnemann's criticism of the blindly empirical or abstractly intellectual nosology of his time that took a few outer elements, arbitrarily conflated them, then confounded similarity of appearance here with identity of cause and origin.  Hahnemann's criticism also was based on an historical study of the morphology of this medical state of mind or ''Kurwesen'', much as Goethe considered the study of history of a phenomenon as a form of knowledge (as did the Greeks).
Equally, Hahnemann was critical of a static approach to disease nosology, which was constantly shape-shifting as the interaction between ''Krankheitwesen'' and ''Menschenwesen'' expressed different aspects of the same underlying disease (these being considered different diseases in the static Linnean nosology of materialistic medicine).  Hahnemann also understood that there was an element of fixity and variability to disease (found in his distinction (1796) between primary (tonic) and secondary (pathic) diseases, just as Goethe accepted a degree of form and structure at the physical level whilst pointing to the underlying dynamics leading to new forms over time (Darwin's adaptation).

=== Lutze and Schönlein ===
The works of Hahnemann and Röschlaub were continued and furthered by Drs. [[Arthur Lutze]] and Johan Schönlein (1793–1864) respectively. Lutze (1813–1870) took the foundations of Hahnemann's approach to disease and placed it on a solid romantic footing in consciously and consistently applying dual remedy prescribing (tonic and pathic disease associations in a given patient).

Where Hahnemann had hesitated and eventually withdrew his public support in the 5th edition of his ''Organon der Heilkunst'' for dual remedy prescribing, having been unable yet to establish a principle upon which to ground it rationally (what is known as the ‘dual remedy affair’), Lutze later re-issued the 5th edition with the withdrawn dual remedy section and clinically practiced based on such an approach. His contribution is recognized in the monument to both Hahnemann and Lutze in Köthen, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homoeotimes.com/april07/html/focus.htm "Memories around the world"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Röschlaub's innovative work in establishing a teaching clinic based on the Brunonian system, in conjunction with Dr. Albert Marcus, was developed further by J. L. Schönlein (1793–1864),&lt;ref name=Nelly /&gt;  who is recognized explicitly even in allopathic historiography for having established the scientific foundation for the modern teaching and practice clinic. This foundation is one based on natural science, but also on the ''arte'' (Pascal's ''spirit of finesse'') of the practitioner, which is something objective and reproducible though based on a different logic and involving more fugitive causes (allopathic ‘medicine’ accepting only the first and then only natural inertial science, not a true physiology of functions, both physical and etheric)

== The schism ==
Up until the middle of the 19th century, following the pioneering work of Brown, Hahnemann, Röschlaub, Lutze and Schönlein, to mention only the main figures, the scientific approach to the question of life, particularly as reflected in the development of Healthcare, seemed conducive to the development of a method that was based on a cognitive capacity going beyond mere mentation (''Sinn'' or ''mens'') and a true physiology involving living functions rather than simply mechanics and chemistry. However, it seemed that the Zeitgeist (Spirit of the Times) could not yet accept such an approach, most minds being still fully ensconced in the intellectual phase (Coleridge's "epoch of the intellect and the senses") of human consciousness. It was only the extraordinary mind of genius that was able at this stage to meet the challenge of a true science of life and mind, what Colerdige termed the “Dynamic System of Thought.”

As a result, the analytical approach favored by the French, schooled in the Cartesian system of mind-body duality, and with their significant advances in surgery (albeit based on access to and development of original Greek medical writings and more modern Greek surgical practice), came to dominate Western science.&lt;ref name=Nelly /&gt;  In Germany, the work of [[Rudolf Virchow]], while drawing from the advances made by Romantic science, effectively reduced and simplified them more in line with what the intellect was able to grasp. The achievements of Romantic Science and Medicine could not be denied, but neither could they be accepted; instead, the followers of the Romantic tradition were either denigrated as considered misguided, occult, and ultimately dreamers rather than serious scientists. The following historiographic assessment is the one that has generally prevailed until recently.

:Around the middle of the 1800s, medicine makes a gigantic surge into a critical, empirical-analytical research project: Virchow's demand for a strict, natural [inertial] scientific method then enabled medical thinking to disentangle itself from the flowery and thorny fields of romantic Naturphilosophie and to transplant itself into the earth of natural scientific-analytic procedure. (Schrenk 1973)&lt;ref name=Nelly /&gt;
Virchow's cellular theory provided the supposed basis for life, without explaining it, and superseded the ancient, and by now denigrated humoral theory (because the noetic capacity to diagnose at this etheric level had waned). As such, chemistry and physics could become the basis for medicine, all the more in that medicine effectively had been reduced to surgery and chemistry, the latter due to Pasteur's ‘germ theory’ of disease (really an unproven hypothesis and where proven according to strict requirements of Koch's postulates, still not fully explanatory in terms of the concepts and reality of ‘susceptibility’ and ‘immunity’, which contemporaries of Pasteur, such as Béchamp and Claude Bernard, sought to address).

The problem of life was to be ‘solved’ by Virchow's cellular hypothesis as the basis of life, which conveniently posited life within medicine without having to explain it.
Thus, as N. Tsouyopoulos points out, Western ‘medicine’ was effectively reduced to surgery and emergency drug treatments, possessing no basis to deal with chronic, complex disorders or diseases having rejected the dynamic approaches developed by the Brunonian orientation, as developed in general terms (physic and physiology) by Röschlaub/Schönlein and Saumarez, and in particular regarding disease (medicine and pathology) by Hahnemann/Lutze. As one reviewer of Tsouyopoulos' major work on romantic medicine summarized: "Romantic medicine was to fall into disfavour as the positivist approach from France gained ground, to the point where Karl August Wunderlich in 1859 dismissed it as mere hollow theory divorced from all empiricism, a myth that survived for nearly a century."&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reeves|first=Nigel|title=Andreas Röschlaub und die Romantische Medizin. Die philosophischen Grundlagen der modernen Medizin|journal=Med. Hist.|date=July 1984|volume=28|issue=3|pages=338–339|pmc=1139459|doi=10.1017/s0025727300036061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the extent that human physiology contains a physical/chemical aspect (broken bones, impinging tumours on vital nerves, severed arteries, or severe tissue damage, significant hormonal or chemical imbalances, severe microbial invasion, and the like), a mechanic-material approach will produce effective results, witness the ‘miracles’ of Western emergency medicine, but in the realm of internal ‘medicine’, there are no cures, only the suppression of symptoms or long-term disease and disorder management using chemical means, mostly synthetic, the intellect seeing no difference between a natural ‘chemical’ and a synthesized one. As one writer summarizes: "Alongside of English and French medicine of that time, whose significance was never under-appreciated, German Romantic Medicine comes off in no way as inferior or reactionary. Its contribution to overcoming the foundational crisis in medical history and for founding a scientific clinic is substantial and decisive for the whole of later developments...today, in our searching for new models and alternatives in medicine, Romantic Medicine lies closer to home than the so-called natural
scientific medicine of the later 1800s and early 1900s."&lt;ref name=Nelly /&gt;

== Contemporary use ==
In 2017, Kamiar-K. Rueckert introduced the term "Romantic Patient" in reference to Romantic medicine and romantic relationships to describe a patient group, which uses the defence mechanism of splitting to divide medicine into good spiritual alternative medicine and bad scientific-based medicine. In his view, these patients are on the one hand aware of their longing for an intuitively understood healing relationship, while on the other hand deny their underlying reason for this longing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Rückert|first1=Kamiar-K.|title=The Romantic Patient|url=https://semperanticuslv.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/semper_anticus_may_2017_eng.pdf|magazine=Semper Anticus|issn=2500-9826 |pages=10–11|date= May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rueckert|first1=Kamiar-K.|title=The Romantic Patient|url=http://in-training.org/the-romantic-patient-15324|website=in-Training|date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8595">'''Russian cursive''' is a printed variant of the Russian cursive (when it is reproduced in ABC books and other places){{unclear|date=November 2018}} and is typically referred to as {{lang|ru|(ру́сский) рукопи́сный шрифт}}, "(Russian) handwritten font". It is the handwritten form of the modern [[Russian language|Russian]] [[Cyrillic script]], used instead of the [[Russian alphabet|block letters]] seen in printed material. In addition, Russian [[italics]] for lowercase letters are often based on Russian cursive (such as lowercase {{lang|ru|т}}, which resembles Latin ''m''). Most handwritten Russian, especially in personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive alphabet. In Russian schools most children are taught from first grade how to write with this script.

== History ==
[[Image:Petr I Order (Ukase) No.1736 20 december 1699.jpg|thumb|right|125px|A ukase written in the 17th century Russian chancery cursive]]
The Russian (and Cyrillic in general) cursive was developed during the 18th centuries on the base of the earlier Cyrillic [[tachygraphic]] writing ({{lang|ru|ско́ропись}}, "rapid or running script", which in turn was the 14th–17th [[chancery hand]] of the earlier Cyrillic [[bookhand]] scripts (called ''[[Early Cyrillic alphabet|ustav]]'' and ''poluustav''). It became the handwritten counterpart of so-called "civil" (or [[Peter the Great|Petrine]]) printed script of books. In order, modern Cyrillic italic typefaces are based (in their lowercase part) mostly on the cursive shape of the letters.

The resulting cursive bears many similarities with the Latin cursive.&lt;ref name="Белоконь"/&gt; For example, the modern Russian cursive letters "{{lang|ru|АВДЕИКМНОРСУХ авдезиопрстухч}}" may coincide with Latin cursive "ABDEUKMHOPCYX abgezuonpcmyxr" (𝒜ℬ𝒟ℰ𝒰𝒦ℳℋ𝒪𝒫𝒞𝒴𝒳 𝒶𝒷ℊℯ𝓏𝓊ℯ𝓃𝓅𝒸𝓂𝓎𝓍𝓇), respectively (despite having completely different sound values in many cases); both upright and italic printed typefaces demonstrate less similarity.

One must not confuse the historical Russian chancery hand ({{lang|ru|ско́ропись}}), the contemporary Russian cursive ({{lang|ru|рукопи́сное письмо́}}) and the contemporary Russian [[stenography]]. The latter is completely different from the other two, though it is sometimes called {{lang|ru|ско́ропись}} like the former.

== Features ==
[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|left|150px|Cursive forms]]

Russian cursive is much like contemporary English and other Latin cursives. But unlike Latin handwriting, which can range from fully cursive to heavily resembling the printed typefaces and where idiosyncratic mixed systems are most common, it is standard practice to write Russian in Russian cursive almost exclusively.

There exists some ambiguity from the fact that several lowercase cursive letters consist (entirely or in part) of the element that is identical to the dotless Latin cursive letter ''[[ı]]'', the cursive Greek letter [[ι]] or a half of the cursive letter ''u'', namely {{lang|ru|и, л, м, ш, щ, ы}}. Therefore, certain combinations of these Russian letters cannot be unambiguously deciphered without knowing the language or without a broader context. For example, in the words {{lang|ru|во'''лш'''ебник}}, "magician" and {{lang|ru|до'''ми'''к}}, "little house" the combinations {{lang|ru|лш}} and {{lang|ru|ми}} are written identically. The word {{lang|ru|лишишь}}, "(you will) deprive (somebody of)" written in cursive consists almost exclusively of these elements. There are examples of different words that become absolutely identical in their cursive form, e.g. {{lang|ru|мщу}}, "(I) revenge" and {{lang|ru|лицу}}, "(to) a face".

In some forms of cursive, the distinction between {{lang|ru|т}} and {{lang|ru|ш}} may become elusive because both are written in the shapes of either ''m'' or ''ɯ''. To alleviate this case of ambiguity, a [[Macron (diacritic)#Other uses|horizontal bar]] can be written above the character (like ''m̅'' or rarely ''ɯ̅'') if it is {{lang|ru|т}}, or below (like ''ɯ̲'' or rarely ''m̲'') if it is {{lang|ru|ш}}. Also, writing {{lang|ru|т}} in its printed form (the ''T'' shape) rather than its usual ''m'' shape is common.

The letter {{lang|ru|д}} may also be written in the shape of [[∂]].

Several letters in Russian cursive are different from the cursive used in the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] languages. Thus, Serbian/Macedonian cursive lowercase г looks same as in Russian with additional macron, п is written like the cursive Latin ''u'' with macron (''ū''), and the letter т is written in the shape of ''ɯ̅''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peshikan |first1=Mitar |last2=Jerković |first2=Jovan |last3=Pižurica |first3=Mato |title=Pravopis srpskoga jezika |date=1994 |publisher=Matica Srpska |location=Beograd |isbn=86-363-0296-X |page=42 |ref=PravopisSrpskog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pravopis na makedonskiot jazik |date=2017 |publisher=Institut za makedonski jazik Krste Misirkov |location=Skopje |isbn=978-608-220-042-2 |page=3 |url=http://www.pravopis.mk/sites/default/files/Pravopis-2017.PDF |ref=MakedonskiPravopis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'' was Hinton's first published book in 1967; Hinton wrote the book at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/movies/MoviesFeatures/07hint.html|title=An Outsider, Out of the Shadows |last=Smith|first=Dinitia|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-11-01 | date=2005-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinton based the characters, the Greasers and the Socs, off of teenage gangs and alienated youth in her hometown of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] during the 1960s. ''The Outsiders'' has sold over fourteen million copies since it was published. In 1983, ''The Outsiders'' became a movie, and was later released onto [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; After experiencing a [[writer's block]] and going into a state of [[depression (mood)|depression]], Hinton met somebody in her [[first year|freshmen]] [[biology]] class, who inspired her to continue writing.

Hinton followed the advice given to her and wrote her second novel, ''[[That Was Then, This Is Now]]'' in 1971. Following that, she wrote her shortest novel, ''[[Rumble Fish (novel)|Rumble Fish]]''; it was published in 1975 after she had published a [[short story]] version in a 1968 edition of [[University of Tulsa]]'s ''Alumni Magazine''. Four years later in 1979, ''[[Tex (novel)|Tex]]'' was published and would be Hinton's last book for nine years as she devoted her time to raise her child. Hinton's next novel ''[[Taming the Star Runner]]'' was her first book that wasn't written in first-person point of view. Seven years after ''Taming the Star Runner'', Hinton released her first children's book, ''Big David, Little David'', which followed with the release of ''[[The Puppy Sister]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sehinton.com/bioframe.html|title=Biography|publisher=SEHinton.com|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[Hawkes Harbor]]'', Hinton's first adult novel, was released.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/movies/MoviesFeatures/07hint.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=An Outsider, Out of the Shadows (page 2)|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-11-01 | date=2005-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinton's most recent book, ''Some of Tim's Stories'', was published in 2007 and is Hinton's third children's book.

'''''Saint Jerome''''' is a 1609 painting by [[El Greco]], now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1975.1.146/|title=Catalogue entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The artist frequently returned to this subject and here shows [[Jerome]] dressed as a cardinal in a pose reminiscent of his ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Tavera]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Jerónimo de Cevallos]]'', pointing at an open book on a table covered with a green tapestry. The deep folds in the garments point to the influence of [[Michelangelo]] and Byzantine icon painting.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
[[File:Luis Guillermo Solís, elecciones abril 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Luis Guillermo Solís]],  then-[[President of Costa Rica]], votes behind a privacy screen]]
The '''secret ballot''', also known as '''Australian ballot'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-ballot]&lt;/ref&gt;, is a voting method in which a [[voter]]'s choices in an [[election]] or a [[referendum]] are anonymous, forestalling attempts to influence the voter by [[intimidation]], blackmailing, and potential [[vote buying]]. The system is one means of achieving the goal of political privacy.

Secret [[ballot]]s are used in conjunction with various [[voting system]]s. The most basic form of secret ballot utilizes blank pieces of paper, upon which each voter writes his or her choice. Without revealing the votes to anyone, the voter would fold the ballot paper and place it in a sealed box, which is emptied later for counting. An aspect of secret voting is the provision of a [[voting booth]] to enable the voter to write on the ballot paper without others being able to see what is being written. Today, printed ballot papers are usually provided, with the names of the candidates or questions and respective check boxes. Provisions are made at the [[polling place]] for the voters to record their preferences in secret, and the ballots are designed to eliminate bias and to prevent anyone from linking voter to ballot.

A problem of privacy arises with moves to improve efficiency of voting by the introduction of [[postal voting]] and [[electronic voting]]. Some countries permit [[proxy voting]], which some argue is inconsistent with voting privacy.

==History==
In [[ancient Greece]], secret ballots were used in several situations,&lt;ref&gt;Saalfeld, Thomas. 1995. On Dogs and Whips: Recorded Votes. In: Herbert Döring. Parliaments and Majority Rule in Western Europe. New York : St. Martin's Press, 1995. Page 531&lt;/ref&gt; like [[ostracism]], and also to remain hidden from people seeking favors.

In [[ancient Rome]], the laws regulating elections were collectively known as ''[[Tabellariae Leges]]'', the first of which was introduced in 139 BC (''[[lex Gabinia tabellaria]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tabellariae_Leges.html Tabellariae Leges]. [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], D.C.L., LL.D.: [[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]], John Murray, London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the practice of casting secret ballots is so commonplace that most voters would not consider that any other method might be used. Other methods which had been used and which are still used in some places and contexts include "oral votes" as well as [[Open ballot system]]s involving the public display of votes or roll calls. Other public voting methods include raising a hand to indicate a vote, or the use of coloured marbles or cards to indicate a voting choice.

===France===
Article 31 of the Constitution of the Year III of the revolution (1795)&lt;ref&gt;[[File:wikisource-logo.svg|15px]] [[s:fr:Constitution du 22 août 1795|Full text]] of the Constitution of the Year III on [[Wikisource]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that "All elections are to be held by secret ballot". The same goes with the [[French Constitution of 1848|constitution of 1848]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Article 24. — Le suffrage est direct et universel. Le scrutin est secret''. [[:s:fr:Constitution du 4 novembre 1848]]&lt;/ref&gt; voters could hand-write the name of their preferred candidate on their ballot at home (the only condition was to write on white paper&lt;ref&gt;''Pour être recevable, chaque vote doit être inscrit sur un papier blanc'' : [[:fr:Élection présidentielle française de 1848]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or receive one distributed on the street.&lt;ref&gt;See the picture captioned '' Distribution des bulletins d'élections dans les rues. L'Illustration du 23 septembre 1848 on [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1848.asp Assemblée Nationale website]&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot was folded in order to prevent other people from reading its contents.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] attempted to abolish the secret ballot for the 1851 [[plebiscite]] with an electoral [[decree]] requesting electors to write down "yes" or "no" (in French: "oui" or "non") under the eyes of everyone. But he faced strong opposition and finally changed his mind, allowing secret ballot to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] [[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]] : ''For the bourgeois and the shopkeeper had learned that in one of his decrees of December 2 Bonaparte had abolished the secret ballot and had ordered them to put a "yes" or "no" after their names on the official registers. The resistance of December 4 intimidated Bonaparte. During the night he had placards posted on all the street corners of Paris announcing the restoration of the secret ballot. '' [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch07.htm Full text (chapter VII)]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official web site of the ''[[Assemblée nationale]]'' (the lower house of the French parliament), the [[voting booth]] was permanently adopted only in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1870.asp#gauche|title=Le suffrage universel - Histoire - Assemblée nationale|first=Assemblée|last=Nationale|website=www.assemblee-nationale.fr|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:William Hogarth 031.jpg|thumb|''[[Humours of an Election|The Polling]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] (1755). Before the secret ballot was introduced, voter intimidation was commonplace.]]
[[File:Cardiganshire Election ballot paper 1880.jpg|thumb|A British ballot paper from 1880]]

The demand for a secret ballot was one of the six points of [[Chartism]].&lt;ref&gt;In the words of the [[petition]] that was published in 1838:

: [http://www.chartists.net/The-six-points.htm ''"The suffrage, to be exempt from the corruption of the wealthy and the violence of the powerful, must be secret."'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] of the time refused even to consider the Chartist demands, but it is notable that [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]], in his speech of 1842, while rejecting Chartism's six points as a whole, admitted that the secret ballot was one of the two points he could support.

The [[London School Board]] election of 1870 was the first large-scale election by secret ballot in Britain.

After several failed attempts (several of them spearheaded by [[George Grote]]&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, Bruce (2004), "George Grote, the Philosophical Radical and Politician", Brill's Companion to George Grote and the Classical Tradition, London: Brill, pp. 16–45&lt;/ref&gt;), the secret ballot was eventually extended generally in the [[Ballot Act 1872]], substantially reducing the cost of campaigning (as [[treating]] was no longer realistically possible) and was first used on [[Pontefract by-election, 1872|15 August 1872]] to re-elect [[Hugh Childers]] as MP for [[Pontefract (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract]] in a [[ministerial by-election (UK)|ministerial by-election]] following his appointment as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. The original [[ballot box]], sealed in wax with a liquorice stamp, is held at Pontefract museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/WryVwsknTr-aa4IQ-ID9iQ|title=BBC - A History of the World - Object : Pontefract's secret ballot box, 1872|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[#Secrecy vs. reliability|use of numbered ballots]] makes it possible in theory if given access to the relevant documents, to identify which candidate voters voted for. Meaning voting in the UK is not physically secret only in so much as the law says the information should not be accessed.

===Australia and New Zealand===

In Australia, secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in [[Tasmania]] on 7 February 1856.

Until the original Tasmanian ''Electoral Act 1856'' was "re-discovered" recently, credit for the first implementation of the secret ballot often went to Victoria, where it was pioneered by the former mayor of Melbourne, [[William Nicholson (Australian politician)|William Nicholson]],&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G 2016, ‘’The story of Australia’s people: the rise and rise of a new Australia’’, Viking, Penguin Random House, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; and simultaneously [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Terry Newman, {{cite web|url= http://www.mumble.com.au/enrollingthepeople/tasmania/newman_tasmania_and_secret_ballot.pdf |title=Tasmania and the Secret Ballot }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(144&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} (2003), 49(1) ''Aust J Pol &amp; Hist 93'', accessed May 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria enacted [[Electoral Act 1856|legislation]] for secret ballots on 19 March 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-21.html|title=Documenting Democracy|website=foundingdocs.gov.au|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South Australian Electoral Commissioner [[William Boothby]] generally gets credit for creating the system finally enacted into law in South Australia on 2 April of that same year (a fortnight later). The other Australian colonies followed: [[New South Wales]] (1858), [[Queensland]] (1859), and [[Western Australia]] (1877). [[New Zealand]] implemented secret voting in 1870.

State electoral laws, including the secret ballot, applied for the first election of the Australian Parliament in 1901, and the system has continued to be a feature of federal elections and referenda. 
The [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]] does not explicitly set out the secret ballot but a reading of sections  206, 207, 325, 327 of the Act would imply its assumption. Sections 323 and 226(4) do however, apply the principle of a secret ballot to polling staff and would also support the assumption.

===United States===
[[File:1900 New York polling place.jpg|thumb|[[New York (state)|New York]] polling place circa 1900, showing [[voting booth]]s on the left.]]
Before 1890, partisan newspapers printed filled-out ballots which party workers distributed on election day so voters could drop them directly into the boxes. All of the states replaced these with secret ballots around 1890, popularly called "Australian ballots." They were printed by the local government and listed all the candidates impartially.&lt;ref&gt;Eldon Cobb Evans, ''A History of the Australian Ballot System in the United States#'' (1917) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K0KIAAAAMAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=Australian+ballot+1890&amp;ots=5LDOICQPgf&amp;sig=dHpus3EMSE4SWa6sJpHb5a9GHJI#v=onepage&amp;q=Australian%20ballot%201890&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Australian ballot" is defined as having four parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Seventh New Colligiate Dictionary |url=https://archive.org/stream/webstersseventhn00unse#page/59/mode/1up |publisher=G&amp;C Merriam Company |year=1967 |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]] |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# an official ballot being printed at public expense,
# on which the names of the nominated candidates of all parties and all proposals appear,
# being distributed only at the polling place and
# being marked in secret.

In the United States, most states had moved to secret ballots soon after the [[United States presidential election, 1884|presidential election of 1884]].  [[Kentucky]] was the last state to do so in 1891, when it quit using an [[oral ballot]]. But seven states did not have government-printed ballots until the 20th century; South Carolina created them in 1950
and Georgia in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;See 1922 Georgia session laws, chapter 530, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first city to start using the Australian ballot in the United States was [[Louisville, Kentucky]], using a ballot drafted by [[Lewis Naphtali Dembitz]], the uncle of and inspiration for future [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court associate justice]] [[Louis Brandeis]], and the first state to adopt the Australian ballot was [[Massachusetts]]. For this reason it is also known as the "[[Massachusetts Ballot Act|Massachusetts ballot]]". In the U.S., voting by secret ballot was universal by 1892 but criminal prohibitions against paying people to vote were only instituted in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/597|title=18 U.S. Code § 597 - Expenditures to influence voting|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections in the United States are mostly held by secret ballot,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Political party|party]] nominating [[caucus]]es in some [[U.S. state]]s (most significantly the leadoff Presidential nominating state of [[Iowa]]) still require an open casting of ballots.&lt;/ref&gt; although some states use mail ballots instead, which violate requirements 3 and 4 of the "Australian ballot", as it is distributed to the home, and potentially marked in the presence of other people. The states of [[Colorado (state)|Colorado]], [[Oregon (state)|Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] conduct all elections by mailed ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Washington Secretary of State|title=Vote by Mail in Washington State|url=https://wei.sos.wa.gov/agency/osos/en/voters/Pages/vote_by_mail.aspx|publisher=State of Washington|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution for the state of [[West Virginia]] still allows voters to cast "open ballots".&lt;ref&gt;''See'' W. Va. Const. Art. IV, §2, "In all elections by the people, the mode of voting shall be by ballot; but the voter shall be left free to vote by either open, sealed or secret ballot, as he may elect.".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
The right to hold elections by secret ballot is included in
numerous [[treaties]] and international agreements that obligate their signatory states:
* Article 21.3 of the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'' states, "The will of the people...shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which...shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 23 of the ''[[American Convention on Human Rights]] (the Pact of San Jose, Costa Rica)'' grants to every citizen of member states of the [[Organization of American States]] the right and opportunity "to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic elections, which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot that guarantees the free expression of the will of the voters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?docid=3ae6b36510 American Convention on Human Rights, "Pact of San Jose", Costa Rica], Organization of American States, Nov. 22, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paragraph 7.4 of the ''Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE'', obligates the member states of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] to "ensure that votes are cast by secret ballot or by equivalent free voting procedure, and that they are counted and reported honestly with the official results made public."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/14304?download=true Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE], Copenhagen, June 29, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 5 of the ''Convention on the Standards of Democratic Elections, Electoral Rights and Freedoms in the Member States of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]'' obligates electoral bodies not to perform "any action violating the principle of voter's secret will expression."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eos.cartercenter.org/uploads/document_file/path/405/Convention_on_Electoral_Standards.pdf Convention on the Stnadards of Democratic Elections, Electoral Rights and Freedoms in the Member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States], Oct. 7, 2002, Chisinau. Unofficial English translation provided by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), Jan. 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disabled people==
[[File:topvoter2.jpg|thumb|ISG TopVoter, a voting machine which assures secret ballot for voters with disabilities.]]
Ballot design and polling place architecture often denies the [[disabled]] the possibility to cast a vote in secret. In many democracies{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} disabled persons may vote by appointing another person who is allowed to join them in the voting booth and fill the ballot in their name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mercurio|first=Bryan|date=2003|title=Discrimination in Electoral Law|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/alterlj28&amp;i=284|journal=Alternative Law Journal|volume=28|pages=272-276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This does not assure secrecy of the ballot.

The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] which entered into force in 2008 assures secret ballot for disabled voters. Article 29 of the Convention requires that all Contracting States protect "the right of the person with [[disabilities]] to vote by secret ballot in [[elections]] and public [[referendums]]". According to this provision, each Contracting State should provide for voting equipment which would enable disabled voters to vote independently and secretly. Some democracies, e.g. the [[United States]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovenia]], [[Albania]] or [[India]] allow disabled voters to use electronic [[voting machines]]. In others, among them [[Azerbaijan]], [[Canada]], [[Ghana]], the [[United Kingdom]], and most [[Africa]]n and [[Asia]]n countries, visually impaired voters can use ballots in [[Braille]] or paper ballot templates. Article 29 also requires that Contracting States ensure "that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible and easy to understand and use." In some democracies, e.g. [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]], all the polling places already are fully accessible for disabled voters.

==Secrecy vs. reliability==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
The [[United Kingdom]] secret ballot arrangements are sometimes criticised because it is possible to link a ballot paper to the voter who cast it. Each ballot paper is individually numbered and each elector also has a number. When an elector is given a ballot paper, their number is noted down on the counterfoil of the ballot paper (which also carries the ballot paper number). This means, of course, that the secrecy of the ballot is not guaranteed, if anyone can gain access to the counterfoils, which are locked away securely before the ballot boxes are opened at the count. Polling station officials colluding with election scrutineers may therefore determine how individual electors have voted.

This measure is thought to be justified as a security arrangement so that if there was an allegation of fraud, false ballot papers could be identified. The process of matching ballot papers to voters is formally permissible only if an [[Election Court]] requires it; in fact the Election Court has never made such an order since the secret ballot was introduced in 1872, although reportedly prisoners in a UK prison were observed identifying voters' ballot votes on a list in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-1051,00.html|title=What happens to the voting slips used in British elections after they have been counted? - The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal authority for this system is set out in the Parliamentary Elections Rules in Schedule 1 of the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/electoral_commission_pdf_file/0020/13259/Ballot-Secrecy-2006-12_23827-6127__E__N__S__W__.pdf |title= Factsheet: Ballot secrecy |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209142843/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/electoral_commission_pdf_file/0020/13259/Ballot-Secrecy-2006-12_23827-6127__E__N__S__W__.pdf |archivedate= 2008-12-09 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(48 [[KiB]])}} (2006), [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission of the United Kingdom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], sometimes the number on the ballot is printed on a perforated stub which is torn off and placed on a ring (like a [[shower curtain]] ring) before the ballot is cast into the ballot box. The stubs prove that an elector has voted and ensure that they can only vote once, but the ballots themselves are both secret and anonymous. At the end of voting day, the number of ballots inside the box should match the number of stubs on the ring, certifying that every ballot was cast by a registered elector, and that none of them were lost or fabricated. Sometimes the ballots themselves are numbered, making the vote trackable. In 2012, this procedure was ruled legal by Federal District Judge [[Christine Arguello]] in Colorado, who determined that the U.S. Constitution does not grant a right to a secret ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_21601455/federal-judge-says-no-constitutional-right-secret-ballot|title=Federal judge says no constitutional right to secret ballot in Boulder case|date=21 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Some people believe that the secret ballot enables election fraud and so should be eliminated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scrap the "secret" ballot - return to open voting|url=http://freepress.org/article/scrap-secret-ballot-return-open-voting|author=Lynne Landes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or supplemented with other ways of verifying voting, such as cryptographically secure receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolving Meaning of the Secret Ballot|url=http://voicevote.org/The_Evolving_Meaning_of_the_Secret_Ballot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~davies/secret-ballot.pdf|title=Consequences of the Secret Ballot|author=Todd Davies|publisher=Symbolic Systems Program, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Small Axe Project''' is an integrated publication undertaking devoted to Caribbean intellectual and artistic work, exercised over four platforms—''Small Axe''; ''sx salon'', ''sx visualities'', and ''sx archipelagos''—each with a different structure, medium, and practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallaxe.net/ Small Axe Project] official website. Retrieved 21 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Project also curates related events, symposia, and exhibitions. The ''Small Axe'' Project is administered by Small Axe Incorporated, a not-for-profit [501(c)3] organization established in New York State in 2002, and is funded by [[The Ford Foundation]], [[The Reed Foundation]], [[Andy Warhol#Foundation|The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts]], [[The Wolf Kahn and Emily Mason Foundation]], and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. David Scott, Director; [[Nijah Cunningham]], Coordinator. 
 
The aim of the Small Axe Project is to promote the expansion and revision of the scope of Caribbean criticism across multiple platforms. The Project aims to rethink the conceptions that guided the formation of Caribbean modernities; namely, race, class, sovereignty, democracy, development, gender, nation and culture. At the same time, the project is concerned with re-conceptualizing the Caribbean as an object of knowledge and study, across its three major linguistic regions—[[anglophone]], [[francophone]] and [[hispanophone]]. 
The current project statement reads:
{{Quote | The Small Axe Project is a transnational, interdisciplinary, and dialogical space of debate and creative expression from and about the Caribbean region and its diasporas. Such a discursive and aesthetic space, as we imagine it, is necessarily open-ended, propelled by a spirit of adventure and criticism. Our mission is to inspire, build, and sustain such a space of inquiry and articulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallaxe.net/#project "Small Axe Project"]. Retrieved 8 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote | With ''Small Axe'', Scott has moved to generate (and increasingly widen) a collective conversation about modernity and the Caribbean's central place in shaping (and being shaped by) it...Scott describes editing as "the cultivation of a capacity for attunement to the work of others, and a responsive ability to shelter and enable perspectives on common and uncommon themes that do not necessarily align with, and indeed, that sometimes wilfully diverge from, one’s own." He is also loyal not only to his contributors but to his journal's audiences—who rely on him to sift and assess and encourage excellence. Overall, this journal brings to life an active intellectual and artistic community. Scott’s vision for that community is clear and alive and open-ended: to be aware of the history of what it has meant to think and study the Caribbean and to keep asking, as he says in another excellent introduction to an issue, "What today is Caribbean studies? What can it be?"&lt;ref&gt;Hutner, Gordon. Book Review Session arranged by the Council of Editors of Learned Journals, 5 January 2017. Speech.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--Better citation needed--&gt;

==''Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism''==
'''''Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism''''' is a peer-reviewed triennial print journal that was established in Jamaica in March 1997 as a forum for critical writing. It was originally published by [[Ian Randle Publishers]] biannually for the Small Axe Collective. In 1998, the journal moved to [[University of the West Indies Press]]. The journal moved again in 2000 to [[Indiana University Press]], and began triennial publication in 2006. ''Small Axe'' has been published by [[Duke University Press]] in March, July and November, since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallaxe.net/timeline "Project Timeline"]. Retrieved 8 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; David Scott is Editor and [[Vanessa Pérez-Rosario]] is Managing Editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallaxe.net/sx ''Small Ave''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal publishes scholarly articles, essays, book discussions, and interviews, as well as literary works of fiction and poetry, visual arts, and reviews. The mission of the journal consists in the renewal of practices of intellectual criticism in the Caribbean, as well as an interrogation and expansion of the idea of "criticism". Furthermore, ''Small Axe'' aims to rethink extant conceptualizations of the regional and diasporic Caribbean, and to provide a platform for critical dialogues emerging from and pertaining to the Caribbean. 

According to ''[[The Caribbean Review of Books]]'', ''Small Axe'' has become "the leading intellectual journal published in the anglophone Caribbean, while maintaining a decidedly critical stance towards the region's political and cultural establishment."&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, Nicholas. [http://caribbeanreviewofbooks.com/crb-archive/18-november-2008/%E2%80%9Ccriticism-as-a-question%E2%80%9D/ "Criticism as a Question"], ''The Caribbean Review of Books'', November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;   

''Small Axe'' celebrated its 50th anniversary issue in 2016.

===Covers===
''Small Axe'' covers have been designed by graphic artist [[Juliet Ali]] since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;DaCosta, Gabrielle, [http://smallaxe.net/sxlive/caribbean-gallery-art-interview-juliet-ali "A Caribbean Gallery of Art: An Interview with Juliet Ali"], ''sx Live'', 4 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The covers have been noted for their striking aesthetic. Some covers have aroused controversy. ''Small Axe'' 6 (1999) was considered controversial for its parodying of [[Edna Manley]]’s sculpture “Negro Aroused” (1937). In March 2000, ''Small Axe'' 7, guest-edited by [[Faith Smith]], was rejected by the press for being pornographic. This controversy eventually led to the journal’s departure from [[University of the West Indies Press]]. 

Each cover figures original work from a Caribbean artist.&lt;ref name=issues&gt;[http://smallaxe.net/sx/issues "Issues"], ''Small Axe'' website. Retrieved 8 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable artists featured on the cover of ''Small Axe'' include:

===Caribbean Queer Visualities===
Curated by David Scott, Erica Moiah James, and Nijah Cunningham, in 2015, Caribbean Queer Visualities (CQV) explores the role of “queerness” in Caribbean visual art. CQV has hosted symposia as well as curated exhibitions.

A 2016 press release for the symposium reads:
{{Quote | One of the most remarkable developments in the Caribbean and its diaspora over the past two decades or so is the emergence of a generation of young visual artists working in various media (paint, film, performance) who have been transforming Caribbean visual practice, perhaps even Caribbean visual culture. Importantly these younger artists did not grow up in the “aftermaths of sovereignty” so much as in the aftermaths of sovereignty’s aftermaths. They grow up in a context in which the great narratives of sovereignty, once oppositional, once open to the adventure of a future-to-come, have congealed and ossified, and in doing so disclose more and more their own modes of exclusion, marginalization, repression, and intolerance. And as the old anti-systemic movements for social and political change became installed in power in the new states of the region they stultified into new modes of orthodoxy, into their own terrified normativities, anxiously policing the boundaries of identity and community, the expressions of personhood and belonging, of sex and pleasure. These are precisely themes that preoccupy this younger generation, and that provoke and illuminate the do main we call Caribbean queer visuality.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, David. [http://outburstarts.com/small-axe-caribbean-queer-visualities/ "small axe: Caribbean Queer Visualities"], [[Outburst Queer Arts Festival]], 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Terror Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white [[magazine]] published by [[EC Comics]] in late 1955 and early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated blocks of text with several illustrations per page.

The first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955, but the second issue was the last. A third issue existed but was not printed by EC. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and the line was cancelled when EC's distributor went bankrupt.

''Terror Illustrated'' was edited by [[Al Feldstein]]. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of the title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to the stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and [[Alfred E. Neuman]]. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by publisher [[William Gaines]]. This included "The Basket" and "The Gorilla's Paw" in the first issue and "Horror in the Freak Tent" and "Reflection of Death" in #2. Other contributing writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications) and John Larner.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Russ. ''Complete EC Library: Terror Illustrated''. Gemstone, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Featured illustrators included [[Reed Crandall]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Graham Ingels]], [[Johnny Craig]], [[Charles Sultan]] and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]].

In 2006 ''Terror Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines by publisher Russ Cochran (with [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in hardbound volumes as the final part of his ''Complete EC Library''. The reprint volume included the previously unpublished third issue of ''Terror Illustrated''.

==Origin==
''Toi toi toi'' was an idiom used to ward off a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]] or [[Curse|hex]], often accompanied by [[knocking on wood]] or spitting. The origin is a threefold warning of the devil (Teufel, pr. toi-fell) in German dialect:

''No’ kommt mer in’s Teu-Teu-Teufelskuchen bey ihm. '''Now we come into the De-De-Devil's Kitchen!'''''

Also from [[Rotwelsch]] ''tof'' and from [[Yiddish]] ''tov'' ("good", derived from the Hebrew טוב and with phonetic similarities to the Old German ''tiuvel'' "Devil").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/15158/ |title=Spit Your Way To Safety: Toi, toi, toi! |publisher=Forward Association, Inc. |date=11 February  2009 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spitting idea===

A separate explanation sees "toi toi toi" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times, a [[Spitting#Spitting as a protection against evil|common practice in many parts of the world]] to ward off evil spirits. Saliva traditionally had demon-banishing powers.

{{Main|Break a leg}}
An alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from [[Italy]], is the phrase ''[[Wikt:in bocca al lupo|In bocca al lupo!]]'' ("In the mouth of the wolf") with the response ''Crepi!'' or ''Crepi il lupo!''  ("May it [the wolf] die!"). Amongst [[actor]]s "[[Break a leg]]" is the usual phrase, while for [[Dance|professional dancers]] the traditional saying is ''[[merde]]'' (from the French "shit"). In Spanish, the phrase is ''mucha mierda'', or "lots of shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Urdang |first1=Laurence |last2=Hunsinger |first2=Walter W. |last3=LaRoche |first3=Nancy |title=Picturesque Expressions: A thematic dictionary |publisher=Gale Research |page=321 |year=1985 |isbn=0-8103-1606-4 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McConnell1977&gt;{{cite book |last1=McConnell |first1=Joan |last2=McConnell |first2=Teena |title=Ballet as body language |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1977 |isbn=0-06-012964-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The QI Elves|title=No Such Thing As The Ugly Panda|url=https://soundbutt.com/nosuchthingasafish/episode-62-no-such-thing-as-the-ugly-panda|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=No Such Thing as a Fish|issue=62|publisher=Quite Interesting Ltd.}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8561">'''Nizam al-Din Ubaydullah Zakani''' ({{lang-fa|خواجه نظام‌الدین عبیدالله زاکانی}}), or simply '''Ubayd-i Zakani''' ({{lang-fa|عبید زاکانی}} c. 1300 – 1371 [[Common Era|CE]]), was a [[Persian people|Persian]] poet and satirist of the 14th century ([[Borjigin|Mongol Period]]) from the city of [[Qazvin]]. He studied in [[Shiraz]] under the best masters of his day, but eventually moved back to his native town. He however preferred Shiraz to Qazvin, as he was a court poet in Shiraz for ''Shah Abu Ishaq'', where a young [[Hafez]] was present as well.

His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' ("Ethics of the Aristocracy") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire.  His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of Persian literature.  He is one of the most remarkable poets, satirists and social critics of [[Iran|Iran (Persia)]], whose works have not received proper attention in the past. His books are translated into [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], and [[German language|German]] (by Joachim Wohlleben, 2009: seemingly the first translation of the complete work into a Western language).

==Biographical information==
While pursuing his studies in Shiraz Ubayd became one of the most accomplished men of letters and learning of his time, acquiring complete proficiency in every art, and compiling books and treatises on them. He subsequently returned to Qazvin, where he had the honour of being appointed to a judgeship and was chosen as the tutor and teacher of sundry young gentlemen. At that time the Turks in Persia had left no prohibited or vicious act undone, and the character of the Persian people, by reasons of association and intercourse with them, had become so changed and corrupted that Ubayd Zakani, disgusted at the contemplation thereof, sought by every means to make known and bring home to them the true conditions of affairs. Therefore, as an example of the corrupt morals of the age and its people, he composed the treatise known as ''Akhlaq-i Ashraf'' "Ethics of the Aristocracy", which was not intended as mere ribaldry, but as a satire containing serious reflections and wise warnings. So, likewise, in order to depict the level of intelligence and degree of knowledge of the leading men of Qazwin each one of whom was a mass of stupidity and ignorance, he included in his ''Risala-i Dilqusha'' "Joyous Treatise" many anecdotes of which each contains a lesson for persons of discernment.

As a measure of his accomplishments, experience, learning and worldly wisdom, his ''Risala-i-Sad'' "Tract of a Hundred Counsels" and his ''Ta'rifat'' "Definitions" are a sufficient proof. Moreover, he composed a treatise ''Ilm-i-Ma'ni u Bayan'' "Rhetoric" which he desired to present to the king. The courtiers and favorites, however, told him that the King had no need for such rubbish. Then he composed a fine panegyric, which he desired to recite, but they informed him that the king did not like to be mocked with the lies, exaggerations and fulsome flattery of poets. Thereupon 'Ubayd-i-Zakani said, 'In that case I, too, will pursue the path of impudence, so that by these means I may obtain access to the King's most intimate society, and may become one of his courtiers and favorites', which he accordingly did.

Then he began recklessly to utter the most shameless sayings and the most unseemly and extravagant jests, whereby he obtained innumerable gifts and presents, which none dared to pose and contend with him. Thus 'Ubayd-i-Zakani a serious writer, a moralist and a panegyrist was compelled by circumstances to become a ribald satirist.

The most striking feature of the serious poems of 'Ubayd-i-Zakani is the constant references to [[Fars Province|Fars]] and its capital, Shiraz, which evidently held the affection of the poet far more than his native city of Qazvin.

Ubayd wrote religious poems, praise of God, [[Muhammad]] and the [[Rashidun]] caliphs; but he neither claimed nor desired to lead a virtuous life.

Poverty and debt were the usual lots of 'Ubayd.

===Examples of his work===

* A few of his jokes from ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'': These are accurate translations of the original Persian, which contain many profanities, and have been subjected to censorship for centuries. They are, however, illuminating examples of Ubayd's radical style, and may be quite revealing. Please continue reading with discretion. 

1) A guy got married. On their first night together, his wife started piercing her ears with a needle. When they had sex a bit later, he found she was not a virgin. He said: "my lady, the hole you must have created while in your father's house, you're making here, and the one you should make here you've already made there".

2) A guy from Qazvin was screwing his wife in the summer heat. The woman kept farting every now and then. "What are you doing?" he protested. "Blowing air at your balls so they don't overheat", she responded.

3) A good-looking Christian boy converted to Islam. The sheriff ordered his circumcision, on the first day, and raped him that very night. The next day his father asked him: "how did you find Muslims?" "Strange peoples", he responded. "Whoever accepts their faith, they cut his dick in the day and tear his ass in the night." 

4) A guy went to a religious scholar and said: "I get an erection whenever I pray. What should I do?" The scholar said: "think of your parents passing". "Doesn't work", he responded. "Your own last breath", "no use". Whatever the scholar said didn't work. He finally got mad and said: "so just come fuck me you ass". The guy responded: "your holiness's wish is my command". 

5) A guy from Shiraz was making love to his wife. He noticed that she had not removed her pubic hair. He said: "this is no problem between us as husband and wife, but make sure you're careful about these things with strangers as it would cause huge embarrassment".

6) A king had three wives: Persian, Arab and Coptic. One night, he was in bed with the Persian wife. "What time is it?" he asked. "It must be dawn", the wife responded. "How do you know?", "The scent of fresh grass and flowers has risen and the birds are singing", she responded. The next night he asked the Arab wife the same question. "It must be dawn as the pearls of my necklace feel cool on my breasts", she answered. On the third night, he asked the same question to the Coptic wife. "It must be dawn as I really have to shit", she said.
