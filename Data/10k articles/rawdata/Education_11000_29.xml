      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4437">'''Albert Harry Wheeler''' (18 January 1873, [[Leominster, Massachusetts]] – 1950) was an American mathematician, inventor, and mathematics teacher, known for physical construction (usually in paper) of [[polyhedron model|polyhedral models]] and teaching this art to students.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roberts, David L.|journal=Historia Mathematica|title= (1873–1950): A Case Study in the Stratification of American Mathematical Activity|volume=23|year=1996|pages=269–287|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82517182.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geometric Models - A. Harry Wheeler|website=American History, Smithsonian Institution|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/maa-charter/geometric-models-a-harry-wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
A. Harry Wheeler received in 1894 his bachelor of science degree from [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. He taught high school in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] from 1894 to 1896 and then was a graduate student in mathematics from 1896 to 1899 at Clark University, but left without a degree. He taught high school mathematics in Worcester from 1899 to 1920. His [[textbook]]s are ''First Course in Algebra'' (1907) and ''Examples in Algebra'' (1914).

At age 47, returned in 1920 to graduate study in mathematics at [[Clark University]], receiving a master's degree in 1921. Wheeler was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1924 at Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Albert Harry (1924) [http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1924.1/Main/icm1924.1.0701.0708.ocr.pdf "Certain forms of the icosahedron and a method for deriving and designating higher polyhedra."] In ''Proceedings of the International Mathematical Congress'', Toronto, vol. 1, pp. 701–708.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 he began part-time teaching (in addition to his high school teaching) as an adjunct instructor of geometry, first at [[Brown University]] and then at [[Wellesley College]]; however, his college-level adjunct teaching ended by the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

Wheeler and [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] planned to be coauthors (with two other mathematicians) of a short book, which was eventually named ''[[The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra]]'' and became a minor classic of mathematical literature. However, in 1938 Wheeler objected to Coxeter's expository style so that Coxeter replaced Wheeler's name on the book's title page by another author, although Wheeler is briefly mentioned in the text. Extending work of [[Max Brückner]], Wheeler actually constructed previously unknown polyhedra. In particular, he produced new [[stellation]]s of the [[icosahedron]]. This achievement impressed Coxeter, who noted Wheeler's achievement in the text.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

Wheeler continued teaching high school mathematics in Worcester until his retirement. His models continued to attract attention. In 1950 he received an invitation to  exhibit part of his model collection at the 1950 ICM in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] from 30 August to September 6. However, serious illness prevented him from attending the conference, and he died in December 1950.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

'''Adrian Malik Fenty''' (born December 6, 1970)&lt;ref name="voters guide"/&gt; is an American politician who served as the sixth [[mayor of the District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name="new mayor"/&gt; He served one term, from 2007 to 2011, losing his bid for reelection at the primary level to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Vincent C. Gray]]. Though Fenty won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayoral primary as a [[write-in candidate]], he declined the Republican nomination and said he would likely not seek elected office again. Gray went on to win the general election for Mayor in the largely Democratic District.

Since leaving office, Fenty has become a special advisor to the venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/andreessen-horowitz-hires-former-d-c-mayor-adrian-fenty-to-be-its-newest-special-advisor/ |title=Andreessen Horowitz Hires Former D.C.

He also serves on the Board of Directors at two nonprofits: Genesys Works-Bay Area and Fight for Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/324277-ex-dc-mayor-fenty-joins-perkins-coie |title=Ex-DC Mayor Fenty joins Perkins Coie  |first=Megan R. |last=Wilson |work=The Hill |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also embarked on a career as a paid speaker, part-time college professor, adviser for the state and local government practice of an information technology consulting firm. Previously, Fenty was a [[Council of the District of Columbia|D.C. Council]] member for six years. A Washington, D.C. native, Fenty is a graduate of [[Oberlin College]] and [[Howard University Law School]].

==Early life, education, and family==

Before becoming involved in local D.C. politics, Fenty worked as an intern for U.S.&amp;nbsp;Senator [[Howard Metzenbaum]] (D-OH), U.S. House of Representatives D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] (D-DC), and U.S. Representative [[Joseph P. Kennedy&amp;nbsp;II]] (D-MA).

He then served as an aide to Councilmember [[Kevin P. Chavous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Suspicions on the Council |first1= Michael H. |last= Cottman |first2= Vanessa |last2= Williams |work= The Washington Post |page= J01 |date= February 3, 2000 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/408582400/136F08CEFD67FB995CA/9?accountid=46320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was elected to the [[Advisory Neighborhood Commission]] (ANC), district 4C, and also was president of the 16th Street Neighborhood Civic Association.

==D.C. Council==
In 2000, Fenty won a seat on the [[Council of the District of Columbia|D.C. Council]], defeating longtime Ward 4 Councilmember [[Charlene Drew Jarvis]] by a margin of 57 to 43 percent after engaging in an aggressive door-to-door strategy.&lt;ref name="jarvis ousted"/&gt;&lt;ref name=2000p/&gt;&lt;ref name=2000g/&gt; Unopposed in both the primary and general elections in 2004, Fenty was reelected for a second term.&lt;ref name=2004p/&gt;&lt;ref name=2004g/&gt;

''The Washington Post'' described Fenty's performance as a Council member as "independent" and "contrarian".&lt;ref name="cropp and fenty"/&gt; During his time on the Council, he opposed public funding for a new baseball stadium, saying the owners should pay for it.&lt;ref name="cropp and fenty"/&gt; He proposed a $1&amp;nbsp;billion capital improvement program for the public schools—which the Council initially opposed, but eventually passed.&lt;ref name="cropp and fenty"/&gt; According to the Washington Post, Fenty's legislative style was to focus on constituent services and take attention grabbing positions.&lt;ref name="cropp and fenty"/&gt;

==2006 mayoral campaign==
{{See also|Washington, D.C. mayoral election, 2006}}
Fenty began his campaign to replace retiring mayor [[Anthony A. Williams]] in 2005. Then-Council Chair [[Linda W. Cropp|Linda Cropp]], businesswoman Marie Johns, then-Councilmember [[Vincent Orange]], and lobbyist [[Michael A. Brown (Washington, D.C. politician)|Michael A. Brown]] also vied for the position.

The race was widely viewed as neck-and-neck between Fenty and Cropp through the spring of 2006. Fenty ran on a platform of bringing a more energetic and hands-on approach to city government,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, advancing bold ideas for change, and sticking to them.&lt;ref name="cropp and fenty"/&gt; Fenty said he would take his uncompromising style to the mayor's office, and cited with approval, Margaret Thatcher's saying that, "Consensus is the absence of leadership".&lt;ref name="cropp and fenty"/&gt; Cropp stressed her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} She also stressed her ability to cooperate with diverse groups and reach consensus. She criticized Fenty's proposed approach to governing; being mayor, saying the mayor's job is "not just standing up and saying, 'This is what I want done,' and miraculously it's going to happen."&lt;ref name="cropp and fenty"/&gt; Both candidates raised significant and nearly equal amounts of money&amp;nbsp;– roughly $1.75 million through June 10, 2006&lt;ref name="vocal critic"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and neither gained any significant advantages from the numerous candidate debates and forums.

By July 2006 polls showed Fenty with a roughly 10-point advantage;&lt;ref name="fenty emerges"/&gt; political observers debated whether it was due to Fenty's door-to-door campaign, Cropp's lack of engagement in the campaign, or the electorate's desire for a new direction. Cropp's campaign began running [[Negative campaigning|negative attack ads]] during the month before the primary, painting Fenty as unfit for the job and as a careless lawyer who had been admonished by the D.C. Bar,&lt;ref name="new cropp"/&gt; (in 2005, he received an informal admonition from the Bar for his role in a probate case in 1999). The attacks backfired. Fenty won all 142 city precincts in the Democratic Primary—a feat unparalleled in earlier mayoral elections&lt;ref name="fenty draws"/&gt;—defeating Cropp by a 57 to 31 percent margin.&lt;ref name=2006p/&gt; He received 89 percent of the vote in the general election&lt;ref name="2006 local elections"/&gt;&lt;ref name=2006g/&gt; and became the District's sixth elected [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] since the establishment of [[District of Columbia home rule|home rule]].

==D.C. mayor (2007–11)==
[[File:20070917 Jack Kemp, Adrian Fenty and Eleanor Holmes Norton.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Kemp]], Fenty, and [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] at D.C. Vote rally on [[Capitol Hill]]]]
Education reform was a major focus of Fenty's mayoral tenure. On the first day of his term, he introduced legislation to vest control of the public schools in himself, rather than the elected school board. Previous attempts to reform the schools, including one in 1996 where a D.C. financial control board took charge of the schools, had failed.&lt;ref name="board takes charge"/&gt; At the beginning of Fenty's term, student test performance scores and graduation rates were among the lowest in the nation and District residents had been demanding that the schools be "fixed".&lt;ref name="on DC politics"/&gt; In April 2007, the D.C.&amp;nbsp;Council approved Fenty's plan;&lt;ref name="takeover approved"/&gt; the necessary legislation was approved by the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in May 2007.&lt;ref name="school takeover"/&gt;

Under the new structure, the existing superintendent was replaced by a chancellor selected by the mayor and reporting directly to him.&lt;ref name="oust"/&gt; The power shift also allowed Fenty to make swift changes in the system's central office, alter teacher qualification requirements, and implement a school consolidation process.&lt;ref name="dc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="public schools"/&gt; His selection of [[Michelle Rhee]] to manage District schools surprised the education establishment. In choosing Rhee, Fenty consulted with national education figures including [[New York City School Chancellor]], [[Joel Klein]].&lt;ref name="oust"/&gt;

The restructuring has been credited with improvements.&lt;ref name="show progress"/&gt; To better allocate resources, Fenty and Rhee significantly reduced the school system's central administrative staff and closed 23 schools with low enrollments.&lt;ref name="Adrian Fenty and Michelle Rhee"/&gt; After 2007, student achievement tests at the secondary level reportedly rose 14&amp;nbsp;points in reading and 17&amp;nbsp;points in math. Student SAT scores rose 27&amp;nbsp;points in 2010.&lt;ref name="Adrian Fenty and Michelle Rhee"/&gt; Graduation rates rose each year since 2007, and 72 percent of District students took the [[PSAT/NMSQT|Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test]] (PSAT),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://dc.gov/mayor/news/release.asp?id=1875&amp;mon=201004 Mayor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527153034/http://dc.gov/mayor/news/release.asp?id=1875&amp;mon=201004 |date=2010-05-27 }}. Dc.gov. Retrieved on 2010-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; which functions as a practice test for college bound students.&lt;ref name="psat"/&gt; Fenty's administration had also taken on a major, five-year maintenance and construction effort to improve school buildings by 2014.&lt;ref name="dc.gov"/&gt; Fenty and Rhee successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Washington Teachers Union that establishes a system of performance-based teacher compensation.&lt;ref name="Adrian Fenty and Michelle Rhee"/&gt;

The Fenty administration also overhauled District agencies for efficiency.&lt;ref name="wapo8-28-10"/&gt; His choice of a woman for police chief, [[Cathy Lanier]], received media attention.&lt;ref name="chief"/&gt; Under Fenty, Lanier added police officers to the streets and expanded community policing initiatives, for example, "beefing up" the policy of accepting anonymous [[text message]] tips from local residents to cut down on potential retaliation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The homicide rate in the District dropped 25% in 2009;&lt;ref name="murder rate"/&gt; the homicide closure rate rose to 70%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; with Fenty reporting that homicides were at their "lowest level since 1964" and that "both violent crimes and property crimes" had experienced a double-digit decline.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Fenty championed development efforts including renovating libraries, parks and recreation centers. Under Fenty, 16 neighborhood and school playgrounds were opened and nine play courts and fields were completed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The District's largest shopping center, the DC USA Shopping Center, and the Camp Simms retail development were opened, and thousands of affordable housing units were established or renovated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The "Housing First" program to provide permanent supportive housing for the city's homeless was begun. The backlog of Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations was reduced by improving the retention of social workers, building an experienced leadership team, and increasing the recruitment of social workers to fill vacancies. Additionally, the Fenty administration improved the delivery of emergency medical services and expanded health care coverage for the uninsured. It also finalized the sale of Greater Southeast Community Hospital (now United Medical Center) in a public-private partnership that kept the facility open.&lt;ref name="dc.gov"/&gt;

In December 2009, Fenty signed the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Act of 2009 to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="same sex"/&gt;

While serving as mayor, Fenty was a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]],&lt;ref name="against guns"/&gt; an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by [[New York City]] mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Boston]] mayor [[Thomas Menino]]. Fenty was known to carry three [[BlackBerry]] devices: one directly connected him to the police chief, the second was for other city business, and the third was for personal matters.&lt;ref name="blackberry"/&gt;

===2010 re-election campaign===
{{see also|Washington, D.C. mayoral election, 2010}}
On July 31, 2009, Fenty's 2010 mayoral campaign chest passed the 2006 primary fundraising total of $2.4 million.&lt;ref name="fatigue"/&gt; Fenty officially launched his reelection bid in April 2010, defending his management style and pledging to remind voters that had made the types of tough decisions that are necessary for real change.&lt;ref name="DC Mayor Begins Campaign For Second Term"/&gt;

On August 1, 2010, the editorial board of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' officially endorsed Fenty, citing his attempts to fix the District's struggling public school system.&lt;ref name="editorial"/&gt; ''[[Washington City Paper]]'' followed on September 9.&lt;ref name="editorial 1"/&gt;

January 2010 hypothetical polling showed Gray in the lead by 4 points;&lt;ref name="approval ratings"/&gt; a ''Washington Post'' poll of August 29 found Gray with a 17-point lead;&lt;ref name="wapo poll"/&gt; a Clarus poll conducted September 7 gave Gray a 7-point lead;&lt;ref name="second poll"/&gt; and a [[Public Policy Polling]] survey sponsored by [[WAMU-FM]] radio and ''Washington City Paper'' showed an 11 percent lead for Gray on September 8.&lt;ref name="gray leads"/&gt;

Fenty lost the September 14 Democratic primary to Gray by a margin of 10 points—54 percent to 44 percent.&lt;ref name=defeats/&gt; While Fenty received the most write-in votes for mayor in the Republican primary election, Fenty had previously said he would not accept the Republican nomination.&lt;ref name=republican/&gt; Following the reporting of the primary results, Fenty called it highly unlikely he will run for public office again.&lt;ref name="pledges support"/&gt;

In August 2011 an investigation into the hiring practices of Mayor Vincent Gray found that during the 2010 primary, a Gray campaign official had paid another candidate, Sulaimon Brown, to disparage Fenty.&lt;ref name="faults gray"/&gt;

====Forward Faster====
Fenty, like all District mayors and council members, had a citizen-service fund that is intended to help the residents of the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name= gives&gt;{{cite news |title= Fenty gives $440K to nonprofit launched by campaign strategist |work= Washington Business Journal |first= Michael |last= Neibauer |date= April 11, 2011 |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2011/04/fenty-gives-440k-to-mystery-group.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the cash held by the fund came from the money raised during his 2006 mayoral candidacy.&lt;ref name= gives/&gt;

Upon leaving office, District law required Fenty to donate the remaining funds in his citizen-service fund to a [[Nonprofit organization#United States|nonprofit organization]]. Two weeks prior to Fenty's last day as mayor, his chief campaign fundraiser, John Falcicchio, incorporated a [[501(c)(4)|social welfare organization]] called Forward Faster as a legacy organization to carry out Fenty's vision.&lt;ref name= board&gt;{{cite news |title= Fenty friends, but not Fenty, on nonprofit board |date= Apr 13, 2011 |first= Michael |last= Neibauer |work= Washington Business Journal |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2011/04/fenty-friends-but-not-fenty-on.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenty donated the $440,709 remaining in his citizen-service fund to Forward Faster.&lt;ref name= gives/&gt;

Forward Faster's board of directors consists of Falcicchio; George Simpson, Fenty's appointee to the [[National Capital Planning Commission]]); Sara Lasner, a former aide to Fenty; and Jason Washington, a former Fenty advance man.&lt;ref name= board/&gt; During its first year of existence, Forward Faster spent $88,700 on grants; $88,000 of salary to John Falcicchio as executive director; $49,500 to Tracy Sandler, also as executive director; and $3,000 to Jennifer Nguyen, also as another executive director.&lt;ref name= former&gt;{{cite news |title=Former staffers leading beneficiaries of Fenty's Forward Faster nonprofit |first= Michael; |last= Neibauer |date= November 17, 2014 |work= Washington Business Journal |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2014/11/former-staffersleading-beneficiaries-of-fentys.html?page=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, Simpson, Lasner, and Washington were no longer connected to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Fenty's Forward Faster files report, remains an enigma |work= Washington Business Journal |first= Michael |last= Neibauer |date= September 16, 2013 |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2013/09/fentys-forward-faster-files-report.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, District law was changed to prohibit an elected official from incorporating a nonprofit organization at the end of his or her term in office and transferring consistent-services fund money into it.&lt;ref name= former/&gt;

==Post-mayoral life==
After his term as mayor was over, Fenty signed with [[Greater Talent Network (GTN)|Greater Talent Network]], a major speakers bureau, in January 2011.&lt;ref name="speakers bureau"/&gt; The same month, Fenty became an outside adviser and counsel to Heffler, Radetich &amp; Saitta, an accounting and consulting firm based in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="lands gig"/&gt; Also in January 2011, it was announced that Fenty would become a distinguished visiting professor of politics, a featured lecturer and a career adviser in the Department of African American Studies at Oberlin College in Ohio.&lt;ref name="oberlin"/&gt; In February 2011, Fenty became an outside adviser to [[Rosetta Stone (company)|Rosetta Stone]], which produces foreign-language software.&lt;ref name="rosetta stone"/&gt; In March 2011, Fenty became a strategic adviser for the state and local government practice of Capgemini Government Solutions LLC, an information technology consulting firm.&lt;ref name="tapped"/&gt; In May 2011, Fenty became a member of the advisory board of EverFi Inc., an online education and certification firm.&lt;ref name="joins D.C."/&gt; In July 2011, Fenty joined the plaintiff and litigation oriented law firm of Klores Perry Mitchell as special counsel.&lt;ref name="joins law firm"/&gt;

On ''[[Morning Joe]]'' on March 8, 2011, Fenty backed Wisconsin Republican Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]'s [[Scott Walker (politician)#Right to work|anti-union efforts]] and broadly condemned the concept of public employee [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref name="backs walker"/&gt; Saying that "Most governors and mayors would love to be able to manage their team without the interference of collective bargaining", Fenty expressed his faith in the ability of managers to set fair wages and hours, and to fairly reward or hold their employees accountable.&lt;ref name="backs walker"/&gt; He also said that the Democratic Wisconsin senators should be held accountable for leaving the state to delay the enactment of Walker's legislation.&lt;ref name="backs walker"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1997, Fenty married Michelle Cross Fenty, an attorney. The couple has three children—twin sons Andrew and Matthew born in 2000, and daughter Aerin born in 2008.&lt;ref name="baby"/&gt; In January 2013, the couple officially separated.&lt;ref name="Laurene"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=Lydia|title=Steve Jobs' billionaire widow Laurene Powell and new love ex-DC mayor Adrian Fenty take island shopping trip during Caribbean vacation|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2920090/Steve-Jobs-billionaire-widow-Laurene-Powell-new-love-ex-DC-mayor-Adrian-Fenty-island-shopping-trip-Caribbean-vacation.html|accessdate=26 July 2017|work=Daily Mail|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the Washington Post reported that Fenty is in a relationship with [[Laurene Powell Jobs]]. Powell Jobs, widow of Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], also has three children.&lt;ref name="Laurene"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/08/08/adrian-fenty-and-his-budding-romance-with-laurene-powell-jobs-billionaire-widow-of-apple-co-founder-steve-jobs/|work=The Reliable Source|author1=Roxanne Roberts|author2=Amy Argetsinger|date=August 9, 2013|title=Adrian Fenty and his 'budding romance' with Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Steve Jobs|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenty is an amateur triathlete and runner. During his time as mayor, he participated in events such as the [[Nation's Triathlon]] and the [[Washington, D.C. Triathlon]].&lt;ref name="triathlon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fitness"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1407">'''Beniamino Carelli''' (9 May 1833 &amp;ndash; 14 February 1921) was a celebrated [[Italy|Italian]] [[singing teacher]] and  [[composer]].

Carelli was born and died in [[Naples]], where he spent many years teaching at the [[Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella]]. One of the most sought after vocal teachers in Italy during the late 19th century and early 20th century, his pupils included such well known opera singers as [[Pasquale Amato]], [[Giannina Arangi-Lombardi]], [[Francesco Maria Bonini]], [[Maria Capuana]], [[Fernando De Lucia]], [[Franco Lo Giudice]], [[Riccardo Martin]] and [[Raimund von zur-Mühlen]]. His book, ''L'Arte del canto: metodo teorico-pratico'' (188?), remains an important text on the art of singing.

His daughter, [[Emma Carelli]], also studied under him and had a successful career as a [[dramatic soprano]] before taking over the management of the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Rome Opera House]] in 1912-1926.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">'''Gertrude van den Bergh''' (c. 21 Jan 1793, d. 10 Sept 1840) was a [[Netherlands]] pianist and composer.

==Early years==
Gertrude van den Bergh was baptized in [[Cologne]], the eldest daughter of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] father Henderik van den Bergh and [[Germans|German]] Maria Theresia Leydel. Van den Bergh showed talent for music at an early age, took piano lessons at six and published a harpsichord sonata at the age of nine. She studied composition with [[Johann Burgmüller]] and piano with [[Ferdinand Ries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PA59 |title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1809 van den Bergh's father organized a concert tour of the Netherlands for Gertrude and her sister Sophia. The family moved to [[The Hague]] about 1813, and afterward Van den Bergh seldom played in public. She continued to perform in private circles and remained well known. In 1830 she was invited to join the Society for the Promotion of Music, which had not been previously open to women. In 1834 the society held a two-day festival in The Hague where Van den Bergh participated. She directed the first mixed voice choir from The Hague and from 1837 or 1838 the Vocal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Piano Music by Women Composers: Composers born before 1900|author=Dees, Pamela Youngdahl|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an unmarried woman, Van den Bergh lived with her mother and gave singing and piano lessons. She wrote a music instruction manual around 1830 to aid in this work, and in 1840 she died in The Hague of breast cancer at the age of 47.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/Bergh,%20Gertrude%20van%20den|title=BERGH, Anna Gertrude Elizabeth van den|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Most of Van den Bergh's compositions were unpublished and so lost. Selected works include:
*''Lied für Piano-Forte''
*''Rondeau pour le piano forte, op. 3''

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

The '''International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods''' (ICPRAM) is held annually since 2012. From the beginning it is held in conjunction with two other conferences: [[ICAART]] - International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence and [[ICORES]] - International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems. 

ICPRAM is composed by two main topics areas: theory and methods and applications. Each one of these areas is constituted by several sub-topics like [[Evolutionary Computation]], [[Density Estimation]], [[Spectral method]], [[Combinatorial Optimization]], [[Reinforcement learning]], [[Meta learning]], [[Convex optimization]] in the case of Theory and methods and [[Natural language processing]], [[robotics]], [[Signal processing]], [[Information retrieval]], [[perception]] in the applications area.

The conference papers are made available at the SCITEPRESS [[digital library]] and are published in the conference [[proceedings]]. It’s also made a selection of the best papers presented in the conference for publication in a [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Latorre Carmona|first1=Pedro|last2=Sánchez|first2=J.

Besides the presentation of papers from the authors, the conference is composed by [[tutorials]]. For example, in the last edition, the conference had a tutorial on Secure our society - Computer Vision Techniques for Video Surveillance given by Huiyu Zhou from the [[Queen's University Belfast]], UK.

Since the first edition, ICPRAM has counted on several keynote speakers like Alberto Sanfeliu, [[Tomaso Poggio]], [[Josef Kittler]], [[Hanan Samet]], [[Nello Cristianini]] and [[John Shawe-Taylor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3633">'''Jeffrey Nielsen''' is founder of the [[Democracy House Project]], and a published author.  He is also a [[philosophy]] instructor at [[Westminster College, Salt Lake City|Westminster College]], Salt Lake City; and [[Utah Valley University]], Orem, Utah.  He is perhaps best known for being both a supporter of [[gay marriage]] and a practicing [[Mormon]].

==Life==
In 2006, Nielsen was a visiting lecturer of philosophy at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). After submitting an editorial to the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' that challenged the position of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), BYU's sponsoring institution, on [[same-sex marriage]], Nielsen received a letter from Daniel Graham, the head of the Department of Philosophy, stating that once term classes ended, his contract would not be renewed. In the editorial, Nielsen criticized the church's support for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit gay marriage.

BYU instructors and employees contract themselves to not criticize the LDS Church as a condition of their employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc4.com/local_news/local_headlines/story.aspx?content_id=0CD8FA2C-81EE-4494-9BBF-794D07F9A49D BYU Professor fired]&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen was subsequently released from his duties in his [[ward (LDS Church)|local church congregation]] as well.

After his dismissal from BYU, Nielsen obtained positions teaching philosophy at [[Westminster College, Salt Lake City|Westminster College]], Salt Lake City, Utah, and [[Utah Valley University]], Orem, Utah.

Nielsen was educated at [[Weber State University]] and [[Boston College]]. At Boston College, he was a Teaching Fellow where he taught courses in logic and critical thinking, the history and philosophy of art and science as well as in ethics and [[epistemology]]. He has also taught in the philosophy department at Brigham Young University, where he taught courses in the ethics of leadership, reasoning and writing, as well as in the history and development of science. His teaching focuses on issues in ethics, moral decision-making, and democracy.

Nielsen is the author of the book ''[[The Myth of Leadership|The Myth of Leadership: Creating Leaderless Organizations]]''. His most recent initiative has been to found the nonprofit [[Democracy House Project]]. The Democracy House Project is an educational initiative using his peer-based model to teach political literacy.

''Knowing Neurons'' frequently features content by guest contributors, many of whom are neuroscience PhD students or postdoctoral researchers.

==Infographics==
''Knowing Neurons'' is perhaps best known for their infographics created by Jooyeun Lee and Kayleen Schreiber. These infographics have focused on a wide variety of topics in neuroscience, such as [[CRISPR]] and scientific [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knowing Neurons Infographics|url=http://knowingneurons.com/infographics/|website=Knowing Neurons|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special series of infographics produced by ''Knowing Neurons'' include ''52 Brain Facts'' and ''Weird Animal Brains''. ''52 Brain Facts'' presented a new fact about the brain each week for 52 weeks from September 2015 to September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=52 Brain Facts|url=https://aeon.co/partners/knowing-neurons|website=Knowing Neurons|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facts are presented on the website in a 'myth or fact?' format, such as "Myth or Fact? One region of the brain sets us humans apart from other species." The proceeding infographic then serves to either debunk the myth or confirm the fact.

==Awards==
In 2016, ''Knowing Neurons'' team members Kate Fehlhaber, Joel Frohlich, and Jooyeun Lee received the [[Society for Neuroscience]] Next Generation Award for their contributions to public neuroscience communication, outreach, and education through ''Knowing Neurons''.&lt;ref name="award" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">'''Kofoeds School''' ({{lang-da|Kofoeds Skole}}) in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]], is an organization carrying out social work for adults according to the "social pedagogical" principle of personal and vocational empowerment.

The school, founded in 1928, bases its work on [[Christian]] and humanitarian principles and among other things, the Danish [[folk high school]] movement. It offers education, workshop activities, counseling, accommodation, emergency assistance and relief measures. The aim of the school is to assist people with social problems in improving their social life and relieve them from their underprivileged social situation. The efforts are holistic and the targets tuned to people’s own abilities and qualifications.

==The school concept==
Kofoeds School is based on the concept that if people are to be assisted socially, they have to be helped educationally, but the terms education and school are understood in the widest sense, not associated exclusively with narrow vocational qualifications. The concept of education is a cornerstone in the work of the school as a principle of development of human resources. 

People using the service at Kofoed's School are called students to emphasize the pedagogical approach to dealing with social problems. The school helps the students to develop their own strength, self-esteem and abilities, and focus is on possibilities and the students’ own interests and wishes. Basically, the school approaches the students as ordinary human beings who experience social difficulties in their life.

Since its foundation Kofoeds School has been involved in a range of social issues such as homelessness, unemployment, urban immigration, integration problems for ethnic groups, [[alcoholism]], substance abuse, and psychiatric problems.

==Method==
The working method of the school emphasizes the importance of the students themselves being active. The aim is not just to help the students but also to help make them take responsibility for their own efforts. The school works on the belief, that help is an ambiguous blessing. Provided without expecting active interplay by the person seeking assistance, it may pacify people and make them dependent. Given the right way, however, it can activate them, make them feel more optimistic and increase their ability to act themselves. 

The concept aims at rebuilding and strengthening the students’ self-esteem while at the same time easing their social problems. On working with the students, the primary focus is on their personal strength and abilities, and the method seeks to move people forward, not just to solve immediate problems.

==History==
Kofoeds School was founded by pastor [[Hans Christian Kofoed]] (1898-1952) in 1928, at a time of economic depression. His goal was to help young unemployed men to come back to society as active citizens. H.C. Kofoed, made the slogan “''hjælp til selvhjælp''” (literally: “help to self-help”) the center of his work. He wished to help the unemployed differently compared to usual charities that often placed the unemployed in a role of passive receivers of assistance. 

Kofoeds himself had experienced unemployment then he was young, and he had remembered since then that if one is being helped in the wrong way, it is possible to cause more damage than benefit. Therefore he based his work on the principle that an unemployed person may receive food or his wages only after performing an activity. When he receives it this way, it is not humiliating but rather brings satisfaction and a sense of justice. At the time Kofoed’s methods were revolutionary. 

Among the first activities of Kofoeds School were a washroom and a laundry, where people could wash and do their laundry for free. And the school opened a workshop where it was possible to repair old garments and shoes. When Kofoed found other collaborators, he opened courses in Danish, English, French, German, counting, humanities, gymnastics and singing. Students could use the services of a legal counselor and a physician. 

In the following years, the number of women learning housework increased. There was a joinery shop, in which men could repair used furniture, and there was a garden in which they could grow vegetables for their needs for free. Kofoed bought a farm in 1940 where a school for adolescents was developed, in which young agricultural workers attended an intensive re-socializing course. 

The number of students grew rapidly in the first decades after its start, and so did the size of the school and the activities offered. Soon Kofoeds School was a well-known institution throughout Denmark, and Hans Christian Kofoed himself became a renowned, public figure. Both the work of H.C. Kofoed and his school received a lot of goodwill and respect from all layers of society, and when Kofoed died following a car accident in 1952, the country was in shock. More than 2000 people attended his funeral.

Students with yet bigger and cumulative problems started to appear at the school in the 1950s. Often they were unemployed alcoholics, people with psycho-pathological problems and drug addicts. The number of students grew intensively in the 1960s leading to the broadening of the offer of the school by many other activities. 

In the following decade, employers and directors of the school entered a conflict about the perception of the school’s mission. Certain practical and ideological changes followed, but in 1979 a return to the original principle of help to self-help recommenced. 

At the present day, the school in Copenhagen offers assistance to those students who are in a temporarily difficult life situation as well as to those who are in a much deeper crisis. The basic pedagogical principles of activation are still accentuated in order to let students try to deal with the problems on their own.

==New schools and international work==
From early on after its start in 1928, Kofoeds School acquired facilities outside the main school in Copenhagen to suit the needs of the different kinds of students and their specific problems. However it was not until the turn of the millennium – in 2003 – that an independent working school opened in [[Denmark]], this time in [[Århus]]. The School in Århus today serves about 70 students daily. 

During the 1990s, Kofoeds School started making more foreign contacts and engaged itself in various international collaborations, but up until 1997 the school in Copenhagen was the only one. However, building on a collaboration between Kofoeds School and Polish social workers begun in the aftermath of World War II and since then progressed, the first sister school opened in Siedlce, Poland in 1997. Since then a string of schools has opened in Central and Eastern Europe and today the organization numbers 15 schools in [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Armenia]] and [[Ukraine]].

'''Kojo''' is a [[programming language]] and [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for computer programming and learning. It has many different features that enable playing, exploring, creating, and learning in the areas of computer programming, mental skills, (interactive) math, graphics, art, music, science, animation, games, and electronics. Kojo draws ideas from the programming languages [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] and [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kogics.net/sf:kojo |title=Kojo home page |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.kogics.net/forum/t-263574 |title=Interview: Scala Learning Environment on the NetBeans Platform |date=19 February 2010 |author=Geertjan Wielenga |publisher=DZone |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kojo is [[open-source software]]. It was created,  and is actively developed, by Lalit Pant, a computer programmer and teacher living in [[Dehradun, India]]. Kojo provides [[domain-specific language]]s (DSLs) for its different areas of learning, and as such can be considered an [[List of educational programming languages|educational programming language]].

Kojo is written in, and its approach is based on, the programming language [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], where users begin with a simple subset of the language and progress in steps. Its graphical user interface is based on Java [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]; a former version was based on the Java [[NetBeans]] platform.

Lalit chose Scala as the underlying language for Kojo because of its low barrier to entry and potential power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Odersky|first=Martin|title=Bringing Scalability to the Classrooms of the Himalayas|url=http://readwrite.com/2011/10/13/bringing_scalability_to_the_classrooms_of_the_hima|work=ReadWrite|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scala-lang.org/node/10714 |title=Interview: Scala is Child's Play |last=Bagwell |first=Phil |date=25 August 2011 |website=Scala-lang.org |publisher=École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kojo has been used in schools and classes around the world. Some of these include:
* Himjyoti School, Dehradun, India.
* [[Rishi Valley School]], Madanapalle, India.
* Cardinal Forest Elementary School, Springfield, Virginia, USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjhsst.edu/~rlatimer/cardinalforest/ScratchProjects/CSI2012/Feb29-2012/kojo/ProjectsKojoMay3-2012.html Cardinal Forest Elementary School]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diablo Valley College]], Pleasant Hill, California, USA.
* [[Our Lady's Catholic High School|Lady's Catholic High School]], Preston, England.
* A Swedish 4th grade class consisting of 10-year-old children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viprogrammerar.se/ Swedish 4th grade class]&lt;/ref&gt; Kojo has been featured by [[Dagens Nyheter]] (DN) and [[Computer Sweden]] as a result of the work done by this class.
* Events like Silicon Valley Code Camp,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Session/2012/kojo-programming-scala-for-grade-6-to-adult Silicon Valley Code Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; [[CoderDojo]], Hack The Future, and Meetups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Stockholm/events/115553642/ Meetups]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Kojo is partly sponsored by [[Lightbend]], formerly TypeSafe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightbend.com/ Lightbend]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lund University]], Computer Science Department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lth.se/programmera/ Lund University, Computer Science Dept.]&lt;/ref&gt; where Kojo is used to introduce children and teachers to computer programming. Professor Björn Regnell of Lund University has an informative presentation on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/Personal/Bjorn_Regnell/project-learn-how-to-program.pdf Professor Björn Regnell, Lund University, Kojo presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Regnell writes, in translation: "''Kojo is the best tool, with a low barrier of entry, I have seen for making real text based programming available for children, that is also  usable all the way up to university level''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cs.lth.se/english/contact/bjorn_regnell/laer_dig_programmera |title= Lär dig programmera! |accessdate= 6 May 2013 |last= Regnell |first= Björn |date= 29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1997, '''Language Magazine''' (formerly '''American Language Review''') is the popular periodical of language, education and communication. In 2001, Language Magazine increased its publication schedule from 6 to 12 issues a year to answer the demand of readers (including department heads, supervisors, government officials and other decision-makers) to be kept up to date with developments in the fast paced world of language and literacy education. It has often published the works of [[Stephen Krashen]], [[Aned Y. Muñiz Gracia]] and Eugene E. García, among others expert in the fields of [[linguistics]] and language instruction.  A great deal of its 150,000 monthly circulation are Teachers of Foreign Languages (TOFL), Teachers of English as Foreign Language (TOEFL), and teachers of English as a Second Language (ESL), as well as educational administrators and university language departments. The [[California Language Teachers Association]] also uses it in lieu of a monthly publication. [[Richard Lederer]] is also a monthly contributor.

Language Magazine is an influential forum of information for language-related professions and businesses. It was the only publication chosen by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] to partner in its “Census in the Schools” program in 2000. In 2003, Language Magazine received the prestigious Media &amp; Communications Award from the California Association for Bilingual Education (CABE).

The look of the magazine has been creatively directed by Los Angeles-based magazine designer [[Leanna Robinson]] since 2016.

'''Learning Object Metadata''' is a data model, usually encoded in XML, used to describe a [[learning object]] and similar digital resources used to support learning. The purpose of learning object metadata is to support the reusability of learning objects, to aid discoverability, and to facilitate their interoperability, usually in the context of online [[learning management systems]] (LMS).

The IEEE 1484.12.1 – 2002 Standard for Learning Object Metadata is an internationally recognised open standard (published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] Standards Association, New York) for the description of “[[learning object]]s”. Relevant attributes of learning objects to be described include: type of object; author; owner; terms of distribution; format; and [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] attributes, such as teaching or interaction style.

== IEEE 1484.12.1 – 2002 Standard for Learning Object Metadata ==

=== In brief ===
The IEEE working group that developed the standard defined learning objects, ''for the purposes of the standard,'' as being “any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training." This definition has struck many commentators as being rather broad in its scope, but the definition was intended to provide a broad class of objects to which LOM metadata might usefully be associated rather than to give an instructional or pedagogic definition of a learning object. ''IEEE 1484.12.1'' is the first part of a multipart standard, and describes the LOM data model. The LOM data model specifies which aspects of a learning object should be described and what vocabularies may be used for these descriptions; it also defines how this data model can be amended by additions or constraints. Other parts of the standard are being drafted to define bindings of the LOM data model, i.e. define how LOM records should be represented in [[XML]] and [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (''IEEE 1484.12.3'' and ''IEEE 1484.12.4'' respectively). This article focuses on the LOM data model rather than issues relating to XML or other bindings.

IMS Global Learning Consortium is an international consortium that contributed to the drafting of the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (together with the ARIADNE Foundation) and endorsed early drafts of the data model as part of the IMS Learning Resource Meta-data specification (IMS LRM, versions 1.0 – 1.2.2). Feedback and suggestions from the implementers of IMS LRM fed into the further development of the LOM, resulting in some drift between version 1.2 of the IMS LRM specification and what was finally published at the LOM standard. Version 1.3 of the IMS LRM specification realigns the IMS LRM data model with the IEEE LOM data model and specifies that the IEEE XML binding should be used. Thus, we can now use the term 'LOM' in referring to both the IEEE standard and version 1.3 of the IMS specification. The IMS LRM specification also provides an extensive ''Best Practice and Implementation Guide'', and an ''XSL transform'' that can be used to migrate metadata instances from the older versions of the IMS LRM XML binding to the IEEE LOM XML binding.

== Technical details ==

=== How the data model works ===
The LOM comprises a '''hierarchy of elements'''&lt;!--, as shown in the diagram (top right)--&gt;. At the first level, there are nine categories, each of which contains sub-elements; these sub-elements may be simple elements that hold data, or may themselves be aggregate elements, which contain further sub-elements. The semantics of an element are determined by its context: they are affected by the parent or container element in the hierarchy and by other elements in the same container. For example, the various ''Description'' elements (1.4, 5.10, 6.3, 7.2.2, 8.3 and 9.3) each derive their context from their parent element. In addition, description element 9.3 also takes its context from the value of element 9.1 ''Purpose'' in the same instance of ''Classification''.

The data model specifies that some elements may be repeated either individually or as a group; for example, although the elements 9.2 (''Description'') and 9.1 (''Purpose'') can only occur once within each instance of the ''Classification'' container element, the ''Classification'' element may be repeated - thus allowing many descriptions for different purposes.

The data model also specifies the '''value space''' and '''datatype''' for each of the simple data elements. The value space defines the restrictions, if any, on the data that can be entered for that element. For many elements, the value space allows any string of [[Unicode]] character to be entered, whereas other elements entries must be drawn from a declared list (i.e. a [[controlled vocabulary]]) or must be in a specified format (e.g. date and language codes). Some element datatypes simply allow a string of characters to be entered, and others comprise two parts, as described below:
* '''LangString''' items contain Language and String parts, allowing the same information to be recorded in multiple languages
* '''Vocabulary''' items are constrained in such a way that their entries have to be chosen from a controlled list of terms - composed of Source-Value pairs - with the Source containing the name of the list of terms being used and the Value containing the chosen term
* '''DateTime''' and '''Duration''' items contain one part that allows the date or duration to be given in a machine readable format, and a second that allows a description of the date or duration (for example “mid summer, 1968”).

When implementing the LOM as a data or service provider, it is not necessary to support all the elements in the data model, nor need the LOM data model limit the information which may be provided. The creation of an [[application profile]] allows a community of users to specify which elements and vocabularies they will use. Elements from the LOM may be dropped and elements from other metadata schemas may be brought in; likewise, the vocabularies in the LOM may be supplemented with values appropriate to that community.

=== Requirements ===
The key requirements for exploiting the LOM as a data or service provider are to:
* Understand user/community needs and to express these as an application profile
* Have a strategy for creating high quality metadata
* Store this metadata in a form which can be exported as LOM records
* Agree a binding for LOM instances when they are exchanged
* Be able to exchange records with other systems either as single instances or ''en masse''.

=== Related specifications ===
There are many metadata specifications; of particular interest is the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Element Set (commonly known as Simple Dublin Core, standardised as ''ANSI/NISO Z39.85 – 2001''). Simple Dublin Core (DC) provides a non-complex, loosely defined set of elements which is useful for sharing metadata across a wide range of disparate services. Since the LOM standard used Dublin Core as a starting point, refining the Simple DC schema with qualifiers relevant to learning objects, there is some overlap between the LOM and DC standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Steven J.|title=Metadata for Digital Collections: A How-To-Do-It Manual|date=2011|publisher=ALA Neal-Schuman|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1-55570-746-0|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is also working on a set of terms which allow the Dublin Core Element Set to be used with greater semantic precision (Qualified Dublin Core). The Dublin Education Working Group aims to provide refinements of [[Dublin Core]] for the specific needs of the education community.

Many other education-related specifications allow for LO metadata to be embedded within XML instances, such as: describing the resources in an IMS Content Package or Resource List; describing the vocabularies and terms in an [[IMS VDEX]] (Vocabulary Definition and Exchange) file; and describing the question items in an IMS QTI (Question and Test Interoperability) file.

The [[IMS VDEX|IMS Vocabulary Definition and Exchange (VDEX) specification]] has a double relation with the LOM, since not only can the LOM provide metadata on the vocabularies in a VDEX instance, but VDEX can be used to describe the controlled vocabularies which are the value space for many LOM elements.

LOM records can be transported between systems using a variety of protocols, perhaps the most widely used being [[OAI-PMH]].

=== Application profiles ===

==== UK LOM Core ====
For UK Further and Higher Education, the most relevant family of application profiles are those based around the ''UK LOM Core''.&lt;ref&gt;http://zope.cetis.ac.uk/profiles/uklomcore/&lt;/ref&gt; The UK LOM Core is currently a draft schema researched by a community of practitioners to identify common UK practice in learning object content, by comparing 12 metadata schemas. UK LOM is currently legacy work, it is not in active development.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''DS:Style'' products}}
[[Image:DS Style.png|thumb|The logo of the series]]
'''''DS:Style''''' is a series of [[educational software]] products for the [[Nintendo DS]] console. The series was created and published in [[Japan]] exclusively by [[Square Enix]], a Japanese [[video game developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]], and developed by both Square Enix and several other companies. It includes reference guides, [[guide book|travel guides]] for different countries or cities, and study guides for Japanese professional licensing and [[civil service|civil servant]] exams. The motto for the series is "The fun of games, the joy of learning".&lt;ref name="IGNhandson"/&gt; Despite the motto and being sold for a game console, the products actually include almost no gaming elements, instead functioning as reference guides and knowledge quizzes.&lt;ref name="IGNhandson"/&gt; The series was perceived when it launched as an attempt by Square Enix to break into a new market, that of "non-traditional gamers".&lt;ref name="SIround"/&gt;

The first nine products in the series were announced on April 4, 2007 and the first five were released on July 5, 2007; the last ''DS:Style'' release was on February 3, 2011.&lt;ref name="IGNannounce"/&gt; Several of the products were named after other non-software products, such as the [[Lonely Planet]] series of travel guides, the Japanese [[Legal Mind]] (LEC) test preparatory company, or the Japanese [[Tipness]] yoga studio chain.&lt;ref name="IGNhandson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LegalMind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tipness"/&gt; While not a part of the ''DS:Style'' series, bookkeeping and real estate certification products (''Honki de Manabu: LEC de Goukaku - DS Hishou Boki 3-Kyū'' and ''Honki de Manabu: LEC de Goukaku - DS Takuchi Tatemono Torihiki Shuninsha'') were also released on the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="PSPbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSPreal"/&gt;

The releases, as they fell in the line between games and software products, went largely unreviewed. Prior to release, the initial products were regarded as having "potential".&lt;ref name="IGNhandson"/&gt; Critics' reactions to the series were tepid; they felt that the products would sell well, given the publisher and subject matter, but that there was little interesting about them. They felt that it would not be worth localizing the products to sell in non-Japanese markets, as there was not much of a market for non-game software for the Nintendo DS without heavy advertising, due to prior failures in promoting such products.&lt;ref name="SIround"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43447">'''Mathematical anxiety''' is [[anxiety]] about one's ability to do [[mathematics]]. It is a phenomenon that is often considered when examining students' problems in mathematics.

==Math anxiety==
[[Mark H. Ashcraft]] defines math anxiety as "a feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with math performance" (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name="Ashcraft, M.H. 2002"&gt;{{citation |author=Ashcraft, M.H. |year=2002 |title=Math anxiety: Personal, educational, and cognitive consequences |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=11 |pages=181–185 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic study of math anxiety originates as early as the 1950s, where Mary Fides Gough introduced the term ''mathemaphobia'' to describe the phobia-like feelings of many towards mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suárez-Pellicioni|first=Macarena|last2=Núñez-Peña|first2=María Isabel|last3=Colomé|first3=Àngels|date=2016|title=Math anxiety: A review of its cognitive consequences, psychophysiological correlates, and brain bases|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-015-0370-7|journal=Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.3758/s13415-015-0370-7|issn=1530-7026|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first math anxiety measurement scale was developed by Richardson and Suinn in 1972.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Since this development, several researchers have examined math anxiety in [[empirical studies]].&lt;ref name="Ashcraft, M.H. 2002"/&gt; Hembree&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Hembree, R. |year=1990 |title=The nature, effects, and relief of mathematics anxiety |journal=Journal for Research in Mathematics Education |volume=21 |pages=33–46 |doi=10.2307/749455}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1990) conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 151 studies concerning math anxiety. It determined that math anxiety is related to poor math performance on math achievement tests and that math anxiety is related to negative attitudes concerning math. Hembree also suggests that math anxiety is directly connected with math avoidance.

Ashcraft&lt;ref name="Ashcraft, M.H. 2002"/&gt; (2002) suggests that highly anxious math students will avoid situations in which they have to perform mathematical calculations. Unfortunately, math avoidance results in less competency, exposure and math practice, leaving students more anxious and mathematically unprepared to achieve. In college and university, anxious math students take fewer math courses and tend to feel negative towards math. In fact, Ashcraft found that the [[correlation]] between math anxiety and variables such as confidence and motivation are strongly [[negative relationship|negative]].

According to Schar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schar | first1 = M. H. | last2 = Kirk | first2 = E. P. | year = 2001 | title = The relationships among working memory, math anxiety, and performance | doi = 10.1037/0096-3445.130.2.224 | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 224–237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because math anxiety can cause math avoidance, an [[empirical]] [[dilemma]] arises. For instance, when a highly math-anxious student performs disappointingly on a math question, it could be due to math anxiety, or the lack of competency in math because of math avoidance. Ashcraft determined that by administering a test that becomes increasingly more mathematically challenging, he noticed that even highly math-anxious individuals do well on the first portion of the test measuring performance. However, on the latter and more difficult portion of the test, there was a stronger negative relationship between accuracy and math anxiety.

According to the research found at the University of Chicago by [[Sian Beilock]] and her group, math anxiety is not simply about being bad at math. After using brain scans, scholars confirmed that the anticipation or the thought of solving math actually causes math anxiety. The brain scans showed that the area of the brain that is triggered when someone has math anxiety overlaps the same area of the brain where bodily harm is registered.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, William. "When People Worry about Math, the Brain Feels the Pain." UChicago News. The University of Chicago, 31 Oct. 2012. Web. 02 Mar. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
The impact of mathematics anxiety on mathematics performance has been studied in much recent literature.  An individual with math anxiety does not necessarily lack ability in mathematics, rather, they cannot perform to their full potential due to the interfering symptoms of their anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beilock|first=S. L., &amp; Willingham, D. T.|date=2014|title=Math Anxiety: Can Teachers Help Students Reduce It? Ask the Cognitive Scientist.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043398|journal=American Educator|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=28–43|issn=0148-432X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Math anxiety manifests itself in a variety of ways, including physical, psychological, and behavioral symptoms, that can all disrupt a student's mathematical performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blazer|first=C.|date=2011|title=Strategies for Reducing Math Anxiety.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED536509|journal=Information Capsule|language=en|volume=1102|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strong negative correlation between high math anxiety and low achievement is often thought to be due to the impact of math anxiety on working memory.  Working memory has a limited capacity, and when solving mathematical problems, a large portion of this capacity is dedicated to problem solving.  However, in individuals with math anxiety, much of this space is taken up by anxious thoughts, thus compromising the individual's ability to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashcraft|first=M. H.|last2=Krause|first2=J. A.|date=2007|title=Working memory, math performance, and math anxiety|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03194059|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=243–248|doi=10.3758/BF03194059|issn=1069-9384|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a frequent reliance in schools on high-stakes and timed testing, where students tend to feel the most anxiety, can lead to lower achievement for math anxious individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scarpello|first=Gary|date=2007|title=Helping Students Get Past Math Anxiety.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ775465|journal=Techniques: Connecting Education and Careers (J1)|language=en|volume=82|issue=6|pages=34–35|issn=1527-1803|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PISA results demonstrate that students experiencing high math anxiety demonstrate mathematics scores that are 34 points lower than students who do not have math anxiety, equivalent to one full year of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/865657364|title=PISA 2012 results. Volume 3, Ready to learn : students' engagement, drive and self-beliefs.|last=|first=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|others=Programme for International Student Assessment.|year=2013|isbn=9789264201170|edition=|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=865657364}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings demonstrate the clear link between math anxiety and reduced levels of achievement, suggesting that alleviating math anxiety may lead to a marked improvement in student achievement.

==Anxiety rating scale==
A rating scale for mathematics anxiety was written about in 1972 by Richardson and Suinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = F.C. | last2 = Suinn | first2 = R.M. | year = 1972 | title = The Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 551–554 | doi=10.1037/h0033456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson and Suinn defined mathematical anxiety as "feelings of apprehension and tension concerning manipulation of numbers and completion of mathematical problems in various contexts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopko | first1 = Derek R. | last2 = McNeil | first2 = Daniel W. | last3 = Lejuez | first3 = C.W. | last4 = Ashcraft | first4 = Mark H. | last5 = Eifert | first5 = Georg H. | last6 = Riel | first6 = Jim | year = 2003 | title = The effects of anxious responding on mental arithmetic and lexical decision task performance | url = | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 17 | issue = 6| pages = 647–665 | doi=10.1016/s0887-6185(02)00240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson and Suinn introduced the MARS (Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale) in 1972.  Elevated scores on the MARS test translate to high math anxiety.  The authors presented the normative data, including a mean score of 215.38 with a standard deviation of 65.29, collected from 397 students that replied to an advertisement for behavior therapy treatment for math anxiety.&lt;ref name="Richardson, F. C. 1972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = F. C. | last2 = Suinn | first2 = R. M. | year = 1972 | title = The mathematics anxiety rating scale: Psychometric data | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 551–554 | doi=10.1037/h0033456}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For test-retest reliability, the Pearson product-moment coefficient was used and a score of 0.85 was calculated, which was favorable and comparable to scores found on other anxiety tests.  Richardson and Suinn validated the construct of this test by sharing previous results from three other studies that were very similar to the results achieved in this study.   They also administered the Differential Aptitude Test, a 10-minute math test including simple to complex problems.

Calculation of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the MARS test and Differential Aptitude Test scores was −0.64 (p &lt; .01), indicating that higher MARS scores relate to lower math test scores and "since high anxiety interferes with performance, and poor performance produces anxiety, this result provides evidence that the MARS does measure mathematics anxiety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = F. C. | last2 = Suinn | first2 = R. M. | year = 1972 | title = The mathematics anxiety rating scale: Psychometric data | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 6| page = 553 |doi=10.1037/h0033456}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This test was intended for use in diagnosing math anxiety, testing efficacy of different math anxiety treatment approaches and possibly designing an anxiety hierarchy to be used in desensitization treatments.&lt;ref name="Richardson, F. C. 1972"/&gt;  The MARS test is of interest to those in counseling psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLeod | first1 = D.B. | year = 1994 | title = Research on Affect and Mathematics Learning in the JRME: 1970 to Present | url = | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 25 | issue = 6| pages = 637–647 | doi=10.2307/749576}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the test is used profusely in math anxiety research.  It is available in several versions of varying length&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Capraro | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Capraro | first2 = R. M. | last3 = Henson | first3 = R. K. | year = 2001 | title = Measurement error of scores on the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale across studies | url = | journal = Educational and Psychological Measurement | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 373–386 | doi=10.1177/00131640121971266}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered psychometrically sound.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, L., &amp; Cobb, R. (1984). Identification of the dimensions and predictors of math anxiety among college students. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Mid-South Educational Research Association (New Orleans, LA, November 16, 1984). ERIC, ED 251320.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other tests are often given to measure different dimensionalities of math anxiety, such as the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales (FSMAS).  The FSMAS evaluates nine specific domains using Likert-type scales: attitude toward success, mathematics as a male domain, mother's attitude, father's attitude, teacher's attitude, confidence in learning mathematics, mathematics anxiety, affectance motivation and mathematics usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenemma | first1 = E. | last2 = Sherman | first2 = J.A. | year = 1976 | title = Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales: Instruments designed to measure attitudes toward the learning of mathematics by females and males | url = | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 324–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the introduction of newer instrumentation, the use of the MARS test appears to be the educational standard for measuring math anxiety due to its specificity and prolific use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = X | year = 1999 | title = A meta-analysis of the relationship between anxiety toward mathematics and achievement in mathematics | url = | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 520–540 | doi=10.2307/749772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Math and culture==
While there are  overarching similarities concerning the acquisition of math skills, researchers have shown that children's mathematical abilities differ across countries. In Canada, students score substantially lower in math problem-solving and operations than students in Korea, India and Singapore. Researchers{{who|date=June 2017}} have conducted thorough comparisons between countries, and have determined that in countries such as Taiwan and Japan, parents place more emphasis on effort rather than one's innate intellectual ability in school success. By parents placing a higher emphasis on effort rather than one's innate intellectual ability they are helping their child develop a [[growth mindset]].&lt;ref&gt;Deck, C. S. (2006). Mindset: The new psychology of success.New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; People who develop a growth mindset believe that everyone has the ability to grow their intellectual ability, learn from their mistakes and become more resilient learners.  Moreover, parents in these countries tend to set higher expectations and standards for their children. In turn, students spend more time on homework and value homework more than American children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stevenson |first1= H.W. |last2= Lee |first2= S. | year = 1990 | title = Contexts of achievement: A study of American, Chinese, and Japanese children | URL = | journal = Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 1–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Math and gender==
Another difference in mathematic abilities often explored in research concerns gender disparities. There has been research examining gender difference in performance on standardized tests across various countries. Beller and Gafni's have shown that children at approximately nine years of age do not show consistent gender difference in relation to math skills. However, in 17 out of the 20 countries examined in this study, 13-year-old boys tended to score higher than girls. Moreover, mathematics is often labeled as a masculine ability; as a result, girls often have low confidence in their math capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How Negative Expectancies and Attitudes Undermine Females' Math Confidence and Performance: A Review of the Literature|last=Gutbezahl|first=Jennifer|year=1995|publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center]]|id=[http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED380279 ED380279]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These gender stereotypes can reinforce low confidence in girls and can cause math anxiety as research has shown that performance on standardized math tests is affected by one's confidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dar-Nimrod | first1 = Ian | last2 = Heine | first2 = Steven J. | year = 2006 | title = Exposure to Scientific Theories Affects Women's Math Performance | url = http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/tmp/Applications/WomenMath.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = | page = 435 | doi=10.1126/science.1131100 | pmid=17053140}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2006). As a result, educators have been trying to abolish this stereotype by fostering confidence in math in all students in order to avoid math anxiety.&lt;ref name="Kail, R.V. 2005"&gt;Kail, R.V., &amp; Zolner, T. (2005). Children. Toronto: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Math and women==
Mathematical anxiety is often most directly related to women as younger female scholars are thought{{By whom|date=November 2018}} to develop anxiety towards mathematics and sciences when they become more interested in social relations in their teen years. It is thought{{By whom|date=November 2018}} that women experience more anxiety in mathematics as a group than men as a result of societal pressures and views of women and mathematics{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. It has also been suggested {{By whom|date=November 2018}}that in primary elementary years, if female students have an anxious female math teacher, they are more likely to confirm the math anxiety as a gender stereotype. Studies have shown {{Which|date=November 2018}} that (&gt;90%) of early elementary school teachers in the United States are female. These female teachers' anxieties relate to an increase in girls internalizing the stereotypes that "boys are good at math", hindering a girls' math achievement via the beliefs about who is good at math{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Girls are more likely than boys to take notice of their female teachers "negatives and fears about math", which could negatively influence their future pursuit of the subject.&lt;ref name="Bielock, Sian 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bielock | first1 = Sian | last2 = Gunderson | first2 = Elizabeth | last3 = Ramirez | first3 = Gerardo | last4 = Levine | first4 = Susan | year = 2010 | title = Female teachers' math anxiety affects girls' math achievement | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0910967107| journal = PNAS | volume = 107 | issue = 5| pages = 1860–1863 | pmc = 2836676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One method to help address this issue is ensuring that teaching programs are reinforcing positive attitudes towards math, and helping teacher candidates solidify their grasp on mathematics.&lt;ref name="Bielock, Sian 2010"/&gt;

Large amounts of research {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} has shown that women are aware of the stereotype surrounding their own math abilities, thus resulting in women's test scores to be lower than that of their male counterparts. The researchers {{Who|date=November 2018}}explain that it is not the result of our biology (genes) but rather a social effect as exhibited in their experiments. Based on the results{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the researchers doing the experiment believe that gender stereotype threat could be a key factor in explaining the difference in women and men's performance on math exams. Stereotype threat based on gender is often seen as a result of gender references made during an exam and can profoundly affect the results of the test{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. This is known as gender labeling and was demonstrated in a research study{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} in which the researchers create two experiments to test their theories. In the first exam they included a 33% split between female, male or neutral questions.  The results showed that both men and women answered "male labeled" questions with better proficiency than the other two types of questions. Male labeled questions would include male names or references to "he" or "him" whereas female labeled questions would include women's names or "she" or "her". The results found that even slight references to gender by including a male vs. a female's name in a question could impact test performance. Although this sort of gender labeling seems to affect men positively, women often seem to do worse on exams including these types of questions.&lt;ref name="Walsh, Margaret 1994"&gt;Walsh, Margaret, Hickey, Crystal, Duffy, Jim. (1994)  Influence of item content and stereotype situation on gender differences in mathematical problem solving. Sex Roles, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, stereotype threat is confounded in situations where the student is required to tell their gender at the beginning of the exam versus the end of it{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Studies {{Which|date=November 2018}}have shown that gender stereotype threat is reduced greatly when women are asked to tell their gender at the end of an exam. Stereotype threat can interfere with performance, affecting men positively but women negatively{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

==Math pedagogy==
The principles of mathematics are generally understood at an early age; preschoolers can comprehend the majority of principles underlying counting. By kindergarten, it is common for children to use counting in a more sophisticated manner by adding and subtracting numbers. While kindergarteners tend to use their fingers to count, this habit is soon abandoned and replaced with a more refined and efficient strategy; children begin to perform addition and subtraction mentally at approximately six years of age. When children reach approximately eight years of age, they can retrieve answers to mathematical equations from memory. With proper instruction, normally functioning children acquire these basic mathematical skills and are able to solve more complex mathematical problems with more sophisticated training.&lt;ref name="Kail, R.V. 2005"/&gt; (Kail &amp; Zolner, 2005).

High risk teaching styles are often explored to gain a better understanding of math anxiety. Goulding, Rowland, and Barber&lt;ref&gt;Goulding, M., Rowland, T., Barber, T. (2002). Does it matter? Primary teachers trainees' subject knowledge in mathematics. [[British Educational Research Association|British Educational Research Journal]], 28, 689-704.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) suggest that there are linkages between a teacher's lack of subject knowledge and ability to  plan teaching material effectively.  These findings suggest that teachers that do not have a sufficient background in mathematics may struggle with the development of comprehensive lesson plans for their students.  Similarly, Laturner's research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laturner | first1 = R.J. | year = 2002 | title = Teachers' academic preparation and commitment to teach math and science | url = | journal = Teaching and Teacher Education | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 653–663 | doi=10.1016/s0742-051x(02)00025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) shows that teachers with certification in math are more likely to be passionate and committed about teaching math than those without certification.  However, those without certification vary in their commitment to the profession depending on coursework preparation.

Moreover, a study conducted by Kawakami, Steele, Cifa, Phills, and Dovidio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kawakami | first1 = K. | last2 = Steele | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Cifa | first3 = C. | last4 = Phills | first4 = C. E. | last5 = Dovidio | first5 = J. F. | year = 2008 | title = Approaching math increases math = me, math = pleasant | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 818–825 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2007.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2008) examined attitudes towards math and behavior during math examinations.  The study examined the effect of extensive training in teaching women to approach math. The results showed that women who were trained to approach rather than avoid math showed a positive implicit attitude towards math.  These findings were only consistent with women low in initial identification with math.  This study was replicated with women who were either encouraged to approach math or who received neutral training.  Results were consistent and demonstrated that women taught to approach math had an implicit positive attitude and completed more math problems than women taught to approach math in a neutral manner.

Johns, Schmader, and Martens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johns | first1 = M. | last2 = Schmader | first2 = T. | last3 = Martens | first3 = A. | year = 2005 | title = Knowing is half the battle: Teaching stereotype threat as a means of improving women's math performance | doi = 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 175–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005) conducted a study in which they examined the effect of teaching stereotype threat as a means of improving women's math performance. The researchers concluded that women tended to perform worse than men when problems were described as math equations.  However, women did not differ from men when the test sequence was described as problem solving or in a condition in which they learned about stereotype threats.  This research has practical implications. The results suggested that teaching students about stereotype threat could offer a practical means of reducing its detrimental effects and lead to an improvement in a girl's performance and mathematical ability.  Concluding that educating female teachers about stereotype threat can reduce its negative effects in the classroom.

==Common beliefs==
A view associated with [[Francis Galton]] author of ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDermott|first1=Ray|last2=Goldman|first2=Shelley|last3=Varenne|first3=Hervé|title=The Cultural Work of Learning Disabilities|journal=Educational Researcher|date=June 5, 2006|volume=35|issue=6|pages=12–17|url=http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/texts/mcdrmr0p006cultwork.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2016|doi=10.3102/0013189x035006012}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that "when asked to explain why some children do better in math than others, Asian children, their teachers, and their parents point to hard work, their American counterparts to ability."&lt;ref&gt;Tobias, Shiela, ''Overcoming Math Anxiety''. (New York:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1993), page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Margaret Murray, female mathematicians in the United States have almost always been a minority.  Although the exact difference fluctuates with the times as she has explored in her book [''Women Becoming Mathematicians: Creating a Professional Identity in Post-World War II America''].&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;Murray M. A. M., ''Women Becoming Mathematicians: Creating a Professional Identity in Post-World War II America'' (Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; "Since 1980, women have earned over 17 percent of the mathematics doctorates.... [In The United States]".&lt;ref name="murray" /&gt; The trends in gender are by no means clear, but perhaps parity is still a way to go. Since 1995, studies have shown that the gender gap favored males in most mathematical standardized testing with boys outperforming girls in 15 out of 28 countries. However, as of 2015 the gender gap has almost been reversed, showing an increase in female presence. This being caused by women steadily increasing their performance on math and science testing and enrollment, but also from males losing ground at the same time. This role reversal can largely be associated with the gender normative stereotypes that are found in the STEM field, deeming "who math is for" and "who STEM careers are for". These stereotypes can fuel mathematical anxiety that is already present among young female populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparks|first1=Sarah|title=TIMSS: A Closer Look at Gender Gaps in Math and Science|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2016/11/timss_why_is_the_us_gender_gap.html?_ga=1.57034858.1100632418.1480614526|accessdate=4 December 2016|agency=Education Week|publisher=Education Week|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus parity will take more work to overcome mathematical anxiety and this is one reason for women in mathematics being role models for younger women.

== In schools==
{{POV check|section|date=September 2013}}

===Causes===

Students often develop mathematical anxiety in schools, often as a result of learning from teachers who are themselves anxious about their mathematical abilities in certain areas.  Typical examples of areas where mathematics teachers are often incompetent or semi-competent include [[fractions]], [[long division|(long)]] [[Division (mathematics)|division]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] "with [[Mathematical proof|proofs]]", [[calculus]], and [[topology]]. In many countries, would-be math teachers are required only to obtain passing grades of 51% in mathematics exams, so that a math student who has failed to understand 49% of the math syllabus throughout his or her education can, and often does, become a math teacher. His or her fears and lack of understanding then pass naturally to his or her students. As [[John Taylor Gatto]]&lt;ref&gt;Gatto, John Taylor .""An Underground History of American Education."" {{cite web |url=http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315065124/http://johntaylorgatto.com/underground/index.htm |archivedate=2007-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated at length, modern Western schools were deliberately designed during the late 19th century to create an environment which is ideal for fostering fear and anxiety, and for preventing or delaying learning.

The role of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] has been suggested as having an impact in the development of the anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Insecure attachment is associated with math anxiety in middle childhood|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01596/abstract|journal = Front Psychol|date = 2015-01-01|pages = 1596|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01596|first = Guy|last = Bosmans|first2 = Bert|last2 = De Smedt|volume=6|pmid=26528233|pmc=4606049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with an [[insecure attachment]] style were more likely to demonstrate the anxiety.

Math is usually taught as a right and wrong subject and as if getting the right answer were paramount.  In contrast to most subjects, mathematics problems almost always have a right answer.  Additionally, the subject is often taught as if there were a right way to solve the problem and any other approaches would be wrong, even if students got the right answer.  When learning, understanding the concepts should be paramount, but with a right/wrong approach to teaching math, students are encouraged not to try, not to experiment, not to find [[algorithms]] that work for them, and not to take risks.  "Teachers benefit children most when they encourage them to share their thinking process and justify their answers out loud or in writing as they perform math operations. ... With less of an emphasis on right or wrong and more of an emphasis on process, teachers can help alleviate students' anxiety about math".&lt;ref&gt;Furner, Joseph M., Berman, Barbara T., "Math anxiety: Overcoming a major obstacle to the improvement of student math performance", ''Childhood Education'', Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

While teaching of many subjects has changed from [[rote learning|rote memorization]] to the current [[Constructivist teaching methods|Constructivist]] approach, math is frequently taught with a rote learning [[behaviorist]] approach.  That is,
* A problem set is introduced
* A solution technique is introduced
* Practice problems are repeated until mastery is achieved
Constructivist theory says the learning and knowledge is the student's creation, yet rote learning and a right/wrong approach to teaching math ensures that it is external to the student.

===Solutions===

There have been many studies that show parent involvement in developing a child's educational processes is essential. A student success in school is increased if their parents are involved in their education both at home and school (Henderson &amp; Map, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, A. T. &amp; Mapp, K. L. (2002), A New Wave of Evidence. The Impact of School,Family, and Community Connections on Student Achievement, Austin: Southwest Educational Development Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, one of the easiest ways to reduce math anxiety is for the parent to be more involved in their child's education. In addition, research has shown that a parent's perception on mathematics influences their child's perception and achievement in mathematics (Yee &amp; Eccles, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Yee DK, Eccles JS. 1988. Parent perceptions and attributions for children's math achievement. Sex Roles
19:317–33.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if a parent makes it apparent that they do not enjoy mathematics or that they are not good at mathematics, this can influence the way in which their child views mathematics.

Furthermore, studies by [[Herbert Ginsburg|Herbert P. Ginsburg]], Columbia University, show the influence of parents' and teachers' attitudes on "'the child's expectations in that area of learning.'... It is less the actual teaching and more the attitude and expectations of the teacher or parents that count".  This is further supported by a survey of Montgomery County, Maryland students who "pointed to their parents as the primary force behind the interest in mathematics".&lt;ref name="zaslavsky"&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia, ''Fear of Math'', pages 198-199. (New Brunswick, New Jersey:  Rutgers University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claudia Zaslavsky]]&lt;ref name="zaslavsky" /&gt; contends that math has two components.  The first component, commonly focused on in many schools, is to calculate the answer.  This component also has two subcomponents, namely the answer and the process or method used to determine the answer.  Focusing more on the process or method enables students to make mistakes, but not 
'fail at math'.  The second component is to understand the mathematical concepts that underlay the problem being studied.  "... and in this respect studying mathematics is much more like studying, say, music or painting than it is like studying history or biology."

Amongst others supporting this viewpoint is the work of Dr. [[Eugene Geist]], Associate Professor at Ohio University – Athens, Ohio and an early childhood education specialist.&lt;ref&gt;"Episode 54: Math Anxiety – Causes and Cures", by Michael on April 13, 2008, http://www.thepsychfiles.com/2008/04/episode-54-math-anxiety-causes-and-cures/ September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Geist's recommendations include focusing on the concepts rather than the right answer and letting students work on their own and discuss their solutions before the answer is given.  Emphasis is given that young people hate to be wrong and hate situations where they can be embarrassed by being wrong.

[[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) (1989, 1995b) suggestions for teachers seeking to prevent math anxiety include:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Accommodating for different learning styles
* Creating a variety of testing environments
* Designing positive experiences in math classes
* Refraining from tying self-esteem to success with math
* Emphasizing that everyone makes mistakes in mathematics
* Making math relevant
* Letting students have some input into their own evaluations
* Allowing for different social approaches to learning mathematics
* Emphasizing the importance of original, quality thinking rather than rote manipulation of formulas
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hackworth (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Hackworth, R. D. (1992). Moth anxiety reduction. Clearwater, FL: H &amp; H.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the following activities can help in reducing and mitigating mathematical anxiety:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Discuss and write about math feelings; 
* Become acquainted with good math instruction, as well as study techniques; 
* Recognize what type of information needs to be learned; 
* Be an active learner, and create problem-solving techniques; 
* Evaluate your own learning; 
* Develop calming/positive ways to deal with fear of math, including visualization, positive messages, relaxation techniques, frustration breaks;
* Use gradual, repeated success to build math confidence in students
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Math (and Statistics) Therapy is a combination of coaching and counseling, provided for adults by people with credentials in both counseling and  math education.  In Math Therapy the reasons for anxiety are addressed, as well as the mathematical skills which are lacking. New coping skills are introduced and practiced, so that fear, distaste or other negative emotions do not block math (or statistics) learning.

There are several anxiety reducing techniques that teachers can teach their children and practice periodically throughout the year.  Teachers will need to learn these techniques and encourage the students to practice them at home and to use them prior to testing or when feeling anxious during math class.
 
Several studies have shown that relaxation techniques can be used to help alleviate anxiety related to mathematics.  In her workbook Conquering Math Anxiety, 3rd edition, Cynthia Arem offers specific strategies to reduce math avoidance and anxiety.  One strategy she advocates for is relaxation exercises and indicates that  by practicing relaxation techniques on a regularly basis for 10–20 minutes students can significantly can reduce their anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arem|first=C.|title=Conquering Math Anxiety|year=2010|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, CA|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
Dr. Edmundo Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation taken from the book Mental Toughness Training for Sports, Loehr (1986) can be used in a modified form to reduce anxiety as posted on the website HypnoGenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HypnoGenesis.:  Magazine for Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy|first=HypnoGenesis:|title=The Progressive Muscle Relaxation of Dr. Edmund Jacobson|url=http://www.hypnos.co.uk/hypnomag/jacobson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visualization has also been used effectively to help reduce math anxiety.  Arem has a chapter that deals with reducing test anxiety and advocates the use visualization.  In her chapter titled Conquer Test Anxiety (Chapter 9) she has specific exercises devoted to visualization techniques to help the student feel calm and confident during testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arem|first=C.|title=Conquering Math Anxiety, 3rd Ed.|year=2010|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, CA|pages=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown students learn best when they are [[active learning|active]] rather than passive learners.&lt;ref&gt;Spikell,M .''Teaching Mathematics With Manipulatives: A Resource of Activities for K-12 Teacher.'' (New York: Allyn and Bacon, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theory of multiple intelligences]] suggests that there is a need for addressing different learning styles. Math lessons can be tailored for [[Visual learning|visual]]/[[Spatial memory|spatial]], logical/mathematics, musical, [[Auditory learning|auditory]], [[Kinesthetic learning|body/kinesthetic]], interpersonal and intrapersonal and verbal/linguistic learning styles. This theory of learning styles has never been demonstrated to be true in controlled trials.  Studies show no evidence to support tailoring lessons to an individual students learning style to be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00091383.2010.503139&lt;/ref&gt;

New concepts can be taught through play acting, cooperative groups, visual aids, hands on activities or information technology.&lt;ref name="curtain-phillips"&gt;Curtain-Phillips, M. ''Math Attack: How to Reduce Math Anxiety in the Classroom, at Work and in Everyday Personal Use.'' (Atlanta: Curtain-Phillips Publishing, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; To help with learning statistics, there are many applets found on the Internet that help students learn about many things from probability distributions to linear regression. These applets are commonly used in introductory statistics classes, as many students benefit from using them.{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}{{who|date=November 2013}}

Active learners ask critical questions, such as: ''Why do we do it this way, and not that way''? Some teachers may find these questions annoying or difficult to answer, and indeed may have been trained to respond to such questions with hostility and contempt, designed to instill fear. Better teachers respond eagerly to these questions, and use them to help the students deepen their understand by examining alternative methods so the students can choose for themselves which method they prefer. This process can result in meaningful class discussions.  Talking is the way in which students increase their understanding and command of math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Talking Mathematics: Studies of Teaching and Learning in School|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, New York|pages=163–189|author=Rittenhouse|edition=P.|authorlink=The Teacher's Role in Mathematical Conversation: Stepping In and Stepping Out.|editor=Lampert, M |editor2=Blunk, M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers can emphasize the importance of original thinking rather than rote manipulation of formulas.  This can be done through class conversations.  Teachers can give students insight as to why they learn certain content by asking students questions such as "what purpose is served by solving this problem?" and "why are we being asked to learn this?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklin|first=Margaret|title=Add-ventures for girls: building math confidence, Junior High teacher's guide.|year=2006|publisher=WEEA Publishing Center|location=Newton, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective journals help students develop metacognitive skills by having them think about their understanding.  According to Pugalee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pugalee|first=D.|title=A Comparison of Verbal and Written Descriptions of Students' Problem Solving Processes|journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics|year=2004|volume=55|issue=3|pages=27–47|doi=10.1023/b:educ.0000017666.11367.c7}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing helps students organize their thinking which helps them better understand mathematics.  Moreover, writing in mathematics classes helps students problem solve and improve mathematical reasoning. When  students know how to use mathematical reasoning, they are less anxious about solving problems.

However, there is still a large part of school math teaching which consists of memorization, repetition, and mechanically performed operations. [[Times tables]] are one example, wherein rote learning is essential to mathematics performance. When a student fails to learn the times tables at a young age, they can experience math anxiety later, when all the students' classmates can remember the tables but they cannot.

Children learn best when math is taught in a way that is relevant to their everyday lives. Children enjoy experimenting. To learn mathematics in any depth, students should be engaged in exploring, conjecturing, and thinking, as well as in rote learning of rules and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marilyncurtainphillips.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MonoMouse''' is a handheld electronic magnifier manufactured by Bierley.com Limited, designed to help people with a visual impairment to read printed text or images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.califa.org/monomouse.php#tab1 California Libraries], California Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name="BBC Website"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4412283.stm#tab1 BBC], BBC review&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally developed by Ian Bierley in 2003 for use by his mother who suffered from [[Glaucoma]], and then later released as a commercial product supplied through opticians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opticianonline.net/Articles/2005/07/22/13746/Bierley's+MonoMouse+.html#tab2 Optician Article]&lt;/ref&gt; The MonoMouse is shaped like an oversized [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]] and connects to any television through either the [[SCART]] connector in Europe or the [[RCA connector]] in the rest of the world.

It is an example of [[Assistive technology]] to enable people with eye conditions like [[Macular degeneration]] to read printed text and see printed images.

'''National Heritage Academies, Inc.''' ('''NHA''') is a for-profit [[education management organization]] headquartered in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhaschools.com/Pages/default.aspx|title=Home page|publisher=National Heritage Academies|accessdate=2011-11-27|quote=Find Us 3850 Broadmoor Ave SE, Suite 201 Grand Rapids, MI 49512}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2018-19 school year, NHA operates 87 [[charter school]]s in nine states: Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, New York, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana, and Wisconsin.  NHA is the largest charter school operator in Michigan and one of the largest charter school operators in the United States.&lt;ref name=Dixonpublicmoney&gt;"[http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2014/12/14/charters-national-heritage-academies-tax-dollars-school-contents/20357559/ Public money for schools buys private property]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6bDPqOJid Archive]). ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''. December 14, 2014. Retrieved on September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; NHA schools are prominent among charter institutions for employing the brick and mortar or traditional school concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://michiganpeninsulanews.com/news/8092-university-michigan-study-finds-nha-charter-school-organization-delivering-substantial-student-gains/|title=The Peninsula - University of Michigan study finds NHA charter school organization delivering substantial student gains|date=2018-04-09|work=The Peninsula|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

NHA was formed in 1995 by entrepreneur J. C. Huizenga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moroney|first1=Kyle|title=National Heritage founder J.C. Huizenga talks about charter chain's 20th anniversary|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/09/national_heritage_academies_fo.html|website=mLIVE|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. C. Huizenga was founding chairman of the Huizenga Manufacturing Group. It owns and operates six flourishing enterprises that manufacture several innovative products. His entrepreneurial spirit encouraged the man to etch a space in history as an educational reformist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thenaf.org/chapters/socal-home/socal-hall-of-fame/j-c-huizenga/|title=J.C. Huizenga - The NAF|work=The NAF|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

In 2015, National Heritage Academies managed charter schools enrolled over 58,000 students on a ''[[Charter management organization#Vendor operated school|vendor operated school]]'' basis.&lt;ref name="jw2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodworth|first1=James L|title=Charter Management Organizations 2017|url=https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/CMO%20FINAL.pdf|publisher=Center for Research on Education Outcomes|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

NHA managed charter schools are publicly funded and charge no tuition.  They are authorized by state-approved institutions such as universities and school boards, and therefore have no geographic boundaries. The schools focus on college preparedness and generally serve students from kindergarten through eighth grade, with some schools also offering pre-kindergarten.This start-up culture dictated the beginning of charters in 1997, when community organizers, educators and local nonprofits opened institutions of learning to envisage their vision of public education. Charters still develop from local programs. Yet, what supporters describe as the “charter school movement” was backed up by networks of schools which included for-profit chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article178438001.html|title=How companies can turn a profit running public schools|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
According to a 2017 study by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes, students in NHA schools were found to show improved spring-to-spring academic growth in the subjects of reading and math, compared with their traditional public school peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterschools.org/press-room/2017/06/26/michigan%E2%80%99s-largest-charter-school-operator-shows-phenomenal-student|accessdate=2017-11-19|title=Michigan’s Largest Charter School Operator Shows Phenomenal Student Achievement in New CREDO Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHA schools use the NWEA test as a measure of student performance. The Northwest Evaluation Association has instituted an assessment process for both mathematics and reading. This flexible and computerized assessment is administered to provide data on students' growth in the fields of Math and Reading for teachers to use it in informing instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.a2schools.org/domain/1227|title=NWEA Assessment System / Home|website=www.a2schools.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oralism''' is the [[Education of the deaf|education of deaf student]]s through [[oral language]] by using [[lip reading]], speech, and mimicking the mouth shapes and breathing patterns of speech.&lt;ref name=Eyes&gt;Through Deaf Eyes. Diane Garey, Lawrence R. Hott. DVD, PBS (Direct), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Oralism came into popular use in the United States around the late 1860s. In 1867, the [[Clarke School for the Deaf]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] was the first school to start teaching in this manner.&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; Oralism and its contrast, [[manualism]], manifest differently in [[deaf education]] and are a source of controversy for involved communities.&lt;ref name="Train" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talking" /&gt; Oralism should not be confused with Listening and Spoken Language, a technique for teaching deaf children that emphasizes the child's perception of auditory signals from hearing aids and/or cochlear implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Estes|first1=Ellen L.|title=Listening, language, and learning: Skills of highly qualified Listening and Spoken Language Specialists in educational settings|journal=Volta Review|volume=110|issue=2|date=June 2010|pages=169–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Early 16th century ===
Since the beginning of formal deaf education in the 18th century in the United States, manualism and oralism have been on opposing sides of a heated debate that continues to this day.&lt;ref name=Winefield&gt;Winefield, Richard. Never the Twain Shall Meet. Washington, DC: [[Gallaudet University]] Press, 1987. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oralism as the systematic education of deaf people began in Spain in the mid-1500s and was the byproduct of socioeconomic motives.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  The church barred deaf people from Holy Communion because they could not confess aloud.  Deaf people were also prohibited from inheriting their family's wealth; therefore, to preserve the family wealth, deaf heirs in Spain were sent to [[Pedro Ponce de León|Pedro Ponce de Leon]] after hearing that he taught a deaf man to talk in [[San Salvador de Oña|San Salvador Monastery]] in [[Oña]].&lt;ref name=Train&gt;Cohen, Leah. Train Go Sorry. New York, New York: First Vintage Books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Oralism provided members of the privileged classes with deaf children a way to channel their children's education and an opportunity to keep them away from the deaf community. Speaking has been equated with the higher classes and higher intellect, signing with the lower.&lt;ref name=Train/&gt;

=== Late 19th century ===

==== Schools ====
Before the [[Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech|Clarke School for the Deaf]] (now the Clarke School for Hearing and Speech) made its mark in deaf American education in the 1860s, there was a popular support of [[Deaf education|manualism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48211543|title=Forbidden signs : American culture and the campaign against sign language|last=C.|first=Baynton, Douglas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226039640|oclc=48211543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manual language soon became a less popular choice for [[deaf education]] due to the new [[Darwinism|Darwinist]] perspective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clarke School for the Deaf in 1867 became a "mainstream service" for deaf students through creating a "learn to listen" mentality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was done through the proper training of educators in auditory/oral education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since its start, [[Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech|Clarke School]] has expanded and provided support for oral communication within deaf education and policy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Policy ====
In relation to the early 16th century oralism in Spain, 19th century oralists viewed oral language as a superior form of communication.&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard|Gardiner Green Hubbard]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Horace Mann]],&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; [[Samuel Gridley Howe]]&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; and [[Alexander Graham Bell]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agbell.org/FamilyNeedsAssessment/|title=Introduction {{!}} AG Bell {{!}} Listening and Spoken Language|website=www.agbell.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; were popular supporters of oralism and its impact on deaf education and services. Until the end of the 19th century, many educators of deaf America were deaf themselves.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[https://wfdeaf.org/news/21st-international-congress-on-the-education-of-the-deaf-iced-in-july-2010-in-vancouver-canada/ "21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) in July 2010 in Vancouver, Canada"]. ''World Federation of the Deaf''. 2016. Retrieved March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=February 2018|reason=No mention on this page of the hearing status of deaf educators.}} However, oralists like [[Alexander Graham Bell]] began to wield increasing influence.&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell|Bell]] and others believed in deaf [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] with the [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstream]] hearing world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bell also believed that sign language was an instrument of imprisonment and that its use prevented the "gesturer" from being a "true American"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Disability History of the United States|last=Nielson|first=Kim|publisher=Beacon Press Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8070-2204-7|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Quotations and attributions are not cited as attributed to Bell|date=February 2018}}. Bell had no opinion regarding whether or whom deaf people should marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Alexander G.|title=Marriage|journal=Science|volume=17|issue=424|date=1891|pages=160–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, negative eugenicists sought to stop the spread of "bad genes" through invasive measures such as mandatory placement in institutions or sterilization. Bell believed oralism was "an attractive option to sterilization"&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenwald|first=Brian H.|date=Spring 2009|title=The Real "Toll" of A.G. Bell: Lessons about Eugenics|jstor=26190555|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=9|pages=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=article is commentary/opinion, not fact-based|date=February 2018}}. To Bell, implementation of oralism meant the possibility of a mainstream and "normal" life for deaf individuals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1878, International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) met in Paris to discuss the use of [[sign language]] and other issues within deaf education.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the congregation, no Deaf members were allowed to testify. In 1880, the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf|International Congress on the Education of the Deaf]] (ICED) met again in [[Milan]] with 164 educators attending with one of them being [[Hearing loss|deaf]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This meeting created the solely oralist classroom preventing any form of [[sign language]] from being used.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After the Milan conference, the Deaf community referred to this time in history as "the dark ages for deaf education in America".&lt;ref name="Eyes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt;

==== Classroom ====
Hearing educators who could not sign replaced deaf teachers and, by the mid-20th century, eighty percent of American secondary schools for the deaf used the oral method exclusively.&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;Fox, Margalit. Talking Hands.  Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks. New York, New York: 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some strategies, such as [[Total Communication]] or [[Simultaneous Communication|SimCom]], saw classes conducted in a mixture of spoken and signed English with the teacher signing along, in English word order as they delivered their lecture. For example, "is" "was" and "the", which are not used in sign, were spelled out by the teachers using the manual alphabet.&lt;ref name="Talking" /&gt; Students were taught using the [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] method, which taught them how to speak and lip read.&lt;ref name="Train" /&gt; Oralists believed that signs were no more than gross holistic gestures, which stood for English words in a one-to-one correspondence. Sentences in sign were thought to have no grammar. The facial expressions, such as exaggerated movements of the mouth, tongue, eyes, and lips, suggesting grimacing or excessive emotional display, triggered horror in hearing people. Students were asked to stop moving their faces when they signed, which is equivalent to asking hearing people to speak in declarative sentences uttered in monotone.&lt;ref name="Train" /&gt;

=== 20th century ===

==== Movement towards manualism ====
Even though students were not allowed to use manual signs within the classroom, many deaf students preferred manual signs and used them frequently in their dorm rooms at residential schools for the deaf.&lt;ref name="Eyes" /&gt; Some deaf children were considered "oral failures" because they could not pick up oral language.{{citation needed|reason=where is the quotation 'oral failures' from?|date=February 2018}} Others thought that the techniques of oralism actually limited them on what they were taught because they always had to concentrate on the way the words were formed, not what they meant.&lt;ref name="Eyes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt;

Leaders of the manualist movement, including [[Edward M. Gallaudet]], argued against the teaching of oralism because it restricted the ability of deaf students to communicate in what was considered their native language.&lt;ref name=Winefield/&gt;  Moreover, "attempts to eliminate sign language were tantamount to stripping them of their identity, their community, and their culture."&lt;ref name=Winefield/&gt;

==== Policy change ====
The retraction of laws forbidding the use of sign language in the classroom occurred in 2010 with the International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Deaf grassroots activists and the planning committee of ICED created a solution to provide proper education to the deaf globally.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Modern usage==
Oralism is no longer used to teach language or communication in the United States. Parental use of the oral approach typically stems from parental desire for their child to use a spoken language to communicate with the majority hearing population. They also feel the use of a spoken language will further their child's literacy and written language skills in the classroom. While some researches believed that success of the oral approach in a classroom setting had not been fully evaluated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=JAbzF41mwmkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=oralism+and+language+acquisition+&amp;ots=bIst47o2bS&amp;sig=ij8gg-bDHrkaOFF-UQJ_pfxDEQI#v=snippet&amp;q=spoken%20language%20&amp;f=false|title=Issues in Deaf Education|last=Swanwick|first=Ruth|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136619977|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent research has demonstrated that oral education using Listening and Spoken Language can provide most deaf children with spoken language skills that are equivalent to those of their hearing peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geers|first1=Anne|journal=Pediatrics|title=Early Sign Language Exposure and Cochlear Implantation Benefits|volume=140|issue=1|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oral schools and their mission ===
A strong supporter of oral schools in the United States is the Oberkotter Foundation, whose mission is "Empowering children who are deaf or hard of hearing to reach their full potential by providing leadership and funding in listening and spoken language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oberkotterfoundation.org/about-us-2/|title=About Us|date=2016-04-22|work=Oberkotter Foundation®|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides financial support to institutions that demonstrate a focus on developing skills in listening and using oral language for deaf individuals. This is not limited to oral schools themselves, but also extends to universities, social support programs, and medical centers that are deemed supportive of spoken language development in deaf children.

=== Efficacy ===
There have been few quantitative evaluations regarding the long-term outcomes of oral programs for deaf individuals, but those that do exist tend to study this in relation to children with cochlear implants. One study compared the English development of deaf children with a cochlear implant versus what the English development might have been without the implant. English development was greater and more successful for the implanted deaf child than that of the non-implanted child based on the implementation of a predictive model. The predictive model employs age, residual hearing, and communication mode used by the child to predict the language development. Although deaf implanted children are already at a disadvantage for English development when compared to their hearing counterparts, the implant, on average, reduced what could have been an even larger deficit had the child not been implanted (based on the predictive model). The authors recommend implanting the child as early as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svirsky|first=Mario A.|last2=Robbins|first2=Amy M.|last3=Iler Kirk|first3=Karen|last4=Pisoni|first4=David B.|last5=Miyamoto|first5=Richard T.|date=March 2000|title=Language Development in Profoundly Deaf Children with Cochlear Implants|jstor=40063514|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=2|pages=153–158|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00231|pmc=3429133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies did not consider how a non-implanted child exposed to a signed language and a [[Bilingual–bicultural education|bilingual/bicultural education]] could develop English skills in relation to a hearing child’s English development. Multiple studies find that by ensuring a deaf child has access to American Sign Language, their overall academic performance is better than those who are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/MTMEone2.html|title=More Than Meets the Eye|website=gupress.gallaudet.edu|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication in oral-deaf students without cochlear implants is typically less frequent and less complex than hearing peers of the same age. These expressed communications are less clear than that of their hearing peers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299100030_Communication_of_oral_deaf_and_normally_hearing_children_at_36_months_of_age|title=Communication of oral deaf and normally hearing children at 36 months of age (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, these communications are typical of the language skills seen much earlier in their hearing counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite efforts to encourage the sole reliance on speech and spoken language in oral schools, some oral-deaf individuals developed sign systems among themselves in non-supervised settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anglin-Jaffe|first=Hannah|date=2013-05-01|title=Signs of Resistance: Peer Learning of Sign Languages Within ‘Oral’ Schools for the Deaf|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11217-012-9350-3|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=261–271|doi=10.1007/s11217-012-9350-3|issn=0039-3746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, oral-deaf children often used manual gestures/signs simultaneously or in addition to vocalizations during expressive communications at home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some studies have called into question the role of developing spoken language skills in relation to developing reading skills. One study in particular demonstrated that while individuals who became deaf before developing spoken language did show a decreased ability to differentiate between the [[Phonology|phonological]] properties of a language, they showed equal capability of recognizing and understanding the orthographic properties of what they were reading.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Paul|date=2007-08-01|title=The Role of Phonology in the Word Decoding Skills of Poor Readers: Evidence from Individuals with Prelingual Deafness or Diagnosed Dyslexia|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10882-007-9057-5|journal=Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=385–408|doi=10.1007/s10882-007-9057-5|issn=1056-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, compared to their hearing counterparts, the deaf individuals showed an increased rate of written word processing skills as they increased in age. Altogether, this research provided evidence contrary to the belief that spoken skills are critical to the development of reading skills, and further proposes that educational approaches should include a stronger focus on building awareness of written language forms separate from the related aural aspects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is little existing research on the social, professional, and mental health of deaf individuals using oral methods in comparison to those using other methods of education and communication. However, some studies suggest that social-emotional outcomes for deaf children who use cochlear implants and spoken language are statistically significantly higher than those of their signing deaf counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moog|first1=Jean|title=Psychosocial adjustment in adolescents who have used cochlear implants since preschool|journal=Ear and Hearing|volume=32|issue=1suppl|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Percy-Smith|first1=Lone|title=Factors that affect the social well-being of children with cochlear implants|journal=Cochlear Implants International|volume=9|issue=4|pages=199–214|date=December 2008|doi=10.1179/cim.2008.9.4.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also was no accurate predictor of oralism's success in the classroom.&lt;ref name="sk.sagepub.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-deaf-studies-encyclopedia/i3490.xml|title=SAGE Reference - Oralism, Psychological Effects of|website=sk.sagepub.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social ===
Deaf children growing up in an oral setting are likely to experience cognitive and developmental delays as a result of a deprivation of natural signed-language.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The decision to place a child in an oral setting, however, likely stems from pressure parents feel to do so from a doctor or medical practitioner.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Pressure is then said to be placed on deaf children, as they are reported to feel embarrassed if they do not master both lip-reading and spoken English.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} These delays are also not only academic, but also social. Deaf children in an oral setting may feel depressed, anxious and experience aloneness and embarrassment as a result of such language deprivation.&lt;ref name="sk.sagepub.com"/&gt;

The '''Oslo School of Architecture and Design''' ({{lang-no|Arkitektur- og designhøgskolen i Oslo}}, '''AHO''') is an autonomous institution within the Norwegian university system. The School offers a unique research-based education with a strong international standing within the fields of architecture, urbanism, design and landscape architecture

AHO offers three full-time masters's programmes: Master of Architecture, Master of Design and Master of Landscape Architecture - the last programme is offered in Oslo and at the Arctic University in Tromsø. The school also offers post-professional Master’s courses in Urbanism and Architectural Conservation. AHO offers a single type of doctoral degree, the Doctor of Philosophy.

==History==
The school was established directly after [[World War II]] as a «crisis course» for students of architecture who were unable to finish their degree due to the outbreak of the war. Prior to this, the only Norwegian option for obtaining an architectural degree was at [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (NTH) in [[Trondheim]].

All through the first half of the twentieth century, a group of architects had worked hard towards the establishment of an architectural school that was more aesthetically and academically oriented than a polytechnic education. The school was finally located in Oslo, since it was generally felt that the capital had access to many of the nation’s best practicing architects.

In the beginning, the architectural course was part of the [[Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry]]. In 1961 The Oslo School of Architecture was established as an independent school, and, from 1968, located in ''St. Olavs gate''.

In 1979, the first formal education in industrial design in Norway was offered as a two-year postgraduate study. A full degree program was established in 1983, and in 1989 this was placed under the direction of The Norwegian Arts and Crafts School. Then, in 1996, the Institute of Industrial Design became part of the Oslo School of Architecture.

Master of Landscape Architecture became part of AHO’s master’s programmes in 2004. In 2005, The Oslo School of Architecture changed name to The Oslo School of Architecture and Design. In 2009, the Institute of Industrial Design changed its name to the Institute of Design.

In 2001 the school moved to new facilities at Vulkan, a revitalised industrial area near the [[Aker River]]. In a central, innovative, creative and cultural part of the city. The school lays adjacent to the [[Oslo National Academy of the Arts]] and the recently opened Food Hall.
In 2005 the school changed its name to The Oslo School of Architecture and Design.

'''''Pelican of London''''' is a sail training ship based in the United Kingdom. Built in 1948 as '''''Pelican''''' she served as an Arctic trawler and then [[coastal trading vessel]] named '''''Kadett''''' until 1995. In 2007 the ship was completed after many years of being re-built as a sail-training ship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weymouth-charters.co.uk/tall-ship-t-s-pelican-of-london/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Built in 1948 in [[Le Havre]], France, ''Pelican'' was originally a double-beam Arctic [[fishing trawler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of five identical ships built in Chantiers et Ateliers, the shipyard once owned by the shipbuilder Augustin Normand. She was sold to a Norwegian firm and spent the next 19 years fishing the [[Arctic]].

In 1968 ''Pelican'' was reclassified from a trawler to a coaster. Her owners renamed her ''Kadett''. She remained ''Kadett'' for 27 years until in 1995 she again changed hands.

She was bought by ex-Naval Commander Graham Neilson who transformed her into a tall ship and renamed her ''Pelican of London''. He had already undertaken a similar project with the [[Astrid (brig)|TS ''Astrid'']]. Working in Portland Harbour, Dorset, UK, Neilson and his team spent 12 years stripping back the trawler and rebuilding her as a main mast [[barquentine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A trainee on the ship won the 2010 [[Torbay cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailtraininginternational.org/events/race-trophies-and-awards STI - Race Trophies and Awards.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian battleship ''Petropavlovsk''''' ({{lang-ru|Петропавловск}}) was the third of the four {{sclass-|Gangut|battleship|0}} [[dreadnought]]s built before [[World War I]] for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], the first Russian [[ship class|class]] of dreadnoughts. She was named after the Russian victory over the British and the French in the [[Siege of Petropavlovsk]] in 1854. The ship was completed during the winter of 1914–1915, but was not ready for combat until mid-1915. Her role was to defend the mouth of the [[Gulf of Finland]] against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so she spent her time training and providing cover for minelaying operations. Her crew joined the general [[mutiny]] of the [[Baltic Fleet]] after the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and she was the only dreadnought available to the [[Bolshevik]]s for several years after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. She bombarded the mutinous garrison of [[Krasnaya Gorka fort|Fort Krasnaya Gorka]] and supported Bolshevik light forces operating against British ships supporting the [[White Movement|White Russians]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in 1918–19. Later, her crew joined the [[Kronstadt Rebellion]] of 1921 and she was renamed '''''Marat''''' after the rebellion was crushed.

''Marat'' was reconstructed from 1928 to 1931 and represented the [[Soviet Union]] at the [[Fleet Review|Coronation Naval Review]] at Spithead in 1937. Two years later, she bombarded a [[Finland|Finnish]] coastal artillery position during the [[Naval warfare in the Winter War|Winter War]] once before the Gulf of Finland iced up. Shortly afterwards, her [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament was upgraded. When the [[Operation Barbarossa|Germans invaded]] on 22 June 1941 she was in [[Kronstadt]] and provided gunfire support to Soviet troops in September as the Germans approached [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. Later that month she had her bow blown off and sank in shallow water after two hits by {{convert|1000|kg|adj=on|sp=us}} bombs (dropped from a [[Ju 87 Stuka]], piloted by [[Hans Ulrich Rudel]]) that detonated her forward [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]. She was refloated several months later and became a stationary battery, providing gunfire support during the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. Plans were made to reconstruct her after the war, using the bow of her [[sister ship|sister]] [[Russian battleship Poltava (1911)|''Frunze'']], but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled in 1948. She was renamed ''Volkhov'', after the nearby [[Volkhov River|river]], in 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken in 1953 and broken up afterwards.

==Design==
[[File:Gangut class diagrams Brasseys 1912.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Plan view of the ''Gangut'' class]]

''Petropavlovsk'' was {{convert|180|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|181.2|m|ftin|sp=us}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|26.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.99|m|ftin|sp=us}}, {{convert|49|cm|ftin|sp=us}} more than designed. Her displacement was {{convert|24800|t|LT|0|lk=out}} at load, over {{convert|1500|t|LT|0|abbr=on}} more than her designed displacement of {{convert|23288|t|LT|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

''Petropavlovsk''{{'}}s machinery was built by the Baltic Works. Four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]]-type [[steam turbine]] sets drove the four propellers. The engine rooms were located between [[turret]]s three and four in three compartments. The outer compartments each had a high-pressure ahead and reverse turbine for each wing propeller shaft. The central engine room had two low-pressure ahead and astern turbines as well as two cruising turbines driving each of the two center shafts. The engines had a total designed output of {{convert|42000|shp|0|lk=in}}, but they produced {{convert|52000|shp|0|abbr=on}} during her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Poltava|1911|2}}'s full-speed trials on 21 November 1915 and gave a top speed of {{convert|24.1|knots}}. Twenty-five [[Yarrow boiler]]s provided steam to the engines at a designed working pressure of {{convert|17.5|atm|kPa psi}}. Each boiler was fitted with [[John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company|Thornycroft]] oil sprayers for mixed oil/coal burning. They were arranged in two groups. The forward group consisted of two boiler rooms in front of the second turret, the foremost of which had three boilers while the second one had six. The rear group was between the second and third turrets and comprised two compartments, each with eight boilers. At full load she carried {{convert|1847.5|LT|MT|0}} of coal and {{convert|700|LT|MT|0}} of [[fuel oil]] and that provided her a range of {{convert|3500|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 208, 224–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The main armament of the ''Gangut''s consisted of a dozen 52-[[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|caliber]] [[Obukhovskii 12"/52 Pattern 1907 gun|Obukhovskii {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}} Pattern 1907]] guns mounted in four triple turrets distributed the length of the ship. The Russians did not believe that [[Superfire|superfiring]] turrets offered any advantage, discounting the value of axial fire and believing that superfiring turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of [[Muzzle flash|muzzle blast]] problems. They also believed that distributing the turrets, and their associated [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s, over the length of the ship improved the survivability of the ship. Sixteen 50-caliber [[120 mm 50 caliber Pattern 1905|{{convert|4.7|in|mm|0|adj=on}} Pattern 1905]] guns were mounted in [[casemate]]s as the secondary battery intended to defend the ship against [[torpedo boat]]s. The ships were completed with only a single 30-caliber [[76 mm air-defense gun M1914/15|{{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}} ''Lender'']] [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) gun]] mounted on the quarterdeck. Other AA guns were probably added during the course of World War I, but details are lacking.&lt;ref name=m01&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 220–21&lt;/ref&gt; Conway's says that four [[75mm 50 caliber Pattern 1892|{{convert|75|mm|adj=on|sp=us}}]] were added to the roofs of the end turrets during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Four {{convert|17.7|in|mm|0|adj=on}} submerged [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted with three [[torpedo]]es for each tube.&lt;ref name=m01/&gt;

==Service==
[[File:Anarkistimatruuseja.jpg|thumb|Sailors of ''Petropavlovsk'' in Helsinki, 1917.]]
''Petropavlovsk'' was built by the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Her keel was laid down on 16 June 1909 and she was launched on 22 September 1911. She entered service on 5 January 1915, six months after the start of [[World War I]], when she reached [[Helsinki]] and was assigned to the First Battleship Brigade of the [[Baltic Fleet]]. ''Petropavlovsk'' and her sister {{ship|Russian battleship|Gangut|1911|2}} provided distant cover for [[Minelayer|minelaying]] operations on 10–11 November and 6 December 1915. She saw no action of any kind during 1916. Her crew joined the general [[mutiny]] of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the idle sailors received word of the [[February Revolution]] in Saint Petersburg. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent [[Finland]] even though the [[Gulf of Finland]] was still frozen over. ''Petropavlovsk'' and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached [[Kronstadt]] five days later in what became known as the [[Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet|"Ice Voyage"]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 207, 299–303&lt;/ref&gt;

''Petropavlovsk'' was the only operable dreadnought belonging to the Soviets and provided cover to smaller ships on raiding missions. On 31 May 1919 she fired in support of the {{ship|Russian destroyer|Azard}} and several [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s that had taken the bait laid by the British forces supporting the [[White Movement|White Russians]]. The British [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Walker|D27|6}} appeared to be operating alone and the Soviets sortied to attack her, but a number of other British destroyers were positioned to sweep in behind the Soviets. ''Azard'' retreated at full speed and ''Petropavlovsk'' opened fire on ''Walker'' at about {{convert|14000|yd|0}}. She hit ''Walker'' twice, inflicting only minor damage and wounding two sailors, and the British destroyers eventually disengaged when they got too close to Soviet [[coastal artillery]] and [[minefield]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Head, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later ''Petropavlovsk'' and the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Andrei Pervozvanny||2}} bombarded [[Krasnaya Gorka fort|Fort Krasnaya Gorka]] whose garrison had mutinied against the Bolsheviks. She fired no fewer than 568 12-inch shells&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; and the garrison surrendered on 17 June when [[Leon Trotsky]] promised them their lives, only to subsequently order them machine-gunned.&lt;ref&gt;Head, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August 1919 ''Petropavlovsk'' was claimed as torpedoed and put out of action by the British [[Coastal Motor Boat]] ''CMB 88'' during a night attack in Kronstadt harbor, but was, in fact, not damaged at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erikson|first=Rolf|year=1974|title=Letter to the Editor|journal=Warship International|publisher=International Naval Research Organization|location=Toledo, OH|volume=XI|issue=1|page=16|issn=0043-0374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew of ''Petropavlovsk'' joined the [[Kronstadt Rebellion]] of March 1921. After it was bloodily crushed she was renamed ''Marat'' to honor the French revolutionary leader [[Jean-Paul Marat]] on 31 March 1921.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922 her primary rangefinder had been moved to a platform on the foremast and she mounted three 3-inch "Lender" AA guns each on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soviet battleship Marat at Spithead Fleet Review 1937 IWM MH 7.jpg|thumb|left|''Marat'' at [[Spithead]] for the 1937 Fleet Review.]]
''Marat'' was partially reconstructed between the fall of 1928 and 8 April 1931 at the Baltic Works. The most obvious external change was a much more elaborate forward superstructure needed to house new fire control instruments. A KDP-6 [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]], with two {{convert|6|m|adj=on|sp=us|0}} [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] [[rangefinder]]s, was positioned at the top of the tubular foremast. An {{convert|8|m|adj=on|sp=us|0}} Zeiss rangefinder was also added on the rear superstructure. The top of the forward funnel was lengthened by about {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} and angled backwards in an attempt to keep the exhaust gases away from the control and gunnery spaces. A [[derrick]] was added to the mainmast to handle a [[Heinkel HD 55|KR-1]] [[flying boat]] imported from Germany that was stored above the third turret. No [[aircraft catapult]] was fitted so the aircraft had to take off and land on the water. A [[forecastle]] was added to the bow, which was also given much more sheer and flare to improve her sea-keeping abilities. Her turrets were overhauled, her guns replaced and new 8-meter rangefinders were installed on every turret. Her boilers were converted to only burn fuel oil and the more powerful boilers allowed the forward three boilers to be removed. The space freed up was used for anti-aircraft ammunition and various control spaces. The cruising turbines were also removed which simplified the ship's machinery at a small cost in power. These changes increased her displacement to {{convert|26170|t|LT|0}} at full load and her overall length to {{convert|184|m|sp=us}}. Her [[metacentric height]] increased to {{convert|1.93|m|sp=us}} from her designed {{convert|1.76|m|sp=us}} mainly because she now carried much of her fuel in her double bottom rather than in coal bunkers high on the sides of the ship. More weight was added to her before World War II, including an increase in the thickness of her turret roofs to {{convert|152|mm|sp=us}}, that decreased her metacentric height to only {{convert|1.7|m|sp=us}}. This was unsatisfactory and plans were made to reconstruct her again, but they were cancelled when the Germans attacked in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 339–42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marat1939.jpg|thumb|''Marat'' in 1939, after her reconstruction|alt=]]
''Marat'' took part in the [[Fleet Review|1937 Coronation Review]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen &amp; Grove, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Her participation in the [[Naval warfare in the Winter War|Winter War]] was minimal as she bombarded Finnish {{convert|10|in|adj=on|0}} coast defense guns one time at [[Saarenpää]] in the [[Beryozovye Islands]] with 133 [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] shells before the Gulf of Finland iced over.&lt;ref name="m1"&gt;McLaughlin, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1940 her anti-aircraft armament was reinforced. She exchanged her elderly 3-inch "Lender" guns for modern [[76 mm air defense gun M1938|{{convert|76.2|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 34-K]] guns and two twin 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm 81-K mounts were mounted on her quarter deck. The magazines for these guns were situated in the rearmost casemates on each beam, which lost their 120&amp;nbsp;mm guns. At some point six automatic [[37 mm automatic air defense gun M1939 (61-K)|{{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 70-K]] guns were also added. These additions boosted her displacement to {{convert|26700|t|LT|0}} at full load.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; She sailed to [[Tallinn]] shortly after the Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied Estonia]], although she returned to Kronstadt on 20 June 1941, two days before the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] began.&lt;ref name="m1" /&gt; ''Marat'' opened fire on troop positions of the German [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Army]] from the Leningrad Sea Canal on 8 September. She was lightly damaged by German {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns on 16 September.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, pp. 98, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Damaged Marat.jpg|thumb|''Luftwaffe'' aerial photograph of ''Marat'' in Kronstadt, leaking oil after her magazine explosion]]
She was sunk at her moorings on 23 September 1941 by two near-simultaneous hits by {{convert|1000|kg|adj=on|sp=us}} bombs near the forward superstructure. They caused the explosion of the forward [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] which heaved the turret up, blew the superstructure and forward funnel over to starboard and demolished the forward part of the hull from frames 20 to 57. 326 men were killed and the ship gradually settled to the bottom in {{convert|11|m|sp=us}} of water.&lt;ref name="m2"&gt;McLaughlin, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; Her sinking is commonly credited to the [[Stuka]] pilot [[First Lieutenant|Oberleutnant]] [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] of III./[[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2|StG 2]], but Rudel dropped only one of the two bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The rear part of the ship was later refloated and she was used as a floating battery although all of her 120&amp;nbsp;mm guns were removed. Initially only the two rearmost turrets were operable, but the second turret was repaired by the autumn of 1942. She fired a total of 1,971 twelve-inch shells during the [[Siege of Leningrad]].&lt;ref name="m2" /&gt; In December 1941 granite slabs {{convert|40|-|60|mm|sp=us}} thick from the nearby harbor walls were laid on her decks to reinforce her deck protection. Another transverse bulkhead was built behind frame 57 and the space between them was filled with concrete to prevent her sinking if the original bulkhead was ruptured.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

She resumed her original name on 31 May 1943. After the war there were several plans to reconstruct her, using the bow of the [[Russian battleship Poltava (1911)|''Frunze'']], but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed ''Volkhov'', after the nearby [[Volkhov River|river]], on 28 November 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken on 4 September 1953. The ship was subsequently broken up.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, pp. 413–14&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6378">'''Science information on Wikipedia''' includes the information which Wikipedia presents about science. It critiques and discusses the impact and quality of that information, and the culture of Wikipedia editors, scientists, and layman engagement with this information.

==Impact==
A 2017 study found evidence that Wikipedia's popularity as the most popular general information source has influenced how everyone talks and writes about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Neil|last2=Hanley|first2=Douglas|title=Science Is Shaped by Wikipedia: Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial|journal=[[Social Science Research Network]]|date=19 September 2017|issue=MIT Sloan Research Paper No. 5238-17.|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3039505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Wikipedia shapes language in science papers|url=https://www.nature.com/news/wikipedia-shapes-language-in-science-papers-1.22656|website=Nature|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22656|date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found evidence that Wikipedia increases the distribution and impact of [[open access]] science publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teplitskiy|first1=Misha|last2=Lu|first2=Grace|last3=Duede|first3=Eamon|title=Amplifying the impact of open access: Wikipedia and the diffusion of science|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|date=September 2017|volume=68|issue=9|pages=2116–2127|doi=10.1002/asi.23687|arxiv=1506.07608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] reports that Wikipedia is a popular source of science information because Wikipedia has high ranking in [[search engines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Natural Sciences Sector|title=The UNESCO Science Report finds a new public on Wikipedia|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/single-view-sc-policy/news/the_unesco_science_report_finds_a_new_public_on_wikipedia/|website=[[UNESCO]]|publisher=[[United Nations]]|language=en|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study examined the way that Wikipedia integrates new scientific information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benjakob |first1=Omer |last2=Aviram |first2=Rona |title=A Clockwork Wikipedia: From a Broad Perspective to a Case Study |journal=Journal of Biological Rhythms |date=17 April 2018 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=233–244 |doi=10.1177/0748730418768120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==
In 2016 the [[Wiki Education Foundation]] and the [[Simons Foundation]] presented an outreach program called the "Year of Science". In this program, Wikipedia educators visited academic conferences and invited scientists to contribute information from their field of expertise to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Simons Foundation]]|title=Mind the Gaps: Improving the Science on Wikipedia|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2017/03/01/mind-the-gaps-improving-the-science-on-wikipedia/|website=Simons Foundation|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities have programs to encourage students to edit Wikipedia's science articles as part of the learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Meghan|title=Science Students Are Writing Wikipedia Articles Instead of Term Papers|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjbbw/science-students-are-writing-wikipedia-articles-instead-of-term-papers|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]|language=en-us|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wikipedia community invites academics to edit Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shafee|first1=Thomas|last2=Mietchen|first2=Daniel|last3=Su|first3=Andrew I.|title=Academics can help shape Wikipedia|journal=Science|date=11 August 2017|volume=357|issue=6351|pages=557.2–558|doi=10.1126/science.aao0462|bibcode=2017Sci...357..557S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academic societies have encouraged their membership to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Evan B.|title=Three Reasons Why Earth Scientists Should Edit Wikipedia|url=https://eos.org/opinions/three-reasons-why-earth-scientists-should-edit-wikipedia|website=Eos|publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
A 2005 study published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' compared 40 Wikipedia articles on science topics to their ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' counterpart. Subject experts found four "serious errors" in each encyclopedia. They also found 162 less serious problems in Wikipedia, and 123 in ''Britannica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/study-wikipedia-as-accurate-as-britannica/|title=Study: Wikipedia as accurate as Britannica|work=CNET|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[popular science]] writer for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' complained in 2017 that Wikipedia's science articles were too technical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Michael|title=Wikipedia’s Science Articles Are Elitist|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne7xzq/wikipedias-science-articles-are-elitist|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]|language=en-us|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scientists and media organizations have questioned and critiqued the extent to which Wikipedia articles on science influence political decisions relating to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucassen|first=Teun|last2=Dijkstra|first2=Roald|last3=Schraagen|first3=Jan Maarten|date=2012-08-20|title=Readability of Wikipedia|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3916|journal=First Monday|language=en|volume=0|issue=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Liat|title=Wikipedia wars are harming politically charged science|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wikipedia-wars-are-killing-politically-charged-science|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Nathan|title=The Political Controversy of Wikipedia Science Articles|url=https://psmag.com/environment/according-to-wikipedia-acid-rain-is-a-load-of-bullshit|website=[[Pacific Standard]]|language=en|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12712">The '''Seville Statement on Violence''' is a statement on violence that was adopted by an international meeting of scientists, convened by the Spanish National Commission for [[UNESCO]], in [[Seville]], [[Spain]], on 16 May 1986. It was subsequently adopted by UNESCO at the twenty-fifth session of the General Conference on 16 November 1989. The statement, then known as a 'Statement on Violence', was designed to refute "the notion that organized human violence is biologically determined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suter |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Suter |title=50 things you want to know about world issues... but were too afraid to ask |year=2005 |publisher=Transworld Publishers |location=Milson's Point, NSW, Australia |isbn=978-1-86325-503-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core Ideas ==
The statement contains five core ideas. These ideas are:

#"It is scientifically incorrect to say that we have inherited a tendency to make war from our animal ancestors."
#"It is scientifically incorrect to say that war or any other violent behaviour is genetically programmed into our human nature."
#"It is scientifically incorrect to say that in the course of human evolution there has been a selection for aggressive behaviour more than for other kinds of behaviour."
#"It is scientifically incorrect to say that humans have a 'violent brain'."
#"It is scientifically incorrect to say that war is caused by 'instinct' or any single motivation."

The statement concludes: "Just as 'wars begin in the minds of men', peace also begins in our minds. The same species who invented war is capable of inventing peace. The responsibility lies with each of us."&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3247&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20050928235336/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3247&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-09-28 |title=Seville Statement on Violence, Spain, 1986 |accessdate=2007-03-04 |work=EDUCATION- Non-Violence Education |publisher=UNESCO |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissemination and Endorsements ==

Once it was drafted and signed by the founding group in May, 1986, the Statement on Violence was disseminated around the world, as described in the newsletter that was issued three or four times a year from 1986 through 1994 as well as two occasions later in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt; http://culture-of-peace.info/ssov_newsletter.html The Seville Statement Newsletter Index&lt;/ref&gt;

The Statement has been published in over 150 scientific and popular journals, including versions translated into more than 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-of-peace.info/SSOV_publications.html Seville Statement on Violence - Journal and Book Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO decided to disseminate the Statement widely in a decision of the twenty-fifth session of the General Conference on 16 November 1989.&lt;ref&gt; http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000846/084696E.pdf Unesco’s contribution to peace&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, this led to publication and dissemination of a UNESCO brochure in English&lt;ref&gt; http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000943/094314e.pdf The Seville Statement on Violence: Preparing the Ground for the Constructing of Peace&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Spanish, French and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt; http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=94314&amp;set=00580BC4C9_3_218&amp;gp=&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=c UNESDOC The Seville Statement on Violence: Preparing the Ground for the Constructing of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;.  The brochure, with the subtitle "Preparing the Ground for the Constructing of Peace" helped prepare the ground for the UNESCO Culture of Peace Programme&lt;ref&gt;[[Culture of peace#UNESCO Culture of Peace Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}}

By the time UNESCO published its brochure, the Statement had been endorsed or disseminated by 75 organizations&lt;ref&gt; http://culture-of-peace.info/brochure/pages34-35.html Organizations that Support the Seville Statement&lt;/ref&gt;, including formal endorsements by three of the major social science organizations of the United States, the American Anthropological Association&lt;ref&gt; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/an.1987.28.9.1.3/full Seville Statement on Violence Endorsed&lt;/ref&gt;, the American Psychological Association&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-07451-001?doi=1 The Seville Statement on Violence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://culture-of-peace.info/ssov_newsletter/ssov_newsletter_vol_2/2-2-3.jpg Council endorses Seville Statement on Violence&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Sociological Association&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/asa.03.1991.pdf March 1991 Footnotes: Council Endorses the Seville Statement on Violence (page 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implications ==

Belief concerning the relationship between warfare and biology may have practical implications.  It has been shown that if one believes that war is biologically determined, he or she is less likely to engage in activities to promote peace.  Conversely, if one believes that war is not biologically determined, one is more likely to work for peace.&lt;ref&gt; http://culture-of-peace.info/myth/title-page.html David Adams and Sarah Bosch, The myth that war is intrinsic to human nature discourages action for peace by young people, in J. Ramfrez, R. Hinde, andj. Groeble (eds.), Essays on Violence, 121—37 (Seville: University of Seville Press, 1987, retrieved May 16, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

In fact, about half of all young people believe that war is biologically determined according to international surveys in 1972&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, William 1972. "Crosscultural theories of war and aggression," International Journal of Group Tensions, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 36-51.&lt;/ref&gt;, replicated by studies in Finland&lt;ref&gt; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00291463.1984.10636883 Riitta Wahlstrom, On the psychological premises for peace education Nordisk Psykologi 1984 36 (3): 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Fry and James N. Welch. Beliefs about Human Nature and Conflict: Implications for Peace Education. American Anthropological Association, San Francisco, CA, 2-6 December, 1992 &lt;/ref&gt;.  If anything, the proportion may have increased in recent years&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~wggray/Teaching/His300/Handouts/Horgan-Fatalism.pdf John Horgan 2009, Countering Students’ Fatalism Toward War&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

[[Steven Pinker]] has criticized the Seville Statement as being an example of the [[moralistic fallacy]].&lt;ref name = "pink"&gt;Pinker, Steven. ''How the Mind Works''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997, pp. 44 and 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists believe both [[evolutionary psychology]]  and [[neuropsychology]]  suggest that human violence does indeed have biological roots.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dan [http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451512a.html "Human behaviour: Killer instincts"], ''Nature'', January 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Melanie [http://www.physorg.com/news121098401.html "Brain rewards aggression much like it does sex, food, drugs"], ''Physorg.com'', February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker has used the Seville Statement as an example of the idea of biological determinism, the incorrect idea that genes are solely responsible for ''any'' of our behaviors.&lt;ref name = "pink"/&gt; A 2008 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Dan Jones stated that "The decades since have not been kind to these cherished beliefs. A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the [[Cinderella effect]]). [[Chimpanzee]]s have violence between groups, which has similarities to raids and violence between groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower in humans living in small group societies than in chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between [[ingroup and outgroup]], which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies, which suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced [[blood feud]]s due to better functioning [[justice system]]s may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = D. | title = Human behaviour: Killer instincts | doi = 10.1038/451512a | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 512–515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18235473| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Some Thoughts Concerning Education''''' is a 1693 treatise&lt;!--do not link to treatise - it redirects to "tract (literature)" which is not the same thing--&gt; on the education of gentlemen written by the English philosopher [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |author-link=|year=1693 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Some Thoughts Concerning Education|volume= |edition= 1|publisher=A.and J.

It was translated into almost all of the major written European languages during the eighteenth century, and nearly every European writer on education after Locke, including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], acknowledged its influence.

In his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), Locke outlined a new [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], contending that the gentleman's mind was a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' or "blank slate"; that is, it did not contain any [[innate idea]]s. ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' explains how to educate that mind using three distinct methods: the development of a healthy body; the formation of a virtuous character; and the choice of an appropriate academic curriculum.

Locke wrote the letters that would eventually become ''Some Thoughts'' for an aristocratic friend, but his advice had a broader appeal since his educational principles suggested anyone could acquire the same kind of character as the aristocrats for whom Locke originally intended the work.

==Historical context==
{{Locke}}
Rather than writing a wholly original philosophy of education, Locke, it seems, deliberately attempted to popularise several strands of seventeenth-century educational reform at the same time as introducing his own ideas. English writers such as [[John Evelyn]], [[John Aubrey]], [[John Eachard]], and [[John Milton]] had previously advocated "similar reforms in curriculum and teaching methods," but they had not succeeded in reaching a wide audience.&lt;ref&gt;Ezell, Margaret J.M. "John Locke's Images of Childhood: Early Eighteenth-Century Responses to ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education''." ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 17.2 (1983–84), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Curiously, though, Locke proclaims throughout his text that his is a revolutionary work; as Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on ''Some Thoughts'', has pointed out, "Locke frequently explicitly opposes his recommendations to the 'usual,' 'common,' 'ordinary,' or 'general' education."&lt;ref&gt;Tarcov, Nathan. ''Locke's Education for Liberty''. Chicago: University  of Chicago Press (1984), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

As England became increasingly [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] and [[secularism|secularist]], the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] educational values of the [[Renaissance]], which had enshrined [[scholasticism]], came to be regarded by many as irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, James L. "Introduction." ''The Educational Writings of John Locke''. Ed. James L. Axtell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1968), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Following in the intellectual tradition of [[Francis Bacon]], who had challenged the cultural authority of the [[classics]], reformers such as Locke, and later [[Philip Doddridge]], argued against [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]]'s decree that "all Bachelor and Undergraduates in their Disputations should lay aside their various Authors, such that caused many dissensions and strives in the Schools, and only follow [[Aristotle]] and those that defend him, and take their Questions from him, and that they exclude from the Schools all steril and inane Questions, disagreeing from the ancient and true Philosophy [sic]."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Frances A. Yates, "Giodano Bruno's Conflict with Oxford." ''Journal of the Warburg Institute'' 2.3 (1939), 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of demanding that their sons spend all of their time studying [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] texts, an increasing number of families began to demand a practical education for their sons; by exposing them to the [[scientific revolution|emerging sciences]], [[history of mathematics|mathematics]], and the modern languages, these parents hoped to prepare their sons for the changing economy and, indeed, for the new world they saw forming around them.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 69&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
In 1684 Edward Clarke asked his friend, John Locke, for advice on raising his son and heir, Edward, Jr.; Locke responded with a series of letters that eventually served as the basis of ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education''.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until 1693, encouraged by the Clarkes and another friend, [[William Molyneux]], that Locke actually published the treatise; Locke, "timid" when it came to public exposure, decided to publish the text anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Locke revised and expanded the text five times before he died,&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; he never substantially altered the "familiar and friendly style of the work."&lt;ref name="Tarcov, 79."&gt;Tarcov, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Preface" alerted the reader to its humble origins as a series of letters and, according to Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on ''Some Thoughts'', advice that otherwise might have appeared "meddlesome" became welcome. Tarcov claims Locke treated his readers as his friends and they responded in kind.&lt;ref name="Tarcov, 79."/&gt;

==Pedagogical theory==
Of Locke's major claims in the ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'', two played a defining role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes at the opening of his treatise, "I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education and of the Conduct of the Understanding.'' Eds. Ruth W. Grant and Nathan Tarcov. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Co., Inc. (1996), 10; see also Tarcov, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in [[original sin]], and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Ezell, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Essay'' Locke posits an "empty" mind—a ''[[tabula rasa]]''—that is "filled" by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theatetus]]'', which suggests that the mind is like a "wax tablet".&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Martin. "Why Can't a Man Be More Like a Woman? (A Note on John Locke's Educational Thought)." ''Educational Theory'' 40.1 (1990), 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Locke argued strenuously for the ''tabula rasa'' theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, John W. ''The Two Intellectual Worlds of John Locke: Man Person, and Spirits in the'' Essay. Ithaca: Cornell University Press (2004), 29–31 and John Yolton, ''Locke: An Introduction''. New York: Basil Blackwell (1985), 19–20; see also Tarcov, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their "aptitudes," and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''John Locke and Education'', 24&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt;—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke also discusses a theory of the self. He writes: "the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the "[[Association of Ideas|associations of ideas]]" made when young are more significant than those made when mature because they are the foundation of the self—they mark the ''tabula rasa''. In the ''Essay'', in which he first introduces the theory of the association of ideas, Locke warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's emphasis on the role of experience in the formation of the mind and his concern with false associations of ideas has led many to characterise his theory of mind as passive rather than active, but as Nicholas Jolley, in his introduction to Locke's philosophical theory, points out, this is "one of the most curious misconceptions about Locke."&lt;ref&gt;Jolley, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; As both he and Tarcov highlight, Locke's writings are full of directives to  seek out knowledge actively and reflect on received opinion; in fact, this was the essence of Locke's challenge to innatism.&lt;ref&gt;Tarcov, 83ff and Jolley 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body and mind===
Locke advises parents to carefully nurture their children's physical "habits" before pursuing their academic education.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 11–20.&lt;/ref&gt; As many scholars have remarked, it is unsurprising that a trained physician, as Locke was, would begin ''Some Thoughts'' with a discussion of children's physical needs, yet this seemingly simple generic innovation has proven to be one of Locke's most enduring legacies—Western child-rearing manuals are still dominated by the topics of food and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Hardyment, Christina. ''Dream Babies: Child Care from Locke to Spock''. London: Jonathan Cape (1983), 226; 246–7; 257–72.&lt;/ref&gt; To convince parents that they must attend to the health of their children above all, Locke quotes from [[Juvenal]]'s ''Satires''—"a sound mind in a sound body." Locke firmly believed that children should be exposed to harsh conditions while young to inure them to, for example, cold temperatures when they were older: "Children [should] be not too ''warmly clad or covered'', winter or summer" (Locke's emphasis), he argues, because "bodies will endure anything that from the beginning they are accustomed to."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, to prevent a child from catching chills and colds, Locke suggests that "his ''feet to be washed'' every day in cold water, and to have his ''shoes'' so thin that they might leak and ''let in water'' whenever he comes near it" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref name="Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 12."&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke posited that if children were accustomed to having sodden feet, a sudden shower that wet their feet would not cause them to catch a cold. Such advice (whether followed or not) was quite popular; it appears throughout [[John Newbery]]'s children's books in the middle of the eighteenth century, for example, the first best-selling children's books in England.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the "Preface" to ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book'', Newbery recommended that parents feed their child a "common Diet only, cloath him thin, let him have good Exercise, and be as much exposed to Hardships as his natural Constitution will admit" because "the Face of a child, when it comes into the World, (says the great Mr. Locke) is as tender and susceptible of Injuries as any other Part of the Body; yet by being always exposed, it becomes Proof against the severest Season, and the most inclement Weather." ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, Intended for the Instruction and Amusement of Little Master Tommy, and Pretty Miss Polly''. 10th edition. London: Printed for J. Newbery (1760), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke also offers specific advice on topics ranging from bed linens to diet to sleeping regimens.

===Virtue and reason===
Locke dedicates the bulk of ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' to explaining how to instill virtue in children. He defines virtue as a combination of self-denial and rationality: "that a man is able to ''deny himself'' his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self-denial but also to see the rational path. Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings. Moreover, he argues that parents should, above all, attempt to create a "habit" of thinking rationally in their children.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''Two Intellectual Worlds'', 31&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke continually emphasises habit over rule—children should internalise the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions. This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke's concerns in the ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Throughout the ''Essay'', Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability, because of the authority of custom, to change or forfeit long-held beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Locke, ''Essay'', 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt; His attempt to solve this problem is not only to treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''Introduction'', 22&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; For Locke, rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists; such sensations arouse passions rather than reason.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 34&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "such a sort of ''slavish discipline'' makes a ''slavish temper''" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LockeEssay.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=Page reads "An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding. In Four Books. Written by John Locke, Gent. The Fourth Edition, with large Additions. Eccles. XI. 5. As thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child: even so thou knowest not the works of God, who maketh all things. Quam bellum est velle consteri potius nescire quod nescias, quam ista effutientum nauseare, atque ipsum sibi displicere! Cic. de Natur. Deor. l. I. London: Printed for Awasham and John Churchil, at the Black-Swan, in Pater-Noster-Row; and Samuel Manship, at the Ship in Cornhill, near the Royal Exchange, MDCC."|Title page from the fourth edition of ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'']]
What is important to understand is what exactly Locke means when he advises parents to treat their children as reasoning beings. Locke first highlights that children "love to be treated as Rational Creatures," thus parents should treat them as such. Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are "motivated only [by] rewards and punishments" to achieve that goal.&lt;ref&gt;Tarcov, 117&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Locke wants children to become adults as quickly as possible. As he argues in ''Some Thoughts,'' "the only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it, into which a young gentleman should be entered by degrees as he can bear it, and the earlier the better."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Second Treatise on Government]]'' (1689), he contends that it is the parents' duty to educate their children and to act for them because children, though they have the ability to reason when young, do not do so consistently and are therefore usually irrational; it is the parents' obligation to teach their children to become rational adults so that they will not always be fettered by parental ties.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''John Locke and Education'', 29–30; Yolton, ''Two Intellectual Worlds'', 34–37; Yolton, ''Introduction'', 36&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic curriculum===
Locke does not dedicate much space in ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' to outlining a specific curriculum; he is more concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''Introduction'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children ''how'' to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [the child] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 195.&lt;/ref&gt; But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning [[Latin]] and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language,&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 143.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly recommending ''[[Aesop's Fables]]''.  Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility.&lt;ref&gt;Bantock, G. H. "'The Under-labourer' in Courtly Clothes: Locke." ''Studies in the History of Educational Theory: Artifice and Nature, 1350–1765''. London: George Allen and Unwin (1980), 241.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because it would be useful to them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the [[scientific revolution]] and advocated the teaching of [[geography]], [[astronomy]], and [[anatomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bantock, 240-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[humanism]] and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade.&lt;ref&gt;John Dunn, in his influential ''Political Thought of John Locke'', has interpreted this "calling" as a Calvinist religious doctrine. Tarcov has criticized this reading, however, writing: "Dunn’s exposition of the doctrine and its providentialist character is based on Puritan and secondary sources, and he gives no clear evidence for attributing it in this form to Locke." (Tarcov 127)&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ethos that would come to define [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Bantock, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Class==
When Locke began writing the letters that would eventually become ''Some Thoughts on Education'', he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;Leites, Edmund. "Locke's Liberal Theory of Parenthood." ''Ethnicity, Identity, and History''. Eds. Joseph B. Maier and Chaim I. Waxman. New Brunswick: Transaction Books (1983), 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Locke writes: "I place ''Vertue'' [sic] as the first and most necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt; James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of the things he said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to ''all'' children" (Axtell's emphasis).&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 52 and Yolton, ''John Locke and Education'', 30&amp;ndash;1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Axtell, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is possible to apply Locke's general principles of education to all children, and contemporaries such as Coste certainly did so, Locke himself, despite statements that may imply the contrary, believed that ''Some Thoughts'' applied only to the wealthy and the [[middle class|middle-class]] (or as they would have been referred to at the time, the "middling sorts"). One of Locke's conclusions in ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' is that he "think[s] a Prince, a Nobleman, and an ordinary Gentleman's Son, should have different Ways of Breeding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=John|title=Some thoughts concerning education|edition=13|date=1764|publisher=Printed for A. Millar, H. Woodfall, J. Wiston and B. White ...|location=London|page=324|url=https://archive.org/stream/13somethoughtscon00lockuoft#page/324/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Peter Gay writes, "[i]t never occurred to him that every child should be educated or that all those to be educated should be educated alike. Locke believed that until the school system was reformed, a gentleman ought to have his son trained at home by a tutor. As for the poor, they do not appear in Locke's little book at all."&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter. "Locke on the Education of Paupers." ''Philosophers on Education: Historical Perspectives''. Ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty. London: Routledge (1998), 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his "Essay on the Poor Law," Locke turns to the education of the poor; he laments that "the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay on the Poor Law." ''Locke: Political Essays''. Ed. [[Mark Goldie]]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1997), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests, therefore, that "working schools" be set up in each parish in England for poor children so that they will be "from infancy [three years old] inured to work."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, "Essay on the Poor Law," 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to outline the economics of these schools, arguing not only that they will be profitable for the parish, but also that they will instill a good work ethic in the children.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, "An Essay on the Poor Law," 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Locke wrote ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' in response to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's "principal aim", as Locke states at the beginning, "is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy." This education "will not so perfectly suit the education of ''daughters''; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref name="Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 12."/&gt; This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that "since therefore I acknowledge no difference of sex in your mind relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I think well to have no thing altered in it from what is [writ for the son]."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "Letter to Mrs. Clarke, February 1685." ''The Educational Writings of John Locke''. Ed. James L. Axtell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1968), 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin Simons states that Locke "suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes."&lt;ref&gt;Simons, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs and teach them little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and "should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate."&lt;ref&gt;Simons, 140; see also Tarcov, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his contemporary [[Mary Astell]], Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, 139 and 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Locke does recommend several minor "restrictions" relating to the treatment of the female body. The most significant is his reining in of female physical activity for the sake of physical appearance: "But since in your girls care is to be taken too of their beauty as much as health will permit, this in them must have some restriction ... 'tis fit their tender skins should be fenced against the busy sunbeams, especially when they are very hot and piercing."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, "Letter to Mrs. Clarke," 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Locke's statement indicates that he places a greater value on female than male beauty, the fact that these opinions were never published allowed contemporary readers to draw their own conclusions regarding the "different treatments" required for girls and boys, if any.&lt;ref&gt;Leites, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, compared to other pedagogical theories, such as those in the best-selling conduct book ''The Whole Duty of a Woman'' (1696), the female companion to ''[[The Whole Duty of Man]]'' (1657), and Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), which both proposed entirely separate educational programs for women, Locke's ''Some Thoughts'' appears far more egalitarian.

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|right|200px|thumb|alt=Half-length portrait of a man with a shock of neck-length white hair who is wearing a loose brown robe and white shirt.|John Locke by [[Godfrey Kneller]] (1697)]]
Along with Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), Locke's ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' was one of the foundational eighteenth-century texts on educational theory. In Britain, it was considered the standard treatment of the topic for over a century. For this reason, some critics have maintained that ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' vies with the ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' for the title of Locke's most influential work. Some of Locke's contemporaries, such as seventeenth-century German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottfried Leibniz]], believed this as well; Leibniz argued that ''Some Thoughts'' superseded even the ''Essay'' in its impact on European society.&lt;ref&gt;Ezell, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' was a runaway best-seller. During the eighteenth century alone, ''Some Thoughts'' was published in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and one [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Samuel F., Jr. ''John Locke and Children's Books in Eighteenth-Century England''. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press (1981), 10; See Axtell 100–104 for a complete list of editions.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also excerpted in novels such as [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, [[John Newbery]]. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.&lt;ref&gt;Secord, James A. "Newton in the Nursery: Tom Telescope and the Philosophy of Tops and Balls, 1761–1838." ''History of Science'' 23 (1985), 132–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the eighteenth century, Locke's influence on educational thought was widely acknowledged. In 1772 James Whitchurch wrote in his ''Essay Upon Education'' that Locke was "an Author, to whom the Learned must ever acknowledge themselves highly indebted, and whose Name can never be mentioned without a secret Veneration, and Respect; his Assertions being the result of intense Thought, strict Enquiry, a clear and penetrating Judgment."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Pickering, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as politically dissimilar as [[Sarah Trimmer]], in her periodical ''[[The Guardian of Education]]'' (1802–06),&lt;ref&gt;Trimmer, Sarah. ''The Guardian of Education''. Bristol: Thoemmes Press (2002), 1:8–9, 108; 2:186–7; 4:74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maria Edgeworth]], in the educational treatise she penned with her father, ''[[Practical Education]]'' (1798), invoked Locke's ideas. Even Rousseau, while disputing Locke's central claim that parents should treat their children as rational beings, acknowledged his debt to Locke.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''Emile, or on Education''. Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 47 and 107&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Cleverley and D. C. Phillips place Locke's ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' at the beginning of a tradition of educational theory which they label "environmentalism". In the years following the publication of Locke's work, [[Etienne Bonnot de Condillac]] and [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] eagerly adopted the idea that people's minds were shaped through their experiences and thus through their education. Systems of teaching children through their senses proliferated throughout Europe. In Switzerland, [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], relying on Locke's theories, developed the concept of the "object lesson."&lt;!--don't link; page is about something different--&gt; These lessons focused pupils' attention on a particular thing and encouraged them to use all of their senses to explore it and urged them to use precise words to describe it. Used throughout Europe and America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these object lessons, according to one of their practitioners "if well-managed, cultivate Sense-Perception, or Observation, accustom children to express their thoughts in words, increase their available stock of words and of ideas, and by thus storing material for thinking, also prepare the way for more difficult and advanced study."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in John Cleverley and D.C. Phillips, ''Visions of Childhood: Influential Models from Locke to Spock''. New York: Teachers College (1986), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such techniques were also integral to [[Montessori method|Maria Montessori's]] methods in the twentieth century. According to Cleverley and Phillips, the television show [[Sesame Street]] is also "based on Lockean assumptions—its aim has been to give underprivileged children, especially in the inner cities, the simple ideas and basic experiences that their environment normally does not provide."&lt;ref&gt;Cleverley and Phillips, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, despite Locke's continuing influence, as these authors point out, the twentieth century has been dominated by the "[[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture]]" debate in a way that Locke's century was not. Locke's optimistic "environmentalism," though qualified in his text, is now no longer just a moral issue – it is also a scientific issue.&lt;ref&gt;Cleverley and Phillips, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">The '''Special Tertiary Admissions Test''' (STAT) is a scholastic aptitude test, used for entry into [[undergraduate]] programs at [[List of universities in Australia|Australian universities]] for people without a recent [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] (ATAR).

The test is designed by the [[Australian Council for Educational Research]], and administered separately by the central tertiary admissions centre in each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] and the [[University of Tasmania]]. Some institutions require the STAT to be undertaken for all applicants for certain courses.

Consisting of two parts, the STAT assesses core competencies deemed necessary for university entrance, testing critical thinking and reasoning skills rather than knowledge. There are currently three types of STAT in use:

* The STAT Multiple Choice 
: The standard test used by tertiary admissions centres. Contains 70 questions, 35 of which are testing Verbal (humanities and social science) competencies and 35 Quantitative (mathematical and scientific) competencies. The test is two hours in duration.

* The STAT F - used by individual institutions
: This test is used by some individual institutions to determine eligibility for entrance into specific courses. It also contains 70 questions, half of which are Verbal and half Quantitative, and is two hours in duration.

* The STAT Written English
: This test is used by some tertiary admissions centres and institutions, in addition to either the STAT Multiple Choice or the STAT F. The test is a one-hour test of the candidate's ability to express themselves in writing. 


The STAT score is reported as a numeric mark between 100 and 200 (200 being a perfect score). The score indicates the candidate's potential academic capacity in relation to past or potential candidates, as the questions are relative across years and test forms. STAT scores are then translated into ENTER scores for university admission through calculation of the percentile rank of the candidate in relation to the test-taking population for the previous six years.

The STAT Written English is required for international students to assess their English language skills. The STAT Multiple Choice is required for entry into a number of tertiary courses, for example [[Bachelor of Pharmacy]] at the [[University of Sydney]].

=== Brighton &amp; Hove Albion ===
Born in [[Eastbourne]], Myall joined the [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion's]] [[Center of excellence|Centre Of Excellence]] at age 11.&lt;ref name="eastbourneunitedafc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbourneunitedafc.co.uk/news/united-aim-myall-high-792969.html|title=United Aim Myall High – Eastbourne United Association FC|publisher=eastbourneunitedafc.co.uk|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club during the [[1992–93 Football League Second Division|1992–93]] season and made seven [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] appearances.&lt;ref name="eastbourneunitedafc"/&gt; He signed his first professional contract in April 1993.&lt;ref name="theargus" /&gt; He gradually broke through into the first team, making 13 league appearances during the [[1993–94 Football League Second Division|1993–94]] season and 27 in [[1994–95 Football League Second Division|1994–95]], scoring his first two Brighton goals during the latter campaign. In the [[1995–96 Football League Second Division|1995–96]] season, Myall made 33 league appearances and scored two goals. He was released by manager [[Jimmy Case]] at the end of the season,&lt;ref name="theargus" /&gt; after the club's relegation to [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]] was confirmed. During his time at the [[Goldstone Ground]], Myall made 93 appearances and scored four goals.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=5752 |title=Stuart Myall &amp;#124; Football Stats &amp;#124; No Club &amp;#124; Age 39 &amp;#124; 1993–1998 &amp;#124; Soccer Base |publisher=soccerbase.com |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Myall recalled that he "had a great time at Brighton. It was what I always wanted to do and I was at the Albion from a very young age. I had a really fantastic time and I was disappointed when I was released in 1996 because I had played quite a few games for the club. But we got relegated and Jimmy Case wanted to bring in his own players".&lt;ref name="theargus" /&gt;

=== Brentford ===
Myall signed a two-year contract with Division Two side [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] during the summer of 1996.{{Sfn|Croxford, Lane &amp; Waterman|2013|p=230}} He failed to make even the substitutes' bench during the [[1996–97 Brentford F.C. season|1996–97]] season under manager [[David Webb (footballer)|David Webb]] and instead turned out for the club's [[Brentford F.C. Reserves and Academy#Reserve team|reserve side]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year=1996 |title=Brentford Matchday Magazine versus Gillingham 27/08/96 |url= |location= |publisher=Quay Design of Poole |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring six goals in 20 appearances.&lt;ref name="BBB90s2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Big Brentford Book Of The Nineties|last=Croxford|first=Mark|last2=Lane|first2=David|last3=Waterman|first3=Greville|publisher=Legends Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781906796723|location=Sunbury, Middlesex|page=517|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under new manager [[Eddie May]] for the [[1997–98 Brentford F.C. season|1997–98]] season, Myall had to wait until 1 November 1997 to make his debut, with a starting appearance in a 0–0 draw at [[Bournemouth A.F.C.|Bournemouth]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase" /&gt; Myall started the following game against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], but was substituted at half time for [[Ryan Denys]] in a 1–0 defeat.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase" /&gt; Following May's sacking and the appointment of [[Micky Adams]], Myall was an unused substitute for a 4–1 defeat to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on 8 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Brentford Matchday Magazine versus Wrexham 29/11/97 |publisher=Quay Design of Poole |year=1997 |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myall never featured in a first team squad again and departed the club in January 1998, having negotiated a settlement on his contract.{{Sfn|Croxford, Lane &amp; Waterman|2013|p=263}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14333">'''Teacher quality assessment''' commonly includes reviews of qualifications, tests of teacher knowledge, observations of practice, and measurements of student learning gains.&lt;ref name ="Strong"&gt;Strong, M. (2011). The highly qualified teacher: What is teacher quality and how do we measure it? New York: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Darling-Hammond"&gt;Darling-Hammond, L., &amp; Youngs, P. (2004). Defining ‘highly qualified teachers.’ what does scientifically-based research actually tell us? Educational Researcher, 31, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments of teacher quality are currently used for policymaking, employment and tenure decisions, teacher evaluations, merit pay awards, and as data to inform the professional growth of teachers.

==Qualifications, credentials, and teacher characteristics==

Teacher qualifications include a range of variables affecting teacher quality, including: type of teaching certification, undergraduate major or minor, undergraduate institution, advanced degree(s) or certifications (such as certification through the [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]] AND Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA)), type of preparation program (traditional or alternate route), test scores (various subject matter, licensure, or verbal skills tests), and years of teaching experience.&lt;ref name="Goe"&gt;Goe, L. (2007).[http://www.tqsource.org/publications/LinkBetweenTQandStudentOutcomes.pdf The link between teacher quality and student outcomes: A research synthesis.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806161328/http://www.tqsource.org/publications/LinkBetweenTQandStudentOutcomes.pdf |date=2010-08-06 }} Washington, DC: National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality. Retrieved 21 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In many countries, teaching credentials represent the main measure of teacher quality.&lt;ref name = "OECD"&gt;Sclafani, S., &amp; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. (2009). Evaluating and rewarding the quality of teachers: International practices. Paris: OECD.
&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, one goal of the [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] law is to ensure that all teachers meet state-defined standards of [[highly qualified teachers]]. Demographic characteristics such as a teacher's gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background may also be characterized as elements of teacher quality as variables impacting student outcomes.&lt;ref name = Zumwalt&gt;Zumwalt, K., &amp; Craig, E. (2005). Teachers' characteristics: Research on the indicators of quality. In AERA Panel on Research and Teacher Education, M. Cochran-Smith &amp; K. M. Zeichner (Eds.), Studying teacher education: The report of the AERA panel on research and teacher education (pp. 157-260). Mahwah, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; These indicators of teacher quality are relatively straightforward to ascertain, as opposed to the student achievement and teacher observation measures described below.

==Student achievement measures==
Teacher quality with regard to student achievement—also known as "teacher effectiveness"—is measured in terms of student achievement gains. Most extant research on teacher quality pertains to observable attributes, preparation, and credentials (Goldhaber, 2002; McCaffrey et al.,2003; Neild and Ripple, 2008). Probably the most widely studied attributes are experience and education levels, in part because the data can be readily obtained because of their use in salary placement (Goldhaber, 2002). There is mixed evidence, however, that experience and education levels are associated with student learning (Goldhaber, 2002; Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997, 2000; Hanushek, 1997; Wenglinsky,2002).&lt;ref name ="Goe" /&gt; Student achievement is measured through the use of standardized tests to determine the academic growth of students over time. Recently, a type of analysis of this growth termed "[[value-added modeling]]," following the 1971 approach of [[Eric Hanushek]],&lt;ref&gt;Eric A. Hanushek, "Teacher characteristics and gains in student achievement: Estimation using micro data." ''American Economic Review'' 60, no. 2 (May): 280-288&lt;/ref&gt;.has sought to isolate the fraction of student achievement gains attributable to individual teachers, or in some cases groups of teachers.&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;Harris, D. N. (2011). Value-added measures in education: What every educator needs to know. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Education Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been argued that student achievement measures do not necessarily correlate entirely with teacher quality, given that there are various factors that influence a student's performance which are not under the control of a teacher.

==Teacher practice==
Assessments of teacher quality may also draw upon evidence collected from observations of teachers' work that lead to the [[Empowering Effective Teachers|empowering of effective teachers]]. This evidence may be collected from in-person or video recorded observations of teaching, pre- and post-observation conferences with teachers, and samples of teachers' work with students. Assessments of teacher practice may examine teacher quality for a single lesson or over an entire school year. Such assessments may be holistic or narrative in form, but in [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]]-based systems of teacher assessment like the Framework for Teaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Danielson|first=Charlotte|title=Enhancing professional practice: A framework for teaching|year=2007|publisher=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|location=Alexandria, Va.|isbn=978-1416605171|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS)&lt;ref&gt;Teachstone.org. [http://www.teachstone.org/about-the-class/ About the CLASS]&lt;/ref&gt; have become increasingly more common in the United States in order to align with state and federal accountability requirements. Many school districts have developed their own rubrics for this purpose, such as the IMPACT system used in the District of Columbia public schools.&lt;ref&gt;District of Columbia Public Schools. [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/Ensuring+Teacher+Success/IMPACT+(Performance+Assessment)/An+Overview+of+IMPACT "An Overview of IMPACT"]&lt;/ref&gt; Other practice-based assessments of teacher quality require teachers themselves to assemble evidence and self-assess their own indicators of teacher quality according to rubrics as part of the process. Examples include the Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT)&lt;ref&gt;.pacttpa.org.  [http://www.pacttpa.org/_main/hub.php?pageName=Home "What is PACT?"]&lt;/ref&gt; and its national successor the edTPA,&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. [http://edtpa.aacte.org/ "About edTPA"]&lt;/ref&gt; the Oregon-based Teacher Work Sample.&lt;ref&gt;[[Western Oregon University]]. [http://www.twsm.org Teacher Work Sample Methodology]&lt;/ref&gt; and the collection of assessments required by teachers seeking certification from the [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]].

==Teacher experience==
The way that most current teacher compensation systems are set up is to reward teachers with salary increases for every year of additional experience they gain. The research literature on the predictive power of teacher experience for student achievement gains, however, reveals modest effects of experience limited to the first few years of a teacher’s career.&lt;ref name ="Jacob"&gt;Jacob, A. M. (2012) [http://cnx.org/content/m44965/latest/ Examining the Relationship between Student Achievement and Observable Teacher Characteristics: Implications for School Leaders.] International Journal of Educational Leadership Preparation, 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Hanushek, Kain, O'Brien, and Rivkin (2005), Kane et al. (2006), and Rockoff (2004) suggests that teacher effectiveness grows in the initial four or five years in the classroom and then begins to level off.

== Teacher evaluation approaches ==
Teacher evaluation is a process used to measure teacher effectiveness based on students learning and success. Evaluations of teachers over the years have changed. In earlier years, teacher evaluations were based on personal characteristics of the teacher, however, starting in the early 1950s until the 1980s, teacher evaluations took a shift and started to focus on teachers' teaching, observed through students' outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Teacher Evaluation, Teacher Effectiveness and School Effectiveness : Perspective from the USA|last = Ellett|first = Chad D.|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Personnel Evaluation in Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = &amp; Teddlie|first2 = C|pages = 101–128|issue = 1|volume = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1980s, teacher evaluations were measured based on increased professional development, accountability, and school improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Teacher evaluation has taken numerous approaches that observed teacher practices. Measures of Effective Teaching (MET), Danielson's Framework Model, Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), and the [[Value-added modeling|Value added Model (VAM)]] are all evaluation tools that aim to measure student achievement using teacher evaluation.  MET evaluates teacher effectiveness through five measures: students' gains in standardized testing, recorded classroom sessions and teacher reflections afterwards, teachers' knowledge in the pedagogical content, students views of the classroom and instruction of the teacher, and the teachers own views on their working conditions and the support of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Working with Teachers to Develop Fair and Reliable Measures of Effective Teaching|last = |first = |date = 2010|journal = MET Project|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the MET approach uses five measures to evaluate teacher effectiveness, the Danielson Framework model evaluates teachers using four domains: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Framework for Teaching Evaluation Instrument|last = Danielson|first = Charlotte|publisher = Charlotte Danielson|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 4–59|edition = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework of evaluation, teachers are evaluated through a rubric that contains these four domains. They can either be ranked or measured as unsatisfactory, basic, proficient, or distinguished. In this rubric, teachers are being evaluated through critical attributes and examples when being observed.

The CLASS approach, by Robert Pianta, evaluates teachers based on their interaction with students. To do this, the CLASS model evaluates teachers' interactions using three domains: emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The CLASS Protocol for Classroom Observations|last = |first = |date = 2010|journal = The MET Project|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that this approach is much more flexible, as the domains used within the approach vary based on students' grade levels.

On the other hand, the [[Value-added modeling|VAM]] approach uses students' test score gains to reflect teachers' effectiveness. Unlike the other approaches that evaluate particular characteristics or style of teaching for teacher evaluations, VAM does not directly evaluate the teacher. Although many of the approaches for teacher evaluations are debated, VAM is said to be inconsistent in its approach due to variation in classes, years, or test since its effectiveness measures are not based on teachers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Evaluating Teacher Evaluation|last = Darling-Hammond|first = Linda|date = 2012|journal = Phi Delta Kappan|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Amrein-Beardsley|first2 = A.|last3 = Haertel|first3 = E.|last4 = Rothstein|first4 = Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it said that VAM measures are retroactively effective due to teacher practices that influence learning of students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Finally, an organisation in India called Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) uses two main steps in teacher certification and evaluation. The first step is an Objective Test which is based on the subject chosen, classroom practice, logical ability, communication etc. The second step is a Practical assessment which consists of an e-portfolio submission and a proctored assessment +  interview. This evaluation and certification is based on CENTA standards &lt;ref&gt; http://centa.org/centastandards &lt;/ref&gt; that have been developed after several years of research and feedback.

The TU Berlin is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology and of the [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.time-association.org/members/|title=T.I.M.E. Top Industrial Managers for Europe|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows for student exchanges between leading engineering schools. It belongs to the [[Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesaer.org/en/members/germany/|title=Germany|author=Brainlane - SiteLab CMS v2|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TU Berlin is home of two innovation centers designated by the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]].

The university is notable for having been the first to offer the now very popular course Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen (which the institute itself translates as Industrial Engineering and Management). The university had conceptualised the course as a response to demands by industrialists to offer a course that provides their offspring with the technical and management expertise to run a company. First offered in winter term 1926/27 it is the oldest and one of the most prestigious programmes of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jens|first=Weibezahn,|date=2016|title=Studienführer für den Studiengang Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen|url=https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/5908|language=de|doi=10.14279/depositonce-5501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TU Berlin has one of the highest proportions of international students in Germany, almost 20% were enrolled in 2016.

==History==
[[Image:Bauakademie Schinkel (Eduard Gaertner).jpg|thumb|The [[Bauakademie]], founded in 1799, was a forerunner of the Technical University of Berlin.]]

On 1 April 1879, the  ''Königlich [[Technische Hochschule]] [[Charlottenburg]]'' ("TH Charlottenburg") was formed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia|governmental]] merger of the ''Berlin Building Academy'' ([[Bauakademie]]) and the ''Royal Trade Academy'' (''Königliche Gewerbeakademie''), two independent [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] founding colleges established in 1799 and 1821 respectively.

The ''TH Charlottenburg'' (''Royal Technical [[higher education|Higher]] School of Charlottenburg'') was named after the borough [[Charlottenburg]] where it is situated just outside Berlin. In 1899, the ''TH Charlottenburg'' was the first [[institute of technology|polytechnic]] in Germany to award [[doctorate]]s, as a standard degree for the graduates, in addition to [[diplom]]as, thanks to professor [[Alois Riedler]] and [[Adolf Slaby]], chairman of the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|Association of German Engineers]] (VDI) and the [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies]] (VDE).

[[File:1895 technische hochschule charlottenburg.jpg|thumb|left|Northern front of the Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg (Royal Technical School Charlottenburg) in 1895.]]

In 1916 the long-standing ''Bergakademie Berlin'', the Prussian [[mining]] academy created by the geologist Carl Abraham Gerhard in 1770 at the behest of King [[Frederick the Great]], was assimilated into the ''TH Charlottenburg''. Beforehand, the mining college had been, however, for several decades under the auspices of the ''Frederick William University'' (now [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]), before it was spun out again in 1860.

After Charlottenburg's absorption into [[Greater Berlin Act|Greater Berlin]] in 1920 and Germany being turned into [[Weimar Republic]], the ''TH Charlottenburg'' was renamed "Technische Hochschule of Berlin" ("TH Berlin"). In 1927, the Department of Geodesy of the ''Agricultural College of Berlin'' was incorporated into the ''TH Berlin''. During the 1930s, the redevelopment and expansion of the campus along the "East-West axis" were part of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] plans of a ''[[Welthauptstadt Germania]]'', including a new faculty of defense technology under General [[Karl Heinrich Emil Becker|Karl Becker]], built as a part of the greater academic town (''Hochschulstadt'') in the adjacent west-wise [[Grunewald (forest)|Grunewald]] forest. The shell construction remained unfinished after the outbreak of [[World War II]] and after Becker's suicide in 1940, it is today covered by the large-scale [[Teufelsberg]] dumping.

[[File:8. The Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg, Berlin.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Technische Hochschule]] in [[Charlottenburg]], [[Berlin]]]]
The north section of the main building of the university was destroyed during a bombing raid in November 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/a70100710/Dokumentationen/Geschichte/UB_TU_125Jahre_20091013_booklet_s30-38.pdf Entstehung und Bedeutung] UNIVERSITÄTSBIBLIOTHEK Technische Universität Berlin. Retrieved 16 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[Battle of Berlin|street fighting]] at the end of the Second World War, the operations at the ''TH Berlin'' were suspended as of April, 20th 1945.  Planning for the re-opening of the school began on June, 2nd 1945, once the acting rectorship led by [[Gustav Ludwig Hertz]] and [[Max Volmer]] was appointed. As both Hertz and Volmer remained in exile in the [[Soviet Union]] for some time to come, the college was not re-inaugurated until April, 9th 1946, now bearing the name of "Technische Universität Berlin".

Since 2009 the TU Berlin houses two Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KIC) designated by the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneurship.tu-berlin.de/menue/masterprogramme_qualifizierung/eit_ict_labs/|title=EIT ICT Labs - Turn Europe into a global leader in ICT Innovation|publisher=TU Berlin|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

The TU Berlin covers 604,000 m², distributed over various locations in Berlin.
The main campus is located in the [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]]. The seven schools of the university have some 33,933 students enrolled in 90 subjects (October, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/ueber_die_tu_berlin/zahlen_fakten/parameter/en/|title=TU Berlin: Facts &amp; Figures|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[El Gouna]] campus:
Technische Universität Berlin has established a satellite campus in Egypt to act as a scientific and academic field office. The nonprofit public-private partnership (PPP) aims to offer services provided by Technische Universität Berlin at the campus in El Gouna on the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campus-elgouna.tu-berlin.de/|title=TUB Campus El Gouna: Home|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight-thousand four hundred fifty five people work at the university: 338 professors, 2,598 postgraduate [[researchers]], and 2,131 personnel work in administration, the workshops, the library and the central facilities. In addition there are 2,651 student assistants and 126 trainees (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/ueber_die_tu_berlin/zahlen_fakten/#91200|title=TU Berlin: Facts &amp; Figures|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International student mobility is applicable through [[ERASMUS programme]] or through [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] (TIME) network.

==Library==
[[File:Zentralbibliothek der TU und UDK, nächtliches Lichtspiel.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the main library of Berlin Technical University and of the [[Berlin University of the Arts]]]]

The new common main library of Technische Universität Berlin and of the [[UdK|Berlin University of the Arts]] was opened in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.tu-berlin.de/index.php?id=555#content10219|title=Universitätsbibliothek TU Berlin: About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305152231/http://www.ub.tu-berlin.de/index.php?id=555#content10219|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holds about 2.9&amp;nbsp;million volumes (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.tu-berlin.de/index.php?id=555#content2195|title=Universitätsbibliothek TU Berlin: About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305152231/http://www.ub.tu-berlin.de/index.php?id=555#content2195|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library building was sponsored partially (estimated 10% of the building costs) by [[Volkswagen]] and is named officially "[[Zentralbibliothek der TU und UdK Berlin|University Library of the TU Berlin and UdK (in the Volkswagen building)]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.tu-berlin.de/|title=Universitätsbibliothek TU Berlin: Startseite|author=Universitätsbibliothek der Technischen Universität Berlin|work=Universitätsbibliothek TU Berlin|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A source of confusion to many, the letters above the main entrance only state "Volkswagen Bibliothek" (German for "Volkswagen Library") – without any mentioning of the universities.

Some of the former 17 libraries of Technische Universität Berlin and of the nearby University of the Arts were merged into the new library, but several departments still retain libraries of their own. In particular, the school of 'Economics and Management' maintains a library with 340,000 volumes in the university's main building (''Die Bibliothek – Wirtschaft &amp; Management''/″The Library″ – Economics and Management) and the 'Department of Mathematics' maintains a library with 60,000 volumes in the Mathematics building (''Mathematische Fachbibliothek''/"Mathematics Library").

'''''The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges - and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates''''' is a 2005 book by [[Daniel Golden]], a recipient of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in journalism. The book criticizes admissions at elite American universities, including preferences given to the wealthy, children of celebrities, and [[Legacy preferences|legacy]] applicants. It also documents discrimination against [[Asian Americans]] in the admissions process.

In 2017, the book was referenced by [[John Oliver]], in the [[late-night talk show]] ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', regarding the way [[Jared Kushner]] got admitted to [[Harvard University]], soon after the private [[Ivy League]] [[research university]] received a donation from Kushner's [[Charles Kushner|father]].&lt;ref name="Last Week Tonight"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8AwgO0AQI "Ivanka &amp; Jared"]. [[Last Week Tonight]]. Season 4 Episode 10. Minute 14:10. Retrieved April 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2016 Golden unfold the chain of events himself, expressing "gratitude to Jared Kushner", for "reviving interest the book".{{refn|{{cite news|title=How did ‘less than stellar’ high school student Jared Kushner get into Harvard? |first=Daniel | last=Golden |date=November 18, 2016|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/18/jared-kushner-harvard-donald-trump-son-in-law}} }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2710">'''Timothy Essex''' (1765?–1847) was an English composer.

==Life==
Essex was born in or about 1765 at [[Coventry, Warwickshire]], the son of Timothy Essex there; [[Margaret Essex]] was his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=53934|title=Essex, Margaret|first=Jane|last=Girdham}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing on the flute and violin at age 13, for his own amusement, and his father let him study music as a profession. In 1786 he established himself as a teacher of the pianoforte, organ, and flute. In order to better his position he matriculated at Oxford as a member of [[Magdalen Hall]] 10 December 1806, and took the degree of bachelor of music on the following 17 December. He proceeded doctor of music 2 December 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Alumni Oxon.; Oxford Graduates, 1851, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Essex was known as a teacher, and obtained some popularity as a composer. His ‘Musical Academy’ was at 38 Hill Street, Berkeley Square; he was also organist, composer to, and director of the choir of [[St George's Chapel, Albemarle Street]]. He died 27 September 1847, aged 82, in York Buildings, New Road, London.&lt;ref&gt;Gent. Mag. new ser. xxviii. 551&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Among his works are:

* ''Eight English Canzonetts for a Single Voice'' (1800).
* ''A Grand Military Sonata for the Pianoforte, with an accompaniment ad libitum for a violin'' (1800). 
* ''Six Duets for Flutes or Violins'' (1801?). 
* ''Eight Lessons and Four Sonatinas on a Peculiar Plan, intended to establish a proper method of fingering on the pianoforte'' (1802). 
* ''Six Canzonets, the words from the poems of the late Mrs. Robinson'' (1804). 
* ''Introduction and Fugue for the Organ'' (1812). 
* ''Harmonia Sacra. being a collection of sacred melodies for the 150 Psalms of David'' (1830?).

Essex also published a set of slow and quick marches for the pianoforte, with the full scores added for a military band, a variety of rondos for the pianoforte, and pianoforte and flute, and many single songs.

The '''UCT Mathematics Competition''' is an annual [[list of mathematics competitions|mathematics competition]] for schools in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]], held at the [[University of Cape Town]].

Around 7000 participants from Grade 8 to Grade 12 take part, writing a multiple-choice paper. Individual and pair entries are accepted, but all write the same paper for their grade.
The current holder of the School Trophy is [[Rondebosch Boys High School]], with [[Diocesan College]] achieving second place in the 2017 competition.&lt;ref name=Winners&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Winners|url=http://www.math.uct.ac.za/mam/outreach/competition/winners|publisher=UCT Mathematics Competition|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two schools have held the top positions in the competition for a number of years.

The competition was established in 1977 by Mona Leeuwenberg and Shirley Fitton, who were teachers at [[Diocesan College]] and [[Westerford High School]], and since 1987 has been run by Professor John Webb of the University of Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uct.ac.za/mam/staff/webb|title=John Webb|publisher=UCT Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna''', or simply '''BOKU''' (derived from its German name, Universität für '''Bo'''den'''ku'''ltur Wien, {{IPA-de|ˌunivɛʁziˈtɛːt fyːɐ̯ ˈboːdn̩kʊlˌtuːɐ̯ viːn|-|De-at Universität für Bodenkultur Wien.ogg}}), founded in 1872, is an education and research centre for renewable resources in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. BOKU combines fundamental and applied expertise in the fields of natural sciences, engineering and biotechnology as well as social and economic sciences to enhance the knowledge basis for sustainable management of natural resources. It is a member of the leading Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) university network and the [[United Nations Academic Impact]] (UNAI) promoting international cooperation. There are currently around 12,500 students from over 100 countries enrolled at BOKU.&lt;ref&gt;https://online.boku.ac.at/BOKUonline/StudierendenStatistik.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
After 27 years at ''Palais Schönborn'' the [[City of Vienna]] decided in 1896 to build a new campus at ''Türkenschanzpark'' in the [[Währing|18th]] district. The departments of sustainable agriculture, soil science, horticulture, animal husbandry, economics and social sciences are still headquartered at this original campus. Another city campus, located at ''Muthgasse'' in the [[Döbling|19th]] district near the [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]] underground station, is the headquarters for the biotechnology, chemistry, plant sciences, water resource management, waste management and food sciences departments. There is also a research facility complex in [[Tulln]], north of the city, with biotechnology and agricultural sciences laboratories and facilities. Other important locations and testing fields are Groß-Enzersdorf ([[Lower Austria]]), Jedlersdorf (Vienna), Knödelhütte (Vienna), Heuberg/Rosalia ([[Burgenland]]) and the Water Cluster [[Lunz am See]] (Lower Austria).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boku.ac.at/en/fm/themen/orientierung-und-lageplaene/standort-tuerkenschanze/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
BOKU offers 8 '''BSc programmes''' and 28 '''MSc programmes'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boku.ac.at/en/studienangebot/&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them allow various specialisations and possibilities for majors. The language of instruction is partly German, partly English. For many MSc programmes the language of instruction is English only. In general, programmes start each year in October and take three years for a BSc diploma with 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits and two years for a MSc diploma with 120 ECTS credits. Studies are in the field of natural resources management, life sciences &amp; biotechnology, civil &amp; environmental engineering, landscape planning, agriculture, forestry and winemaking.

The '''PhD programme''' is a three-year programme with 180 ECTS credits which consists of a research component (conducting research under supervision and writing a thesis) and a smaller education component. In order to guarantee adequate supervision, the research subject must fit the research programme of BOKU and its institutes.

Dr. '''Virginia Uribe''' (born December 20, 1933) is an educator, counselor and LGBT youth education outreach advocate. She is best known for founding Project 10, an educational support and drop-out prevention program for LGBT youth.

== Personal life ==

Uribe was born in Los Angeles, and lived her entire life in [[Pasadena, California]]. She grew up in an Italian family, living with parents and her grandparents in the same household. She went to [[Catholic school]] throughout elementary school, high school, and college.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelavendereffect.org/projects/ohp/virginia-uribe/|title=Dr. Virginia Uribe|date=2015-05-12|work=THE LAVENDER EFFECT®|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her grandparents were immigrants and "intensely" patriotic and believed the United States to be a land of opportunity. Their sense of fairness, [[working class]] sensibilities, and [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideals shaped her world view. Uribe felt that her family was supportive of her throughout her childhood, which gave her the mindset and strength needed to advocate for youth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Uribe, while attracted to both men and women, felt her deepest attractions towards women. During her time as a student, she found herself sexually attracted to [[nun]]s at the Catholic schools she attended. While these desires remained mostly hidden, Uribe believed that some of the other female Catholic students had similar desires towards nuns, based on their behavior while in their presence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She eventually married a man, but the marriage ultimately ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9QkDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Virginia+Uribe+divorce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R3fJEVOz-m&amp;sig=ovyIJW5xZlqCEakKqC_hsPvtVvM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi14qXw2oHUAhUmxoMKHVTuC4AQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Virginia%20Uribe%20divorce&amp;f=false|title=School's Out: Gay and Lesbian Teachers in the Classroom|last=Connell|first=Catherine|date=2014-11-14|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520278226|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational choices for women were limited in her youth, so Uribe felt she needed to choose among social work, nursing, and teaching. She chose education.  During her job as a science teacher and counselor at Fairfax High School, Uribe became interested in youth LGBT outreach. She decided to form the program after hearing the concerns of a student who had been kicked out of his family's home and dropped out of four high schools due to being sexually harassed. She founded Project 10 in 1984, as a drop-out prevention program for students who were LGBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lgbthistorymonth.com/virginia-uribe?tab=biography|title=Virginia Uribe {{!}} LGBTHistoryMonth.com|website=lgbthistorymonth.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project 10 ==
Uribe founded Project 10 in 1984 to help schools curtail harassment of homosexual students, therefore reducing the LGBT [[High school dropouts|dropout]] rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-28/news/we-1425_1_high-school-students|title=Project 10 Gives Gay Students Help When They Need It Most|last=YARBER|first=MARY|date=1991-03-28|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project 10, Los Angeles Unified School District program, provides support services and education for [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[transgender]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] students. Project 10's main goal is to establish voluntary, confidential, peer support groups led by trained facilitators. The support groups provide a safe environment for discussing the coming out process, family relationships, harassment, and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/lausd/offices/hep/programs/01.html|title=PROJECT 10 and FRIENDS OF PROJECT 10, INC.|last=|first=|date=|website=Los Angeles Unified School District|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also works to educate young people, educators, and parents on important issues such as [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]], [[teenage pregnancy]] prevention, and [[substance abuse]]. Services are provided to elementary and secondary advisers and district staff for at-risk youth.  According to the organization's mission statement, "[Project 10] works to assure that public schools are in compliance with state and federal laws regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, and that academic achievement should not be limited by being part of a marginalized social group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://friendsofproject10.org/vision.html|title=Welcome to Friends of Project 10 Inc.!|website=friendsofproject10.org|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project 10 received backlash from conservative politician [[Marion W. La Follette|Marian La Follette]] in March 1988, who led the GOP caucus in voting to withhold new funds from the Los Angeles Unified School District until it stopped supporting the program. Despite this, then District Supt. Leonard Britton and school board members voiced strong support for Uribe, the program, and homosexual students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-22/local/me-1677_1_school-district|title=Local News in Brief :  Counselor of Gays Backed|date=1988-03-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 1990 a session to teach some San Diego Unified School District staffers how to help students with the "curiosity, depression and fear that can surround homosexuality" drew a crowd outside of about 25 people, many of whom protested the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-25/local/me-978_1_gay-students|title=Workshop on Gay Pupils Draws Protest|last=BELLANDI|first=DEANNA|date=1990-09-25|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vocational Competence Certificate (VCC)''' - is a system of education and certification.
The VCC ideas are in accordance with strategic documents and directives in the European Union within the vocational range of education: 
* Initiation “New abilities on new work posts” - education and training customized to labour market needs and an access to education during the whole professional life,
* [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|The European Credit System for Vocational Education]],
* The CELAN system - aimed at promoting foreign languages,
* Strategy [[Europe 2020]],
* The European Professional Card – implemented by the European Commission to give employees the same rights in all European Union Countries,
* [[European Qualifications Framework|The European Qualifications Framework]].

'''The VCC is divided into two areas:'''  New Competences and Select Competences.

'''New Competences''' - The VCC New Competences module provides an opportunity to practise a certain profession. the recommended vocational education pathway within the VCC New Competences module includes between 260 and 300 training hours. To obtain a VCC New Competence certificate you need to pass 2 exams to demonstrate your theoretical and practical knowledge and abilities in the given profession.  The VCC is innovative thanks to the psychological and IT elements involved in the modules, as well as the trade foreign language course on offer.

'''Select Competences''' - The VCC Select Competences module provides candidates with an opportunity to develop update and independently choose their own modules.The VCC certification system is based on the results of the education process, meaning that every person, regardless of time, place, or education can pass a VCC exam in accordance of the European Qualifications Framework.

'''The VCC structure involves the following:''' 
* The VCC Foundation – responsible for the framework of the VCC modules and indicates the directions of its development,
* The Regional Academy – responsible for the certification process in a particular country/region,
* The Academy of Education – responsible for the education process
* Examination Partners – responsible for the organization of the theoretical and practical exams,
* Supporting Partners – responsible for promoting the VCC standard in its activities.
