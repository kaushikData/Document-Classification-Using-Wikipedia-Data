'''''Time for Tea: Women, Labor and Post-colonial Politics on an Indian Plantation''''' (2011) is a [[Postcolonial feminism|post-colonial feminist]] ethnographic critique of labour practices in [[India]]n [[tea]] [[plantation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Through personal interviews, anecdotes and a play, Piya Chatterjee examines the role gender, class, and race play in the production, consumption and circulation of tea. Transcending the realm of local politics and culture, the ethnography reveals the multilayered, multispatial, colonial dimension of gendered labour. She begins by deconstructing the image of the tea box itself to showcase how the image of the exotic tea-plucking women distracts the consumer from the harsh working conditions of plantations. By providing a historical account of the tea industry in India, Chatterjee reveals the intricate link between colonialism and the gendered division of labour in North Bengalese plantations. While gender is her main unit of analysis, Chatterjee explores the way in which colonialism has shaped and continues to shape, the patriarchal and class-based nature of plantations. Coming from a [[Global South]] perspective, she demonstrates the intersectionality of gender, class and race, as mutually constitutive mechanisms of oppression. Throughout the novel, she acknowledges her own privilege as a Global South academic and highlights the difficulties of speaking for the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]].

== Awards ==
* Recipient of the John Franklin Hope Book Award from [[Duke University]] press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukeupress.edu. Duke University Press. 2001."A Time for Tea."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review ==
* “A kaleiodoscopic account of the phenomenon of tea, incorporating dramatic interludes via [[Antonin Artaud]]’s theatre of the absurd, the poetics of [[Edward Said]] and the opiatic imagination of [[Lewis Carroll]], depicting the role tea plays in the high and low drama of empire building as it was and remain in transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, Sheleyah A. 2004. A time for tea: Women, labor, and Post/Colonial politics on an indian plantation. ''The Australian Journal of Anthropology'' 15, (1): 111.&lt;/ref&gt;–''[[The Australian Journal of Anthropology]]''
* “Those searching for an argument about the postcolonial tea economy, or to learn the history of trade unionism on the North Bengal Tea plantation, or even to gain a better understanding of the complexity of gender, caste, and ethnic relations in the region will be disappointed. […] Her book is more properly read as a meditative and reflective work and deserves to be judged on these terms.”&lt;ref&gt;Visweswaran, Kamala. 2003. "Piya Chatterjee. A Time for Tea: Women, Labor, and Post/Colonial Politics On an Indian Plantation." ''The American Historical Review'' 108, (2): 499-500.&lt;/ref&gt;-''[[The American Historical Review]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15593">{{Culture of Tuvalu}}
The '''Art of [[Tuvalu]]''' has traditionally been expressed in the design of clothing and traditional handicrafts such as the decoration of mats and fans. Tuvaluan clothing was traditionally made from ''Fala'' leaves (Screw Pine or [[Pandanus]]).&lt;ref name="CHF1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hedley |first1= Charles|title= General account of the Atoll of Funafuti|url= http://australianmuseum.net.au/Uploads/Journals/16686/487_complete.pdf |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1896 |publisher= Australian Museum Memoir 3(2): 1–72 |location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page=|pages=40–41|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[material culture]] of [[Tuvalu]] uses traditional design elements in artifacts used in everyday life such as the design of canoes and fish hooks made from traditional materials. The design of women's skirts (''titi'') and tops (''teuga saka''), that are used in performances of the [[Music of Tuvalu|traditional dance songs of Tuvalu]], represents contemporary Tuvaluan art and design.&lt;ref name="TPwa"&gt;{{cite web| last =  Mallon | first = Sean |title= Wearable art: Tuvalu style| publisher= Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa) blog|chapter=|date = 2 October 2013|url= http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2013/10/02/wearable-art-tuvalu-style/| accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Museum of New Zealand]] holds Tuvaluan artifacts and handicraft, including a man's jacket and a [[Mother Hubbard dress]]{{#tag:ref|pandanus jacket (FE001055/1) and Mother Hubbard dress (FE001055/2) Catalogue of the Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa).&lt;ref name="TPC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Te Papa - Collection|publisher= Museum of New Zealand|chapter=|date = |url= http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/| accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  made from [[pandanus]] leaves that were made following the impact of [[Christian]] missionaries who demanded that the [[women of Tuvalu]] adopt more conservative clothing as compared to traditional Tuvaluan clothing.&lt;ref name="TPTC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Topic: Tales from Te Papa Episode 48: Tuvalu Clothes|publisher= Te Papa (Museum of New Zealand) Pacific Cultures collection video|chapter=|date = |url= http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/topic/2209| accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional headband (''fau o aliki'') or headdress (''kula'', ''pale'') made out of pandanus, such as those prepared for the inauguration of a chief (''aliki'') would follow a specific design and the task of creating the headband or headdress is often reserved to a specific person, such as a daughter of the chief.&lt;ref name="GKTGS1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gerd Koch (translated by Guy Slater)|title=The Material Culture of Tuvalu|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1981 |month= |origyear= |publisher= University of the South Pacific|location=Suva |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id=ASIN B0000EE805 |page= |pages=100–102 |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional floral garland of a young woman (''Te fou ote tamafine'') or a headdress for a woman (''fou'') would also follow a specific design using ''tiale'' ([[gardenia]]), ''pua'' ([[guettarda speciosa]]) and ''melia'' ([[Plumeria|frangipani]]).&lt;ref name="GKTGS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoT"&gt;{{cite web| last =Takemoto| first =Shoko |title= The Art of Tuvalu - Climate Change through the eyes of artists in Tuvalu| publisher= exposure.co|chapter=|date = 4 November 2015|url= https://shoko.exposure.co/the-art-of-tuvalu| accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Te titi tao'' is a traditional skirt placed upon another skirt - a ''titi kaulama'' - and tops (''teuga saka''), headbands, armbands, and wristbands continue to be used in performances of the [[Music of Tuvalu|tradition dance music of Tuvalu]], such as the ''[[fatele]]''.&lt;ref name="AoT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Linkels|first1=Ad|title=The Real Music of Paradise|publisher=Rough Guides, Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.)|isbn= 1-85828-636-0|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''fatele'', in its modern form, is performed at community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals, such as the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September 2012.&lt;ref name="VM"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/william-and-kate-tour-2012-duke-1329728 |work=Mirror Online Edition|title=Game of thrones: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge play king and queen before dancing the night away in Tuvalu |accessdate=October 21, 2012| location=London | first=Victoria | last=Murphy | date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RE"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204827/Duchess-Cambridge-dons-grass-skirt-final-leg-Royal-tour.html|work=Mail Online Edition|title=Swaying to the South Pacific beat: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge don grass skirts to join in tribal dance on final leg of royal tour|accessdate=October 21, 2012| location=London | first=Rebecca | last=English | date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TPB 012013"&gt;{{cite web| work=Royal Visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Tuvalu, 18–19 September 2012 |title= Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau Newsletter  (TPB: 01/2013) |date = 6 February 2013|url=http://www.tuvaluislands.com/stamps/phil-bur/newsletter/index.html| accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary dancing skirts (''titi'') and tops (''teuga saka'') may still incorporate pandanus leaves, as well as synthetic or natural cloth that is decorated with bold geometric motifs and bold colours.&lt;ref name="TPwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoT"/&gt; Tuvaluan men also participate in performances of the traditional music in the costumes that follow tradition style that are made from pandanus leaves and synthetic or natural cloth that incorporate bold colours. Marriage ceremonies are usually conducted with men and women in traditional costumes.

==The material culture of Tuvalu==
In 1960–1961 [[Gerd Koch]] a German anthropologist, visited the atolls of [[Nanumaga]], [[Nukufetau]] and [[Niutao]], which resulted in his publication of a book on the material culture of the Ellice Islands, which described, with illustrations, the design of traditional handicrafts and artifacts. Following the change of name to [[Tuvalu]], the English translation by Guy Slatter was published under the title ''The Material Culture of Tuvalu''.&lt;ref name="GKT"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gerd Koch (translated by Guy Slater)|title=The Material Culture of Tuvalu|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1981 |month= |origyear= |publisher= University of the South Pacific|location=Suva |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id=ASIN B0000EE805 |page= |pages= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Hedley]], a naturalist at the [[Australian Museum]], had earlier written the ''General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti'' (1896) which described some uses of the native plants and trees on [[Funafuti]].&lt;ref name="CH1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hedley |first1= Charles|title= General account of the Atoll of Funafuti|url= http://australianmuseum.net.au/Uploads/Journals/16686/487_complete.pdf |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1896 |publisher= Australian Museum Memoir 3(2): 1–72 |location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Artists Open House''' is a special example of an [[Open Studio]] whereby the studio is a residential venue, usually a house or a garden. The format of an Open House is very similar to an Open Studio, but the significantly lower cost of exhibiting in a residential venue than a studio or gallery provides more artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.

== History ==
Artists Open Houses are perhaps best known in [[Brighton and Hove]] in the [[UK]] as taking place alongside the [[Brighton Festival]] and [[Brighton Festival Fringe]]. 

In 1982 Ned Hoskins filled his home with his and other artists work in protest at the lack of visual arts in the Brighton Festival. 
Hoskins had started a new phenomenon. This became the Fiveways Artists Group, named after the area of the city known as [[Fiveways, Brighton|Fiveways]]. They were soon followed by other groupings of Artists' Open Houses in other areas around Brighton and Hove, including Beyond The Level, founded 1996 (from city area [[The Level]]) and Kemptown Artists (from city area [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]]). In 2008 there were around 1000 artists exhibiting work in over 200 houses, divided into 13 trails, together with many independent open houses. 

In 2002 the Artists Open Houses Festival broke away from the official and fringe Brighton Festivals to become an independent organisation, often simplified to just ''AOH'', producing its own brochure and website.

== Currently ==
In Brighton, the Artists Open Houses Festival still runs concurrently with the Brighton Festival and Brighton Festival Fringe. These three organisations, along with many other projects that happen during the three weeks of the festival, work together to create a diverse range of art available for display around the city. 

A similar organisation in [[Cheltenham]] also runs for a week at the beginning of June. Originally called Cheltenham Artists Open Houses, but now known as Cheltenham Art Festival &amp; Open Studios. 

The [[Helfa gelf]]/Art Trail that covers much of North Wales includes many Artists Open Houses amongst its participating studios.

Also unlinked Artists Open House events happen in other areas of the UK. [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Leicester]], [[Manchester]], [[Oxford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Stroud]], [[Somerset]] and [[Worthing]] all have ones of their own.

==Plot==
Svirid Petrovich Golokhvosty ([[Oleg Borisov]]), unlucky proprietor of a barber shop, is a frivolous fashionist who after going bankrupt decides to fix his affairs with a profitable marriage. He learns by chance that the father of unfortunate looking woman Pronya Prokopovna (Margarita Krinitsyna) is offering a dowry of ten thousand.

During a stroll with his friend on the [[Saint Vladimir Hill]], he sees a beautiful girl Galya (Natalia Naum) and falls in love with her. He boasts to his friends that he will marry Pronya Prokopovna only because of the money and will start an affair with a beauty. One evening Golokhvosty meets Galya and begins to make advances towards her. At this moment Galya's mother, Sekleta Limerikha (Nonna Koperzhinskaya) finds them and makes him swear to marry Galya, which is against the daughter's desire.

The next day, Svirid Petrovich goes on a visit to the Serks and receives a blessing for marriage with Pronya Prokopovna. Returning from the bride, he accidentally encounters Sekleta and goes to her [[name day]]. There, Sekleta informs the guests that Galya and Svirid are now bride and groom. Galya escapes to her beloved Stepan directly from the engagement and asks for his protection, he manages to calm her down.

The wedding day is coming, but the plans of the Golokhvosty are not meant to come true: Sekleti's friends who attended the engagement of Svirid Petrovich with Galya, accidentally find out about his upcoming wedding with Pronya Prokopovna and inform Sekleta. She runs to the church and announces to those present that Svirid Petrovich is engaged to her daughter, and that he wishes to marry Pronya only because of the generous dowry.

Pronya Prokopovna and her parents drive away the treacherous bridegroom, and the usurer informs everyone that Golokhvosty is bankrupt, and is not the prosperous groom whom he pretended to be.

'''Dianne Houston''' (born July 22, 1954 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) is an [[African-American]] [[film director]], [[film producer|producer]] and [[screenwriter]].

Her first plays were produced in 1977. In 1990, she wrote for ''[[Brewster Place]]'', a show produced by [[Harpo Productions]]. After this, [[Oprah Winfrey]] became a supporter and financial backer on occasion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1994, she directed the short film ''Tuesday Morning Ride'', which starred [[Ruby Dee]] and [[Bill Cobbs]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] in 1995. She is the first and only African-American woman to be nominated for an Oscar for directing work.&lt;ref&gt;Haring, Bruce. "[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/special/l96os026.htm Oscars' minority viewpoint]." ''USA Today''. 03/04/97.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has since directed for a variety of [[Serial (radio and television)|TV series]], including ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' and ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', while continuing in film work. As a screenwriter, she worked on ''[[Take the Lead]]'' among other projects.

==Early life and career beginnings==
Dianne Houston was born on July 22, 1954, in Washington, D.C. She developed an interest in theater when her mother taught her how to read and write. Trained as an actress, she was very active in the D.C theater circuit. Houston wanted to be a [[child actor|child star]]. She was deeply disappointed when she failed to gain a role as a Mouseketeer on the Walt Disney TV series ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. In her teens she moved to [[New York City]], but became frustrated with the quality of acting roles available to black women. Houston resumed her education and attended Howard University in northwestern Washington, D.C.

==Career==
Houston began to write and direct her own plays. Her first play was produced about 1977. She was offered a chance to work with a script owned by [[Warner Bros.]] Her input and revision of the script led to other screenwriting assignments. She later worked in New York City, [[Amsterdam]], and [[Berlin]], gaining a screenwriter’s view of a world outside the [[United States]]. In 1990, she returned to the United States.

In that same year, she became executive story editor for an American drama series called ''Brewster Place'', based on [[Gloria Naylor]]’s novel, ''[[The Women of Brewster Place (novel)|The Women of Brewster Place]]'', which aired on ABC in May 1990, and was filmed entirely in [[Chicago]]. The series starred Oprah Winfrey, who also served as co-executive producer, and funded the series with her own production company, Harpo Productions. The series was canceled after a month, but Houston maintained a close friendship with Winfrey, who remained a supporter and, on occasion, became a financial sponsor for some of Houston’s later films.

In 1992, Houston was the associate producer for a TV film called ''You Must Remember This'', which portrays a highly principled African-American independent filmmaker, played by [[Robert Guillaume]].

In 1994, Houston created the screen play for ''[[Override (short film)|Override]]'', a science fiction film based on the short story "Over the Long Haul" by [[Martha Soukup]]. The film was directed by [[Danny Glover]] and starred [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] and [[Emily Lloyd]].

Her partnership with Glover was critical because he introduced Houston to the Chanticleer Discovery program, which enables industry professionals to direct their first film. From a pool of 1,000, Houston was one of four chosen. Using the Chanticleer Discovery program's resources, Houston was able to write, direct, and produce her short film titled ''[[Tuesday Morning Ride]]'' in 1994.

''Tuesday Morning Ride'' was based on the short story "A Summer Tragedy", by [[Arna Bontemps]], a [[Harlem Renaissance]] writer. Set in the 1930s, the story depicts an old man and woman who feel they have nothing to live for, since their children do not visit. They are so depressed that they eventually take themselves over a cliff. Houston’s portrayal of the characters is different. The elderly couple (Bill Cobbs and Ruby Dee) wake up on a Tuesday morning and finish preparing for their last few hours in their home before they have to move into an old people’s home. The couple has everything to live for, but lack a society to do it in. ''Tuesday Morning Ride'' gained Houston a nomination for an Academy Award in the category Best Live Action Short Film in 1995.

As the Academy Award nominations were announced, it became apparent that Houston was the only one of the 166 nominees who was an African American. [[Jesse Jackson]] responded by calling for a boycott of the Academy Awards ceremonies to call attention to what he labeled as "institutional racism in the Hollywood film industry”.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

When asked if she was surprised by the nomination for ''Tuesday Morning Ride'', she answered “No”. She had always wanted to be recognized as a director and knew she would need to make an outstanding piece of work that would be Oscar-worthy. She intended to make ''Tuesday Morning Ride'' the film that would get her that recognition.  Ironically, because she was the only African American to be nominated that year, her accomplishment as the only African American woman director to be nominated was overlooked.  Her nomination did lead, however, to several offers to direct feature films, and she continues to produce, write, and direct films.

In 1996, with Scott Abbott, Houston co-wrote the TV movie ''Run for the Dream: The Gail Devers Story''. [[Gail Devers]], played by [[Charlayne Woodard]], was one of the best female sprinters in America, who seemed assured a place on the United States Olympic team to compete in the 100-meter hurdles in the Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, in 1988. [[Graves' disease]] prevented her from competing in the Seoul Olympics. Devers underwent radiation treatment for two years but eventually recovered and earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team for the 1992 games in Atlanta, Georgia.

In 2000 Houston was the executive story editor and director of the television series ''[[City of Angels (2000 TV series)|City of Angels]]'', a medical drama that was broadcast for two seasons on CBS. This show was the network's first medical drama composed of a predominantly African-American cast.

In 2002 she directed ''NYPD Blue'' a television series set in the 15th police division of New York City. Each week two partners, detectives [[Andy Sipowicz]] and [[John Kelly (NYPD Blue)|John Kelly]] (later replaced by [[Bobby Simone]]), are the central characters in the police drama.

In 2004 Houston directed the NBC television series ''[[Crossing Jordan]]''. Dr. Jordan, played by [[Jill Hennessy]], is a forensic pathologist who tends to be overly passionate about solving homicides and frequently extends her search for answers outside of the autopsy table.

In 2005 Houston wrote the movie ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'' with [[Jamal Joseph]]. Inspired by a true story, the film portrays Richard Mason ([[Ted Danson]]), who is middle-aged and unemployed when he begins teaching in an inner-city school in the [[Bronx]].  Instead of following the prescribed curriculum, Mason encourages his elementary school students by teaching them the game of chess.

Her latest movie was ''[[Take the Lead]]'', in 2006. This urban drama was inspired by the life of Pierre Dulaine (played by [[Antonio Banderas]]), who was a prize-winning ballroom dancer and instructor who volunteered at elementary schools in one of the roughest neighborhoods in the Bronx. Given the tough assignment of a detention class, he teaches the students classical dance, which they mix with hip hop to create an exciting new style.

'''''Empty''''' is a cult, [[Australian]] "creative" magazine, concerned largely with printed design work, photography, illustration and film, created for the professional creative community.

The magazine is published by [[Sydney]]-based [[Design is Kinky]] studio, curators of the [[Semi-Permanent]] design festival, a fixture in design culture's global landscape, which occurs annually in Australia.

The magazine acts largely as a gallery of artwork, both domestic and international. It also features cultural commentary and interviews with artists, animators, other magazines, and so on. Notable interviewees have included [[Mark Andrews (writer)|Mark Andrews]], head of story on [[The Incredibles]] (cover story, issue 2, late-2004) and [[Dan Houser]] of [[Rockstar Games]] (issue 3, early-2005). 

''Empty'' was launched in April 2004 and is published somewhat arbitrarily, but usually occurs on a bi-monthly basis.

The magazine features little to no advertising whatsoever.

Current editor is [[Andrew Johnstone]], creator of ''Empty'' and the above-mentioned [[Design is Kinky]] and [[Semi-Permanent]].

The magazine enjoys newsstand distribution, but at this time is distributed only within Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">'''Ethnofiction''' is a [[neologism]] which refers to an [[ethnographic]] [[docufiction]], a blend of [[documentary]] and [[fictional film]] in the area of [[visual anthropology]]. It is a film type in which, by means of [[fictional]]  [[narrative]] or creative [[imagination]], often improvising, the portrayed characters ([[Indigenous peoples|natives]]) play their own roles as members of an [[ethnic]] or social group.

[[Jean Rouch]] is considered to be the father of ethnofiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maitres-fous.net/glossary.html Glossary] at MAITRES_FOUS.NET&lt;/ref&gt; An [[ethnologist]], he discovered that a filmmaker interferes with the event he registers.

An ethnographer cameraperson, in this view, will be accepted as a natural partner by the actors who play their roles. The cameraperson will be one of them, and may even be possessed by the [[rhythm]] of dancers during a ritual celebration and induced in a state of ''cine-[[trance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinetrance.com/cine-trance.htm Cine-trance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://der.org/jean-rouch/pdf/American_Anthropologist_Tribute.pdf Cine-trance: a Tribute to Jean Rouch](Visual Anthropology, American Anthropologist)&lt;/ref&gt; Going further than his predecessors, [[Jean Rouch]] introduces the [[actor]] as a tool in research.

A new genre was born.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rouch and the Genesis of Ethnofiction – thesis by Brian Quist (Long Island University)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Flaherty]], a main reference for Rouch, may be seen as the grandfather of this [[genre]], although he was a pure documentary maker and not an ethnographer.

Being mainly used to refer to [[ethnographic]] films as an object of visual anthropology, the term ethnofiction is as well adequate to refer to experimental documentaries preceding and following Rouch's oeuvre and to any [[fictional]] creation in human communication, arts or literature, having an ethnographical or social background.

==History==
Parallel to those of Flaherty or Rouch, ethnic portraits of hard local realities are often drawn in Portuguese films since the thirties, with particular incidence from the sixties to the eighties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comite-film-ethno.net/colloque-2006/pdf/constructions-identitaires/alves-costa.pdf Imagining Rurality: Portuguese Documentary and Ethnographic Film in the 1960s and 1990s] – Abstract for a conference by Catarina Alves Costa at [http://www.comite-film-ethno.net/ Comité du Film Ethnographique]&lt;/ref&gt;  and again in the early 21st century. The remote Trás-os-Montes region (see: [[Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province]] in [[Portugal]]), [[Guinée Bissau]] or the [[Cape Vert]] islands (ancient Portuguese colonies), which step in the limelights from the eighties on thanks to the work of certain directors ([[Flora Gomes]], [[Pedro Costa]], or [[Daniel E. Thorbecke]], the unknown author of [[Terra Longe]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://woyingi.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/african-filmmaker-profiles-flora-gomes/ African  Filmmaker Profiles: Flora Gomes] at [http://woyingi.wordpress.com/ The Woyingi Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reehanmiah.wordpress.com/2010/12/27/pedrocosta/ The Films of Pedro Costa] at [http://reehanmiah.wordpress.com/ Distant Voices]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spla.pro/fiche.php?no=1094&amp;type=films Terra Longe] at [http://www.spla.pro/ South Planet] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;) are themes for pioneering films of this genre, important landmarks in film history.
Arousing fiction in the heart of [[ethnicity]] is something current in the Portuguese popular narrative ([[oral literature]]): in other words, the traditional attraction for [[legend]] and [[surrealistic]] imagery in popular arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://d1113048.dotsterhost.com/The_Portuguese_and_the_others.pdf The Portuguese and the “others”: dialogue of cultures and characters in oral literary tradition] - Article by Maria Edite Orange and Maria Inês Pinho at Departamento de Artes e Motricidade Humana do IPP – Escola Superior de Educação (Porto)&lt;/ref&gt; inspires certain Portuguese films to strip off realistic predicates and become poetical fiction. This practice is common to many fictional films by [[Manoel de Oliveira]] and [[João César Monteiro]] and to several [[docufiction]] hybrids by [[António Campos]], [[António Reis]] and [[Ricardo Costa (filmmaker)|Ricardo Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/etn/v14n3/v14n3a05.pdf  Things we see: Portuguese anthropology on material culture] – Paper by Filomena Silvano at [http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/ Scielo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/disquieting-objects-20110503 Disquieting Objects]  - Article by Gabe Klinger at [http://www.movingimagesource.us/ The Museum of Moving Image]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d1113048.dotsterhost.com/RCen.pdf Ricardo Costa and the Flowing Pictures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145733/http://d1113048.dotsterhost.com/RCen.pdf |date=July 10, 2011 }} – Article by [[José de Matos-Cruz]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, ethnofiction (local real life and fantasy in one) is a distinctive mark of Portuguese cinema.

'''Eve Unsell''' (December 6, 1879&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census. Roll 501, p. 16B, Enumeration District 0139, FHL microfilm 124051, Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; July 6, 1937) was an American [[screenwriter]]. She wrote for 96 films between 1914 and 1933.&lt;ref name = Pioneers&gt;[http://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-eve-unsell/ Women Film Pioneers Project] (Columbia University Libraries)&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and died in [[Hollywood, California]]. Eve was an American scenarist who was known to also use the [[pseudonym]] Oliver W. Geoffreys as well as E.M. Unsell. Eve was married to a man named Lester Blankfield, but the year is disputed. Records list their marriage year as 1911, but it does not match up with other documentation. Eve Unsell was a professional in her career as a scenarist, overcoming many challenges along the way. Eve wrote for over 96 films in her lifetime, and edited over ten. Some of her most famous screen writes turned into productions include ''Shadows'' (1922), ''[[The Ancient Mariner (film)|The Ancient Mariner]]'' (1925), ''The Plastic Age'' (1925), and ''[[The Spirit of Youth]]'' (1929). Although she was most famous for her work in scenario writing she can also be given credit as an adapter, company director, editor, play reader, screenwriter, theatre actress, and writer. She helped in the writing of many novels as long as editing many different pieces from literature to theatrical writing.

== Career ==
Unsell underwent training as a journalist and magazine writer for the ''[[Kansas City Post]]'' and graduated from [[Columbia College (Missouri)|Christian College]]&lt;ref&gt;Emerson College. "Eve Unsell". Special Collections, 1902-03. Web. 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; in Columbia, Missouri. She attended [[Emerson College]] in Boston for her postgraduate year, studying literature and drama. The theatrical agent, [[Beatrice deMille|Beatrice DeMille]] was so impressed with one of Unsell’s short stories that she hired young Eve as a play reader for her theatrical company in New York.&lt;ref name = Achuff&gt;Achuff, Charlie; Madeline F. Matz. "Eve Unsell." In Jane Gaines, Radha Vatsal, and Monica Dall’Asta, eds. [https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-eve-unsell/ Women Film Pioneers Project]. Center for Digital Research and Scholarship. New York, NY: Columbia University Libraries, 2013. Web. September 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; DeMille became a mentor to Eve, giving her the motivation she needed to further her career. Beatrice’s two son’s Cecil and William, partnered with future theatre impresario [[David Belasco]], later took over Beatrice’s company, becoming mentors to Unsell as well. In the article, "The Rise Of The Continuity Writer," featured in ''Writer’s Monthly'', Eve wrote of her mentors, "Masters of screen technique as the DeMille’s have realized the necessity for not only recruiting the eminent authors for screen ranks but for training young writers to become technicians of screen detail, for the purpose of successfully translating the ‘big ideas’ of the big authors in screen terms, and so, close on the heels of the plot itself."&lt;ref&gt;Eve Unsell. ''Writers Monthly'', Volumes 19-20. From The Studio Angle. 2-The Rise of The Continuity Writer. Scenario Editor, R-C Studios, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; This is where she learned plot construction, or what she liked to call it, plot ‘detecting’. Eve gained much experience under the DeMille’s and David Blasco. Blasco, who cast her in the theatrical comedy ''Excuse Me'', gave Unsell two years of on stage experience that would later help in her better understanding of acting and screen writing. It was not until 1913 that Unsell’s hard work in screen writing paid off. That year ''Moving Picture World'' announced that she would sell several film scenarios to the Pathe Freres, and the Kalem Company, who decided to produce Unsell’s scenario, ''The Pawnbroker’s Daughter''.&lt;ref name = Achuff/&gt;

Later that year Unsell signed a contract with Cecil DeMille and [[Jesse Lasky]] for what was then the [[Famous Players Film Company]]. The famous news headline "Eve Unsell Will Sail For England," announced that in 1916 Unsell was chosen to be scenario head of the [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players-Lasky British Producers]] Ltd. The company’s aim was "to feature European locations and to produce the works of the greatest Continental writers."&lt;ref name = Achuff/&gt; Eve liked her office in London, describing it as "comfortable and cozy." However, her heart was in American Pictures. In an interview with ''[[Motion Picture News|Motion Pictures News]]'' she explains, "English audience is a very critical one. American pictures predominate and are well received." The most successful film written by Unsell in her time abroad was ''[[The Call of Youth]]'' (1921), a short romance film in which [[Alfred Hitchcock]] is credited as a title designer.&lt;ref name= Slide&gt;Anthony Slide. University Press of Mississippi. ''A Special Relationship: Britain Comes to Hollywood and Hollywood Comes to Britain''. Chp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the movie was produced in 1921, Unsell moved back to New York to start her own company, Eve Unsell Photoplay Staff, Inc., the only company of its kind at the time headed by a woman.

Unsell was a feminist and in a time when women had little representation in media she made a point to make both her male and female roles equally important in screen writes and other written works. In an article "From the Studio Angle, The Development Of Screenwriters," written by Eve and featured in the ''Writer’s Monthly'', she talks of her stance on men and women representation in screen writing and on screen roles. "There’s sex in writing," she explains. "Men are generally more successful in working out intricate plots, and supplying the broad sweeps of action, the masculine logic, and proper balance of the subject." Women’s roles tend to be different, however just as important. The women "successfully ‘doctor’ the scenarios, adding little touches that give that emotional values to the dramatic scenes, and the psychology of the character necessary for the ‘popular’ picture."&lt;ref name = Unsell&gt;Eve Unsell. ''Writers Monthly'', Volumes 19-20. From the Studio Angle. 3-The Development of Screen-Writers. Scenario Editor, R-C Studios, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; Eve defends Eve illuminates how the roles of men and women are brought alive through screen writing and ultimately through pictures and art. The pride she takes in her work is evident through her emphasis on the importance of the storywriter. "Only the best stories are good enough for the film… the screen needs men and women of vision, to portray life at it’s best… the screen writer must learn the art of substituting action for words."&lt;ref name = Unsell/&gt;

Eve Unsell is now one of the 202 women featured in the "Women Film Pioneers Project," an online database that "showcases women who worked behind-the-scenes in the silent film industry as directors, producers, editors, and more".&lt;ref name = Pioneers/&gt;

The term "'''Expressionist Rococo'''" was first used in 1928 by Max Osborn to describe the Theater am Kurfürstendamm in Berlin designed by [[Oskar Kaufmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Der Architekt Oskar Kaufmann|last=Osborn|first=Max|publisher=F. E. Hübsch|year=1928|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=XIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; In difference to the original [[Rococo]] design Kaufmann emphasizes on the dynamic and movement as a whole concept. Asymmetrical details are subordinated to a large symmetrical frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oskar Kaufmann Ein Theaterarchitekt zwischen Tradition und Moderne|last=Hansen|first=Hansen|publisher=Gbr. Mann Verlag|year=2001|isbn=3786123756|location=Berlin|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other protagonists of this style were [[Hans Poelzig]],  Leo Nachtlicht and Gerhard Schliepstein.

The '''film industry''' or '''motion picture industry''', comprises the technological and commercial institutions of [[filmmaking]], i.e., film [[production company|production companies]], [[film studio]]s, [[cinematography]], [[animation]], [[film production]], [[screenwriting]], [[pre-production]], [[post production]], [[film festival]]s, [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[actor]]s, [[film director]]s and other [[film crew]] personnel.

Though the expense involved in making [[film]]s almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable film making equipment, and expansion of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed [[independent film]] production to evolve. [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] is the oldest film industry of the world, and the largest in terms of box office gross revenue. [[Indian cinema]] (including [[Bollywood]]) is the largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, with 3.5 billion tickets sold worldwide annually (compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold annually)&lt;ref&gt;Matusitz, J., &amp; Payano, P. (2011). The Bollywood in Indian and American Perceptions: A Comparative Analysis. ''India Quarterly: A Journal of International Affairs'', ''67''(1), 65–77. {{doi|10.1177/097492841006700105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,986 feature films produced annually.&lt;ref name="filmfed"&gt;{{cite web|title=INDIAN FEATURE FILMS CERTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 2017|url=http://www.filmfed.org/IFF2017.html|website=[[Film Federation of India]]|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide theatrical market had a box office of {{USD|38.6 billion}} in 2016. The top three continents/regions by box office gross were: Asia-Pacific with {{USD|14.9 billion}}, the U.S. and Canada with {{USD|11.4 billion}}, and Europe, the Middle East and North Africa with {{USD|9.5 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lang |first=Brent |date=22 March 2017 |title=Global Box Office Hits Record $38.6 Billion in 2016 Even as China Slows Down |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/box-office-record-china-1202013961/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2016-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-Report-2.pdf |title=Theatrical Market Statistics 2016 |website=MPAA |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016}}, the largest markets by box office were, in decreasing order, the United States, China, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom. {{as of|2011}}, the countries with the largest number of film productions were India, Nigeria, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Daniel B. |title=The trend shift of the modern film industry |url=https://www.bollywikia.com/ |accessdate=2 April 2018 |agency=Lindale Avenue |issue=April '18 |publisher=San Fran &amp; co |date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, significant centers of movie production are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="EUROAVCOUNCIL-20090511"&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct from the centers are the locations where movies are filmed. Because of labor and infrastructure costs, many films are produced in countries other than the one in which the company which pays for the film is located. For example, many U.S. movies are filmed in Canada, many Nigerian movies are filmed in [[Ghana]], while many Indian movies are filmed in the Americas, Europe, [[Singapore]] etc.

[[File:Hollywood Sign (Zuschnitt).jpg|thumb|The [[Hollywood Sign]]|226x226px]]
The [[cinema of the United States]], often generally referred to as '''Hollywood''', has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world which originated more than 121 years ago and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. [[Hollywood]] is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the [[American Film Institute]], [[LA Film School]] and NYFA being established in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyfa.edu/los-angeles/ Los Angeles Film Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; However, four of the [[Major film studio#Today's Big Six|six major film studios]] are owned by [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] companies. The [[major film studios]] of Hollywood including [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] are the primary source of the [[List of highest-grossing films|most commercially successful movies in the world]], such as  ''[[Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).

American film studios today collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world. Only [[The Walt Disney Company]] — which owns [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the Walt Disney Studios]] — is fully based in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donckels|first=William|title=Disney Raises SoCal Annual Pass Prices 30% - to Keep Locals "Out"|url=http://technorati.com/business/article/disney-raises-socal-annual-pass-prices/|publisher=Technorati.com|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] is headquartered in Culver City, California, its parent company, the [[Sony Corporation]], is headquartered in [[Tokyo]], Japan. Most shooting now takes place in [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Louisiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[North Carolina]]. Hollywood is the most popular film industry with the highest number of screens, and is the highest-grossing film industry in the world. Between 2009-2015, Hollywood consistently grossed $10 billion (or more) annually.&lt;ref&gt;Number of total movies in 2014 are taken from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood's award ceremony, the [[Academy Awards]], officially known as The Oscars, is held by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) every year and a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oscar Statuette|url = http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette|website = Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] which makes [[Cinema of the United States|United States cinema]] the earliest cinema in the whole world. Jenkins used his Phantoscope to project his film before an audience of family, friends and reporters. The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner [[Thomas Armat]] modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to [[Thomas Edison]], who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope.
[[File:Nestor studio 1911.jpg|thumb|223x223px|Nestor studio, 1911]]
[[Nestor Studios]] was Hollywood's first movie studio, founded on 27 October 1911. It was built by [[David Horsley]] for Nestor Motion Picture Company. It was then owned and operated by [[David Horsley]] and his brother, William Horsley. The first [[Sound stage|motion picture stage]] in Hollywood was built behind the tavern. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move
west. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, [[Al Christie]]. Other [[Filmmaking|filmmakers]] began opening studios in the [[Hollywood]] area. The Horsleys operated the [[Nestor Studios]] at the Sunset and Gower location until 20 May 1912, when the [[Universal Studios]] was formed, headed by [[Carl Laemmle]]. Nestor, along with several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle's [[Independent Moving Pictures]] (IMP), was merged with Universal.

[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|Old Chinese Cinema in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]], China]]
The '''Cinema of China''' is one of three distinct historical threads of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] [[film|cinema]] together with the [[cinema of Hong Kong]] and the [[cinema of Taiwan]]. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on [[Shanghai]] in the first decades. China is the home of the largest film studio in the world, the [[Hengdian World Studios]], and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving [[Entrepôt|entrepot]] and the largest city in the [[Far East]]. In 1913, the first independent Chinese [[screenplay]], ''[[The Difficult Couple]]'', was filmed in [[Shanghai]] by [[Zheng Zhengqiu]] and [[Zhang Shichuan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = East Asian Cinema|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC|publisher = Oldcastle Books, Limited|date = 4 November 2010|isbn = 9781842433805|first = David|last = Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'' (2000) was funded in part by [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s production house,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Touch of Sin: Interview with Jia Zhang-ke|url = http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2014/05/16/a-touch-of-sin-interview-with-jia-zhangke/|website = Electric Sheep|accessdate = 3 December 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''Still Life'' was shot on HD video. ''Still Life'' was a surprise addition and [[Golden Lion]] winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. ''Still Life'', which concerns provincial workers around the [[Three Gorges]] region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth [[Generation]] Chinese directors like [[Zhang Yimou]] and [[Chen Kaige]] who were at the time producing ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''The Promise'' (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2014, the gross box office in China was [[Renminbi|¥]]29.6 billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]4.82 billion), with domestic films having a share of 55%.

The 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s are generally considered the [[golden age]] of Egyptian cinema. As in the West, films responded to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable [[Film genre|genres]] (happy endings being the norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one critic, "If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites, it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which would manifest themselves in the box office."&lt;ref name="retrospection"&gt;Farid, Samir, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm "Lights, camera...retrospection"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511112523/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm |date=11 May 2013 }}, ''[[Al-Ahram]] Weekly'', 30 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, Egypt's cinema has gone in separate directions. Smaller [[art film]]s attract some international attention but sparse attendance at home. Popular films, often broad comedies such as ''[[What A Lie!

The term "'''cinema of Korea'''" (or "'''Korean cinema'''") encompasses the motion picture industries of [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late [[Joseon dynasty]] to [[Korean War|the Korean War]] to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.

South Korean films enjoyed a "Golden age" during the late 1950s, and 1960s, but by the 1970s had become generally considered to be of low quality.

Unlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas.  It has always been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing [[film genre|genres]], like comedy and action, and heavily reliant on formulas, sequels and remakes.  Typically of commercial cinemas, its heart is a highly developed [[star system (film)|star system]], which in this case also features substantial overlap with the [[Cantopop|pop music industry]].

The '''cinema of Pakistan''', or simply, '''Pakistani cinema''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پاکستانی سنیما}}}}) refers to [[Pakistan]]'s film industry. Most of the feature films shot in Pakistan are in [[Urdu]], the national language, but may also include films in English, the official language, and regional languages such as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]].

Before the separation of Bangladesh, Pakistan had three main film production centres: [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Dhaka]]. The regime of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]]s, [[film piracy]], the introduction of entertainment taxes, strict laws based upon ultra-conservative jurisprudence, was an obstacle to the industry's growth.&lt;ref name="dawn.com"&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1045365&lt;/ref&gt; Once thriving, the cinema in Pakistan had a sudden collapse in the 1980s and by the 2000s "an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.".&lt;ref&gt;an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywhat.com/beyond/pakistani.html The Beginner's Guide to Pakistani Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the industry has recently made a dramatic and remarkable comeback, evident from the fact that 18 of the 21 highest grossing Pakistani movies were released from 2013 through to the present, with Pakistani films frequently outcompeting Bollywood movies for the Pakistani audience, the industry is supported by Pakistani channels such as ARY and Geo whose entertainment divisions have invested significantly in Pakistani cinema when expanding from providing news and entertainment on TV channels, the lifting of strict regulations on production of films and reduction of taxes on cinemas helped to fuel an expansion across the industry from which the film industry has seen a revival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

{{see also|Cinema of Bangladesh|Dhallywood}}
The '''cinema of Bangladesh''' is the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language film industry based in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. The industry often has been a significant film industry since the early 1970s. The word "Dhallywood" is a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and [[Hollywood]]. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is [[Melodrama|Melodramatic cinema]], which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company named Picture House was opened. A short silent film titled ''Sukumari'' (''The Good Girl'') was the first produced film in the region during 1928. The first full-length film ''The Last Kiss'', was released in 1931. From the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dhaka is the center of Bangladeshi film industry, and generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences. The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s were the golden years for Bangladeshi films as the industry produced many successful films. ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh|The Face and the Mask]]'', the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film was produced in 1956.&lt;ref name=cholochitro&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Bangladeshi Film|url=http://www.cholochitro.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=49|website=cholochitro.com|publisher=Cholochitro|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukh O Mukhosh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mukh O Mukhosh |url=http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |publisher=bfa.gov.bd |accessdate=14 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021323/http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign films include major box offices from the west, and other major film producers of the world. This has caused a massive ripple effect on the country's economy. It is assumed that this increases the purchase of unlicensed DVDs. However, even copyright violating DVDs took longer to obtain. The minimum cost to view a foreign film not screened locally, was 1 million Rupiah. This is equivalent to US$100, as it includes a plane ticket to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/indonesia/new-import-policy-will-kill-indonesian-film-industry-noorca/423632 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923200931/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/indonesia/new-import-policy-will-kill-indonesian-film-industry-noorca/423632 |archivedate=23 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an annual [[Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival]] which runs for two weeks in the latter half of September.

=== Nepal ===
{{main|Kallywood}}
Nepali film does not have a very long movie history, but the industry has its own place in the cultural heritage of the country. It is often referred to as 'Nepali Chalchitra' (which translates to "Nepali movies" in English). The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of "Kathmandu" and "Hollywood"; "Kollywood" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.[1] [[Chhakka Panja]] has been considered the highest-grossing movie of all time in Nepali Movie Industry and Kohinoor the second highest. Nepali movies has recently begun receiving international acclaim with films such as [[The Black Hen]] (2015), [[Kagbeni (film)|Kagbeni]] (2006) and others. Nepali feature film [[White Sun]] (Seto Surya) has bagged the Best Film award at [http://sgiff.com/ the 27th Singapore International Film Festival] (SGIFF)(2016).

The Film Development Board (FDB) was established by the Government of Nepal for the development and promotion of the Nepali film industry. The Board is a liaison to facilitate the conceptualization, making, distribution and exhibition of Nepali films nationally. The Board attempts to bridge the gap between film entrepreneurship and government bureaucracy. The Board is a balance between the people at large, the government, and the process of film making. It is intended to act as the safeguard of the interests of the people, the watchdog of the government, and the advocate of filmmakers.

[[File:Story-of-the-kelly-gang-capture-1906.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Still frame|still]] from ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (Australia, 1906; 80&amp;nbsp;min.)]]

The first [[feature film]] to be made was the 1906 Australian silent ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', an account of the notorious gang led by [[Ned Kelly]] that was directed and produced by the [[Melbourne|Melburnians]] Dan Barry and [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Story of the Kelly Gang |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ |publisher=Australian Screen, National Film and Sound Archive |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.

=== Hollywood ===
The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word "Hollywood" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.

In 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].

The [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&amp;M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.

The famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read "Hollywoodland." It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest.

The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].

The first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.

From about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the "Hollywood studio system", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.

''[[Joymoti (1935 film)]]'' by [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]] was the first Indian dubbed film, released in Calcutta on 10 March 1935. Till then, all dialogues of all talkies were had to be recorded at locations during the shooting of the film.

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the [[Great Depression]], World War II, the [[Indian independence movement]], and the violence of the [[Partition of India|Partition]]. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly [[escapism|escapist]], but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.&lt;ref name="britannica2"/&gt;

In 1937 [[Ardeshir Irani]], of ''[[Alam Ara]]'' fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, ''[[Kisan Kanya (1937 film)|Kisan Kanya]]''. The next year, he made another colour film, a version of ''Mother India''. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker [[Nasir Hussain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How film-maker Nasir Husain started the trend for Bollywood masala films|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/how-film-maker-nasir-husain-created-the-prototype-for-bollywood-masala-films/story-ckL6zPLHJFDYoupjFBtbfN.html|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=30 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]], pioneering the Bollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] format.&lt;ref name="Chaudhuri58"/&gt;

== Economics ==
{{main|Economics of the arts and literature}}

Profitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.

Substantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].

The film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.&lt;!-- several recent Ghibli productions --&gt;

On the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon McClure]], lead singer with [[Reverend and the Makers]], set up a petition on the [[UK]] [[Prime Minister]]'s website to allow protest against what he alleges as "racial discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/jon-mclure-protests-form-696|title=Jon McLure Protests Form 696 - Musicians Set Up Petition|publisher=Clash Music|date=2 December 2008|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement on their web site, The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters CEO Patrick Rackow stated "...the imposition of Form 696 on live music is likely to discourage the existence and growth of live music. Music has long been a positive form of free expression, for people from all walks of life to create and enjoy. This form appears to single out certain genres of music and ethnic audiences and therefore the Academy cannot support it.”&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2008, Mike Howlett, Chairman of the Music Producers Guild (UK), wrote to the General Secretary of the Musicians Union "In keeping with the Musicians Union and UK Music, we feel this is a gross infringement of civil liberties and a form of racial discrimination. We also feel that this will deter the staging of live musical events, stifle free expression and possibly penalise certain genres of music and ethnic audiences. Our members are horrified that this legislation, introduced in 2006, is being enforced under the guise of public law and order. We see no reason why artists and/or venue owners and managers should be forced to comply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpg.org.uk/news_stories/102|title=MPG letter of Support towards MU to stop form 696|publisher=Music Producers Guild|date=12 December 2008|accessdate=8 March 2009|last=Howlett

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police position==
David Isles, Detective Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police Clubs and Vice unit has stated that Form 696 is not designed to stop people having a good time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20081203_form696.shtml|title=Form 696 fury|publisher=BBC 6 Music News|accessdate=2009-02-21}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police web site describes the form as a ''Promotion Event risk assessment form''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/Article/Organising-a-promotion-or-event/1400002385589/1400002385589|title=Metropolitan Police Service - Events
|publisher=Metropolitan Police Service|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Martin stated that the original form, with its questions relating to audience ethnicity "was removed just because I don't think it added any value to the form.... We take account of where the event is playing, what other events might be playing nearby, the type of music that's being played, and whether there have been problems before. We've had quite a few of what I consider 'higher risk events', where there may be some problems - so we recommend additional searching processes and additional security to help manage the event safely."&lt;ref name=guardian20090129 /&gt; "It's not about being risk averse, it's about managing the risk," he said. "If you're a publican and you are just having some performers to entertain your regular customers, you won't be expected to do a risk assessment. It's for when the performance is being put on to draw people in. We will never assess somebody just on the genre of music they are performing. There is a whole raft of factors that are taken into account."&lt;ref name=independent20081121 /&gt;

==Form revised==
In September 2009, the Metropolitan Police announced "that venues would no longer be asked for details of the music style. A requirement to provide the telephone number of the performing artist will also be dropped and an independent "scrutiny panel" will be set up to ensure that the form is not misused."&lt;ref name=guardian7-9&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/sep/07/met-police-form-696-clubs|title=Met police bows to pressure to drop question on 'racist' form 696|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 September 2009|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feargal Sharkey]] described this as an "exercise in semantics" and called for the form to be completely scrapped. He added that "it was clear that the altered version continued to target musicians from ethnic minorities and he objected strongly to a question which asks about the 'make-up of the patrons'."&lt;ref name=guardian7-9/&gt;

==Form 696 scrapped==
On 10 November 2017, it was announced that the use of Form 696 was to be discontinued in London following a review called for by [[Mayor of London]] [[Sadiq Khan]].&lt;ref name="Independent 10 November 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/form-696-scrapped-racist-police-paperwork-claims-london-mcs-djs-grime-garage-a8048821.html|title= Form 696: Police scrap 'racist' risk assessment for MCs and DJs| last= Nerssessian| first= Joe |date= 10 November 2017|website= www.independent.co.uk |publisher= [[The Independent]] | accessdate= 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 10 November 2017"/&gt; Reporting the decision, the BBC noted, "The Met denied the form had been used to target particular genres but said it had decided to drop it after a fall in 'serious incidents' at music events"; however, the BBC also reported that a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information]] request earlier in 2017 had discovered that 16 other English police forces were using forms similar to Form 696.&lt;ref name="BBC 10 November 2017"/&gt;

[[File:Giuseppe Di Giacomo.jpg|thumb|Giuseppe Di Giacomo]]

Author of about a hundred scientific publications on the relationship between aesthetics and literature,&lt;ref&gt;His most important work on the relationship between aesthetics and literature is ''Estetica e letteratura. Il grande romanzo tra Ottocento e Novecento'', Laterza, 1999, rpt. 2010; Spanish translation, Valencia, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on the relationship between aesthetics and the visual arts, with an emphasis on modern and contemporary culture, and on topics such as the image, representation, the art/life nexus, memory and the notion of testimony.

==Biography==
Before undertaking his university career, immediately after graduating in Philosophy (with professor Emilio Garroni), Di Giacomo taught in senior high schools and, even before that, while still a university student, he was a substitute teacher for several months in various junior high schools. In 1976, he was awarded a contract to teach Epistemology at the Faculty of Natural, mathematical and physical sciences of the University of Parma, and obtained a permanent position in the same university two years later. On 28 February 1987 he became a researcher at ''Sapienza'' University of Rome, where, starting from 19 October 1993, he became Associate Professor and, from 1 November 2001, Full Professor of Aesthetics.
Since November 2012, he has been the Director of MLAC (Museo Laboratorio di Arte Contemporanea/Laboratory Museum of Contemporary Art), ''Sapienza'' University. He is a member of the Teaching Staff of the Ph.D. in Philosophy of the same university, where he also served, for six years, as President of the Master’s Degree of the former Faculty of Philosophy.
He has coordinated national research projects (Progetti PRIN) and has taken part in international research projects. Over the last decade, he has coordinated university researches (Ricerche di Ateneo) involving more than thirty scholars from different study areas and focussing on aesthetic-philosophical and literary-artistic topics.

He edited, with Claudio Zambianchi, the anthology ''Alle origini dell'opera d'arte contemporanea'' (Roma-Bari, Laterza, 2008; 4th ed. 2012)

He is a founding member of SIE (''Società Italiana di Estetica/Italian Society of Aesthetics'').

He is the editor of the book series ''Figure dell'estetica'' of the publishing house Alboversorio (Milan).

He is a member of the scientific board of the following journals 
* Paradigmi
* Studi di estetica
* Rivista di estetica
* Estetica. Studi e ricerche
* Comprendre. Revista catalana de filosofia

Di Giacomo is also a member of the scientific board of ''Aesthetica Preprint'', a book series of the ''Centro Internazionale Studi di Estetica'' (''International Centre for the Study of Aesthetics'').

== Thought==
Di Giacomo maintains that, in order to tackle the issue of the image today, it is necessary to refuse both an interpretation of the image as a mere mirror of things and its interpretation as an exclusively self-referential system of signs. Based on his reading of Wittgenstein, he draws the conclusion that logical representation entails something that manifests itself and, while doing so, remains ‘other’, distinct from the visibility of the representation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Dalla logica all'estetica'', pp. 97-147&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in presenting itself, the image manifests the other of the visible, of the representable: that other which reveals itself in the visible, by hiding from it. And this is precisely how the image becomes an icon of the invisible.

However, starting from Adorno’s reflection, the image tends to lose its figurative character but, at the same time, it continues to exist;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Alle origini dell'opera d'arte contemporanea'', pp. 203-222&lt;/ref&gt; the image is, indeed, both a thing and a non-thing: a paradoxical “real unreality”.  This ensues from the attempt to divide the double-edged nature of the image into its constituent elements: on the one hand, a readymade in which the representational dimension melts into a purely presentational dimension, and, on the other hand, a solely mental image endowed with a weak material support.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Astrazione e astrazioni'', pp. 11-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the images of the new media are images of images and, in this sense, they are not even proper images but simulations, “simulacra”. It is no coincidence that digital images, as reproductions, have a low value as images, because they tend to acquire the aspect of something, thus losing that connection between transparency and opacity which characterises authentic images. Hence, indeed, the question whether new media are able to create real images.
More particularly, it is in the kind of art that Adorno defines as “modern” that we find an overcoming of the epiphanic dimension that distinguishes the icon, where the visible is the place of manifestation of the invisible as Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "La questione dell'aura tra Benjamin e Adorno", Rivista di Estetica, 52 (1/20013), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; As we have become aware of the impossibility to exhaust the whole of reality and, at the same time, to manifest the Absolute, what emerges now is a conception of the image as something that can be interrogated as a testimony of what does not allow itself to be translated into an image: to testify is indeed to tell what cannot be told completely. In this sense, testimony coincides not with memory, as consistent with what happened, but with the immemorial, which refers to something we can neither remember nor forget completely, that is something that is neither totally speakable nor totally unspeakable.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Volti della memoria'', pp. 445-481&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, a witness only speaks starting from the impossibility to speak. That the image is equivalent to testimony means, then, that the attempt to say the unsayable is an infinite task, and this is why the question of the image forms an integral part of the ethical question. This entails that in the image there is no completeness and, consequently, neither redemption nor reconciliation with the real. From this point of view, to consider the image as testimony is tantamount to seeing it as the place of a perpetually unresolved tension between memory and oblivion, thus as the expression of the imperative of sense in a context, such as the contemporary one, in which both world and art seem to be increasingly abandoned to non-sense.

'''''In Search of The La's: A Secret Liverpool''''' is a biography about [[The La's]] written by M.W. Macefield, published in 2003 by Helter Skelter Publishing. The book gives a detailed history of the band with interviews from several ex-members and other persons related to the group. The author also discusses his own journey in tracking down each of the interviewees.

==Synopsis==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"With the timeless single "[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]", Lee Mavers' La's overtook [[The Stone Roses]] as great British guitar hopes and paved the way for the [[Britpop]] renaissance of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. However, since 1991, The La's have been silent, while rumors of studio-perfectionism, madness and drug addiction have abounded with Mavers lined up as another rock casualty. The author sets out to discover the truth behind Mavers' lost decade and eventually gains a revelatory audience with Mavers himself."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author, MW Macefield, travels to [[Liverpool]] to interview several ex-members of the band (including co-founder [[Mike Badger]], guitarist [[Paul Hemmings]] and bass player [[John Power (singer-songwriter)|John Power]]), and sundry other personnel, and eventually gets to chat with the group's chief songwriter [[Lee Mavers]]. In it several La's myths are dispelled along the way, new song titles are named, and the past and future of the band is discussed.

'''Jonty Hurwitz''' (born 2 September 1969 in Johannesburg) is an artist, [[engineer]] and entrepreneur.  Hurwitz creates scientifically inspired artworks and [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/048913-007/tracks#details-description Tracks: Jonty Hurwitz], on [[Arte|ARTE]] 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognised for the smallest human form ever created using [[nano technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/14/sculpture-human-sperm_n_6158258.html  |title=Artist Creates Sculptures So Tiny They Can't Be Seen By The Human Eye |publisher=Huffington Post, Leigh Weingus |date= 14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jonty Hurwitz was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Selwin, a hotelier and entrepreneur and Marcia Berger, a drama lecturer and teacher. Jonty spent his early life living in small hotels in rural towns in South Africa while his father built up his business.

Jonty studied [[Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]] from 1989 to 1993. His major was [[Signal Processing]]. He then joined the [[University of Cape Town]] Remote Sensing Group as a full-time researcher under Professor Michael Inggs, publishing a paper on radar pattern recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=365844 |title=Synthetic Range Profile Measurements of Aircraft, COMSIG-93, COMSIG ’93:204 – 209, September 1993. M R Inggs, J.B. Hurwitz, and A. Langman.  |publisher=COMSIG |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his research post, Hurwitz traveled for a long period of time in India studying Yoga and wood carving.

==Career in art==
In a 2015, documentary by CNN International on Hurwitz's artwork,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/03/13/spc-ones-to-watch-sculpture-c.cnn |title=Is this the World's Smallest Sculpture? |publisher=CNN |date= March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio 2]] art critic Estelle Lovatt commented on Hurwitz's work: "If [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] were alive today, he would have been doing what Jonty is doing.  He would have been using algorithms.  No one else works like him today.  His art is the mix between the emotional and the intelligent, and that's what gives it that spark."&lt;ref name="Self2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mathematics of Self|title=Art of Jonty Hurwitz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leATtAEACAAJ|date=8 January 2018|publisher=Blurb, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-389-03122-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz's work focuses on the aesthetics of art in the context of human perception. His early body of sculpture was discovered by Estelle Lovatt during 2011 in an article for ''Art of England Magazine'': "Thinning the divide gap between art and science, Hurwitz is cognisant of the two being holistically co-joined in the same way as we are naturally, comfortably split between our spiritual and operational self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/541afcd4e4b09246971aad4b/t/5421b307e4b0004bfbd4f10e/1411494663328/ARTofEnglandJonty.pdf |title=Art of England, Estelle Lovatt, Feb 2011 publication, p50. |publisher=Art of England |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=31285 Art of England Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz began producing sculptures in 2008. In 2009, his first sculpture '[[Yoda]] and the Anamorph' won the People’s Choice Bentliff Prize of the [[Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/winner-of-art-prize-announced-a105202/|title=Winner of Art Prize Announced. |publisher=Kent Online | date= 6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2009 he won the [[Bernard Noble|Noble]] Sculpture Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnsf.org.uk/winners/2009/ |title=Bernard Noble Sculpture Prize. |date= Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned to install his first large scale work (a nude study of his father called 'Dietro di me')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jontyhurwitz.com/noble-prize ''Dietro di me''] by Jonty Hurwitz&lt;/ref&gt; in the Italian village [[Colletta di Castelbianco]]. In 2010, he was selected as a finalist for the 4th International [[Arte Laguna Prize]] in Venice, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premioartelaguna.it/catalogo/4edizione/catalogo_premio_arte_laguna_2009.pdf |title=Arte Laguna Exhibition Catalogue, p106. |publisher=Arte Laguna Prize |date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was described by the art blogger [[Colossal (blog)|Christopher Jobson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/01/the-skewed-anamorphic-sculptures-and-engineered-illusions-of-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=The skewed anamorphic sculptures and engineered illusions of Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Christopher Jobson, Colossal |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a short documentary about Hurwitz's "Generation Pi" philosophy by ''Vera Productions'' it is estimated that the sculpture received 20 million views online in the space of a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTp5Q3-8Ng |title=The Paintbrush of Mathematics |publisher=Vera Productions |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013 Hurwitz was introduced to the [[Savoy Hotel]] by London art agent Sally Vaughan. Hurwitz was commissioned to be [[Artist in Residence]] at the hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/londons-savoy-hotel-continues-its-artist-in-residence-tradition |title=London's Savoy Hotel continues its artist in residence tradition |publisher=Artlyst |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produce a sculpture of the hotel’s historically iconic [[Mascot]] ''Kaspar the Cat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-homage-to-kaspar-the-friendly-cat-checks-in-at-the-savoys-new-eatery-8600305.html |title=A homage to Kaspar the friendly Cat checks in at the Savoy's new eatery |publisher=The Independent |date= April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz lived for several months in the hotel producing the sculpture.

In the same year, Hurwitz was also nominated for the [[Threadneedle Prize]] and exhibited a collection at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London. By late 2013, in a special edition of Art of England on portraiture, Hurwitz was cited as the #1 portrait artist in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?catid=1029&amp;category=Art+%26+Photography&amp;subcatid=183&amp;subcategory=Art&amp;title=Art+of+England&amp;titleid=1015&amp;issueid=60975 |title=Six of the Best, Sally Vaughan, Aug 2013. |publisher=Art of England |date= Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 Hurwitz was voted #46 in the top 100 artists of 2013 by the American art site, Empty Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emptykingdom.com/featured/empty-kingdom-top-100-artists-of-2013/ |title=Top 100 artists of 2013, Empty Kingdom. |publisher=Empty Kingdom |date= 31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Hurwitz's anamorphic work was blogged as "The best of 2013" by the American Art and Culture magazine, [[Juxtapoz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz |title=Best of 2013: Sculpture by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Juxtapoz |date= 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Hurwitz's work was also curated by ''Science Gallery International'' for a touring group show entitled ‘Illusion’ curated by [[Trinity College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ Science Gallery International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212190314/http://www.international.sciencegallery.com/illusion/ |date=12 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show presents a collection of installation artworks from around the world that affect human perception. The exhibition led to a 2014/2015 tour in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/30/fleet-science-center-illusion-exhibit/ |title=Real fun at Fleet’s ‘Illusion’ exhibit |publisher=U-T San Diego, Karla Peterson |date= 30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it attracted over 170,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |title=Science Gallery Dublin honoured with dedicated 68c stamp |publisher=Business &amp; Leadership Magazine |date=7 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110010448/http://www.businessandleadership.com/marketing/item/48935-science-gallery-dublin-hono |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show then moved on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2015 and Leipzig, Germany in 2016.

In late 2014, he released a series of “nano sculptures” under the title of ″Trust″. This series of works captured the attentions of both the scientific and art community, being cited by among others, [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/images-of-the-month-november-2014-1.16481 |title=Image of the Month: November 2014 |publisher=Nature Journal, Daniel Cressey |date= 5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2014/12/20/physics-week-in-review-december-20-2014/ |title=Physics Week in Review |publisher=Scientific American, Jennifer Ouellette  |date= 20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular Science]] and [[Phys.org]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-11-science-art-nanosculpture-marvels.html |title=When science and art produce nanosculpture marvels |publisher=Phys.org, Nancy Owano  |date= 18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Hurwitz was elected a member of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]]. In 2016 the [[Royal Photographic Society]] selected a [[Scanning Electron Microscope]] photograph by Hurwitz and Stefan Diller as one of the top 100 'Royal Society International Images for Science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3777603/From-droplets-spider-web-spiral-galaxy-Stunning-photos-reveal-natural-beauty-science.html#ixzz4JfHIgjum |title=From droplets on a spider web to a spiral galaxy: Stunning photos reveal the natural beauty in science |publisher=Daily Mail, Libby Plumner  |date= 7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anamorphic sculpture===
Hurwitz has produced a body of work using both [[oblique projection|oblique]] (perspective) and [[catoptric]] (mirror) [[anamorphosis]]. In an interview with Christopher Jobson, Hurwitz explains his anamorphic inspiration as follows: “I have always been torn between art and physics. In a moment of self-doubt in 2008, I wandered into the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] and stumbled across a strange anamorphic piece by [[William Scrots]], a portrait of Edward VI from 1546. Followed shortly down the aisle by The Ambassadors by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] from 1533. My life changed forever. I rushed home and within hours was devouring the works of [[M. C. Escher]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci|Da Vinci]] and many more. In a breath I had found “brothers” in a smallish group of artists spanning 500 years with exactly the same dilemma as me. Within two months I was deep in production of my first work. My art rests on the shoulders of giants, and I am grateful to them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twistedsifter.com/2013/04/anamorphic-sculptures-made-with-algorithms-jonty-hurwitz/  |title=Anamorphic Sculptures Made With Algorithms |publisher=Twisted Sifter |date= 17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anamorphosis]] as a form of art has a long history. A page in Leonardo Da Vinci’s note book (folio 35 verso a of the [[Codex Atlanticus]]) shows two strangely elongated sketches of a child's head and an eye. These distorted and hesitant drawings, the first known anamorphoses, from around 1485”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startstudioarts.si.edu/2009/08/anamorphoses-in-the-eye-of-leonardo.html |title=Anamorphoses in the eyes of Leonardo |publisher=The Smithsonian, Holly Sloofman |date= 26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th Century anamorphosis was also used by [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] artists to secretly depict images of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] in the wake of brutal English censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core77.com/blog/fine_art/how_to_hide_a_forbidden_image_in_plain_sight_anamorphic_cylinders_27356.asp |title=How to Hide a Forbidden Image in Plain Sight |publisher=Core77, Rain Noe |date= 22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz is a pioneer in creating [[catoptric]] sculpture.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Until the creation of his first work ''Rejuvenation'', anamorphic sculptures have not been known to have existed in art history. In his online talks, Hurwitz explains that this is a function of processing power and that whilst painting is possible in a mirror, three dimensional anamorphosis could only have come into being with the advent of powerful computers. Each of his sculptures involves billions of calculations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignant.de/2013/01/30/anamorphic-sculptures/ |title=Anamorphic Sculptures |publisher=Ignant |date= 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; using an [[algorithm]] derived from the mathematical constant [[π]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.designboom.com/art/anamorphic-sculptures-by-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Anamorphic sculptures by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Design Boom |date= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2013/02/kiss-of-chytrid-anamorphic-art-jonty-hurwitz/ |title=Kiss of Chytrid: Anamorphic art by Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Urban Ghost Media |date= 5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz asserts that his art is “contemporary to the millisecond”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsfwyoutube.com/videos/398405/Jonty-Hurwitz-talk-Contemporary-Art-is-measured-in-milliseconds |title=Contemporary Art is Measured in Milliseconds |publisher=NSFW Youtube, Vera Productions, Jonty Hurwitz |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinetic Art]] curator and director of the London ''Kinetica Museum'', Dianne Harris, described Hurwitz's art as follows "The works of polymath Jonty Hurwitz are contemporary [[trompe l'oeil]], at first glance appearing abstract, but in mirrored reflections, representational".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinetica-artfair.com/?exhibitors/2013/jonty-hurwitz |title=Kinetica Museum Artist Profile, 2013.  |publisher=Kinetica |date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nano sculpture===
In 2014, Hurwitz pioneered a new sculptural technique{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} in the field of [[Nanoart]] using [[multiphoton lithography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.chempics.org/post/105392403108/trust-artist-jonty-hurwitz-and-nanoscientist |title=Trust |publisher=Chemical and Engineering News |date= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[photogrammetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://all3dp.com/enter-photo-studios-21st-century/?hvid=3766p |title=Enter the Photo Studios of the 21st Century |publisher=All3DP |date= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create the world’s smallest human portraits of his first love. The works of art were inspired by the nineteenth century marble sculpture of Cupid and Psyche by [[Antonio Canova]], part of the permanent collection of the [[Louvre Museum]], Paris. Hurwitz’s works are so tiny that they are invisible to the human eye, able to be placed on the forehead of an ant. Smaller details of the works are at approximately the 300 [[nanometer]] scale, similar to the [[wavelengths]] of visible light and are therefore near impossible by the laws of physics to see in the visible spectrum.  The only way to observe these works is through a non-optical method of magnification like a [[scanning electron microscope]]. To create these works Hurwitz collaborated with a team of over 20 people, including Stephan Hengsbach of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and Yehiam Prior of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], an art project centred in the world of academic [[physics]]. In February 2015, Hurwitz's sculpture "Trust" was awarded the world record for the "Smallest sculpture of a human" by the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/superlatives/smallest |title=Sculpture of a human 80 x 100 x 30 micrometers |publisher=Guinness World Records |date= 13 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Beautiful/Decay Hurwitz explains the philosophy behind the works: “As technology starts to evolve faster than our human perception is able to handle, the line between science and myth becomes blurred. We live in an era where the impossible has finally come to pass. In our own little way we have become demigods of creation in our physical world…. The nano works that I present to you here represent more that just a feat of science though. They represent the moment in history that we ourselves are able to create a full human form at the same scale as the sperm that creates us in order to facilitate the creation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautifuldecay.com/2014/11/12/jonty-hurwitzs-sculptures-small-cant-seen-human-eye/ |title=Jonty Hurwitz’s sculptures are so small the can’t be seen with the human eye |publisher=Beautiful/Decay |date= 12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online interview with [[Slashdot]], Hurwitz himself asks the question “How can something you can't see be art?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech-beta.slashdot.org/story/14/12/15/1357213/interviews-ask-jonty-hurwitz-about-art-and-engineering |title=Ask Jonty Hurwitz about Art and Engineering |publisher=Slashdot |date= January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By basing his work on the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] he also suggests that our belief in modern science isn't that different from the faith the ancient greeks had in the [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/elegant-nanosculptures-fit-comfortably-inside-the-eye-of-a-needle |title=Elegant Nano Sculptures Fit Comfortably Inside the Eye of a Needle |publisher=The Creators Project, Beckett Mufson  |date= 13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final irony was that the sculptures were destroyed by a touch one week before the images were published on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2836676/Is-smallest-sculpture-Nano-artist-creates-images-nude-model-easily-fit-eye-needle.html |title=Artist spends ten months creating sculptures which are half the width of a human hair... only for his friend to accidentally crush them a few minutes later |publisher=Daily Mail, Stephanie Linning  |date= December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in technology==
In the mid-90s, Hurwitz arrived in London following his travels in India and got his first job researching financial [[data visualization]] for [[Gilbert de Botton]], Chairman and Founder of [[GAM (company)|Global Asset Management]] (GAM). During this period, he was exposed to de Botton’s [[open architecture]] model of asset management. It was Jonty’s close relationship with de Botton, also a major British art collector, that exposed him to the art world. The two maintained a close friendship until de Botton's death in 2000.

Hurwitz left Global Asset Management after two years forming his own company, ''Delve'', to develop the [[Research and Development|R&amp;D]] in [[data visualisation]] and reporting. Jonty’s main client became de Botton himself. In 1996, GAM launched its financial reporting technology built by Hurwitz, which attracted attention in the financial media, winning several awards.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Hurwitz’s newly formed graphics and software team evolved over several years publishing several visualization projects (non-exhaustive list):

*1997 News International visual archives on the [[Cold War]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], Published by News International
*1998 [[Biosys]] an environmental simulation published by ''Take 2 Interactive''. 
*1998 Hurwitz was selected by the British Foreign Office to build a 3D engine called “Oceans of Innovation” to represent the leading edge of British Innovation.  The work was nominated for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/189832.stm | title=Bafta plugs into interactive awards. | publisher=BBC |date= 9 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years from 2000 to 2005, Hurwitz signed up a large base of asset managers for his reporting and analysis technology. In 2005, Hurwitz’s company ''Delve'' was acquired by [[Alternative Investment Market]] listed company Statpro Group PLC (SOG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/rns/050704sog4008o |title=Acquisition of Delve, a leading supplier of enterprise and web reporting. |publisher=Proactive Investors |date= 4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurwitz joined Statpro as [[Creative Director]] where he designed the first [[cloud-based|Cloud Computing]] analytics and [[risk]] platform for asset data. In 2008, Statpro launched its flagship product ''Statpro Revolution'' which was the result of this R&amp;D. By 2014, eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world were Statpro Clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statpro.com/news/eight-top-ten-largest-asset-managers-world-statpro-clients/ |title=Eight out of the top ten largest asset managers in the world Statpro Clients. |publisher=Statpro |date= 20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurwitz was co-founding Chief Technology Officer of [[Wonga.com]] in 2007 where he designed and built the first real-time online consumer loan system in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} During this period, Wonga’s technology won several awards (listed below). By 2011, Wonga had begun to attract criticism and Hurwitz, as the inventor of the technology, found himself with not enough influence to guide the now large company's use of his designs. After several attempts at changing Wonga's strategy, he resigned from his operational role in November 2011, quietly releasing his sculpture entitled ''Co-Founder''.

Hurwitz's technology is credited with several innovations in the financial services industry:
*Financial sliders. A [[User Interface]] innovation which allowed customers to easily to get a real-time quote on the exact cost of a loan in pound and pennies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/16/wonga-algorithm-lending-debt-data |title=Your prosperity could depend on an Algorithm |publisher=Will Sawney,Guardian |date= 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of communicating loan information to consumers has been adopted by several of the major high street UK lenders. These include (non-exhaustive list): [[HSBC]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Barclays]], [[Halifax (bank)|Halifax]], [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyds]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company|Nationwide]], [[Santander Bank]], [[The Co-operative Bank|Co-operative Bank]], [[Natwest]] and [[Bank of Scotland]].
*Real-time risk technology. Wonga’s risk engine was the first ever to evaluate the credit worthiness of a customer in near real time on the internet based on the collection of data from alternative sources in combination with traditional credit scores.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The consumer risk technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/03/15/the-algorithm-that-beats-your-bank-manager/ |title=The algorithm that beats your bank manager |publisher=Parmy Olson, Forbes |date= 15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the ability to transfer money to customers within 12 minutes on the basis of the decision.

Hurwitz continues to commit much of his time to [[Financial technology|fintech]] startups while at the same time building up his body of artwork. In late 2011 Hurwitz backed Damian Kimmelman, to build a next-generation data provider [[Duedil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/news-and-market-deals/fundraising-deals/1679298/duedil-secures-funding-from-wongas-jonty-hurwitz.thtml |title=Duedil secures funding from Jonty Hurwitz |publisher=Growth Business, Thomas Hobbs |date= 14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duedil has since been dubbed "The Bloomberg of private companies" and has emerged as one of the key data providers in Europe and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cd830afa-8364-11e3-86c9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3QWzwSOhb |title=UK startup dubbed 'Bloomberg of private companies' raises $17m  |publisher=Financial Times, Jonathan Moules |date= 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Hurwitz [[seed money|seed funded]] the financial technology startup ''behalf.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/challenged-by-upstarts-lenders-try-new-strategy-cooperation/?_r=1&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Investment%20Banking&amp;module=BlogPost-Title&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&amp;version=Blog%20Main |title= Challenged by Upstarts, Lenders try a New Strategy: Cooperation  |publisher=New York Times, Randall Smith |date= 7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Hurwitz backed the UK startup bank for young people: ''Meet Osper''.

[[File:Keep-calm-and-carry-on-scan.jpg|thumb|The original 1939 ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' poster]]

'''''Keep Calm and Carry On''''' is a [[motivational poster]] produced by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] in 1939 in preparation for [[World War II]]. The poster was intended to raise the [[morale]] of the British public, threatened with widely predicted mass air attacks on major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Slocombe |title=British Posters of the Second World War |location=London |publisher=Imperial War Museum |year=2010 |isbn=9781904897927 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2poster.co.uk/2009/04/1939-3-posters/ |title=1939: The Three Posters (PhD Extract) |first=Rebecca, PhD |last=Lewis |work=Keep Calm and Carry on and other Second World War Posters: British Home Front Propaganda Posters of the Second World War |date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 2.45&amp;nbsp;million copies were printed, and although [[the Blitz]] did in fact take place, the poster was hardly ever publicly displayed and was little known until a copy was rediscovered in 2000 at [[Barter Books]], a bookshop in [[Alnwick]]. It has since been re-issued by a number of private companies, and has been used as the decorative theme for a range of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7869458.stm|title=The Greatest Motivational Poster Ever?|work=''BBC News''|date= 4 February 2009|first=Stuart|last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evocative of the Victorian belief in British stoicism – the "[[stiff upper lip]]", self-discipline, fortitude, and remaining calm in adversity – the poster has become recognised around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keep calm and carry on … bidding for rare poster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/25/wartime-poster-secret-auction|work=The Guardian|date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that only two original copies survived until a collection of approximately 15 was brought in to the ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' in 2012 by the daughter of an ex-[[Royal Observer Corps]] member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2105518/Keep-calm-carry-Only-surviving-stash-original-iconic-poster-appears-Antiques-Roadshow.html|accessdate=13 May 2012|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Chris|last=Slack|title=Keep Calm and Carry On... to the bank: Original wartime poster shows up on Antiques Roadshow|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few further examples have come to light since.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' poster was designed by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] during the period of 27 June to 6 July 1939.&lt;ref name="irving"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://history.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/27/keep-calm-and-carry-on-the-compromise-behind-the-slogan/ |title=Keep Calm and Carry On – The Compromise Behind the Slogan |first=Henry |last=Irving |publisher= History of Government Blog |date= 27 June 2014 |accessdate= 27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced as part of a series of three "Home Publicity" posters (the others read "&lt;u&gt;Your&lt;/u&gt; ''Courage,'' &lt;u&gt;Your&lt;/u&gt; ''Cheerfulness,'' &lt;u&gt;Your&lt;/u&gt; ''Resolution Will Bring Us Victory''" and "''Freedom Is in Peril / Defend It With All Your Might''"). Each poster showed the slogan under a representation of a "[[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor Crown]]" (a symbol of the state). They were intended to be distributed to strengthen morale in the event of a wartime disaster, such as mass bombing of major cities using high explosives and poison gas, which was widely expected within hours of an outbreak of war.&lt;ref name="PhD"/&gt;

A career civil servant named A. P. Waterfield came up with "Your Courage" as "a rallying war-cry that will bring out the best in everyone of us and put us in an offensive mood at once".&lt;ref name="PhD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 45–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Others involved in the planning of the early posters included: [[John Hilton (industrial relations)|John Hilton]], [[Montague Burton Professor of Industrial Relations|Professor of Industrial Relations]] at [[Cambridge University]], responsible overall as Director of Home Publicity; William Surrey Dane, managing director at [[Odhams Press]]; [[Gervas Huxley]], former head of publicity for the [[Empire Marketing Board]]; William Codling, controller of [[HMSO]]; [[Harold Nicolson]], MP; W. G. V. Vaughan, who became Director of the General Production Division (GPD); H. V. Rhodes, who later wrote an occasional paper on setting up a new government department; [[Ivison Macadam]]; "Mr Cruthley"; and "Mr Francis". [[Ernest Wallcousins]] was the artist tasked with creating the poster designs.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 42, 44, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Detailed planning for the posters had started in April 1939 and the eventual designs were prepared after meetings between officials from the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and [[HM Treasury]] on 26 June 1939 and between officials from the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and [[HMSO]] on 27 June 1939.&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt; Roughs of the poster were completed on 6 July 1939, and the final designs were agreed by the Home Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood]] on 4 August 1939. Printing began on 23 August 1939, the day that Nazi Germany and the USSR signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], and the posters were ready to be placed up within 24 hours of the outbreak of war.&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt;

The posters were produced in 11 different sizes, ranging from {{convert|15|xx|10|in|cm}} up to large 48-sheet versions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The background colour was either red or blue.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The lettering was probably hand-drawn by Wallcousins:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kominek|first1=Lex|title=Keep Calm and Carry On – WWII Posters |url=http://www.typophile.com/node/39466#comment-242245|publisher=Typophile|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 44, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; it is similar, but not identical, to [[humanist sans-serif typeface]]s such as [[Gill Sans]] and [[Johnston (typeface)|Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep Calm and Carry On: Fonts|url=http://www.k-type.com/keep-calm-carry-on/|publisher=K-Type|accessdate=28 September 2014}} For distinctive features, see for example the terminals of the "C".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Almost 2,500,000 copies of ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' were printed between 23 August and 3 September 1939 but the poster was not sanctioned for immediate public display.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; It was instead decided that copies should remain in "cold storage" for use after serious air raids (with resources transferred to ''Your Courage'' and ''Freedom is in Peril''). Copies of ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' were retained until April 1940, but stocks were then pulped as part of the wider [[Paper Salvage 1939–50|Paper Salvage]] campaign.&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt; A very few copies do appear to have been displayed, but such instances were rare and unauthorised: an October 1940 edition of the ''[[The Yorkshire Post|Yorkshire Post]]'' reports the poster hung in a shop in [[Leeds]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 October 1940 |title=Ban on Silk Stockings: Should They Have Been Rationed? |newspaper=[[The Yorkshire Post|Yorkshire Post and Leeds Mercury]] |page=4 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results?basicsearch=%22few%20had%20eyes%20for%20the%20poster%22 |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a photograph discovered in 2016 shows it on the wall of a government laboratory in [[Bedfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Patrick |last1=Sawer |first2=Paul |last2=Hooley |title=Wartime rebels who broke the ban by displaying keep calm and carry on poster |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=30 October 2016 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/29/wartime-rebels-who-broke-the-ban-by-displaying-keep-calm-and-car/ |accessdate=5 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] publicity campaign was cancelled in October 1939 following criticism of its cost and impact. Many people claimed not to have seen the posters; while those who did see them regarded them as patronising and divisive.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 52–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Nigel Rees |last=Rees |first=Nigel |date=20 July 2011|title=Cheer up, the worst is yet to come|work=[[Today programme]]|publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9543000/9543352.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design historian Susannah Walker regards the campaign as "a resounding failure" and reflective of a misjudgement by upper-class civil servants of the mood of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2012, pp.6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
In late May and early June 1941, 14,000,000 copies of a leaflet entitled "Beating the Invader" were distributed with a message from Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. The leaflet begins "If invasion comes..." and exhorts the populace to "Stand Firm" and "Carry On". The two phrases do not appear in one sentence, as they applied to different segments of the population depending on their circumstances, with those civilians finding themselves in areas of fighting ordered to stand firm (i.e., stay put) and those not in areas of fighting ordered to carry on (i.e., continue vital war work). Each mandate is identified as a "great order and duty" should invasion come. The leaflet then lists 14 questions and answers on practical measures to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If Invasion Comes. Mr. Churchill's Orders. "Stand Firm and Carry On."|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47326422|work=The West Australian|date=26 May 1941|location=Perth, WA, Australia|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery and commercialisation===
[[File:Keep Calm And Carry On - Original poster - Barter Books - 17-Oct-2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The poster discovered at Barter Books]]
[[File:Keep Calm merchandise.jpg|thumb|right|2013 shop display of "Keep Calm" merchandise, including the original slogan and variants such as "Keep Calm and Drink Tea".]]
In 2000, Stuart Manley, co-owner with his wife Mary of [[Barter Books]] Ltd. in [[Alnwick]], Northumberland, was sorting through a box of used books bought at auction when he uncovered one of the original "Keep Calm and Carry On" posters. The couple framed it and hung it up by the cash register; it attracted so much interest that Manley began to produce and sell copies.&lt;ref name="Rediscovery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepcalmhome.com/about.htm |title=About Keep Calm and Carry On}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/first-person-i-am-the-keep-calm-and-carry-on-man-1672398.html |first=Stuart |last=Manley |title=First person: 'I am the Keep Calm and Carry On man' |newspaper=The Independent |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2005, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist Susie Steiner featured the replica posters as a Christmas gift suggestion, raising their profile still further.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies followed the Manleys' example, and the design rapidly began to be used as the theme for a wide range of products.&lt;ref name=feud&gt;{{cite news |title=Keep Calm and carry on ... into a feud |url= http://www.smh.com.au/world/keep-calm-and-carry-on--into-a-feud-20130503-2ix55.html |accessdate= 4 May 2013 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Manley later commented, "I didn't want it trivialised; but of course now it's been trivialised beyond belief."&lt;ref name=feud/&gt;

In early 2012, Barter Books debuted an informational short film, ''The Story of Keep Calm and Carry On'', providing visual insight into the modernisation and commercialisation of the design and the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=FrHkKXFRbCI|title=The Story of Keep Calm and Carry On}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poster has become an evocation of British stoicism: the "[[stiff upper lip]]", self-discipline, fortitude and remaining calm in adversity. Susannah Walker comments that it is now seen "not only as a distillation of a crucial moment in Britishness, but also as an inspiring message from the past to the present in a time of crisis".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; She goes on to point out, however, that such an interpretation overlooks the circumstances of its production, and the relative failure of the campaign of which it formed a part.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker 2012, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trademark claims ===
{{update|section|date=March 2015}}
In August 2011, it was reported that a UK-based company called Keep Calm and Carry On Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepcalmandcarryon.com |title=Keep Calm and Carry On Ltd |publisher=Keepcalmandcarryon.com |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (managed by entrepreneur Mark Coop) had registered the slogan as a [[community trade mark]] in the EU, CTM No: 009455619, and in the United States, No. 4066622,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2011/10/keep-calm-and-carry-on-trademark-fight|title=The Vicious Trademark Battle Over 'Keep Calm and Carry On'|date=5 October 2011|publisher=[[The Awl]] |first=Maria |last=Bustillos |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301012125/http://www.theawl.com/2011/10/keep-calm-and-carry-on-trademark-fight |archivedate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Jeremy |title=Monday miscellany |date=22 August 2011|url = http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2011/08/monday-miscellany_22.html|publisher=IPKitten blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; after failing to obtain its registration as a trademark in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Rayner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8785585/Battle-rages-over-Keep-Calm-and-Carry-On-souvenirs.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Gordon |last=Rayner |title=Battle rages over 'Keep Calm and Carry On' souvenirs | date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lew74"&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The company issued a take-down request against a seller of ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15014748|title=Battle over trademark of 'keep calm' phrase|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keep calm and carry on items removed from my ebay account |publisher=justanswer.com |date=August 2011 |url=http://www.justanswer.com/uk-law/5e2l0-keep-calm-carry-items-removed.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's right to claim the trademark was questioned by, among others, the Manleys of Barter Books, as the slogan had been widely used before registration and was not recognisable as indicating trade origin.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lew74"/&gt; An application was submitted by British intellectual property advisor and UK trademarking service Trade Mark Direct to cancel the registration on the grounds that the words were too widely used for one person to own the exclusive rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/3912.shtml|title=IP group aims to reclaim 'Keep Calm &amp; Carry On'|publisher=freelanceuk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the request for cancellation was rejected and the trade mark is still protected in all EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The company subsequently tried to register the slogan as its trademark in both the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=85297485 |title=Serial Number: 85297485 Keep Calm and Carry On USA Trademark|work=Official Gazette|date=20 September 2011|publisher=[[USPTO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref name="Rayner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do;jsessionid=0001K46wR_Bu__TfKBulXGEhGen:-14J2QPI?lang=eng&amp;status=&amp;fileNumber=1524133&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1 |title= Canadian Trade-mark Data |publisher= IC.GC.CA |date= 13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imitations==
As the popularity of the poster in various media has grown, innumerable parodies, imitations and co-optations have also appeared, making it a notable [[Internet meme|meme]]. Messages range from the cute to the overtly political, typically with references to other aspects of popular culture raging from [[Land Rover]] and [[Disney]] to [[Star Wars]] and [[Thomas the Tank Engine]]. Examples have included "Now Panic and Freak Out" (with an upside-down crown), "Get Excited and Make Things" (with a crown incorporating [[wrench|spanners]]), "Keep Calm and Have a Cupcake" (with a [[cupcake]] icon), "Don't Panic and Fake a British Accent", "Keep Spending and Carry On Shopping",&lt;ref name="NYT mag story"&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Walker (journalist) |title=Remixed Messages |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/magazine/05FOB-consumed-t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=magazine  |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate= 21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Keep Calm and Don't Sneeze" during the [[2009 flu pandemic in the United Kingdom|2009 swine flu pandemic]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; "Keep Calm and Call Batman" (with the Batman logo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://batman-news.com/2013/07/09/new-batman-easter-egg-from-man-of-steel-revealed|title=New Batman Easter egg from 'Man of Steel' revealed|author=Chris Begley |date=9 July 2013 |website=batman-news.com |access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Keep Calm and Switch to Linux" (with [[Tux (mascot)|Tux]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep calm and switch to Linux |url=http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/265/2/a/keep_calm_and_switch_to_linux_by_devianteles-d4am5ur.png}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March–April 2012, the British pop-rock band [[McFly]] undertook a theatre tour entitled "[[The Keep Calm &amp; Play Louder Tour|The Keep Calm and Play Louder Tour]]", promoted with a poster closely based on that of 1939. In late 2012 and early 2013, the "Save Lewisham Hospital" campaign (a protest against proposed cuts in services at [[University Hospital Lewisham]]) made widespread use of a poster with the slogan "Don't Keep Calm Get Angry and Save Lewisham A&amp;E".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Little |first=Mandy |title=Protestors show unity |newspaper=South London Press |location=London |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2013 |url=http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/News.cfm?id=44283&amp;headline=Protestors%20show%20unity |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023806/http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/News.cfm?id=44283&amp;headline=Protestors%20show%20unity |archive-date=28 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2013 |publisher=Save Lewisham Hospital campaign |url=http://www.savelewishamhospital.com/ |title=Save Lewisham Hospital! |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of [[Naheed Nenshi]], mayor of [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada, to encourage and motivate his citizens in the wake of the [[2013 Alberta floods]] made him the subject of parody "Keep Calm and Nenshi On" fundraising T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dean Bennett |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mayor-nenshi-has-captured-calgarys-heart-but-the-worst-at-least-politically-is-yet-to-come/article12884159/ |title=Mayor Nenshi has captured Calgary's heart, but the worst, at least politically, is yet to come |work=The Globe and Mail |date=28 June 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2014 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kill Bill:&lt;!--Th official website shows a colon in the title.  See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-2/ --&gt; Volume 2''''' is a 2004 American [[martial arts film]] written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. It stars [[Uma Thurman]] as the [[The Bride (Kill Bill)|Bride]], who continues her campaign of revenge against the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad ([[Lucy Liu]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Daryl Hannah]], and [[Vivica A. Fox]]) and their leader Bill ([[David Carradine]]), who tried to kill her and her unborn child.

Tarantino conceived ''Kill Bill'' as a homage to "[[grindhouse]]" cinema including [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] films, [[samurai cinema]], [[blaxploitation]] films, and [[Spaghetti Western|spaghetti westerns]]. It is the second of two ''Kill Bill'' films produced simultaneously; the first, ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'', was released in 2003. The films were originally set for a single release, but the film, with a runtime of over four hours, was divided in two. Like ''Volume 1, Volume 2'' received positive reviews and was a commercial success.

==Plot==
The pregnant Bride and her groom rehearse their wedding. Bill, the Bride's former lover, the father of her child, and the leader of the [[Deadly Viper Assassination Squad]], arrives unexpectedly and orders the Deadly Vipers to kill everyone at the wedding. The Bride survives and swears revenge.

Four years later, the Bride has already assassinated Deadly Vipers [[List of Kill Bill characters#O-Ren Ishii|O-Ren Ishii]] and [[List of Kill Bill characters#Vernita Green|Vernita Green]]. She goes to the trailer of Bill's brother and Deadly Viper [[List of Kill Bill characters#Budd|Budd]], planning to ambush him. Budd has been warned by Bill of her approach; he shoots her in the chest with a shotgun blast of rock salt, then sedates her. He calls [[List of Kill Bill characters#Elle Driver|Elle Driver]], another former Deadly Viper, and arranges to sell her the Bride's unique sword for a million dollars. He seals the Bride inside a coffin and [[Premature burial|buries her alive]].

Years earlier, Bill tells the young Bride of the legendary [[martial arts]] master [[Pai Mei]] and his Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, a [[Touch of Death|death blow]] that Mei refuses to teach his students; the technique that supposedly kills any opponent after they have taken five steps. Bill takes the Bride to Mei's temple for training. Mei ridicules her and makes her training a torment, but she gains his respect. In the present, the Bride uses Mei's martial arts techniques to break out of the coffin and claw her way to the surface.

Elle arrives at Budd's trailer and kills him with a [[black mamba]] hidden with the money for the sword. She calls Bill and tells him the Bride has killed Budd and that Elle has killed the Bride. She uses the Bride's real name: Beatrix Kiddo. As Elle exits the trailer, Beatrix ambushes her and they fight. Elle, who was also taught by Mei, taunts Beatrix by revealing that she poisoned Mei in retribution for his plucking out her eye. Beatrix plucks out Elle's remaining eye and leaves her screaming in the trailer with the black mamba.

In Mexico, Beatrix meets a retired pimp, Esteban Vihaio, who helps her find Bill. She tracks him to a hotel, and discovers that their daughter B.B. is still alive, now aged four. She spends the evening with them. After she puts B.B. to bed, Bill shoots Beatrix with a dart containing [[truth serum]] and interrogates her. She recounts a mission in which she discovered she was pregnant and explains that she left the Deadly Vipers to give B.B. a better life. Bill explains that he assumed she had died and mourned her for three months; he ordered her assassination when he discovered she was alive and engaged to a "jerk" he assumed was the father of her child. Beatrix disables Bill and strikes with Mei's [[Touch of Death|Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique]], which she kept secret. Bill makes his peace with her, takes five steps and dies. Beatrix leaves with B.B. to start a new life.

==Music==
{{main|Kill Bill Vol. 2 Original Soundtrack}}
As with Tarantino's previous films, ''Kill Bill'' features an eclectic soundtrack comprising many [[musical genre]]s. On the two soundtracks, music ranges from [[country music]] to selections from the [[Spaghetti Western]] film scores of [[Ennio Morricone]]. [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s theme from the film ''[[Twisted Nerve]]'' is whistled by the menacing Elle Driver in the hospital scene. A brief, 15-second excerpt from the opening of the ''[[Ironside (1967 TV series)|Ironside]]'' theme music by [[Quincy Jones]] is used as the Bride's revenge motif, which flares up with a red-tinged flashback whenever she's in the company of her next target.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3356&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental tracks from Japanese guitarist [[Tomoyasu Hotei]] figure prominently, and after the success of ''Kill Bill'' they were frequently used in American TV commercials and at sporting events. The end credits are driven by the rock and roll version of "[[Malagueña Salerosa]]", a traditional Mexican song, performed by "[[Chingon (band)|Chingon]]", [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s band.

==Release==

===Theatrical release===
[[File:State Theater Ann Arbor, MI.jpg|thumb|The [[State Theatre (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|State Theater Ann Arbor, MI]] shows a double feature of ''Kill Bill'' Vols. 1 and 2]]
''Kill Bill: Volume 2'' was released in theaters on {{nowrap|April 16}}, 2004. It was originally scheduled to be released on {{nowrap|February 20}}, 2004, but was rescheduled. ''Variety'' posited that the delay was to coincide its theatrical release with ''Volume 1''{{'}}s release on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Diorio | first1=Carl | last2=Hettrick | first2=Scott | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117898063 | title=Inside Move: 'Bill 2' delayed until April | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=January 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, ''Volume 2'' was released in {{nowrap|2,971 theaters}} and grossed {{nowrap|$25.1 million}} on its opening weekend,&lt;ref name="bomvol2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=killbill2.htm | title=Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking first at the box office and beating fellow opener ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]''. ''Volume 2''{{'}}s opening weekend gross was higher than ''Volume 1''{{'}}s, and the equivalent success confirmed the studio's financial decision to split the film into two theatrical releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/apr/19/news.quentintarantino | title=Bill makes a killing at US box office | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=April 19, 2004 | quote=Kill Bill: Volume 2's total ... confirmed the financial good sense of Miramax's decision to split the movie in two.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volume 2'' attracted more female theatergoers than ''Volume 1'', with 60% of the audience being male and 56% of the audience being men between the ages of 18 to 29 years old. ''Volume 2''{{'}}s opening weekend was the largest to date for [[Miramax Films]] aside from releases under its arm [[Dimension Films]]. The opening weekend was also the largest to date in the month of April for a film restricted in the United States to theatergoers 17 years old and up, besting ''[[Life (1999 film)|Life]]''{{'}}s 1999 record. ''Volume 2''{{'}}s opening weekend was strengthened by the reception of ''Volume 1'' in the previous year among audiences and critics, abundant publicity related to the splitting into two volumes, and the DVD release of ''Volume 1'' in the week before ''Volume 2''{{'}}s theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117903431 | title='Bill's' better half | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April 18, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the United States and Canada, ''Volume 2'' was released in 20 territories over the weekend of {{nowrap|April 23}}, 2004. It grossed an estimated {{nowrap|$17.7 million}} and ranked first at the international box office, ending an eight-week streak held by ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3669157.stm | title=Kill Bill tops global box office | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=April 29, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volume 2'' grossed a total of {{nowrap|$66.2 million}} in the United States and Canada and {{nowrap|$86 million}} in other territories for a worldwide total of {{nowrap|$152.2 million}}.&lt;ref name="bomvol2" /&gt;

===Home release===

In the United States, ''Volume 2'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] on August 10, 2004.

In a December 2005 interview, Tarantino addressed the lack of a special edition DVD for ''Kill Bill'' by stating "I've been holding off because I've been working on it for so long that I just wanted a year off from ''Kill Bill'' and then I'll do the big supplementary DVD package."&lt;ref name="DVD1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/tarantino%20brings%20kill%20bills%20together |title=Tarantino Brings Kill Bills Together |accessdate=2007-06-11 |last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |date=December 21, 2005 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=ContactMusic.com |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States does not have a DVD boxed set of ''Kill Bill'', though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom. Upon the DVD release of ''Volume 2'' in the US, however, Best Buy did offer an exclusive box set slipcase to house the two individual releases together.&lt;ref name="DVD3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/features/best_dvd_packag.html |title=Best DVD Packaging of 2004 |accessdate=2007-06-11 |last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=DVD Talk |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''Volume 1'' and ''Volume 2'', were released in [[High-definition video|High Definition]] on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on September 9, 2008 in the United States.

===''The Whole Bloody Affair''===
At the 2008 [[Provincetown International Film Festival]], Tarantino announced that the original cut of ''Kill Bill'', incorporating both films and an extended animation sequence, would be released in May 2009 as ''Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocateinsider.com/provincetown_film_festival_2008/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904171338/http://www.advocateinsider.com/provincetown_film_festival_2008/index.html|date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenings began on March 27, 2011 at the [[New Beverly Cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-02-25/kill-bill/the-whole-bloody-affair-premieres-march-27 | title=Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair Premieres March 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Kill Bill: Volume 2'' received a score of 84% based on reviews from 238 critics, and an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus states, "''Kill Bill: Volume 2'' adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kill_bill_vol_2/ | title=Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)| publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 83 out of 100 based on 41 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kill-bill-vol-2 | title=Kill Bill: Vol. 2 Reviews| publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] celebrated the films, saying "Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. ... This is all one film, and now that we see it whole, it's greater than its two parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kill Bill, Volume 2 | author=Roger Ebert | work=rogerebert.com | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040416/REVIEWS/404160301/1023 | date=2004-04-16 | accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he placed the film on his twenty best films of the decade list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best films of the decade |author=Roger Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |work=Roger Ebert's Journal |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/12/the_best_films_of_the_decade.html |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2010-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r92dOFlB?url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/12/the_best_films_of_the_decade.html |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sequels==
In April 2004, Tarantino told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that he was planning a sequel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schilling|first1=Mary Kaye|title=From ''Kill Bill'' to kids: A Q&amp;A with Quentin|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2004/04/09/kill-bill-kids-qa-quentin|website=www.ew.com|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Oh yeah, initially I was thinking this would be my "[[Dollars Trilogy]]". I was going to do a new one every ten years. But I need at least fifteen years before I do this again. I've already got the whole mythology: Sofie Fatale will get all of Bill's money. She'll raise Nikki, who'll take on The Bride. Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as The Bride deserved hers. I might even shoot a couple of scenes for it now so I can get the actresses while they're this age.}}

At the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], Tarantino stated that, after the completion of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', he wanted to make two [[anime]] ''Kill Bill'' films: an [[origin story]] about Bill and his mentors, and another origin starring the Bride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15618 Rodriguez and Tarantino Present Grindhouse!], Blake Wright on ComingSoon.net, July 22, 2006.

Retrieved October 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Details emerged around 2007 about two possible sequels, ''Kill Bill: Volumes 3 and 4''. According to the article, "the third film involves the revenge of two killers whose arms and eye were hacked by Uma Thurman in the first stories." The article adds that the "fourth installment of the popular kung fu action films concerns a cycle of reprisals and daughters who avenge their mother's deaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9221 |title=Kill Bill Volumes 3 and 4 Details Emerge! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015034926/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/9221/ |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 Morelia International Film Festival, Tarantino stated that he intended to make a third ''Kill Bill'' film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badtaste.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9753&amp;Itemid=29 Quentin Tarantino Talks Kill Bill 3: The Bride Will Fight Again!], BadTaste.it, October 1, 2009.

In December 2012, Tarantino stated: "I don't know if there's ever going to be a ''Kill Bill Vol. 3''. We'll see, probably not though."&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2012/12/12/no-kill-bill-3-for-tarantino&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, it was reported that Tarantino has spoken with Thurman on a potential return for a sequel, but noted that Tarantino remains non-committal on actually making a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shepherd|first1=Jack|title=Quentin Tarantino talks Kill Bill 3: 'I wouldn't be surprised if Uma Thurman's The Bride made one more appearance'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/quentin-tarantino-on-kill-bill-3-i-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-uma-thurmans-the-bride-made-one-more-a6794661.html|accessdate=28 July 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5487">The '''League of Canadian Poets''' ('''LCP'''), founded in 1966, is a national non-profit arts service organization based in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The organization acts as the national association of professional and aspiring poets in Canada.&lt;ref name=New&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Mkh2vJ_9GpEC&amp;pg=PA642#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada |page=642|first=William H. |last=  New |publisher=University of Toronto Press|year= 2002 | accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League counts [[Phyllis Webb]], [[Robert Kroetsch]], [[Susan McCaslin]], [[Barry Dempster]], [[Gay Allison]], [[Micheline Maylor]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] among its membership;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ps26JhFFS8wC&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Literary Research and Canadian Literature: Strategies and Sources |page=162 |first=Gabriella Natasha |last= Reznowski |publisher=Scarecrow Press|date= 1 Jan 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://poets.ca/members_data/glossary/M |title=www.poets.ca |work=poets.ca |year=2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it provides funding for poetry readings and competitions, hosts an annual AGM, runs a series of awards, and publishes an electronic newsletter.&lt;ref name=New/&gt;

== Membership ==
Members of the League are professional poets who are actively contributing to the development, growth, and public profile of poetry in Canada. They offer two primary levels of membership, as well as student and supporting memberships, open to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.&lt;ref name="poets.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poets.ca/join/|title=Join the League! – League of Canadian Poets|website=poets.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full members are poets with an established poetic career, whether with a published book of poetry or a background in performance and spoken word poetry.&lt;ref name="poets.ca"/&gt;

Associate members are poets working towards establishing their careers. Poet Bruce Meyer helped to establish the associate level of membership in the 1970s to enable young poets to join the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poets.ca/2016/04/08/meet-the-shortlist-adebe-derango-adem-bruce-meyer/|title=MEET THE SHORTLIST: ADEBE DeRANGO-ADEM &amp; BRUCE MEYER – League of Canadian Poets|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The League organizes the annual [[Pat Lowther Memorial Award]], the [[Gerald Lampert Award]], and the [[Raymond Souster Award]]. The recipient of each award receives an cash honorarium, and there is an administration fee of $25 for each submission.&lt;ref name="Gerald Lampert — Poets.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poets.ca/wordpress/contests-awards/gerald-lampert |title=Gerald Lampert — Poets.ca |work=poets.ca |year=2012 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314221718/http://poets.ca/wordpress/contests-awards/gerald-lampert |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pat Lowther Memorial Award is named after [[Pat Lowther]], and is for a book of poetry by a Canadian woman published in the preceding year. It was given to [[Anne Simpson]] in 2008.&lt;ref name = award&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/books/story/2008/06/23/poetry-awards.html |title=Press Release: N.S., Toronto poets win League of Canadian Poets honours - Arts &amp; Entertainment - CBC News  |work=cbc.ca |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Los Angeles Poverty Department''' (LAPD) is a [[Los Angeles]]-based performance group closely tied to the city's [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]] neighborhood. Founded in 1985 by director and activist John Malpede, LAPD members are mostly homeless or formerly homeless people who collaborate with advocates, social service professionals and community members to create performances and multimedia art that highlight connections between their lived experiences and external forces that impact their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you want the cosmetic version or do you want the real deal?

==History==

Performance artist John Malpede moved to Los Angeles from New York in 1984 to start work as an outreach paralegal at the [http://www.innercitylaw.org/ Inner City Law Center] (ICLC). He began leading theater workshops for the neighborhood's homeless population out of the ICLC's offices on Skid Row, gathering a group of performers and artists who now create their art as the Los Angeles Poverty Department (the acronym, LAPD, is a deliberate appropriation of that of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Colby|title=Los Angeles Poverty Department|journal=Artforum International|date=April 2014|volume=52|issue=8|page=263|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1514895730?accountid=14512|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was founded, the LAPD was the first theater by and for homeless people in the country and the first arts-based initiative for the Los Angeles homeless population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Maria Rosario|last2=Malpede|first2=John|title=Making the Case for Skid Row Culture: Findings from a Collaborative Inquiry by the Los Angeles Poverty Department and the Urban Institute|journal=Arts &amp; Civic Engagement Impact Initiative of Animating Democracy (Americans for the Arts)|date=2009|url=http://www.lapovertydept.org/home/newsletters/making-the-case-for-skid-row-culture/download.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the LAPD has been dedicated to giving expression to the homeless community's struggle to  create meaning out of their own lives and to avoid a sentimentalized or stereotyped narrative of victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graver|first1=David|last2=Kruger|first2=Lauren|title=Dispossessing the Spectator: Performance, Environment, and Subjectivity in Theatre of the Homeless|journal=Tdr (1988-)|date=Summer 1991|volume=35|issue=2|id=page 172|pages=157–175|jstor=1146094}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Material is often developed and rehearsed through community workshops and feedback sessions, continually evolving through conversation with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

In 2014, the [[Queens Museum]] mounted the first museum survey of the Los Angeles Poverty Department's activity, showcasing nearly thirty years of materials.   The Queens Museum and [[Autonomedia]] also released ''Agents and Assets: Witnessing the war on drugs and on communities,'' timed to coincide with the exhibition and containing the script, notes, and conversations accumulated over 12 years of performance of one of LAPD's best known and widely toured works. LAPD is the recipient of the [https://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/ Foundation for Contemporary Arts] Robert Rauschenberg Award (2018).

[[File:Green Lycurgus Cup.jpg|thumb|Photographed front-lit with flash, the cup appears in the green colour it has without light coming through the glass]]

The '''Lycurgus Cup''' is a 4th-century [[Roman glass]] [[cage cup]] made of a [[dichroic glass]], which shows a different colour depending on whether or not light is passing through it; red when lit from behind and green when lit from in front.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Highlights; Freestone, 270-273; see also  [http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~photspec/Press_files/NewsnViews_Leonhardt.pdf this pdf with good images under both lights]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only complete Roman glass object made from this type of glass,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lycurgus_cup.aspx British Museum - The Lycurgus Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; and the one exhibiting the most impressive change in colour;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271&lt;/ref&gt; it has been described as "the most spectacular glass of the period, fittingly decorated, which we know to have existed".&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup is also a very rare example of a complete Roman cage-cup, or ''diatretum'', where the glass has been painstakingly cut and ground back to leave only a decorative "cage" at the original surface-level.  Many parts of the cage have been completely undercut.  Most cage-cups have a cage with a geometric abstract design, but here there is a composition with figures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=1380 Corning Museum of Glass], Cage cups;Freestone, 270&lt;/ref&gt; showing the mythical King [[Lycurgus (Thrace)|Lycurgus]], who (depending on the version) tried to kill Ambrosia, a follower of the god [[Dionysus]] (Bacchus to the Romans). She was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and restrained him, eventually killing him. Dionysus and two followers are shown taunting the king.  The cup is the "only well-preserved figural example" of a cage cup.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

==The glass==
The dichroic effect is achieved by making the glass with tiny proportions of [[nanoparticle]]s of gold and silver dispersed in [[colloid]]al form throughout the glass material.  The process used remains unclear, and it is likely that it was not well understood or controlled by the makers, and was probably discovered by accidental "contamination" with minutely ground gold and silver dust. The glass-makers may not even have known that gold was involved, as the quantities involved are so tiny; they may have come from a small proportion of gold in any silver added (most Roman silver contains small proportions of gold), or from traces of gold or [[gold leaf]] left by accident in the workshop, as residue on tools, or from other work.  The very few other surviving fragments of Roman dichroic glass vary considerably in their two colours.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 275; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij5xe1V9Kw4C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Dichroic+Lycurgus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S0rFUo6FEZKihgfJz4CoAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dichroic%20Lycurgus&amp;f=false "Gold particles for imaging and Radiotherapy"], 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corning Inc.|Corning Glass Works]] has reproduced a [[Glass blank|blank]] of a material of similar chemical composition and internal structure, which displays under reflected and transmitted light the same "Lycurgus effect" of green to red colour change as the Lycurgus cup material does.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 273, fig 6 a &amp; 6b&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cranberry glass]] or gold ruby glass is somewhat similar and far more common, manufactured with colloidal gold, but this only ever shows a red colour.

To a conventionally composed Roman glass flux 330 parts per million of silver and 40 of gold were added: "These particles were precipitated as colloids and form a silver-gold alloy.  When viewed in reflected light the minute metallic particles are just coarse enough to reflect enough of the light without eliminating the transmission.  In transmitted light the fine particles scatter the blue end of the spectrum more effectively than the red end, resulting in red transmission, and this is the colour observed.  Since it is impossible that the Roman artisans managed to add these incredibly low levels of silver and gold to the volume of the glass used to make the vessel deliberately, the levels were probably added at higher levels to a larger volume of glass-melt, and increasingly diluted by adding more glass."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63; see also Freestone, 272-273; originally published in Barber&lt;/ref&gt;  The particles are only about 70 [[nanometer]]s across,&lt;ref&gt;Barber&lt;/ref&gt; and embedded in the glass, so they cannot be seen by optical microscopy, and a [[transmission electron microscope]] is needed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, 34; see also Henderson, 63&lt;/ref&gt;  At this size they approach the size of the wavelengths of visible light, and a [[surface plasmon resonance]] effect takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the cup is mostly smooth, but behind the main figures the glass has been hollowed out, well beyond even the main outer surface, so that they are of similar thickness to the main outer surface, giving an even colour when light passes through. This is a feature unique among surviving cups; Harden suggests they were an "afterthought".&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  An area around the torso of Lycurgus is a rather different colour from the rest of the glass; perhaps an accident of manufacture, but one exploited by the glass-cutter "so that he could make Lycurgus's rage glow even more strongly".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342; Freestone, 274&lt;/ref&gt;  After the very lengthy cutting stage the fine polished appearance was achieved by a process called "flame polishing" that risked the complete loss of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248; Williams, 342, though Freeman, 274 reports "groups of regular fine parallel striations", and suggests the polishing was all done mechanically.&lt;/ref&gt;  A suggestion in 1995 that in fact this and other cage cups used a mixture of moulding and cutting has met with little acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;By the glass historian Rosalinde Lierke (see also [[Hedwig glass]]). [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBBkBJN_lJMC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Lycurgus+Cup&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MZSGTNbcNpa6jAfuw6H9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lycurgus%20Cup&amp;f=false ''Roman glass in the Corning Museum of Glass''], David Whitehouse, Corning Museum of Glass; Freestone, 273-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Byzantine - The "Rubens Vase" - Walters 42562.jpg|thumb|left|The Rubens Vase, an [[agate]] [[hardstone carving]] of c. A.D. 400]]
Like the British Museum's other spectacular work in Roman glass, the [[cameo glass]] [[Portland Vase]], the cup represents to some extent the extension of skills developed by cutters of [[engraved gem]]s, or the larger [[hardstone carving]] of vessels in semi-precious stones, which were luxury arts with enormous prestige in ancient Rome.  No carved gemstone vessels directly comparable to either work are known, but the general taste behind these extreme exhibitions of glass-making skill is one formed by objects in natural stones like the [[Coupe des Ptolémées]] or the [[Rubens Vase]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, 92; see also Freestone, 273-274; for the Rubens Vase, see [http://art.thewalters.org/viewwoa.aspx?id=10284 the Walters Art Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was not until the first full studies of the cup in 1950 that it was established for certain that the material was glass and not a gemstone, which had previously been in question.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems likely that as many as three separate workshops or factories will have been involved in the whole process, perhaps not in the same part of the Empire.  The glass may have been initially made in a large block of standard clear glass, perhaps in Egypt or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which both exported great quantities of glass for forming, and sometimes colouring, elsewhere.  The thick "blank" dichroic vessel was probably made by one specialist workshop and passed to another consisting of specialist cutters.  This would certainly have been a rare and highly expensive object, and the secrets of its manufacture, possibly not well understood even by its makers, seem only to have been used for about a century.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 275&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various small losses, of which the face of the panther is the most significant, and the cup is cracked; the British Museum has never removed the metal rim for this reason.  The base or foot of the cup is damaged, and the original form of the base uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 245&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], in New York has a fragment measuring 2 3/16 x 3 in. (56 x 76&amp;nbsp;mm) of a satyr from a dichroic cage cup that turns from olive green to "reddish amber".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/all/objectview.aspx?OID=130013048 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Brit Mus room 41 Lycurgus cup no lighting.JPG|thumb|left|The satyr with the rock, in the new 2014 display]]
The figure of Lycurgus, bound by the vine and naked apart from boots,&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 245, for all the iconography. Lycurgus is normally depicted naked, or very nearly so.&lt;/ref&gt; is flanked on the left by a crouching Ambrosia, at a considerably smaller scale. Behind her one of Dionysus's [[satyr]]s (shown with a normal human form) stands on one foot as he prepares to hurl a large rock at Lycurgus.  In his other hand he holds a ''pedum'' or shepherd's crook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extremecraft.typepad.com/extreme_craft/2008/03/roman-knows.html photograph here in green] and [http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MXhw69CipdpzgXlez5u3Wg here in red] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712072805/http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MXhw69CipdpzgXlez5u3Wg |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the right of Lycurgus comes first a figure of [[Pan (god)|Pan]],&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=1066684&amp;objectid=61219 British Museum image of Pan]. The Pan figure is only illustrated at Harden, 247, out of the print sources seen.&lt;/ref&gt; then at his feet a rather canine-looking [[Panthera|panther]], the traditional companion of Dionysus, whose face is missing but was presumably snapping at the king, and then the god himself, taunting him with his right arm extended in an angry gesture.  Dionysus carries a [[thyrsus]], the special staff of the god and his followers, and his dress has an Eastern, perhaps Indian, flavour, reflecting what the Ancient Greeks generally believed (perhaps wrongly) about the origins of his cult.  The calf section of one leg has been lost.  A streamer hanging behind him from his thyrsus overlaps the raised foot of the satyr with the rock, completing the circle of the cup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=1066672&amp;objectid=61219 British Museum database image]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that this not very common scene was a reference to the defeat in 324 by the Emperor [[Constantine I]] of his co-emperor [[Licinius]], who was killed in 325 after a period under close guard.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Highlights&lt;/ref&gt;  Another suggestion is that the colour change from green to red was understood as evoking the ripening of red grapes, so that there was a particular suitability in depicting a scene with the god of wine.  The cup may have been intended for use at Bacchic cult celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 275&lt;/ref&gt; still very much a feature of Roman religious life around 300.  A letter supposedly from the Emperor [[Hadrian]] (d. 138) to his brother-in-law [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus|Servianus]], quoted in a biography in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', records the gift of two dichroic cups, which the 4th century author had seen: "I have sent you particoloured cups that change colour, presented to me by the priest of a temple. They are specially dedicated to you and my sister. I would like you to use them at banquets on feast days."&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 275; the biography was of [[Julius Saturninus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other depictions of the story tend to either depict Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, often with a double-headed axe, while her companions rush to her aid, or Lycurgus alone, entangled in the vine.  The closest parallel to the scene on the cup is one of the [[apse]] mosaics in the [[triconch]] ''[[triclinium]]'' at the [[Villa Romana del Casale|Villa del Casale]], [[Piazza Armerina]], which may also refer to Licinius.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248, and those in next note&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a mosaic at [[Antioch on the Orontes]], and a group on a 2nd-century [[sarcophagus]] at the [[Villa Parisi]] in [[Frascati]].&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271; [https://books.google.com/books?id=U7Uu_Dq8oY4C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Lycurgus+Piazza+Armerina&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lMVEm2Uuwk&amp;sig=nvPkUDffwsdEcuOlWmo368YQ7z4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AO2HTPzpNYzd4Aa1nojSBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lycurgus%20Piazza%20Armerina&amp;f=false More on the mosaics]; see next note for a link to an image.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a floor-mosaic from [[Vienne]], now in the museum at [[Saint-Romain-en-Gal]], with Lycurgus alone inside the vine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green-man-of-cercles.org/articles/men_among_vines.pdf PDF on classical precedents for Romanesque figures entwined with vines]; fig. 7 is the Vienne mosaic, fig. 9 a partial view of the Piazza Armerini mosaic. [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosWrath.html#Lykourgos Four other depictions of Lycurgus] can be seen here.&lt;/ref&gt; The preceding scene of Lycurgus attacking Ambrosia, is on a floor-mosaic at [[Brading Roman Villa]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/88938785@N00/280125516/ Brading mosaic]&lt;/ref&gt;  Of this and similar mosaics, Martin Henig says: "In cases such as this, we are not concerned with simple, popular paganism but with recondite knowledge. This is the sort of esoteric religion which the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus|Praetextatus]], [[Macrobius]] and [[Proclus]] relished. The religious thought behind these floors is probably deeper and more complex than contemporary Christianity and many of the keys to understanding it have been lost."&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup was probably designed for drinking from at feasts, or more specifically Bacchic cult celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 248&lt;/ref&gt; where the lack of a foot, also a feature found in other cage-cups, may mean it was passed around, as elaborate cups often were in medieval cultures. Alternatively other cage cups were almost certainly used, suspended, as [[oil lamp]]s, where the dichroic effect of this cup would show to advantage.

==History==
[[File:Lycurgus Cup red BM MME1958.12-2.1.jpg|thumb|A view showing parts in both colours, and the variation in the red.]]
The cup was "perhaps made in [[Alexandria]]" or Rome in about 290-325 AD, and measures {{convert|16.5|x|13.2|cm|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342; the British Museum Highlights has "4th century AD. Probably made in Rome". The dimensions are also from Williams and the Highlights; the Collection database has {{convert|15.88|cm|1|abbr=on}} for the height, perhaps a difference arising from the remounting of the foot.&lt;/ref&gt;   From its excellent condition it is probable that, like several other luxury Roman objects, it has always been preserved above ground; most often such objects ended up in the relatively secure environment of a [[church treasury]].  Alternatively it might, like several other cage cups, have been recovered from a [[sarcophagus]].  The present [[gilt-bronze]] rim and foot were added in about 1800,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 342, who says "gilt-bronze"; The BM database says "[[silver-gilt]]".&lt;/ref&gt;  suggesting it was one of the many objects taken from church treasuries during the period of the [[French Revolution]] and [[French Revolutionary Wars]].  The foot continues the theme of the cup with open-work vine leaves, and the rim has leaf forms that lengthen and shorten to match the scenes in glass.  In 1958 the foot was removed by British Museum conservators, and not rejoined to the cup until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum database, where there are also photographs with the foot removed.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may well have been earlier mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, 271&lt;/ref&gt;

The early history of the cup is unknown, and it is first mentioned in print in 1845, when a French writer said he had seen it "some years ago, in the hands of M. Dubois".&lt;ref&gt;"il y a quelques années, entre les mains de M. Dubois", Harden, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is probably shortly before it was acquired by the [[Rothschild family]].&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 247&lt;/ref&gt;  Certainly [[Lionel de Rothschild]] owned it by 1857, when the touring [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] saw it in his collection and described it as "barbaric and debased".&lt;ref&gt;Reist, Inge (ed.), "Le Gout Rothschild", in ''British Models of Art Collecting and the American Response: Reflections Across the Pond
The Histories of Material Culture and Collecting, 1700–1950'', p. 104, 2014, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., {{ISBN|147243806X}}, 9781472438065, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdJIBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1862 Lionel lent it to an exhibition at what is now the [[V&amp;A Museum]], after which it virtually fell from scholarly view until 1950.  In 1958 [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Victor, Lord Rothschild]] sold it to the British Museum for £20,000, £2,000 of which was donated by the [[Art Fund]] (then the NACF).&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 246; [http://www.artfund.org/artwork/3433/the-lycurgus-cup Art Fund website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup forms part of the museum's Department of Prehistory and Europe rather than the Greece and Rome Department, and was previously on display, lit from behind, in Room 50.  In 2015 it was on display with the new display of the Rothschild donation of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]] in Room 2A, with a changing internal lighting source that shows the colour change very effectively, though only one side of the cup can be seen.  By October 2015 it was back in the re-opened Room 41.

While Room 41, where it was then displayed, was closed for refurbishment, from November 2012 to August 2013 it was on display with other British Museum pieces at The [[Art Institute of Chicago]]'s Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman and Byzantine Art,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/weekend/16382786-421/story.html Chicago Sun-Times]&lt;/ref&gt; where it was very effectively displayed in a free-standing case, lit from above with changing light so that the colour change was clearly visible.&lt;ref&gt;See videos on external links&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered able to travel to important exhibitions and in 2008 was exhibited in "Reflecting Antiquity, Modern Glass Inspired by Ancient Rome" at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], in 2003 at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in London in "'Saved! 100 Years of the National Art Collections Fund", and in 1987 in "Glass of the Caesars" in the British Museum, [[Cologne]], [[Milan]], and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Database; Harden p. XI; see also Corning link above.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Martyrs of the Alamo''''' (also known as '''''The Birth of Texas''''') is a 1915 American [[Historical film|historical]] [[War film|war drama film]] written and directed by [[Christy Cabanne]]. The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including [[Sam De Grasse]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Walter Long (actor)|Walter Long]] and [[Alfred Paget]].&lt;ref name="silentera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/M/MartyrsOfTheAlamo1915.html|title=The Martyrs of the Alamo; or, "The Birth of Texas"|publisher=silentera.com|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in ''[[The Lamb]]'', was released prior to this picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/16586 | publisher=American Film Institute | title=The Martyrs of the Alamo | accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features the [[Siege of Béxar]], [[Battle of the Alamo]] and [[Battle of San Jacinto]].

While making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in [[San Antonio]] in 1836 as a group of ill-mannered drunks.  One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her.  The white woman reports the incident to her husband, [[Almeron Dickinson]] who in turn shoots the Mexican officer.  In his book ''Remembering the Alamo'', author Richard R. Flores, argues that the negative portrayal of the Mexican population is due to racism toward Mexicans in 1915, the year the film was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Richard R. |title=Remembering the Alamo: Memory, Modernity, and Thew Master Symbol|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0-292-78196-2|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the film is preserved at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="silentera" /&gt;

'''Martín Tovar y Tovar''' (10 February 1827 &amp;ndash; 17 December 1902) was a Venezuelan painter, best known for his portraits and historical scenes.

== Biography ==
Tovar was born and died in [[Caracas]]. His father, Antonio Maria Tovar (1791-1860), was a former official of the Spanish government who had retired after receiving a serious bullet wound during the [[Venezuelan War of Independence|War of Independence]]. His mother, Damiana Tovar Liendo (c.1805-1844), was from [[Caracas]]. The family had been living in exile in [[Puerto Rico]], but returned to Venezuela immediately before Tovar's birth.&lt;ref name="V"&gt;[http://vereda.ula.ve/wiki_artevenezolano/index.php/Tovar_y_Tovar,_Mart%C3%ADn Biography] @ Wikihistoria del Arte Venezolano.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He received his first lessons from Celestino Martinez (1820-1855) who, at the age of nineteen, had just become an instructor at the "Academia de Dibujo" (Drawing Academy). Later, Tovar studied at the Academy itself with Antonio José Carranza (1817-1893) and at the "Colegio de La Paz" with [[Carmelo Fernández]]. In 1844, he joined with Fernández and two other artists to acquire a [[lithography]] workshop owned by German emigrants.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.mcnbiografias.com/app-bio/do/show?key=tovar-y-tovar-martin Brief biography] @ MCN Biografías.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Firma del acta de independencia de Venezuela.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Study (art)|Study]] for the Signing of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]]
In 1850, he travelled to Spain and enrolled at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] in Madrid. There, he studied with [[José de Madrazo]] and his son, [[Federico de Madrazo]], among others.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;[http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/sec/his/id/186/?show=1 Brief biography] @ Efemérides Venezolanos.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, he opened a shop called "Fotografía Artística de Martín Tovar y Tovar", becoming one of his country's pioneer photographers. In 1852, he moved to Paris and found a position in the workshop of [[Léon Cogniet]].&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; Three years later, he returned to Venezuela, but stayed for only a year before going back to Paris to copy paintings by the major artists, with a view towards using them to establish a national museum in Caracas. His proposal was accepted, but a lack of funds kept it from being realized.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;

He continued to focus on portraits, however, and participated in several exhibitions, including the [[International Exposition (1867)]] in Paris. Two years later, he was appointed Director of the "Academia de Bellas Artes" in Caracas.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt; In 1872, he exhibited at the "Primera Exposición Anual de Bellas Artes Venezolanas", organized by the explorers James Mudie Spence (1836-1878)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdv.com/lexico/pioneros/spence.htm Biography of Spence] @ Pioneros en Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anton Goering]] (who was also a painter).

In 1873, he received what would be his largest commission; painting 30 portraits of heroes from the War of Independence and other public figures for the "Salón Elíptico" at the [[Palacio Federal Legislativo]],&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; a project that would occupy him for two years. In 1881, he received another commission from President [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]]; a large canvas depicting the signing of the [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]], also for the "Salón Elíptico". The work was presented at the "Exposición Nacional de Venezuela" in 1883 and was awarded a gold medal.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt; This resulted in further commissions to portray the battles of [[Battle of Carabobo|Carabobo]], [[Battle of Boyacá|Boyacá]], [[Battle of Junín|Junín]] and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]]. After researching and sketching the battle sites, he set up a workshop in Paris, which he maintained from 1887 to the late 1890s, commuting between there and Caracas and doing more portraits as well as the battle scenes. He had finished only three of the battles when he died in 1902. The ''Battle of Ayucucho'' was completed by [[Antonio Herrera Toro]], using Tovar's studies.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33705">The '''misappropriation doctrine''' is a U.S. legal theory conferring a "quasi-property right" on a person who invests "labor, skill, and money" to create an [[intangible asset]]. The right operates against another person (usually a competitor of the first person) "endeavoring to reap where it has not sown" by "misappropriating" the value of the asset (ordinarily by copying what the first person has created). The quoted language and the legal principle come from the decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', 248 U.S. 215 (1918), also known as ''INS v. AP'' or simply the ''INS'' case.

The misappropriation doctrine originated as federal common law but since 1938 it has been based on state law. The current viability of the misappropriation doctrine is uncertain because of subsequent developments in U.S. patent and copyright law that "preempt" state law that operates in the same field of law, as is explained in the article on ''[[INS v. AP]]''.

==Legal setting in which doctrine arose==

===Why doctrine developed under federal law but is now under state law===

In 1918 when the Supreme Court decided the ''INS'' case, a body of federal common law concerning business practices and torts existed that the Supreme Court had power to declare or create. This legal regime stemmed from the 1842 decision of the Supreme Court in ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;41 U.S. 1 (1842).&lt;/ref&gt; That case held that the federal courts, when deciding legal issues not specifically addressed by the applicable state legislature, had the authority to develop a federal common law. In 1938, however, in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'',&lt;ref&gt;304 U.S. 64 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court overruled ''Swift v. Tyson''. Consequently, since that time the misappropriation doctrine fell under the control of the laws of the various states, which were therefore free to accept or reject it.

===Previous state of unfair competition law===

Before the ''INS'' case, unfair competition law was generally considered to be limited to cases of "palming off"—where the defendant deceived customers by causing them erroneously to believe that the defendant's product emanated from the plaintiff, and as a result diverted trade from the plaintiff to the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Goldstein, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1120873?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''Federal System Ordering of the Copyright Interest''], 69 {{smallcaps|Columb. L. Rev.}} 49, 58 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''INS'' case extended the concept of unfair competition to a much wider range of business conduct, based on the particular court's concept of morality.&lt;ref&gt;In New Jersey, for example, "the tort of Unfair Competition protects businesses from the commercial immortality of others.  There is no one standard for the tort, rather at its essence are notions of fair play.  As a concept, it is said to be as 'flexible and elastic' as is demanded by the ever evolving standards of commercial morality." [http://www.lawforchange.org/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=2929 Law for Change]. See also ''Roy Export Co. Establishment v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.'', 672 F.2d 1095, 1105 (2d Cir. 1982) (New York unfair competition law: "encompassing any form of commercial immorality").&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''INS'' case==
{{Main|INS v. AP}}

===Background===

The ''INS'' case, the cornerstone of the misappropriation doctrine, arose out of a dispute between two news gathering organizations, the Associated Press (AP) and the International News Service (INS) over reporting World War I news. The Allied Powers (England and France) perceived [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s INS to be unduly favorable to the Central Powers (Germany and Austria); therefore, the Allies barred INS from using Allied telegraph lines to report news; this effectively prevented INS from reporting war news. To deal with this, INS copied AP's news bulletins from publicly accessible sources, rewrite them, and distributed the rewrites to INS's client newspapers. The AP then brought an action seeking to enjoin INS from copying AP-gathered news.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/05/03/102698926.pdf News Pirating Case in Supreme Court]'', {{smcaps|N.Y. Times}}, May 3, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court ruling===

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the AP, with Justice Pitney writing for the majority. Justices Holmes and Brandeis wrote dissents.

====Majority opinion====

The majority opinion by Justice Pitney recognized that the information found in the AP news was not copyrightable. Instead, Pitney approached the issue from the perspective of unfair competition. He found that there was a "quasi-property right" in the fresh news as it is "stock in trade to be gathered at the cost of enterprise, organization, skill, labor and money, and to be distributed and sold to those who will pay money for it." Given the "economic value" of the news, a company can "therefore" have a limited property interest in it against a competitor (but not against the general public) who would attempt to take unfair advantage of the information.&lt;ref&gt;See See ''INS v. AP'', 248 U.S. at 234-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court characterized INS's behavior as "misappropriation."&lt;ref&gt;See ''INS v. AP'', 248 U.S. at 240, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the tenuous value of "hot" news, Pitney narrowed the period for which the proprietary right would apply: copying was forbidden "only to the extent necessary to prevent that competitor from reaping the fruits of complainant's efforts and expenditure."&lt;ref&gt;See ''INS v. AP'', 248 U.S. at 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court justified its creation of a "quasi-property right" in these terms:

{{quote|[INS] is taking material that has been acquired by AP as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and which is salable by AP for money, and that INS in appropriating it and selling it as its own is endeavoring to reap where it has not sown, and by disposing of it to newspapers that are competitors of AP's members is appropriating to itself the harvest of those who have sown.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [A] court of equity ought not to hesitate long in characterizing it as unfair competition in business.

.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [H]e who has fairly paid the price should have the beneficial use of the property. It is no answer to say that AP spends its money for that which is too fugitive or evanescent to be the subject of property. That might, and for the purposes of the discussion we are assuming that it would furnish an answer in a common-law controversy. But in a court of equity, where the question is one of unfair competition, if that which AP has acquired fairly at substantial cost may be sold fairly at substantial profit, a competitor who is misappropriating it for the purpose of disposing of it to his own profit and to the disadvantage of AP cannot be heard to say that it is too fugitive or evanescent to be regarded as property. It has all the attributes of property necessary for determining that a misappropriation of it by a competitor is unfair competition because contrary to good conscience.&lt;ref&gt;See ''INS v. AP'', 248 U.S. at 239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Holmes dissent====

Justice Holmes dissented, arguing that the law of unfair competition requires a misrepresentation. If the misrepresentation here is that some people may think AP copied the news from INS, the proper remedy would be only to prohibit INS (for a limited time) from copying from AP unless it provides a notice that it copied from AP.&lt;ref&gt;See ''INS v. AP'', 248 U.S. at 246-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brandeis dissent====

Justice Brandeis dissented on the grounds that "reaping where another sowed" is not an actionable tort: "[O]rdinarily one is at perfect liberty to find out, if he can by lawful means, trade secrets of another, however valuable, and then use the knowledge so acquired gainfully, although it cost the original owner much in effort and in money to collect or produce."&lt;ref&gt;See See ''INS v. AP'', 248 U.S. at 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandeis closed his dissent with an argument that the Court was ill-suited to act as a legislature and the matter should be left to the wisdom of Congress:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The creation or recognition by courts of a new private right may work serious injury to the general public, unless the boundaries of the right are definitely established and wisely guarded. . . . A Legislature, urged to enact a law by which one news agency or newspaper may prevent appropriation of the fruits of its labors by another, would consider .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [possible adverse effects on the public and other businesses]. Legislators might conclude that it was impossible to put an end to the obvious injustice involved in such appropriation of news, without opening the door to other evils, greater than that sought to be remedied.

    Courts are ill-equipped to make the investigations which should precede a determination of the limitations which should be set upon any property right in news or of the circumstances under which news gathered by a private agency should be deemed affected with a public interest. Courts would be powerless to prescribe the detailed regulations essential to full enjoyment of the rights conferred or to introduce the machinery required for enforcement of such regulations. Considerations such as these should lead us to decline to establish a new rule of law .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;See ''INS v. AP'', 248 U.S. at 262-63, 264, 267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

Although ''INS'' was a landmark case when it was decided, subsequent developments have diminished its significance and that of the misappropriation doctrine. A leading copyright law scholar has commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been suggested that the credence due the ''International News Service'' case today is minimal: that subsequent decisions have restricted its [misappropriation] doctrine to the news context and that, in any event, it is but a derelict of the federal common law, untenable after ''[[Erie R.R. v. Tompkins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goldstein, 69 {{smallcaps|Colum. L. Rev.}} at 49 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seventh Circuit Judge Posner similarly remarked that ''INS'' is "a decision no longer authoritative because it was based on the federal courts' subsequently abandoned authority to formulate common law principles .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;''Confold Pacific, Inc. v. Polaris Indus., Inc.'', 433 F.3d 952, 960 (7th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The misappropriation doctrine still persists, however, in the area of "hot news" and other time-value information and in those states that give the ''INS'' doctrine expansive scope against "immoral" commercial behavior, typically involving copying.

An additional factor affecting the scope and viability of the  misappropriation doctrine has been the development of the federal preemption doctrine since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sears v. Stiffel]]'' and ''[[Compco v. Day-Brite]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine makes state law ineffective when it conflicts with or disturbs the balance between competition and monopoly struck in the federal intellectual property laws.
On the other hand, the misappropriation doctrine has not been preempted in areas where a type of copying is not regulated under federal copyright or patent law.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.'', 416 U.S. 470 (1974); ''Goldstein v. California'', 412 U.S. 546 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; But the limits of this dispensation are uncertain: the boundary condition may be that state law may operate so long as the omission from federal regulation is not the result of a congressional decision that the area should be left open to free competition; an alternative boundary rule may be that the state law must not upset a delicate balance which the court perceives that the federal system has struck.&lt;ref&gt;See Leo J. Raskind, ''Assessing the Impact of Feist'', 17 {{smallcaps|U. Dayton L. Rev.}} 331 (1992). See also ''Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.'', 489 U.S. 141, 146 (1989) ("We believe that the Florida statute .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. so substantially impedes the public use of the otherwise unprotected design and utilitarian ideas embodied in unpatented [products that the Florida law protects] as to run afoul of the teaching of .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. ''Sears'' and ''Compco''.").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of ''Kellogg'' case===

In ''[[Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;305 U.S. 111 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; in 1938, the Supreme Court considered a case arguably akin to ''INS'' but (with Justice Brandeis now writing for the Court's majority instead of dissenting as in ''INS'') denied relief. The ''Kellogg'' Court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kellogg Company is undoubtedly sharing in the goodwill of the article known as ''Shredded Wheat''; and thus is sharing in a market which was created by the skill and judgment of plaintiff's predecessor and has been widely extended by vast expenditures in advertising persistently made.  But that is not unfair.  Sharing in the goodwill of an article unprotected by patent or trade-mark is the exercise of a right possessed by all—and in the free exercise of which the consuming public is deeply interested.&lt;ref&gt;305 U.S. at 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One commentator maintained that one could properly—
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...view ''Kellogg'' as vindication of the views that he [Brandeis] expressed in ''INS''. That Nabisco had invested in the shredded wheat product did not give it control over the use of the pillow shape (or the term SHREDDED WHEAT); it had no property right against misappropriation of the shape after the expiry of the patents. Instead, Brandeis inquired [only] whether Kellogg had engaged in any acts of misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme B. Dinwoodie, [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&amp;context=graeme_dinwoodie ''The Story of Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.: Breakfast with Brandeis''] 29 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since Kellogg did not misrepresent its version of Shredded Wheat, the Court held it free to appropriate the unpatented, uncopyrighted biscuit features regardless of Nabisco's expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and it allowed Kellogg to reap where Nabisco had sown.

===Effect of ''Sears'' and ''Compco'' cases===

In ''[[Sears v. Stiffel]]'' and ''[[Compco v. Day-Brite]]'', the defendants copied the unpatented, uncopyrighted product designs of the plaintiffs. The lower courts had applied what amounted to the ''INS'' misappropriation doctrine to hold the defendants guilty of unfair competition. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that state law was being used to create a state-law equivalent of the federal patent system, and that disturbed the balance Congress had struck in this area. One commentator explained: "Though ''International News Service'' has never been expressly overruled, the Court was, in ''Sears'' and ''Compco'', apparently rejecting its approach.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goldstein, 69 {{smallcaps|Colum. L. Rev.}} at 64 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1989, the Court struck down a state law protecting boat designs that were neither patented nor copyrighted, in ''[[Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;489 U.S. 141 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; thus reaffirming the preemption rule of the ''Sears'' and ''Compco'' cases barring ''INS''-like protection of product designs where the patent or copyright laws might otherwise apply.

On the other hand, the Court has permitted state misappropriation law to apply against copying in areas not regulated by federal law, such as sound recordings before 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Goldstein v. California]]'', 412 U.S. 546 (1973). Congress did not protect sound recordings under the copyright law until 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of these decisions with the 1989 ''Bonito Boats'' decision may suggest a less preemptive approach to subject matter in the neighborhood of copyright than in the neighborhood of patent law.

==="Hot news" cases===

In a number of cases, courts have applied the misappropriation doctrine to copying in fact settings analogous to the circumstances of the ''INS'' case—a competitor's appropriation of information that is costly to generate and that has value for only a limited time.

The original core holding and narrowest implication of ''INS'' was that there was now a "hot news" doctrine that protected first comers in their creation of an ephemeral, time-sensitive information asset at appreciable expense against "free riders." The Second Circuit addressed this concept in ''[[National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.]] (NBA)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1997946105F3d841_1804.xml/NATIONAL%20BASKETBALL%20ASS%27N%20v.%20MOTOROLA,%20INC. ''NBA''], 105 F.3d 841 (2d Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; But the Second Circuit imposed precise limits on the rule to avoid possible conflict with copyright law and the First Amendment. It held that under New York State law, a "hot-news," ''INS''-like claim exists only in cases where:

:(i) a plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost;

:(ii) the information is time-sensitive;

:(iii) a defendant's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff's efforts;

:(iv) the defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs; and

:(v) the ability of other parties to free-ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.&lt;ref&gt;105 F.3d at 845. It has been noted "that although ''INS'' did not expressly adopt all of these factors, they all would have been met by the facts of that case." [http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006spring/law/357c/001/projects/dougf/node7.html ''Misappropriation'', U.N.C. Law School].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Circuit held that the "hot news" tort was largely preempted by the 1976 Copyright Act, in this case, and it tailored the five factors to avoid such preemption. The effect was to limit the scope of the hot-news branch of the misappropriation doctrine largely to the facts of the ''INS'' case.&lt;ref&gt;Accord ''[[Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc.]]'', 650 F.3d 876 (2d Cir. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other copying===

The language of the ''INS'' case can be interpreted to cover conduct quite different in kind from the appropriation of hot news. Some states, such as New Jersey and Wisconsin, and at times New York, have applied the doctrine more broadly to cover any conduct that the courts deemed "immoral" under open-ended, flexible, adaptable, capacious, and amorphous standards.

For example, the Second Circuit at one point spoke sweepingly of the scope of the New York misappropriation doctrine in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New York courts have noted the incalculable variety of illegal practices falling within the unfair competition rubric, calling it a broad and flexible doctrine that depends more upon the facts set forth than in most causes of action. It has been broadly described as encompassing any form of commercial immorality, or simply as endeavoring to reap where one has not sown; it is taking the skill, expenditures and labors of a competitor, and misappropriating for the commercial advantage of one person a benefit or property right belonging to another. The tort is adaptable and capacious.&lt;ref&gt;''Roy Export Co. Establishment v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.'', 672 F.2d 1095, 1105 (2d Cir. 1982) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, the determinative factor is "whether the acts of a defendant are 'fair or unfair, according to principles recognized in equity, and not by 'the morals of the market place.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Oneida, Ltd. v. National Silver Co.'', 25 N.Y.S.2d 271, 276 (Sup. Ct. 1940).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, New Jersey courts have said that state's unfair competition law is a matter of determining what is "fair play."&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Broadcasting System v. Melody Recordings, Inc.'', 134 N.J. Super. 368, 376, 341 A.2d 348 (App. Div. 1975) ("the essence of unfair competition is fair play").&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the Third Circuit said of New Jersey unfair competition law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
New Jersey's common law of unfair competition does not have clear boundaries but is instead flexible and elastic as evolving standards of morality demand, and the essence of an unfair competition claim is the enforcement of fair play.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexington Nat. Ins. Corp. v. Ranger Ins. Co.'', 326 F.3d 416, 419 (3d Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New Jersey courts have therefore placed great focus on what they perceived to be the moral and ethical quality of the defendant's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. Farmland Dairy Farms, Inc.'', 282 N.J. Super. 140, 186, 659 A.2d 904, 926 (N.J. Super. A.D. 1995) ("Unfair competition laws are intended to restrain competition deemed ethically unprincipled."); ''Squeezit Corp. v. Plastic Dispensers'', 31 N.J. Super. 217, 221, 106 A.2d 322, 324-25 (N.J. Super. A.D. 1954) (the trend of unfair competition law "has been in the direction of enforcing increasingly higher standards of fairness or commercial morality in trade"). See also ''Ryan v. Carmona Bolen Home for Funerals'', 341 N.J. Super. 87, 775 A.2d 92, 95 (2001) ("[T]he purpose of the law regarding unfair competition is to promote higher ethical standards in the business world.").&lt;/ref&gt; They recognize that their "law of unfair competition is an amorphous area of jurisprudence. It knows no clear boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;''New Jersey Optometric Ass'n v. Hillman-Kohan Eyeglasses, Inc.'', 144 N.J. Super. 411, 427,  365 A.2d 956, 965 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mercury Records Productions, Inc. v. Economic Consultants, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;64 Wisc. 2d 163, 218 N.W.2d 705 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that ''INS'' states the applicable law for Wisconsin: "The unfair competition-misappropriation theory applied in ''INS'' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. comports with the theory" of the Wisconsin courts and "is consistent with the public policy of the state of Wisconsin"; that state policy is "simply simply the principles of old-fashioned honesty," meaning that "[o]ne man may not reap where another has sown nor gather where another has strewn."&lt;ref&gt;64 Wisc 2d at 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

California, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Nouth Carolina, and Wisconsin applied the ''INS'' misappropriation doctrine to enjoin those copying records (so-called record piracy) during the period when federal copyright law did not cover sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;''Capitol Records, Inc. v. Erickson'', 2 Cal. App. 3d 526, 532, 2 Cal. Rptr. 798 (1969); ''Capitol Records v. Spies'', 130 Ill. App. 2d 429, 432, 264 N. E. 2d 874 (1970); ''National Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Nance'', 506 S.W.2d 483, 484, 485 (Mo. Ct. App. 1974); ''Capitol Records, Inc. v. Greatest Records, Inc.'', 43 Misc. 2d 878, 252 N.Y.S.2d 553 (Sup. Ct. 1964); ''Liberty/U A, Inc. v. Eastern Tape Corp.'', 11 N.C. App. 20, 22, 180 S.E.2d 414 (1971); ''Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Custom Recording Co.'', 258 S.C. 465, 478, 189 S.E.2d 305 (1972),&lt;/ref&gt;

But those courts have applied the misappropriation doctrine, as well, to other forms of copying, such as copying of products. Many of these cases were decided before the Supreme Court's ''Sears'', ''Compco'', and ''Bonito Boats'' decisions, which have raised preemption issues as to some of these misappropriation decisions.

For example, in a 1940 case under New York law, the defendant copied the ornamental design of the plaintiff's silverplate as well as "a similar system of advertising, copied at least in part by the defendant; and high pressure salesmanship in obtaining a wide market amongst dealers by offering attractively a greater number of pieces in a set of inferior quality at a much lower price," while pointing out to the dealers that they could sell the defendant's silverware to customers instead of the plaintiff's because "purchasers would readily believe that the old pattern or a new one of similar type was being offered at a bargain."&lt;ref&gt;''Oneida, Ltd. v. National Silver Co.'', 25 N.Y.S.2d 271, 276 (Sup. Ct. 1940).&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the defendant succeeded in "attracting the interest of a class having some knowledge of patterns but being largely uninformed and undiscriminating concerning the quality of the wares and the reputation and business standing of different manufacturers, who are attracted by offers of a bargain."&lt;ref&gt;25 N.Y.S.2d at 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that this was unfair competition, under the standard that "whether the acts of a defendant are 'fair or unfair, [must be judged] according to principles recognized in equity, and not by 'the morals of the market place.'"&lt;ref&gt;25 N.Y.S.2d at 276, 292. The facts in this case are similar to those of ''[[Compco v. Day-Brite]]'', discussed earlier in this Article, and under that subsequent Supreme Court precedent this case might require a different judgment.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In another New York case, the defendant copied the plaintiff's unpatented, uncopyrighted "Mustard Seed Remembrancer" locket, containing a mustard seed to remind users of the power of "so much faith as a grain of mustard" to move mountains (''Matt''. 17:20). The court found misappropriation under the ''INS'' doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Flint v. Oleet Jewelry Mfg. Co.'', 133 F. Supp. 459 (S.D.N.Y. 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; It also cited and relied upon the concept of unfair competition described in the preceding silverplate case. The court specifically declined to follow the ''Kellogg'' decision, discussed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;This case was decided a decade earlier than the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Sears v. Stiffel]]'', discussed earlier.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, in a subsequent case under New York law, involving the copying of ornamental jewelry designs, the defendant asserted preemption as a defense. The district court opined in ''dicta''—"Were Gemveto's claim predicated solely upon Cooper's having copied plaintiff's jewelry designs [''i.e.'', New York misappropriation law] the claim perhaps would be preempted by federal law." But "there was proof not only that Cooper copied Gemveto's products but of a deliberate attempt by Cooper to deceive the consuming public as to the source of its "knockoffs" and thereby to appropriate the goodwill or reputation of Gemveto, a rival seller." Therefore, it was proper to enjoin the defendant under New York's law against palming off, the district court ruled, without reaching the issue of whether federal copyright or patent law preempted New York's misappropriation law against product imitation.&lt;ref&gt;''Gemveto Jewelry Co. v. Jeff Cooper, Inc.'', 613 F. Supp. 1052, 1064 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against copying, because it was insufficiently clear as to what palming-off activity the defendant was prohibited from engaging in. The final order by the district court permanently enjoined Cooper "from selling or offering for sale any item of jewelry that is confusingly similar in appearance to any item of plaintiff's jewelry such that the sale or offer for sale of such item, ''by any method or means, is calculated to deceive the public as to its source''...."&lt;ref&gt;''Gemveto Jewelry Co. v. Jeff Cooper Inc.'', 800 F.2d 256, 258 (2d Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; But "the ''Sears'' and ''Compco'' decisions .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. hold that copying of the article itself that is unprotected by the federal patent and copyright laws cannot be protected by state law," the Second Circuit stated.&lt;ref&gt;800 F.2d at 259.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid colliding with ''Sears-Compco'', the district court had to enter an order with "an appropriate re-wording of the injunction to specify Cooper's acts which would, if not enjoined, constitute palming-off under New York common law." The court ruled that the injunction must be directed against deceptive conduct (palming off), not the nature of the product; under ''Compco'', for example, the defendant had a right to make a confusingly similar jewelry item, so long as it did not engage in deceptive palming off.&lt;ref&gt;800 F.2d at 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

A much more recent jewelry-copying case under New York law appears to state the current view of New York's misappropriation law, as applied to both patent and copyright preemption (outside the "hot news" field):

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to avoid preemption, that which is claimed to be unfair competition must be something different from copying, or the fruits of copying, or the intent or bad faith that can be inferred from the act of copying; if the harm [to plaintiff] arises from the simple fact of copying, the claim falls within the Copyright Act [or patent law] and is preempted.&lt;ref&gt;''Eyal R.D. Corp. v. Jewelex New York Ltd.'', 784 F. Supp. 2d 441, 447 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting ''Computer Associates Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.'', 982 F.2d 693, 717 (2d Cir. 1992)).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the claim is in substance based on mere copying, it will be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;''Eyal'', 784 F. Supp. 2d at 447 ("As pleaded, however, Eyal has simply attempted to dress up its claim that Jewelex has copied its design."); ''id''. at 448 ("Eyal's claim, based on the financial injury caused by Jewelex in 'distributing, selling, promoting and/or otherwise exploiting the Eyal Ring, thereby reaping financial rewards without having to pay the costs required to design and market the ring,' falls squarely within the ambit of §&amp;nbsp;106 of the Copyright Act, because it is simply alleging harms arising from Jewelex's alleged copying of the Eyal ring.").&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the Second Circuit has said of preemption and the misappropriation doctrine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e believe that ''Metropolitan Opera'' 's broad misappropriation doctrine based on amorphous concepts such as "commercial immorality" or society's "ethics" is preempted. Such concepts are virtually synonymous for wrongful copying and are in no meaningful fashion distinguishable from infringement of a copyright.&lt;ref&gt;''National Basketball Assoc. v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 851 (2d Cir. 1997) (reversing district court judgment based on New York's misappropriation doctrine.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other circuits have treated the misappropriation doctrine and preemption boundary similarly to the Second Circuit's line of cases. They require the state-law claim to be based on something significantly or "qualitatively" extra, beyond mere copying of the plaintiff's product or service to avoid preemption.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Cambridge Literary Props., Ltd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik'', 510 F. 3d 77, 102 (1st Cir. 2007) (no Copyright Act preemption of state-law claim for trade secrets misappropriation because latter involved "extra element"—''viz.'', breach of a fiduciary duty—not found in a copyright infringement claim); ''Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software Servs., Inc. v. Grace Consulting, Inc.'', 307 F.3d 197, 217–18 (3d Cir. 2002); ''Trandes Corp. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co.'', 996 F.2d 655 (4"' Cir. 1993) (state law claim must be "predicated upon an act incorporating elements beyond mere production or the like"); ''Carson v. Dynegy, Inc.'', 344 F.3d 446, 456 (5th Cir. 2003); ''Stromback v. New Line Cinema,'' 384 F.3d 283, 301 (6th Cir. 2004); ''Toney v. L'Oreal USA, Inc.'', 406 F.3d 905, 910 (7th Cir. 2005); ''National Car Rental Sys., Inc. v. Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc.'', 991 F.2d 426, 431 (8th Cir. 1993); ''Montz v. Pilgrim Films &amp; Television, Inc.'', 649 F.3d 975, 980 (9th Cir. 2011) (''en banc'') ("The California Courts of Appeal have uniformly concluded that ''Desny'' claims are not preempted because they flow from agreements and understandings different from the monopoly protection of copyright law."); ''La Resolana Architects, PA v. Clay Realtors Angel Fire'', 416 F.3d 1195, 1199 n.2 (10th Cir. 2005); ''Stuart Weitzman, LLC v. Microcomputer Resources, Inc.'', 542 F.3d 859, 864 n.5 (11th Cir. 2008) ("courts ask whether the state law claim has extra elements that make it qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim"); ''Sturdza v. United Arab Emirates'', 281 F.3d 1287, 1304 (D.C. Cir. 2002); ''Bowers v. Baystate Techs., Inc.'', 320 F.3d 1317, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("claims might be preempted whose extra elements are illusory, being mere label[s] attached to the same odious business conduct".&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these cases hold that "commercial immorality" plus copying is no more than copying alone for preemption purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp.'', 36 F.3d 1147, 1165 (1st Cir. 1994) ("a state law misappropriation claim will not escape preemption ... simply because a plaintiff must prove that copying was not only unauthorized but also commercially immoral"); ''Financial Information, Inc. v. Moody's Investors Serv.. Inc.'', 808 F.2d 204, 208 (2d Cir. 1986) ("Whether or not reproduction of another's work is 'immoral' depends on whether such use of the work is wrongful. If, for example, the work is in the public domain, then its use would not be wrongful. Likewise, if, as here, the work is unprotected by federal law because of lack of originality, then its use is neither unfair nor unjustified."); ''Baltimore Orioles v. Major League Baseball Players,'' 805 F.2d 663, 674 (7th Cir. 1986) ("reproduction with intent, knowledge, or commercial immorality not different in kind").&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ms .45''''', also known as '''''Angel of Vengeance''''', and mistyped as '''''Ms. 45''''', is a 1981 American [[exploitation film|exploitation]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by [[Abel Ferrara]] and starring [[Zoë Tamerlis Lund]].

Inspired by films such as ''[[Thriller - A Cruel Picture]]'' (1973), ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'' (1974) and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), the film is a [[rape and revenge films|rape and revenge]] story about Thana, a [[Speech disorder|mute]] woman who becomes a [[spree killing|spree killer]] after she is [[rape]]d twice in one day when going home from work. It was critically maligned on its theatrical release, but is now generally highly regarded among fans of [[underground film|underground]]&lt;ref name="Pettersson"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pettersson| first = Ron| title = The Zoë Lund Cinematheque| publisher = Senses of Cinema| date = August 2002| url = http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/22/lund/cteq.html#ms_45| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060920210521/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/22/lund/cteq.html| archivedate = 2006-09-20| accessdate = 2007-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independent film.&lt;ref name=xo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.co.uk/beauty/pretty-in-the-past-zo-lund|title=Pretty in the Past: Zoë Lund|publisher=xojane.co.uk|date=Nov 7, 2012|last=Mott|first=Allan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802075142/http://www.xojane.co.uk/beauty/pretty-in-the-past-zo-lund|archivedate=2014-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was acquired by [[Drafthouse Films|Alamo Drafthouse Films]] in October 2013 and remastered in [[High-definition video|HD]] from the original negatives. The distributor released the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.horror-movies.ca/2014/02/drafthouse-films-unleash-visitor-ms-45-onto-blu-ray-dvd/|title=Drafthouse Films to Unleash The Visitor and Ms. 45 onto Blu-ray &amp; DVD|last=Savage|first=Chris|publisher=''horror-movies.ca''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
While walking home from work, Thana, a mute seamstress in [[New York City]]'s [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]], is raped at gunpoint in an alley by a mysterious, masked attacker. She survives and makes her way back to her apartment, where she encounters a burglar and is raped a second time. Thana, her name an allusion to Greek god of death [[Thanatos]],&lt;ref name=xo/&gt; hits this second assailant with a small sculpture then bludgeons him to death with an iron, and carries his body to the bathtub. She goes to work the next day, and after encountering working with an iron, watching her boss Albert rip a shirt off a mannequin, she goes into [[Acute stress reaction|shock state]], which worries her co-workers. However, when she looks at the trash bin at her office, she decides to dismember the burglar's corpse and throw the parts away in various locations of the city.

After being sent home, she dismembers the burglar's body, then keeps his [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber]] pistol, puts the pieces into plastic garbage bags, and then stores them in her fridge. After cleaning her bathtub, she decides to take a shower, but as she strips, she begins to hallucinate the first attacker in the mirror grabbing her breast. This puts her into shock, and notices that organs and body fluids from the burglar are overflowing in the drain. Her nosy neighbor, an old, recently widowed woman named Mrs. Nasone who is the landlady and owns a small dog named Phil, also starts to notice her odd behavior.

On her walk home from work the next day, Thana is noticed by a leering young man on the street while she is disposing of one of the bagged body parts; thinking that she accidentally dropped the bag, he retrieves it, frightening her. He chases her through the alleys of the city, and fearing another [[sexual assault]], she fatally shoots him when she is cornered by him. The event furthers her impulse for vengeance. While running home from the incident, the landlady Mrs. Nasone notices she ran up the stairs violently and started throwing up. She insists in calling a doctor for Thana, and Mrs. Nasone's dog, Phil, starts to become attracted to her fridge. Thana escorts her out of her apartment while still in shock.

As the limbs start to bring attention towards the media, Albert brings her into his office and notices she hasn't been selling and feeling well lately. He decides to invite her to a [[Halloween party]] that he is throwing for work, and tells her that there will be "many boys there [her] age". She responds to him in writing, saying "I'll try". As Thana's vengeance increases, she starts regularly targeting and killing several men, such as a fashion photographer, a pimp who assaults a prostitute because of debt, several members of a gang, a [[Saudi Arabian]] businessman and his limousine driver, and even drives a recently dumped salesman to suicide after her gun jams.

Her boss, Albert notices her ditching work after going to dinner with her co-workers, resulting in her co-workers having to finish her work. However, she promises to go to the party with him in exchange for staying out of trouble for her absence. Thana notices that Mrs. Nasone's dog, Phil, is attracted to the smell of the burglar's dismembered limbs. Thana takes Phil for a walk then ties him to a post in the park. She leaves a note saying that Phil ran away but will probably find his way back home soon. 

With Albert, Thana attends the costume party dressed as a nun with red lipstick. Meanwhile, Mrs. Nasone enters Thana's apartment and finds the burglar's dismembered head. She jumps to the conclusion that Thana killed her dog, and tells police that she is at a party with her co-workers. At the party, Albert takes Thana upstairs in private and tries to seduce her. In revenge for his borderline-sexual behavior towards her in the past, she shoots him. The party stops and her co-workers run upstairs to Thana, but quickly realize that she is the murderer when she steps out of the room with her pistol. Thana then begins a shooting spree, targeting many of the men present. Her co-worker Laurie picks up the knife from the cake table and stabs Thana in the back. Thana turns around and points the gun at Laurie, but hesitates; she screams in pain, "Sister!" then falls to the ground and dies.

After the party massacre, Mrs. Nasone is seen crying in memorial for her husband and her dog Phil. But outside her apartment door, Phil has returned and is shown running up the stairs and scratching at the door.

==Production==

Many years later Zoë Tamerlis described how minimal the script was, which is uncharacteristic of Ferrara's later films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xojane.co.uk/beauty/pretty-in-the-past-zo-lund|title=Pretty in the Past: Zoë Lund|publisher=xojane.co.uk|date=Nov 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802075142/http://www.xojane.co.uk/beauty/pretty-in-the-past-zo-lund|archivedate=2014-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The film currently holds an 89% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 27 critic reviews, with wide praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ms. 45 (2013)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ms_45/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Home video ==
In 1983, the film was released on [[VHS]] by [[U.S.A. Home Video]] in its uncut form.

''Ms .45'' was released on [[DVD]] in the U.S. on April 25, 2000, by [[Image Entertainment]], but was reedited for DVD release.  The reedit removes less than a minute total.  The cuts include changes to the first rape featuring Ferrara's cameo, which is split by an insert shot from a later scene.  The second rape is more drastically cut, omitting a line "This oughta make you talk, huh?"  The climactic Halloween party shoot-out was also recut to remove an on-screen murder, which now occurs off screen.&lt;ref name="DVDfile"&gt;{{cite web

In 1973, she moved to Rochester to marry Michael Joseph Kress.  They had two sons, and divorced in 1984.  At that time, she went to work at Stanton and Hucko, an advertising agency.
In 1998, she married fellow author [[Charles Sheffield]], who died in 2002 of a [[brain tumor]]. Kress moved back to [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to be near her grown children.&lt;ref name="Home Page" /&gt; She recently (2009) moved to Seattle.&lt;ref name="YearsBestSF"&gt;{{cite book |title=Year's Best SF15 |page=119 |author=David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer | publisher=Eos Books |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011 she married author Jack Skillingstead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nancykress.blogspot.com/2011/02/las-vegas.html|first=Nancy|last=Kress|title=Las Vegas|date=11 February 2011|website=Nancy's Blog|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wesleyan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evens|first1=Arthur|title=The Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction|date=2010|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Kress tends to write technically realistic [[hard science fiction]] stories, often set in a fairly near future.
Her fiction often involves [[genetic engineering]], and, to a lesser degree, [[artificial intelligence]].  There are many technologies shared between stories, including "genemod" to refer to genetic engineering, and foamcast, a lightweight and sturdy building material that appears in many of her novels and short stories. By conducting extensive research she keeps her topics within the realm of possibility; however, as Kress clarified for one [[Locus (magazine)]] interviewer, "[Sheffield] pronounces it ''science'' fiction, and I pronounce it science ''fiction''."&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt; She loves [[ballet]], and has written stories around it.

[[Image:NileMosaicOfPalestrina.jpg|thumb|250px|A detail of the mosaic.]]
[[Image:Mosaïque Praeneste.jpg|thumb|250px|Another detail (Altes Museum, Berlin).]]
The '''Palestrina Mosaic''' or '''Nile mosaic of Palestrina''' is a late [[Hellenistic]] floor [[mosaic]] depicting the [[Nile]] in its passage from the [[Blue Nile]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. The mosaic was part of a Classical sanctuary-grotto in [[Palestrina]], a town east of [[Ancient Rome]], in central Italy. It has a width of 5.85 metres and a height of 4.31 metres and provides a glimpse into the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fascination with [[ancient Egypt]]ian exoticism in the 1st century BC, both as an early manifestation of the role of [[Egypt in the European imagination|Egypt in the Roman imagination]]&lt;ref&gt;Another Nile floor mosaic, in the [[House of the Faun]], [[Pompeii]], is dated by Meyboom 1995, ca 90 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; and an example of the genre of "[[Nilotic landscape]]", with a long iconographic history in Egypt and the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]].

==Description==

The mosaic, with an arch-headed framing that identifies its original location as flooring an [[apse]] in a [[grotto]], features detailed depictions of [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Greeks, [[Aethiopia]]ns in hunting scenes, and various animals of the Nile river.&lt;ref&gt;A Nilotic monster was identified as a "dinosaur" on [http://www.s8int.com/dinolit2.html a website], giving rise to some hopeful Internet speculation on the coexistence of dinosaurs and humans.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest Roman depiction of Nilotic scenes, of which several more were uncovered at [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul G. P. Meyboom, ''The Nile Mosaic of Palestrina: Early Evidence of Egyptian Religion in Italy'', Brill 1995, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus on the dating of the work is slowly emerging. Paul G. P. Meyboom suggests a date shortly before the reign of Sulla (ca. 100 BC) and treats the mosaic as an early evidence for the spread of Egyptian cults in Italy, where [[Isis]] was syncretised with [[Fortuna]]. He believes Nilotic scenes were introduced in Rome by [[Demetrius the Topographer]], a Greek artist from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] active ca. 165 BC. Claire Préaux emphasises the "escapist" nature of the fantastic scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Préaux, "Graeco-Roman Egypt", in J.R. Harris, ed. ''The Legacy of Egypt'', 1971:340f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The Nile Mosaic and its companion piece, the Fish Mosaic, were apparently still to be seen in the Italian city of [[Palestrina]], ancient Praeneste, in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia La Malfa, "Reassessing the Renaissance of the Palestrina Nile Mosaic" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''66''' (2003), pp. 267-272, notes the mosaic's appearance in a manuscript ''De antiquitati Latii'', a description of sites and antiquities in [[Lazio]], by Antonio Volsco, now in the [[British Library]] (Harley Ms 5050); the manuscript is dedicated to Gerolamo Basso Della Rovere, who died in 1507.&lt;/ref&gt; When first noticed shortly before 1507 by Antonio Volsco, a humanist in the circle of [[Pomponio Leto]], the mosaics were still ''in situ'' among the vestiges of [[Sulla]]'s sanctuary of [[Fortuna|Fortuna Primigenia]]. At that time the town was owned by the [[Colonna]] family of Rome, whose palazzo in Palestrina occupied a section of the ruins.

The mosaic may have been indicated in a well-known passage in [[Pliny's Natural History]] concerning mosaic floors in Italy:
{{bquote|Mosaics came into use as early as [[Sulla]]'s régime. At all events there exists even today one made of very small [[tessera]]e which he installed in the temple of Fortune at Palestrina.}}

Volsco added that these were "arranged in the pattern of a picture".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in La Malfa 2003:268.&lt;/ref&gt; Maurizio Calvesi, in identifying Francesco Colonna as the author of ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', identifies passages in ''Hypnerotomachia'' depending on Pliny that were enriched by direct experience of the mosaics themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calvesi|title=Il sogno di Polifilo prenestino|location=Rome|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
In the 17th century, Palestrina passed to the [[Barberini family]], who between 1624 and 1626 removed most of the mosaic from its setting, without recording the overall composition, and, after further movements and damage, put it on exhibition in the [[Palestrina#Main sights|Palazzo Barberini in Palestrina]], where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;Meybloom, 1&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic was restored and repaired on numerous occasions, but careful watercolors of the sections were made for [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]] before the initial restoration in the ''opificio'' of St. Peter's. Helen Whitehouse's rediscovery of the long-lost watercolors enabled a reconstruction of the surviving segments in a more meaningful way &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Helen|last=Whitehouse|title=The Dal Pozzo Copies of the Palestrina Mosaic|location=Oxford|journal=British Archaeological Reports|year=1976}}; Meybloom (p. 6) generally agrees with Whitehouse, except over the placing of one section.  Commons has a selection of images from the Dal Pozzo copies.&lt;/ref&gt; although much remains uncertain about the original composition. The mosaic has been a major feature of the ''Museo Nazionale Prenestino'' in Palazzo Barberini, Palestrina (not the one in Rome) since 1953

The '''Ontario Arts Council''' ('''OAC''') is a publicly funded Canadian organization in the province of [[Ontario]] whose purpose is to promote and assist the development of the arts for the enjoyment and benefit of all Ontarians. Based in [[Toronto]], OAC was founded in 1963 by Ontario's [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] at the time, [[John Robarts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.on.ca/site4.aspx Ontario Arts Council website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030131950/http://www.arts.on.ca/site4.aspx |date=30 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OAC plays a vital role in fostering the stability and growth of Ontario's arts community. An arm's-length agency of the [[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Culture]], OAC offers more than fifty funding programs for Ontario-based artists and arts organizations. Grants provide assistance for a specific activity, support for a period of time, or for ongoing operations. OAC administers the Premier's Awards for Excellence in the Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2015/10/winners-announced-for-premiers-awards-for-excellence-in-the-arts.html|title=Winners Announced for Premier's Awards for Excellence in the Arts|date=12 October 2015|work=News release|publisher=[[Queen's Printer for Ontario]]|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers additional prizes as well as scholarships from private funds, and further supports Ontario's arts community by conducting research and statistical analyses of the arts and culture. OAC staff manage granting programs, while a 12-member volunteer board of directors oversees the fulfilment of the organization's mandate. The board of directors is appointed by the [[Government of Ontario]] for a three-year term (and may be re-appointed for one additional term).

OAC provides grants in three ways:

* Artistic discipline: [[crafts]], dance, theatre, literature; music; [[visual arts|visual]] and [[media arts]].
* Artistic or other activity: arts education; [[community arts]]; touring; residencies; and capacity building/professional development.
* Cultural practice: [[Native American art|Aboriginal Arts]] and [[Franco-Ontarian]] Arts.

'''Pamela Gail Fryman''' (born August 19, 1959) is an [[United States|American]] [[sitcom]] [[television director|director]] and [[Television producer|producer]]. She directed all but twelve episodes of the television series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.

==Early life==
Fryman was born and grew up in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="dga"&gt;{{cite web|title=DGA Quarterly Spring 2010 - Director Profile: Pamela Fryman|url=http://www.dgaquarterly.org/BACKISSUES/Spring2010/DirectorProfilePamelaFryman.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110228160011/http://www.dgaquarterly.org/BACKISSUES/Spring2010/DirectorProfilePamelaFryman.aspx|archivedate=2011-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Fryman got her first job on ''The John Davidson Show'' as an assistant to the talent coordinator, and went on to be a booth production assistant and secretary on ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', eventually moving up to assistant director (AD), and director.&lt;ref name="dga" /&gt; In 1993, producer [[Peter Noah]], with whom she had worked on the game show ''[[Dream House (game show)|Dream House]]'', gave Fryman a chance to direct an episode of the short-lived sitcom ''[[Café Americain]]''. These would be the first stepping stones toward a long and successful career.&lt;ref name="dga"/&gt;

Before her directing career blossomed, Fryman pursued stage directing. On the set of ''[[Frasier]]'', rehearsal resembled a play staging, which is exactly what creator and executive producer [[David Lee (screenwriter)|David Lee]] had in mind when he hired her.&lt;ref name="DGA - January 1999"&gt;{{cite web|title=DGA Magazine January 1999 - Fraiser|url=http://stage.dga.org/news/mag_archives/v23-5/v23-5.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fryman directed 34 episodes of the show from seasons four through eight.

Fryman directed the majority of the episodes of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
| title = Neil Patrick Harris Directs Episode of 'How I Met Your Mother' Airing 1/18

| accessdate = 2010-01-30 
}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; Show creator [[Craig Thomas (screenwriter)|Craig Thomas]] praised her communication skills, saying, "She makes everyone feel they've been heard and respected and she can connect with anyone."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news 
| date = October 19, 2008

| newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] 
| pages = 3
}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
Though Fryman's original career plan did not include directing (she figured she would "follow in her father's footsteps in merchandising"),&lt;ref name="dga"/&gt; she has grown to realize that directing is her forte and passion. In [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] magazine, Fryman said that continuing to direct ''How I Met Your Mother'' is her fantasy realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she officiated the wedding of ''How I Met Your Mother'' co-star [[Neil Patrick Harris]] and [[David Burtka]], who played a side role in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/article/neil-patrick-harris-marries-david-burtka/|title=Neil Patrick Harris Marries David Burtka|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8012">A '''procedural drama''' is a [[genre]] of [[television program]]ming which focuses on how crimes are solved or some other aspect of a law enforcement agency, legislative body, or court of law.  Some dramas include a lab or conference room with high-tech or state-of-the-art equipment where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not require the viewer to have seen previous [[episode]]s. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced and resolved within the same episode.
 
The procedural format is popular around the world.&lt;ref name="dl062711"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Adler | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/why-tv-procedurals-also-rule-the-world/ | title = Why TV Procedurals Also Rule The World | date = June 27, 2011 | accessdate = June 27, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, "The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure."&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt; Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | author = Gerard Gilbert | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/american-law--british-order-1626849.html | title = American law... British order | date = 2009-02-20 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, procedural dramas can usually be re-run with little concern for episode order.&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt;

Procedurals are often criticized for being [[Wiktionary:formulaic|formulaic]].&lt;ref name="formulaic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="formulaover"&gt;{{cite news | author = James Hibberd | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5160IN20090207 | title = Networks' new pilots favor formula over experiment | date = 2009-02-06 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedurals are also generally less character-driven than serialized shows. However, some procedurals have more character emphasis than is typical of the format.&lt;ref name="duelling"&gt;{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/duelling-sleuths/2006/08/08/1154802894078.html | title = Duelling sleuths | date = 2006-08-10 | work = [[The Age]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nomystery"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill Carter | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/arts/television/17ncis.html?_r=1 | title = No Mystery: Ratings Heat Up for ‘NCIS’ | date = 2008-11-16 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may occasionally feature a storyline stretching over several episodes (often called a [[story arc]]).&lt;ref name="changes"&gt;{{cite news | author = Jason Hughes | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/09/23/what-if-house-stopped-being-a-procedural/ | title = What if House stopped being a procedural? | date = 2009-09-23 | work = [[TVSquad]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular variant is the [[police procedural]].

In [[Serial (literature)|serial fiction]], a '''reboot''' is a new start in an established [[fictional universe]], work, or series that [[retcon|discards]] all [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in order to recreate its characters, [[plotline]]s and backstory from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Willits"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willits|first1=Thomas R.|title=To Reboot Or Not To Reboot: What is the Solution?|url=http://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue344/reboot1.html|website=Bewildering Stories|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parfitt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parfitt|first1=Orlando|title=Top 12 Forthcoming Franchise Reboots|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/25/top-12-forthcoming-franchise-reboots|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a way to "rebrand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Julia |title=The Matrix reboot isn’t a remake: Here’s the difference between the two |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/15/14935390/the-matrix-reboot-remake |website=[[Polygon.com|Polygon]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "restart an entertainment universe that has already been established".&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt; Another definition is a [[remake]] which is part of an established [[film series]] or other [[media franchise]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The term has been criticised for being a vague and "confusing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hollywood's 10 Best Reboots |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/22/hollywoods-10-best-reboots |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[buzzword]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peters |first1=Ian |author2=''et al'' |title=Reboots, Remakes, and Adaptations |url=http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/imr/2012/08/06/reboots-remakes-and-adaptations |website=[[MediaCommons|In media res]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |language=en |date=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[neologism]] for remake,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Child |first1=Ben |title=Don't call it a reboot: how 'remake' became a dirty word in Hollywood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/24/film-industry-remakes-hollywood-movies |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |language=en |date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Patches |first1=Matt |title=The Reboot Glossary: Which Hollywood Buzzword Fits the Bill? |url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/the-reboot-glossary-which-hollywood-buzzword-fits-the-bill-57239239/ |website=[[Hollywood.com]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept which has been losing popularity in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Faughnder |first1=Ryan |title=Hollywood's summer problem?

==Origin==
The term is thought to originate from the computing term ''[[reboot]]'', meaning to restart a computer system.&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt;

==Types==
Reboots cut out non-essential elements associated with a pre-established franchise and start it anew, distilling it down to the core elements that made the source material popular.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norris|first1=Erik|title=Why Franchise Reboots Can Be A Good Thing|url=http://www.mandatory.com/fun/456007-why-franchise-reboots-can-be-a-good-thing|website=Mandatory|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|accessdate=June 6, 2018|date=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For audiences, reboots allow easier entry for newcomers unfamiliar with earlier titles in a series.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

===Comic books===
In comic books, a long-running title may have its continuity erased in order to start over from the beginning, enabling writers to redefine characters and open up new story opportunities, and allowing the title to bring in new readers.&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lorendiac|title=Lorendiac’s Lists: The DC Reboots Since Crisis on Infinite Earths|url=http://www.cbr.com/lorendiacs-lists-the-dc-reboots-since-crisis-on-infinite-earths|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic books sometimes use an [[Fictional universe|in-universe]] explanation for a reboot, such as merging parallel worlds and timelines together, or destroying a fictional universe and recreating it from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #1-12 (April 1985 – March 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flashpoint"&gt;''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' #1-5 (May – September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'' #4-0 (Sept. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
With reboots, filmmakers revamp and reinvigorate a film series in order to attract new fans and stimulate revenue.&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt; A reboot can renew interest in a series that has grown stale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vasquez |first1=Zach |title=Beyond the grave: what's next for the horror reboot? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/halloween-horror-reboots-upcoming-pet-sematary-it |accessdate=October 25, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reboots act as a safe project for a studio, as a reboot with an established fanbase is less risky (in terms of expected profit) than an entirely original work, while at the same time allowing the studio to explore new demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billington|first1=Alex|title=Sunday Discussion: The Mighty Hollywood Reboot Trend|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/sunday-discussion-the-mighty-hollywood-reboot-trend/|website=FirstShowing.net|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reboots also allow directors and producers to cast a new set of younger actors for the familiar roles of a film series in order to attract a younger audience.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Unlike a remake, however, a reboot often presupposes a working familiarity on the part of the audience with the original work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Television===
{{See also|Revival (television)}}
In television, a reboot of a TV show can be a return to production after cancellation and a long hiatus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Francis |first1=James Jr. |title=Why did the television reboot become all the rage? |url=https://theconversation.com/why-did-the-television-reboot-become-all-the-rage-96179 |website=[[The Conversation]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |language=en |date=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Husser |first1=Amy |title=Reboot overload?

===Video games===
Reboots are common in the video game industry, particularly with franchises that have multiple entries in the series.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt; Reboots in video games are used to refresh the storyline and elements of the game.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
A '''retrospective''' (from [[Latin]] ''retrospectare'', "look back"), generally, is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past. As a noun, ''retrospective'' has specific meanings in medicine, software development, popular culture and the arts. It is applied as an adjective, synonymous with the term ''[[wikt:retroactive|retroactive]]'', to laws, standards, and awards.

==Medicine==
A [[Medicine|medical]] retrospective is an examination of a patient's [[medical history]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].

==Arts and popular culture==
A retrospective exhibition presents works from an extended period of an artist's activity. Similarly, a retrospective [[compilation album]] is assembled from a recording artist's past material, usually their [[greatest hits]]. A television or newsstand special about an actor, politician, or other celebrity will present a retrospective of the subject's career highlights. A leading (usually elderly) academic may be honored with a [[Festschrift]], an honorary book of articles or a lecture series relating topically to a retrospective of the honoree's career. Celebrity [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]] good-naturedly mock the career of the guest of honor, often in a retrospective format.

==Awards==
A retrospective or retroactive award is one which is created and then awarded to persons who would have received it before. Alternatively, a slight change to the criteria of an existing award may result in retrospective awards being presented to persons who would have won the award under present rules. Comparatively few awards are presented retrospectively.

==Law==
The term is used in situations where the law (statutory, civil, or regulatory) is changed or reinterpreted, affecting acts committed before the alteration. When such changes make a previously committed lawful act now unlawful in a retroactive manner, this is known as an [[Ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' law]] or [[retroactive law]]. Because such laws punish the accused for acts that were not unlawful when committed, they are rare, and not permissible in most legal systems. More commonly, changes retroactively worsen the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; by changing the punishment or recompense prescribed, as by adding new penalties, extending sentences, or increasing fines and damages payable; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make exoneration more difficult than it would have been.

Conversely, a form of retrospective law commonly called an [[amnesty law]] may decriminalize certain acts. A [[pardon]] has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. An ''[[in mitius]]'' change may alleviate possible consequences for unlawful acts (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Finally, when a previous law is [[repeal]]ed or otherwise nullified, it is no longer applicable to situations to which it had been, even if such situations arose before the law was voided; this principle is known as ''[[nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]''.

==Software development==
{{refsection|date=April 2017}}
The term is also used in [[software engineering]], where a retrospective is a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project or process (often after an [[Iterative and incremental development|iteration]]) to discuss what was successful about the project or time period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the successes and improvements in future iterations or projects. Retrospective can be done in many different ways.

In [[Agile software development|agile development]], retrospectives play a very important role in iterative and incremental development. At the end of every iteration a retrospective is held to look for ways to improve the process for the next iteration. [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]] call this the Sprint Retrospective.

==Standards==
In the context of scientific and technical standards, retrospectivity applies current norms to material that pre-dates new rules. An example of a retrospective or retroactive standard is the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN Code), a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] which governs the formal [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific naming]] of [[animal]]s, of which the 4th edition is effective since 2000. All previous editions of the ICZN Code, or previous other rules and conventions are disregarded today,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 86.3]&lt;/ref&gt; and the scientific names published in former times are to be evaluated only under the present edition of the ICZN Code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12885">[[File:Charles Robert Cockerell.jpg|thumb|English architect [[Charles Robert Cockerell]] was the first recipient of the Royal Gold Medal in 1848.]]
The '''Royal Gold Medal''' for [[architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ar/a/a7/RoyalGoldMedal%28c%29RIBA_261x347.jpg RIBA Royal Gold Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; is awarded annually by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] on behalf of the [[British monarch]], in recognition of an individual's or group's substantial contribution to international architecture. It is given for a distinguished body of work rather than for one building, and is therefore not awarded for merely being currently fashionable.

The medal was first awarded in 1848 to [[Charles Robert Cockerell]], and its winners include some of the most influential architects of the 19th and 20th centuries, including [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] (1864), [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] (1941), [[Le Corbusier]] (1953), [[Walter Gropius]] (1956), [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1959) and [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1968). Already with the second recipient, the Italian [[Luigi Canina]] in 1849, the award went international.

Not all recipients were architects. Also recognised were [[engineer]]s such as [[Ove Arup]] (1966) and [[Peter Rice]] (1992) who undoubtedly played an outstanding role in the realisation of some of the 20th century's key buildings all over the world. Repeatedly, the prize was awarded to influential writers on architecture, including [[scholars]] such as the Rev [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]] (1862), Sir [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] (1967) and Sir [[John Summerson]] (1976) as well as [[theory|theoreticians]] such as [[Lewis Mumford]] (1961) and [[Colin Rowe]] (1995). It honoured archaeologists such as Sir [[Austen Henry Layard]] (1868), [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] (1869), [[Charles-Jean-Melchior de Vogüé|Melchior de Vogüé]] (1879), [[Heinrich Schliemann]] (1885), [[Rodolfo Lanciani]] (1900) and Sir [[Arthur Evans]] (1909), and [[Painting|painters]] such as [[Lord Leighton]] (1894) and Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] (1906). Another notable exception was the 1999 award to the city of [[Barcelona]].

[[File:NYC Grand Central Terminal ceiling.jpg|thumb|The [[constellation]] mural at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]] is an example of skyscape art.]]
'''Skyscape art''' depicts representations of the [[sky]], especially in a [[painting]] or [[photograph]]. Skyscapes differ from [[cloudscape (art)|cloudscape]]s because they do not necessarily include [[cloud]]s. Like cloudscape art, skyscape art can also omit any view of land or anything else which might help to suggest scale or orientation. Images called "skyscapes" often do include clouds or land, but these things can also be excluded or kept to a minimum.

The view may be from earth or from a level far above. There is often nothing to suggest scale in the art, unless a bit of [[landscape]] is included or some phenomena such as the depiction of clouds, precipitation, [[rainbow]]s and [[aurorae]]. Some [[artist]]s also depict [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s and other flying objects, as well as manmade [[aircraft]], [[kite]]s and objects such as [[leaves]], and [[balloon]]s.

There are many examples of cloudless skies in painting, [[printmaking]], [[serigraphy]] and photography. 

[[Weather]] is often an important element in the composition of skyscapes.

The sky is really nothing more than the denser gaseous zone of the earth’s [[atmosphere]]. Sky can be depicted as many different [[color]]s, such as a pale [[blue]] or the lack of any color at all, such as the [[night]] sky, which has the appearance of blackness, albeit with a scattering of [[star]]s on a clear night. During the day, the sky is seen as a deep blue due to the [[sunlight]] reflected on the [[air]].

Astronomically speaking, the sky is a celestial sphere–an imaginary dome divided into constellations–where the [[moon]], [[planet]]s, stars and [[sun]] seem to visually move across the sky.

Although artists have long painted the sky it was [[Edward Hopper]] who first showed us the beauty of the skyscape, sans clouds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the 1950s, [[Eric Sloane]] painted many cloudless skyscapes during his stay in [[Taos, New Mexico]].

Another example of a cloudless skyscape artwork is the celestial ceiling [[mural]] at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]].

A '''sound editor'''  is a creative professional responsible for selecting and assembling [[sound recordings]] in preparation for the final [[Audio mixing (film and television)|sound mixing]] or [[Audio mastering|mastering]] of a television program, motion picture, video game, or any production involving [[recorded sound|recorded]] or [[sound synthesis|synthetic]] sound.  Sound editing developed out of the need to fix the incomplete, undramatic, or technically inferior sound recordings of early [[talkies]], and over the decades has become a respected filmmaking [[craft]], with sound editors implementing the aesthetic goals of [[Sound design#Film|motion picture sound design]].

The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognizes the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing with the [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]].

There are primarily three divisions of sound that are combined to create a final mix, these being dialogue, effects, and music.  In larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles, sound editors often specialize in only one of these areas, thus a show will have separate dialogue, effects, and music editors.  In smaller markets, sound editors are expected to know how to handle it all, often crossing over into the mixing realm as well.  Editing effects is likened to creating the sonic world from scratch, while dialogue editing is likened to taking the existing sonic world and fixing it.  Dialogue editing is more accurately thought of as "production sound editing", where the editor takes the original sound recorded on the set, and using a variety of techniques, makes the dialogue more understandable, as well as smoother, so the listener doesn't hear the transitions from shot to shot (often the background sounds underneath the words change dramatically from take to take).  Among the challenges that effects editors face are creatively adding together various elements to create believable sounds for everything you see on screen, as well as memorizing their sound effects library.

==Equipment==

The essential piece of equipment used in modern sound editing is the [[digital audio workstation]], or DAW.  A DAW allows sounds, stored as computer files on a host computer, to be placed in timed synchronization with a motion picture, mixed, manipulated, and documented.  The standard DAW system in use by the [[American film industry]], as of 2012, is [[Avid Technology|Avid]]'s [[Pro Tools]], with the majority running on [[Apple Computer|Mac]]s.  Another system in use presently is [[Yamaha]] owned [[Steinberg]]'s cross platform DAW [[Nuendo]] running on [[Apple Computer|Mac]]s using [[operating system]] [[Mac OS X]] but also on [[Windows XP]]. Other systems historically used for sound editing were:
* [[WaveFrame]], manufactured by [[WaveFrame (company)|WaveFrame]] of [[Emeryville]], [[California|CA]]
* Several DAWs have been manufactured by [[Fairlight (company)|Fairlight]]
* [[SonicSolutions]]
* [[AMS-Neve]] Audiofile
* AudioVision manufactured by Avid

The WaveFrame, Fairlights, and Audiofile were of the "integrated" variety of DAW, and required the purchase of expensive proprietary hardware and specialized computers (not standard PCs or Macs).  Of the two surviving systems, Pro Tools still requires some proprietary hardware (either a low cost portable device such as the "Mbox" or the more expensive multichannel A/D,D/A converters for more professional high end applications), while Nuendo (a successor to [[Cubase]]) is of the "host based" variety.

==Sound-effects library==
Sound-effects editors typically use an organized catalog of sound recordings from which sound effects can be easily accessed and used in film soundtracks. There are several commercially distributed sound-effects libraries available, the two most well-known publishers being [[Sound Ideas]] and The Hollywood Edge. Online search engines, such as [[Sounddogs]], A Sound Effect and Sonniss allow users to purchase sound effects libraries from a large online database.

Many sound effects editors make their own customized sound recordings which are accumulated into highly prized personal sound effects libraries. Often, sound effects used in films will be saved and reused in subsequent films. One exemplary case in point is a recording known as the "[[Wilhelm Scream]]" which has become known for its repeated use in many famous films such as ''[[The Charge at Feather River]]'' (1953), Pierre Marette Story (1957), ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992). Credited with naming and popularizing this particular recording is sound designer [[Ben Burtt]].

==History==

===Early talkies===
The first sound process to substantially displace [[silent film]]s in the moviegoing market was the [[Vitaphone]] process.  Under the Vitaphone process, a [[microphone]] recorded the sound performed on set directly to a [[phonograph]] master, which made Vitaphone recordings impossible to cut or resynchronize, as later processes would allow. This limited the Vitaphone process to capturing musical acts or one-take action scenes, like [[Vaudeville]] routines or other re-creations of stage performances; essentially, scenes that required no editing at all. However, [[Warner Brothers]], even as early as ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'', began experimenting with the mixing of multiple phonograph recordings and intercutting between the "master" sync take and coverage of other angles. The original mixing console used to make the master recording of ''The Jazz Singer'', still viewable in the Warner Bros. Studio Museum, has no more than four or five knobs, but each is still visibly labeled with the basic "groups" that a modern [[sound designer]] would recognize: "music", "crowd", and so on.

Warner Bros. developed increasingly sophisticated technology to sequence greater numbers of phonograph sound effects to picture using the Vitaphone system, but these were rendered obsolete with the widespread adoption of [[sound-on-film]] processes in the early 1930s.

===Mechanical editing===
In a sound-on-film process, a microphone captures sound and converts it into a signal that can be photographed on film.  Since the recording is imposed linearly on the medium, and the medium is easily cut and glued, sounds recorded can be easily re-sequenced and separated onto separate tracks, allowing more control in mixing.  Options expanded further when optical sound recording processes were replaced with magnetic recording in the 1950s. Magnetic recording offered a better [[signal-to-noise ratio]], allowing more tracks to be played simultaneously without increasing noise on the full mix.

The greater number of options available to the editors led to more complex and creative sound tracks, and it was in this period that a set of standard practices became established which continued until the [[Digital data|digital]] era, and many of the notional concepts are still at the core of sound design, computerized or not:

* Sounds are assembled together onto '''tracks'''.  Many tracks are mixed together (or "dubbed together") to create a final film.
* A track will generally contain only one "type" or '''group''' of sound.  A track that contains dialogue only contains dialogue, a track that contains music should only contain music.  Many tracks may carry all the sound for one group.
* Tracks may be mixed a group at a time, in a process called '''predubbing'''.  All of the tracks containing dialogue may be mixed at one time, and all of the tracks containing [[Foley artist|foley]] may be mixed at another time.  In the process of predubbing, many tracks can be mixed into one.
* Predubs are mixed together to create a '''final dub'''.  On the occasion of the final dub, final decisions about the balance between different groups of sounds are made.

Historically the '''Dubbing Mixer''' (UK) or '''Re-Recording Mixer''' (US) was the specialist who mixed all the audio tracks supplied by the Dubbing Editor (with the addition of 'live sounds' such as Foley) in a special Dubbing Suite. As well as mixing, he would introduce equalization, compression and filtered sound effects, etc. while seated at a large console.  Often two or three mixers would sit alongside, each controlling sections of audio, e.g., dialogue, music, effects.

In the era of optical sound tracks, it was difficult to mix more than eight tracks at once without accumulating excessive [[noise]].  At the height of magnetic recording, 200 tracks or more could be mixed together, aided by [[Dolby]] noise reduction.  In the digital era there is no limit. For example, a single predub can exceed a hundred tracks, and the final dub can be the sum of a thousand tracks.

=== Digital sound ===
The mechanical system of sound editing remained unchanged until the early 1990s, when [[digital audio workstation]]s acquired features sufficient for use in film production, mainly, the ability to synchronize with picture, and the ability to play back many tracks at once with CD-quality [[fidelity]].  The quality of 16-bit audio at a 48&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sampling rate]] allowed hundreds of tracks to be mixed together
with negligible noise.

The physical manifestation of the work became computerized: sound recordings, and the decisions the editors made in assembling them, were now digitized, and could be versioned, done, undone, and archived instantly and compactly.  In the magnetic recording era, sound editors owned trucks to ship their tracks to a mixing stage, and transfers to magnetic film were measured in hundreds of thousands of feet.  Once the materials arrived at the stage, a dozen recordists and mix technicians required a half an hour to load the three or four dozen tracks a predub might require.  In the digital era, 250 hours of stereo sound, edited and ready to mix, can be transported on a single 160 GB [[hard drive]].  As well, this 250 hours of material can be copied in four hours or less, as opposed to the old system, which, predictably, would take 250 hours.

Because of these innovations, sound editors, as of 2005, face the same issues as other computerized, "knowledge-based" professionals, including the loss of work due to outsourcing to cheaper labor markets, and the loss of royalties due to ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights.

===Animation sound editing===
In the field of animation, traditionally the sound editors have been given the more prestigious title of "film editor" in screen credits. As animated films are more often than not planned to the frame, the traditional functions of a film editor are often unnecessary. [[Treg Brown]] is known to cartoon fans as the sound effects genius of [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. Other greats of the field have included [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] of the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]], Greg Watson and Don Douglas at [[Hanna-Barbera]], and Joe Siracusa of [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and various TV cartoon studios.

== Other fields ==
In the production of [[radio programming|radio program]]s and music, persons who manipulate sound recordings are known simply as "editors", in cases where the producers themselves do not perform the task.

A '''stamp catalog''' (or '''stamp catalogue''') is a catalog of [[postage stamp]] types with descriptions and prices.

The stamp catalog is an essential tool of [[philately]] and [[stamp collecting]]. Stamp catalogs are part of [[philatelic literature]].

== History ==
The first stamp catalog was published in France by [[Oscar Berger-Levrault]] on 17 September 1861 and the first illustrated catalog by [[Alfred Potiquet]] in December 1861 (based on the earlier work).

The first catalogs in Great Britain were published in 1862 by [[Frederick Booty]],&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Phillips, Stanley. ''Stamp Collecting: A guide to modern philately'', revised edition, Stanley Gibbons, London, 1983, p.243. {{ISBN|0-85259-047-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Brown (philatelist)|Mount Brown]],&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt; and Dr. [[John Edward Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5YDAAAAQAAJ&amp;ots=fXq6jrKBT0&amp;dq=A%20hand%20catalogue%20of%20postage%20stamps&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  John Edward Gray, ''A hand catalogue of postage stamps for the use of collectors,'' London, Robert Hardwicke, 1862]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Early Postage Stamp Catalogs" by George B. Sloane in ''Stamps'', 13 July 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the United States was ''The Stamp Collector's Manual'' by A.C. Kline (a pseudonym for John William Kline), also 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Trenchard and George T. Turner, "John William Kline America's First Philatelic Author", in ''Philatelic Literature Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 24-41, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally catalogs were just [[Stamp dealer|dealer]]s' price lists, though today that is less common.  The catalogs of some major publishers continue to serve as an official price list for the publisher.  For example, Stanley Gibbons in the United Kingdom specifically states in the catalog that the price listed is the estimated selling price by Stanley Gibbons Ltd.  On the other had, Scott in the United States does not sell stamps.  Rather, the Scott catalog serves as a reference document for expected prices used by buyers and sellers.  Over time, as [[philately]] developed, catalogs tended to accumulate additional supporting details about the stamps, such as dates of issue, color variations, and so forth. As their use by collectors became widespread, the catalogs came to define what was and was not a legitimate stamp, since many collectors would avoid stamps not described in the catalog. In recent years, the [[Internet]] has become a common resource for information about stamps. Some catalogs have an on-line version while others are available only on-line.

== Current catalogs ==
The following catalogs have a worldwide coverage:
*[[Michel catalog|Michel]] - printed, software and online
*[[Scott catalog|Scott]] - printed, pdf-format and online
*[[Stanley Gibbons#Stamp catalogues|Stanley Gibbons]] - printed and online
*[[Yvert et Tellier]] - printed only

These are large undertakings, since there are thousands of new stamps to describe each year, and the prices of all stamps may go up or down. For publishers that are not dealers, the prices are estimated by data from dealers and auctions.

In addition, the catalog publishers usually put out specialized volumes with additional details, generally by nationality: Michel has a specialized German catalog, Scott a specialized US catalog, and so forth.

Many countries have their own "national catalogs", typically put out by a leading publisher or dealer in that country. Postal administrations may themselves put out catalogs, although they tend to be aimed at less-experienced collectors, and rarely provide fully detailed stamp data. Some notable country catalogs include:

*ABDA (Philippines)
*Aerophil (Switzerland)
*[[AFA catalog|AFA]] (Denmark)
*AFINSA (Portugal)
*Brusden-White (Australia)
*Edifil catalogs (Spain and its former colonies)
*[[Facit catalog|Facit]] (all countries of Scandinavia)
*[[Fischer catalog|Fischer]] (Poland)
*Hellas (Greece)
*Hibernian Catalogue and Handbook (Ireland)
*[[JB Catalogue]] of Malta Stamps and Postal History (Malta)
*[[Lamy (and Rinck)|Lamy]] (Peru)
*Ma catalog (China)

{{Update|date=September 2012}}
'''''Strickland v. Sony''''' was a court case whose central focus was on whether violent video games played a role in Devin Moore's [[murder|first-degree murder/shooting]] of three people in a police station. In August 2005, former attorney [[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]] filed the lawsuit against [[Sony]].

==History==
Devin Moore was convicted in 2005 for the 2003 shooting of two police officers and a dispatcher as he was being detained for allegedly stealing a car. He grabbed one officer's .45 caliber pistol and killed all three before fleeing the station in a police cruiser he stole from the station. He was eventually caught and sentenced to death by lethal injection.

In March 2005, Thompson announced he was filing a lawsuit on behalf of the families of two of the three victims in [[Fayette, Alabama]]. He was also featured in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' special on the case.&lt;ref name="60minutes"&gt;Bradley, Ed. "[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/04/60minutes/main678261.shtml Can A Video Game Lead To Murder?]". ''[[60 Minutes]]'', 2006-03-05&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2007, the third victim's family later joined the lawsuit.

On November 1, 2005, Thompson sent an email to various websites commenting on the opening day of the civil trial. In it, he compared [[Sony]] and [[Take-Two Interactive]]'s sale of the ''Grand Theft Auto'' video game to [[Imperial Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] during [[World War II]]. According to Thompson, certain [[regional government]]s in Japan had prevented the sale of the ''Grand Theft Auto'' games to minors, though Sony continued to sell the game where its sale was not restricted in Japan and abroad ([[Microsoft]] is doing the same for its own video game console). Thompson also compared the distribution of violent games to the distribution of pornography.&lt;ref name="Pearl Harbor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/game-lawyer-compares-sony-pearl-harbor |title=Game Lawyer Compares Sony to 'Pearl Harbor' - Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=2005-11-02 |accessdate=2011-06-16 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2005, [[Blank Rome]] submitted a motion to have Thompson removed from the case, stating that Thompson would "turn the courtroom into a circus."&lt;ref name="standing"&gt;DeWitt, Robert. [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051104/NEWS/511040354/1007 Lawyer pushes to have standing in video game lawsuit]. ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'', 2005-11-04&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2005, Thompson withdrew from the case, stating, "It was my idea [to leave the case]." He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore; however, Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his right to practice law in Alabama ''(using [[Pro hac vice|Pro Hac Vice]])'', following accusations that he violated legal ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/126359.html |title=gamepolitics: BREAKING NEWS: GTA Lawsuit Will Proceed Minus Jack Thompson |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bow"&gt;DeWitt, Robert. "[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051108/NEWS/511080361/1007 Attorney in Fayette case bows out]" ''Tuscaloosa News'' 2005-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before leaving the case, Thompson filed a motion with the court, quoting noted designer [[Warren Spector]] (''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', ''[[Thief (computer game series)|Thief]]'') as being critical of Rockstar's actions, taken from a speech Spector gave at the [[Montreal]] International Game Summit. He even implied that Spector could be served a [[subpoena]] to testify, even though the court's jurisdiction did not extend to Spector's place of residence. On November 9, 2005, Spector lashed out at Thompson for taking his comments out of context, saying "Take two or three things, from different contexts, mash them together and you can mislead people pretty dramatically." &lt;ref name="clarification"&gt;Feldman, Curt. "[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6139443.html Warren Spector clarifies GTA critique]". ''[[GameSpot]]'', 2005-11-09&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devin Moore ===
{{main|Devin Moore}}

Devin Moore was apprehended several hours after the shootings in Mississippi. According to the [[Associated Press]], after his recapture he said, "Life is a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime." Once in custody, Moore quickly confessed. He told detectives that he shot the men because he didn't want to go to jail.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Kevin and Fiorillo, Juré. ''True Stories of Law &amp; Order: SVU''. 2007: Berkley/Penguin, page 139. ({{ISBN|0425217353}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore faced trial in 2005 and pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Tony |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/11/gta_not_guilty/ |title='Grand Theft Auto' cop killer found guilty |publisher=The Register |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial judge barred the defense from introducing evidence to the jury that ''Grand Theft Auto'' incited Moore's shooting spree. Moore's attorney, Jim Standridge, contended that Moore was suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] at the time of the crimes. Standridge argued that Moore had been emotionally and physically abused by his father as a child.&lt;ref&gt;'Dwyer, Kevin and Fiorillo, Juré. ''True Stories of Law &amp; Order: SVU''. 2007: Berkley/Penguin, page 139. ({{ISBN|0425217353}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Moore was convicted as charged. On October 9, 2005, he was sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]]. Jim Standridge appealed the case. On February 17, 2012, the [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld Moore's conviction in a 5-0 decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beyerle |first=Dana |url=http://www.gadsdentimes.com/article/20120217/news/120219821 |title='Grand Theft Auto' killer's sentence upheld |publisher=The Gadsden Times |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case will automatically be appealed to the [[Alabama Supreme Court]], and can then be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

==Alabama license revoked==
On November 18, 2005, Judge Moore rejected Thompson's request to withdraw, and instead revoked his ''[[Pro hac vice|Pro Hac Vice]]'' admission (a temporary license to practice in a given jurisdiction), in an 18-page decision. Thompson responded with a letter to [[Alabama]]'s Judicial Inquiry Commission, questioning Judge Moore's ethics and accusing him of violating the first 3 [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050529061436/http://www.alalinc.net/jic/docs/cans2000.pdf Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/134653.html |title=gamepolitics: BREAKING: Jack Thompson Thrown off Alabama Case by Judge |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toss"&gt;Sinclair, Brendan. [http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140117.html Alabama judge tosses Thompson]. GameSpot, 2005-11-18&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson also claimed the judge had "absolutely no authority" in preventing him from withdrawing from the case, and so therefore the court's decision to kick him off the case was a "legal nullity". He accused the court of punishing him for "aggressively telling the truth" while it "looked the other way when [[Blank Rome]] elegantly told those lies."&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;Feldman, Curt. [http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140202.html Jack Thompson huffs, puffs, provokes]. GameSpot, 2005-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Moore has also referred this matter to the [[Alabama State Bar]] for "appropriate action" remarking among other things: "Mr. Thompson's actions before this Court suggest that he is unable to conduct himself in a manner befitting practice in this state." &lt;ref name="revoke"&gt;Steel, Wade. [http://ps2.ign.com/articles/668/668345p1.html Jack Thompson's Alabama License Revoked]. [[IGN]], 2005-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 2005, Thompson claimed that "We had heard going into this civil case, before it was even filed, that a particular Western Alabama lawyer had to be part of our litigation team or Judge Moore would not give us a fair hearing. This lawyer himself claims, openly, that 'Judge Moore will not allow you to survive summary judgment if I am not on the case.' For too long we have heard swirling around this Judge allegations of improper influence." (sic) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/137095.html |title=gamepolitics: Jack Thompson vs. The World, Alphabetically |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson alluded that the "fixer" was local lawyer Clatus Junkin, although Junkin denied he had any influence over any judges, or that he had made such a comment, as he was "not that dumb [...] or foolish enough to imply that [he] could [influence Judge Moore]." He also declined Thompson's request to join the plaintiffs' team, citing disagreements over Thompson's demands of complete control of any contact with the news media. Judge Moore noted that even though he had banned comments on the case outside the courtroom, Thompson had issued 7 different communications between the start of the case and the day he revoked Thompson's ''Pro Hac Vice''.&lt;ref name=thompsonRevoked&gt;DeWitt, Robert "[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/NEWS/511220348/1007 Judge stands by Fayette decision]". ''Tuscaloosa News'', November 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; After being thrown off the case, Thompson requested that Judge Moore [[recuse]] himself from the case. Moore ignored him, stating "I can’t consider it because he’s no longer practicing in the state of Alabama. If some other lawyer in the case asks me to recuse myself, I’ll consider it in court."&lt;ref name="recusal request"&gt;DeWitt, Robert [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051206/NEWS/512060349&amp;SearchID=73243282680461 Fayette judge will hear video game case]. ''Tuscaloosa News'', 2005-12-06; accessed 2006-05-01&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2005, Thompson announced that he will be "assisting plaintiffs’ counsel during the discovery process and in the courtroom at trial" when the civil trial begins in 2006 (the judge ruled on both Thompson's dismissal from the case, and dismissal of the case itself, during pretrial hearings). He also claimed he "will likely be a witness in the case." Although he gave no details as to what he would be a witness to, except that he claimed he had "warned, in writing," Take-Two and Rockstar Games "that murders such as those in Alabama would occur by teens who had rehearsed the murders on their virtual reality killing simulators." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/gamepolitics/157172.html?thread=8478452#t8478452 |title=gamepolitics: Hot Coffee Scandal Named to List of Worst P.R. Blunders |publisher=Livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted though, that Judge Moore forbade Thompson from "[communicating] with the court or the judge" or he "would be held in contempt of court." &lt;ref name=thompsonDenied&gt;DeWitt, Robert "[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051119/NEWS/511190331/1007 Judge denies attorney’s request to withdraw from Devin Moore case]". ''Tuscaloosa News'', November 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While that order was appealed, it has not yet{{when|date=August 2015}} been ruled on.

On February 16, 2006, Thompson sent a letter to the Alabama Bar, accusing Judge Moore of breaking the bar rules by publicly disclosing that he had filed a complaint about Thompson with the Alabama Bar. He accused Judge Moore of denying Devin Moore a fair trial, and claimed the FBI was investigating the Florida Bar's "disciplinary process". Thompson gave the Alabama Bar until "five o’clock p.m., Eastern time, February 17, 2006" to drop the complaint, or else he would file a "federal lawsuit in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida on Monday, February 20, 2006." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/208673.html?thread=14563617#t14563617 |title=gamepolitics: GameCloud Interview with Creator of Jack Thompson-inspired Game |publisher=Gamepolitics.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alabama State Bar rules state that a court official who revokes Pro Hac Vice due to conduct must refer the matter to the Bar for review, and the Bar decides if an investigation is needed. No complaint is required to open an investigation.

Thompson's deadline of February 17 passed, without action from either party.

On February 22, 2006, Thompson followed up with another letter, announcing that he had filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar, for investigating a complaint " which in fact was not even filed" in "violation of its own Bar Rules." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/213925.html?thread=15262117#t15262117 |title=gamepolitics: Walsh &amp; NIMF Issue Parental Alert For Movie Promo Sex Game |publisher=Gamepolitics.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alabama Bar has not yet been served notice with any complaint from Thompson, nor has any Florida court acknowledged a civil suit being filed.

Thompson announced that the ''Strickland v. Sony'' plaintiffs were still his clients, and vowed to represent them in-court when the trial resumes.&lt;ref name=thompsonVowsReturn&gt;Feldman, Curt  "[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6146882.html GTA killer case clears hurdle]". ''GameSpot'', March 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2007, Thompson filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The case has been assigned to the same judge who has had previously presided over attempts by Thompson to sue the Florida Bar, which were voluntarily withdrawn. Thompson claimed that his rights of "speech, petition, and religion" were violated when his ''Pro Hac Vice'' status was revoked.

==Dismissal appeal denied==
On March 29, 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Judge Moore's ruling against the dismissal of the case. Law firm Blank-Rome, representing the defendants, had previously attempted unsuccessfully to have the suit dismissed during the pre-trial since it argued that the defendants had a right under the 1st Amendment to sell mature games to minors. At the time of the sale, there was no law preventing such a sale. Thompson called the ruling "exciting" because "no one has ever before survived a motion to dismiss." At the same time, the Alabama Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments as to whether the Fayette County Court had the jurisdiction to preside over the case at all.&lt;ref name=dismissalUpheld&gt;Reeves, Jay "[http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-20/1143662355218050.xml&amp;storylist=alabamanews Court rejects appeal in Alabama suit blaming game for slayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029012618/http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-20%2F1143662355218050.xml&amp;storylist=alabamanews |date=2008-10-29 }}".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1281">'''Strié''' is a popular form of [[faux painting]] using [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] and paint brushes to create a soft natural striped texture.  [[File:sch ewf 10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of the strie faux painting technique over raised stencil]]

Strié is a negative glaze technique. The glaze is generally rolled over the entire surface, and then removed with a tool such as a brush.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Schmidt, ''Building &amp; Finishing Walls &amp; Ceilings'', Creative Publishing International, 2002, p86. {{ISBN|1-58923-042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''strié'' can be used to describe this process of painting, or to describe the actual finish created.

Strié is a simple technique that can be altered and elaborated in many ways.  It can be done on its own, with the streaks directed either vertically or horizontally.  It can be brushed over a raised [[plaster]] stencil.  It is also very popular to overlap a horizontal and vertical strié, creating the look of fabrics such as linen or denim.  This is often referred to as a linen weave or burlap strié.

'''The Peel Players''' were an [[amateur theatre]] group from the [[Isle of Man]] in operation during the 1910s and specialising in [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]] dialect productions.

Through the initiation of [[Sophia Morrison]],&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Mona Douglas, 'Story of a Militant Manxwoman: Sophia Morrison was a Champion of Manx Culture' (1964), in ''[http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/~stephen/chiollaghbooks/MD_RESTORING_S.pdf "Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance]'' by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, pp. 61 - 65&lt;/ref&gt; the group met for the first time in July 1912 at Christian Street School, [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]].&lt;ref name="Cubbon"&gt;'Drama' in ''A Bibliographical Account of Works Relating to the Isle of Man: Volume II'', compiled and edited by [[William Cubbon]], London: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 1005 - 1030&lt;/ref&gt; They commenced playing in 1913 with [[Christopher R. Shimmin]] as [[Theatrical producer|producer]].

On 13 January 1913 the Players premiered Shimmin's short Manx dialect play, ''Illiam Kodhere's Will'', in the [[Gaiety Theatre, Isle of Man|Gaiety Theatre]] in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].&lt;ref name="Shimmin"&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/manxliterature/13308060625/ Original cast list], in ''Illiam Kodhere's Will'' by Christopher R.

It was reported of this performance (by Sophia Morrison) that "There was a crowded house. The Liverpool newspapers gave unstinted praise to both plays and players."&lt;ref name="notes2"&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v2p057.htm 'Notes'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 2, November 1913&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of that same year, the Players did a production of Shimmin's next plays, ''Luss ny Graih'' and ''The Dooinney Moyllee''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v2p063.htm 'Creating a Manx Drama'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 2, November 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

The Players were keen to use the profits from their performances for charitable purposes in line with their Manx ideals. This included a donation of £52 in 1913 to [[Manx Gaelic Society|The Manx Society]], for "the publication of Manx books and music, music prizes, and so forth,"&lt;ref name="Notes 1915"&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v5p298.htm 'Notes'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 5, May 1915&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the Society was in desperate need of money,&lt;ref name="Manx Quarterly"&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq13085.htm 'Manx Society, Annual Meeting: President’s Address'], ''The Manx Quarterly'', No. 13, Vol. II&lt;/ref&gt; and a donation in 1915 to help fund the provision of copies of [[Thomas Edward Brown|T.

When [[World War I]] broke out, ''[[Mannin (journal)|Mannin]]'' reported that: "The Peel Players' revenue had been devoted to war objects, so that their work had been somewhat curtailed for lack of funds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v6p378.htm 'Notes'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 6, November 1916&lt;/ref&gt; This continued for the following year, when ''Mannin'' reported that the Players:&lt;ref name="Notes 1915" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"have this season given their profits to war funds, or for gifts to Peel men on active service and in training; £10 went to Douglas Needlework Fund, £10 to Douglas Belgian Hostel, £5 8s. to Ramsey Belgian Hostel, and the rest to Peel men serving on sea or land."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was only two years after this, in January 1917, that Sophia Morrison, the inspiration behind the Players, died. The central connection between Morrison and the Players was demonstrated by some of their members forming her [[Pall-bearer|pallbearers]]: John J. Joughin, Christopher R. Shimmin, C. Cashin and C. H. Cowley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq18048.htm 'Obituary: Miss Sophia Morrison'], ''The Manx Quarterly'', No. 18, Vol. IV&lt;/ref&gt; The Peel Players did not last long beyond this time.

People who acted with the Peel Players include: Christopher R. Shimmin, William B. Meyrick, John J. Joughin, Evelyn Christian, Amy Preston, C. Cashin, C. H. Cowley, W. H. Crellin, John W. Kelly, Hilda Vick, Amelia Keegan, Lionel Lucas, Charles W. Palmer, [[Tom Dodd (Manx actor)|Tom Dodd]], Sam Harrison and Annie V. Cain.&lt;ref name="Shimmin" /&gt;

Although the Peel Players were only a small amateur group, they are perhaps the most significant theatre group in modern Manx history. Through their central place in the Manx Cultural Revival and their premiering works by perhaps the island's most important playwright, in Christopher R. Shimmin, the Peel Players have been compared to the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]] for their significance to Manx culture.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;

==Plays produced==
* ''Illiam Kodhere's Will'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
* ''[[The Charm (play)|The Charm]]'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
* ''Luss by Graih'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
* ''The Dooinney Moyllee'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
It had also been hoped that the Players could stage productions of ''Catchin Kirree'' by F. Corris and ''Ellie's Stranger'' by [[W. Clucas Kinley]], but the onset of the First World War disrupted these plans.&lt;ref name="notes2" /&gt;

'''''The Procuress''''' is the name given to a number of similar paintings by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Dirck van Baburen]]. The painting is in the [[Caravaggio|Caravaggiesque]] style of the [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Utrecht school]].

==The painting==
The painting shows three figures, a prostitute on the left, the client in the middle and the procuress on the right pointing to her palm to indicate that she is expecting payment. The client is holding a coin between his fingers as he puts his arm around the prostitute, who is playing a [[lute]]. The painting is an example of the popular genre known as ''Bordeeltjes'', or brothel scenes (see also the overlapping genre of [[Merry company]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Schneider, ''Vermeer, 1632–1675: veiled emotions'', Taschen, 2000, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cropped, close-up figures close to the [[picture plane]] against a flat blank background are typical of [[Utrecht Caravaggism]].&lt;ref name = "jmm"/&gt;

There are at least three versions of the painting. The versions in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011141312/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/zoeken/asset.jsp?id=SK-C-612&amp;lang=en Rijksmuseum catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-procuress-33414 |title=MFA catalogue |publisher=Mfa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; are attributed to [[Dirck van Baburen]] or his studio. One copy of the painting was owned by [[Maria Thins]], mother-in-law of [[Johannes Vermeer]], who reproduced it in the background of two of his own paintings.  A copy owned by the [[Courtauld Institute]] in London has been identified as the work of the forger [[Han van Meegeren]]. This was featured in the third episode of the BBC TV series, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''.&lt;ref name="FoF3"&gt;{{Cite episode

==Vermeer==
[[File:Vermeer The concert.JPG|thumb|left|Vermeer's ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall at the upper right]]
[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Zittende Klavecimbelspeelster (1673-1675).jpg|thumb|Vermeer's ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'', in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall behind the figure]]

One of these paintings was owned by [[Vermeer]]'s mother-in-law, and it may have been an influence on one of his own early paintings on a similar subject, also known as ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656).&lt;ref name = "jmm"&gt;John Michael Montias, ''Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History'', Princeton University Press, 1991, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in the background of two of Vermeer's later paintings, ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' (c.1664) and ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'' (c.1670). In both of these later paintings the blatant lust depicted by Baburen is contrasted with the genteel, but erotically charged, middle-class world occupied by Vermeer's women. The contrast between the images may also imply "a more general association between music and love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal |title=National Gallery |publisher=National Gallery |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer sets up a series of contrasts between his own delicate, restrained style and Baburen's vulgar realism. According to Michael Wayne Cole and Mary Pardo this represents Vermeer's own move away from such low-life subjects. The older, cruder style of Baburen is relegated to the background, "eclipsing it with the more modern kind of genteel subject that Vermeer would soon paint exclusively".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wayne Cole, Mary Pardo, ''Inventions of the studio, Renaissance to Romanticism'', UNC Press Books, 2005, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Courtauld Institute version==
[[File:The_Procuress_forgery_by_Han_van_Meegeren_from_the_Courtauld_Gallery.jpg|left|thumb|The Courtauld Institute copy, believed to be a van Meegeren forgery]]
In 1960, [[Geoffrey Webb]] presented a version of the painting to the Courtauld Institute. At the end of the [[Second World War]], he had been an allied officer in Europe investigating art works looted by the Nazis. He believed it was a fake painted by [[Han van Meegeren]], and he presented it to the Courtauld as such. In his own defense, van Meegeren claimed that the painting had been bought in an antique shop by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8612890/Master-forgery-17th-century-work-exposed-as-a-fake.html |title=report in the Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the painting was initially believed to be a fake, its authenticity remained controversial, and in 2009 a scientific study indicated that the painting was likely to be genuine, as no modern pigments were found. A spokesperson for the gallery stated that they were "surprised" by the results, but that the evidence indicated that it was "likely to be a 17th-century painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akbar |first=Arifa |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/fake-painting-revealed-as-dutch-masterpiece-1794254.html |title=Independent article |publisher=Independent article |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following this, the BBC TV programme ''Fake or Fortune?'' conducted a further investigation.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The resulting film was first shown July 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; [[Philip Mould]] and [[Fiona Bruce]] traveled to Amsterdam where they obtained samples of the paints used by van Meegeren.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; These included an artificial resin which turned out to be [[Bakelite]].&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The use of Bakelite had the effect of hardening the paint and thus making it difficult to detect that it was new.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Chemical analysis showed Bakelite in the Courtauld painting, thus confirming that it was a modern forgery.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Van Meegeren is the only forger known to have used this technique, so the painting was attributed to him.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It was probably intended to be used as a prop in Vermeer forgeries.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It is more valuable as a van Meegeren forgery than as a 17th-century studio copy.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt;

{{see also|List of theatre personnel}}

A ''theatrical technician'', (variably known as a '''tech''', '''techie''', '''technician''', '''theatre tech''' or '''theatre technician''') is a person who operates technical equipment and systems in the [[performing arts]] and [[entertainment industry]].  In contrast to [[Performing arts|performers]], this broad category contains all "unseen" theatrical personnel who practice [[stagecraft]] and are responsible for the logistic and production-related aspects of a performance including designers, operators, and supervisors.  Many professional designers and technicians consider the diminutive "techie" to be offensive.

==Typical positions==
Theatrical responsibilities taken by technicians include:
* [[Set construction]] and [[Carpenter (theater)|theatrical carpentry]]
* [[Sound reinforcement system|Sound system]] configuration and [[Sound operator|operation]]
* [[Lighting design]] and [[Light board operator|light board operation]], [[Followspot operator|Followspot operation]], hanging and maintenance of [[stage lighting instrument]]s as well as [[Electrician (theater)|various other electrical jobs]]  
* [[Fly system|Flying]] of [[theatrical scenery|scenery]] and occasionally even [[actors]] by [[Fly crew|fly men]]
* Rigging of moveable and stationary set pieces by [[Rigger (entertainment)|rigger]]s
* [[Stage management]]
* [[Costume]] and [[Theatrical property|prop]] management
* Operation of [[Special effects]] including [[fog machines]] and [[pyrotechnics]]


A single theatrical technician may regularly do one or more of the above jobs during load in, load outs (strike), [[rehearsal]] and performance. Performance technicians are generally divided between those [[Theater (structure)#Basic elements of a theater structure|backstage]] (stagehands, Stage Managers) and those in a [[control room]] (lighting and audio technicians).  During load in and load out additional crew members may be needed due to the amount of work required to be completed in a short time span. Larger and more complex shows require larger crews and often personnel with specialized advanced skills to perform these job functions.

The position may be [[Volunteering|volunteer]] or a paid position. It is not uncommon to receive [[Remuneration|compensation]] (such as comp/free tickets to the current or future productions or items used in the show) in other forms than [[money]] for [[Wage|pay]]. This type of compensation allows the person working to receive value for their services while not costing the [[Theatrical producer|producer]] more out-of-pocket [[expenses]].  Theatrical technicians are represented by the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] in the United States.

==Stagecraft classifications==
Stagecraft and technicians can be classified into departments and jobs as follows. Not all productions will have all departments or jobs filled, and, in many cases, one technician will perform multiple jobs (even if only possessing one title).

* [[Technical director|Technical Director]] – This person will typically oversee the carpentry, rigging, lighting and props departments as a liaison to the performance's primary [[theatre director|director]].  Depending on the production, a "TD" may also supervise the audio and pyrotechnics departments.  In smaller performances and venues, this position is commonly taken by the show's director, assistant director, or [[stage manager]].  In addition, non-resident venues (those that host touring or temporary performances rather than long-term productions) generally have an [[in-house]] Technical Director who oversees incoming event load-in, and a technical liaison between the venue's owner/manager and the director of the performance.

===Carpentry===
This is the general name for all work involving scenery, including the deck (floor) of the stage.
* [[Carpenter (theater)|Master Carpenter]] – Although there may be multiple Master Carpenters in a scene shop, typically a performance or tour will only have one. This technician will typically report directly to the Technical Director.
* Carpenter – Multiple carpenters may be attached to a single show, and report to the Master Carpenter. These technicians are responsible both for assembling and building the scenery as well as moving scenic elements during scene shifts.  Often these technicians also function as [[stagehand]]s.

===Electrics===
This department is responsible for all of the onstage lighting for a show including, but not limited to, practicals, stage lighting and [[followspots]]. Electricians are responsible for the assembly, installation, operation and maintenance of the lighting for a production.  The Electrics department is also typically in charge of any fog or haze machines used during a production, as well as the configuration of pyrotechnics and other special hardware.

* [[Master electrician|Master Electrician]] – The head of the Electrics department on a show, who typically reports directly to the Technical Director, but also sometimes to the Lighting Designer during the development phase of a show.  
** Head [[Spotlight operator|Followspot Operator]] – In some shows, a separate technician gives all cues to the follow spot operators to reduce the stage manager's workload.
** [[Light board operator]] – The person who operates the [[light board]] and controls all the stage lights during a show.  In smaller performances and venues, may be the Lighting Designer or the Master Electrician.
** [[Electrician (theater)|Electrician]] – Multiple electricians may be assigned to a single show. On touring shows, this can be a general designation, with specific positions as follows:
*** Deck Electrician – Responsible for all electric elements on the stage floor, including roving instruments, fog machines, practicals or lighting installed into scenic pieces. Also, in some shows (usually dance productions), where it is sometimes necessary to swap the color media on lighting instruments during the performance or re-focus lights that a performer may have bumped into, the Deck electrician may be responsible for these swaps. 
*** Followspot Operators – These technicians operate one or more [[followspots]] to track performers during a show.

===Rigging===

{{see also|Rigging (theatre)}}
This department is responsible for all equipment hung (flown) in the theater space. This department varies greatly from show to show, sometimes being absorbed into the Electrics or Carpentry departments. If the production incorporates personnel flying (such as in the staging of [[Peter Pan]]), there will usually be designated riggers specifically trained in flying actors. Rigging techniques and traditions come from sailing. Sailors were considered the earliest stagehands in history and many techniques used today for rigging in the theater are from standard uses on boats. Theater technicians today have also incorporated techniques from mountain climbers as well to improve the capabilities of flying equipment in the air. 
* Rigger – The general term for persons in this department. If a rigger is specifically assigned to a certain department, they will have a title referencing that department (Electrics Rigger).
* Flyman – Specific term normally used with counterweight rigging system for an operator of the linesets for those systems.
* Head Flyman – The senior technician in charge of the operations of a counterweight rigging system.

===Rigging systems===

A theater consists of four basic rigging systems such as: hemp house, single purchase, double purchase and truss. Proper knowledge of the basic rigging systems by theater technicians is how scenery is properly built and hung over people's heads for productions. The hemp house is where all the ropes are housed in the theater and are counterweighted with sandbags. Whereas a single purchase is where the loading floor is on the stage floor in order to reduce the amount of staged space in the wings. A double purchase system works quite differently compared to a single purchase because it puts the loading floor halfway between the stage floor and the loft blocks. The truss is considered as to be the most important rigging system in theater because it consists of two or more pieces of pipe fabricated together with cross bracing. The purpose of the truss is to replace standard pipes for extremely heavy loads to be lifted. &lt;ref&gt;[[Rita Kogler Carver|Carver, Rita Kogler]](2012). "Stagecraft Fundamentals Second Edition: A Guide and Reference for Theatrical Production", p. 256-262. Focal Press, MA. {{ISBN|9780240808574}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===
The properties department is responsible for all hand and scenic [[Theatrical property|props]] for a show. This usually includes furniture, weaponry and consumables (paper, food and drink) for a production.  In addition to the above duties, the props department is responsible for the cleanliness of the stage floor, including sweeping and mopping of the stage surface.
* Propsmaster/Propsmistress – The head of the Properties department. Will also usually be in charge of purchasing or building the props for a show.
* Prop Runner – Those who must move scenic props on (and off) stage or supply actors with their props during the show. This job is often unnecessary in small shows.
* This position may also be referred to as a [[set dresser]].

===Audio===
The audio department is responsible for all sound production for a show, including the configuration of microphones, speakers and control equipment, as well as the production of any necessary audio tracks.  Personnel in this department include:

*[[Sound designer]] or [[audio engineer]], responsible for the configuration of the venue's sound system as a whole, including the placement and designation of microphones, monitors, loudspeakers, and control hardware.  This position is often held by an [[acoustician]], especially in large performances requiring musical or orchestral sound reinforcement.
*[[Sound operator]], responsible for the [[Audio mixing (live audio)|live mixing]] of the performance's audio at a master [[Mixing console|sound board]].  Often referred to as '''A-1''' to designate the first (highest) position of the production '''A'''udio department.  This technician is generally positioned in the back of the audience space, so as to hear the performance's audio directly rather than be forced to use a monitoring system, and is responsible for maintaining volume for performers and musicians while avoiding [[feedback]] and other problems.
**[[A2 (theater)|A-2]], or audio assistant, responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of audio equipment used by the sound operator (specifically any [[lavalier]] microphones used in the performance).  Depending on performance size, this technician may perform other duties, including the operation of audio media devices.  In smaller performances, this position is often taken by a [[stagehand]] rather than a technician trained in audio.

===Pyrotechnics/special effects===
A rarely seen department in theatre due to the heavy restrictions on the use of true pyrotechnics and is sometimes combined with other tech departments (usually the Electrics department) is referred to as special effects. Theatrical technicians are responsible for the production and operation of explosives, special effects and illusions on sufficiently large theatrical productions. Today many of the special effects used on stage have been modernized and are extremely advanced the most commonly used effects are nature, fire, fog and haze. In order to make special effects seem more realistic on stage technicians use innovative techniques and special equipment to bring the production to life across the stage. For nature effects like wind, fans are commonly used to bring movement on stage by adjusting the speed and direction of the fan. For effects like fire, equipment is brought in to create flames and smoke and is usually operated by a licensed special effects operator. Whereas fog and haze machines are easy and accessible for technicians to use and only require fluid to be placed inside the machine to vaporize into fog and haze. These machines also have functions where the flow and speed of the fog and haze can be adjusted to control how its distributed throughout a production.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Rita Kogler(2012). "Stagecraft Fundamentals Second Edition: A Guide and Reference for Theatrical Production", p. 256-262. Focal Press, MA. {{ISBN|9780240808574}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage management===
The [[stage manager]] is in control of a production during its run. Responsibilities include calling the cues and determining the starting time of the show and ensuring the safety of all persons involved. Depending on circumstances, multiple positions are possible:
* Production Manager – Typically seen on touring shows or larger permanent venues, this is usually the most senior member of the stage management staff.
* Stage Manager – The usual title applied to the head stage manager assigned to a specific production. This will also be the person who will run a show during performances.
* Deputy Stage Manager – Also known as "Call Boy" is responsible for calling technical (lighting, sound, fly, av etc.) cues at certain times read from the prompt copy (Cue Script).
** Assistant Stage Manager – Reports to the Stage Manager, usually assisting backstage or onstage during a production.
* Repertory Stage Manager – Used occasionally if one stage manager oversees multiple productions being performed in repertory. During any one production, would fulfill the duties assigned to the Stage Manager as above.
* Production Assistant – Used in Equity houses (Actor's Equity Association is the union for Stage Managers), this is the non-union equivalent of an Assistant Stage Manager
* Deck Stage Manager – Used in some shows to specifically refer to the Assistant Stage Manager on the deck during a performance.

===Wardrobe===
Responsible for the creation and maintenance of costume pieces and dressing the performers.
*Costume Designer
*Assistant Costume Designer
* Wardrobe Mistress/Master – The head of the wardrobe department during a production
* Dresser/Wardrobe Crew – General Wardrobe technician during a show that assists the performers in dressing and performing quickchanges.
* Draper
* Tailor 
* Costumer – Person responsible for the creation of all costumes for a show.  Similar to a Technical Director for the Wardrobe, Hair and Makeup departments.
* Milliner – Seen occasionally, this person is responsible for the creation of headwear for a show.
* Wardrobe Crafts – Sometimes found as a separate department or a sub-department of Wardrobe, this department is responsible for the creation of masks, headdresses or non-standard costumes for a production.
* Hair/Makeup – Twin departments responsible for the makeup, wigs and hair stylings for a show.

'''''Tit-Bits from all the interesting Books, Periodicals, and Newspapers of the World''''', more commonly known as '''''Tit-Bits''''', was a British weekly magazine founded by an early father of popular journalism [[George Newnes]] on 22 October 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bridget Griffen-Foley|title=From Tit-Bits to Big Brother: a century of audience participation in the media|journal=Media Culture and Society|date=2004|volume=26|issue=4|url=http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/MEDIA165/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82%20%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85-audience%20research-%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7/big%20brother.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the magazine's headquarters moved from [[Manchester]] to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Howard Cox|author2=Simon Mowatt|title=Technology, Organisation and Innovation: The Historical Development of the UK Magazine Industry|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/1129/Technology_organisation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;origin=publication_detail|work=Auckland University of Technology|accessdate=25 June 2016|format=Research paper|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it paved the way for popular journalism — most significantly, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was founded by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], a contributor to ''Tit-Bits'', and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' was launched by [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Arthur Pearson]], who worked at ''Tit-Bits'' for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine.&lt;ref name = "Hulda"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Friederichs, Hulda|authorlink= | coauthors= | title=George Newnes| year=1911 | publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1911) Kessinger Publishing (2008) | location=London | isbn=978-0-548-88777-6 | pages=}} (republished 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, the magazine was a mass-circulation commercial publication on cheap newsprint which soon reached sales of between 400,000 and 600,000. Like a mini-encyclopedia it presented a diverse range of tit-bits of information in an easy-to-read format, with the emphasis on human interest stories concentrating on drama and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conboy ''Journalism: A Critical History''&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured short stories and full-length fiction, including works by authors such as [[Henry Rider Haggard|Rider Haggard]] and [[Isaac Asimov]], plus three very early stories by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]].

The first humorous article by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings", appeared in ''Tit-Bits'' in November 1900.&lt;ref&gt;From the chronology maintained by the [http://wodehouse.ru/chrono.htm Russian Wodehouse Society]&lt;/ref&gt; During the first world war [[Ivor Novello]] won a ''Titbits'' competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned ''[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]''.&lt;ref name="MagfTB"&gt;{{cite web|title= Tit-Bits/Titbits |url=http://www.magforum.com/mens/mensmagazinesatoz11.htm |work= Magforum |accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000.  At the beginning of 1973 ''Tit-Bits'' lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 ''[[Reveille (newspaper)|Reveille]]'' (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into ''Titbits'', and the magazine was briefly rebranded as ''Titbits incorporating Reveille''. This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984,&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt; under its last editor Paul Hopkins, ''Titbits'' was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' ''Weekend''. At the time, the ''Financial Times'' described ''Titbits'' as “the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press”&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt;. ''Weekend'' itself closed in 1989.

==Cultural influence ==
In ''All Things Considered'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]], the author contrasts ''Tit-Bits'' with the ''Times'', saying: "Let any honest reader... ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write the front page of ''The Times'', which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of ''Tit-Bits'', which is full of short jokes." Reference to the magazine is also made in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits." ''[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 4.2C Calypso|Calypso]]'' episode of ''Ulysses'' by James Joyce.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Moments of Being]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' and AJ Cronin's ''The Stars Look Down''. It has been also mentioned in [[Stanley Houghton]]'s play [[The Dear Departed]]. Wells also mentioned it in his book ''Experiment in Autobiography''. The magazine is burlesqued as "Chit Chat" in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. In the closing scene of the film ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), the protagonist Louis Mazzini ([[Dennis Price]]) is approached by a journalist ([[Arthur Lowe]]) from ''Tit-Bits''.

The magazine name survived as a glossy adult monthly ''Titbits International''.

[[File:Fashions.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration depicting fashions throughout the 19th century]]
'''Victorian fashion''' comprises the various fashions and trends in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] that emerged and developed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[British Empire]] throughout the [[Victorian era]], roughly from the 1830s through the first decade of the 1900s. The period saw many changes in fashion, including changes in styles, fashion technology and the methods of distribution. Various movement in architecture, literature, and the [[decorative arts|decorative]] and [[visual arts]] as well as a changing perception of the traditional gender roles also influenced fashion
.

Under [[Queen Victoria]]'s rule, England enjoyed a period of economic growth along with technological advancement. [[Mass production]] of sewing machines in the 1850s as well as the advent of synthetic dyes introduced major changes in fashion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Fashion|last=Breward|first=Christopher|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=145–180|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing could be made quicker and more cheaply. Advancement in printing and proliferation of fashion magazines allowed the masses to participate in the evolving trends of high fashion, opening the market of mass consumption and advertising. By 1905, clothing was increasingly factory made and often sold in large, fixed-price department stores, spurring a new age of consumerism with the rising middle class who benefited from the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Women's fashions==

During the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], women generally worked in the private, domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/gender-roles-in-the-19th-century|title=Gender roles in the 19th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in earlier centuries when women would often help their husbands and brothers in family businesses and in labour, during the nineteenth century, gender roles became more defined. The requirement for farm labourers was no longer in such a high demand after the [[Industrial Revolution]], and women were more likely to perform domestic work or, if married, give up work entirely. Dress reflected this new, increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and was not intended to be utilitarian.

Clothes were seen as an expression of women’s place in society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian and Edwardian Fashion - A Photographic Survey|last=Gernsheim|first=Alison|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|year=1963|location=New York|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were hence, differentiated in terms of [[social class]]. [[Upper class|Upper class women]], who did not need to work, often wore a tightly laced [[corset]] over a [[bodice]] or [[chemisette]], and paired them with a [[skirt]] adorned with numerous [[Embroidery|embroideries]] and [[Trim (sewing)|trims]]; over layers of [[petticoat]]s. [[Middle class|Middle class women]] exhibited similar dress styles; however, the decorations were not as extravagant. The layering of these garments make them very heavy. Corsets were also stiff and restricted movement. Although the clothes were not comfortable, the type of [[Textile|fabrics]] and the in-numerous layers were worn as a symbol of wealth.
[[File:1850's Evening Dress.jpg|thumb|Picture of 1850s evening dress with a bertha neckline]]
'''Neck-line'''
[[Bertha (collar)|Bertha]] is the low shoulder neck-line worn by women during the [[Victorian Era]]. The cut exposed a woman’s shoulders and it sometimes was trimmed over with a three to six inch deep lace flounce, or the bodice has neckline draped with several horizontal bands of fabric pleats. However, the exposure of neck-line was only restricted to the upper and middle class, working class women during the time period were not allowed to reveal so much flesh.
The [[décolleté style]] made shawls to become an essential feature of dresses. [[Corsets]] lost their shoulder straps, and fashion was to produce two bodices, one closed décolletage for day and one décolleté for evening.

'''Boning'''
[[Corset]]s were used in women’s gowns for emphasizing the small waist of the female body. They function as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bound tightly around the waist, hold and train a person’s waistline, so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal creasing. With the corset, a very small tight fitting waist would be shown.
Yet, corsets have been blamed for causing lots of diseases because of the tight waist bound. Ill condition examples were [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], deformities of the ribs and [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]]. As a result, people started to oppose the use of corsets in later times.
[[File:The Engageants sleeves.jpg|thumb|Engageants]]

'''Sleeves'''
Sleeves were tightly fit during the early [[Victorian era]]. It matched with the tight fit women’s small waist in the design, and the shoulder sleeve seamline was drooped more to show a tighter fit on the arm. This eventually limited women’s movements with the sleeves. 
However, as [[crinoline]]s started to develop in fashion, sleeves turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. [[Engageante]]s, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under the sleeves. They were easy to remove, launder and restitch into position, so to act as false sleeves, which was tacked to the elbow-length sleeves during the time. They commonly appear under the bell-shaped sleeves of day dresses.

'''Silhouette'''
Silhouette changed over time supported by the evolution of the undergarment. In earlier days, wide skirts were supported by fabrics like linen which used horsehair in the weave. [[Crinoline]]s were used to give skirts a beehive shape, with at least six layers petticoats worn under the skirt, which could weigh as much as fourteen pounds. 
Later, the [[Crinoline|cage crinoline]] was developed. Women were freed from the heavy petticoats, and were able to move their legs freely beneath the cage.
Silhouette later began to emphasise a slope toward the back of the skirt. [[Polonaise style]] was introduced where fullness bunched up at the back of the skirt. Crinolines and cages also started to disappear with it being more dangerous to working class women. [[Tournure]]s or [[bustle]]s were developed.

== 1830s dress style ==
[[File:1837 Dress.jpg|alt=This dress features a low waistline, and the bodice is worn over the hips to further emphasise the silhouette|thumb|upright|1837 dress]]

During the start of Queen Victoria’s reign in 1837, the ideal shape of the Victorian woman was a long slim [[torso]] emphasised by wide hips. To achieve a low and slim waist, corsets were tightly laced and extended over the abdomen and down towards the hips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Queen to Empress - Victorian Dress 1837-1877|last=Goldthorpe|first=Caroline|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chemise was commonly worn under the corset, and cut relatively low in order to prevent exposure. Over the corset, was the tight-fitting bodice featuring a low waistline. Along with the bodice was a long skirt, featuring layers of [https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/65/93/69/659369c98b04380d9fc3bfb5adcecfe6.jpg horsehair petticoats]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; worn underneath to create fullness; while placing emphasis on the small waist. To contrast the narrow waist, low and straight necklines were thus used.

== 1840s dress style ==

[[File:1840's Dress.jpg|alt=This evening dress features low straight necklines at the shoulder, bodices ending at the natural waistline and converging to a point at the front, and sleeves flaring out from the elbow. Organ pleats were used to further create the fullness of the skirts.|left|thumb|1840s dress]]
[[File:Mid-1840s Dress.jpg|alt=The mid-1840s saw day dresses featuring V-shaped necklines, which were covered by a chemise for decency. Skirt widths widened due to the horsehair petticoat, and extra flounces were added for emphasis and decoration.Funnel sleeves.|thumb|right|upright|Mid-1840s day dress]]

In the 1840s, collapsed sleeves, low necklines, elongated V-shaped bodices, and fuller skirts characterised the dress styles of women.

At the start of the decade, the sides of bodices stopped at the natural waistline, and met at a point in the front. In accordance with the heavily boned corset and [[Seam (sewing)|seam]] lines on the bodice as well, the popular low and narrow waist was thus accentuated.

Sleeves of bodices were tight at the top, because of the [[wikt:mancheron|Mancheron]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Queen to Empress - Victorian Dress 1837-1877|last=Goldthorpe|first=Caroline|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but expanded around the area between the elbow and before the wrist. It was also initially placed below the shoulder, however; this restricted the movements of the arm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result, the middle of the decade saw sleeves flaring out from the elbow into a funnel shape; requiring [https://janeaustensworld.wordpress.com/tag/undersleeves/ undersleeves] to be worn in order to cover the lower arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Queen to Empress - Victorian Dress 1837-1877|last=Goldthorpe|first=Caroline|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skirts lengthened, while widths increased due to the introduction of the [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bOuPyjWzwT8/TuKx-x1R12I/AAAAAAAAAF0/oRs6AyGH0gw/s1600/CI53.51.15_B1870Amer.Horsehair.jpg horsehair crinoline] in 1847; becoming a status symbol of wealth.

Extra layers of [[Ruffle|flounces]] and petticoats, also further emphasised the fullness of these wide skirts. In compliance with the narrow waist though, skirts were therefore attached to bodices using very tight [[Pleat|organ pleats]] secured at each fold.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This served as a decorative element for a relatively plain skirt. The 1840s style was perceived as conservative and "Gothic" compared to the flamboyance of the 1830s.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Fashion.

== 1850s dress style ==
[[File:1850's Dress.jpg|alt=Necklines plunged further, needing a chemisette to be worn underneath. Sleeves widened at the elbow, while bodices ended at the natural waistline. Skirts widened and were further emphasised by the addition of flounces.|left|thumb|left|1850s dress]]

[[File:1856 Cage Crinoline.jpg|alt=1st patented cage crinoline.Fullness of the skirt is even further emphasised.|thumb|1856 cage crinoline]]
A similar silhouette remained in the 1850s, while certain elements of garments changed.

Necklines of day dresses dropped even lower into a V-shape, causing a need to cover the bust area with a chemisette. In contrast, evening dresses featured a [[Collar (clothing)|Bertha]], which completely exposed the shoulder area instead. Bodices began to extend over the hips, while the sleeves opened further and increased in fullness. The volume and width of the skirt continued to increase, especially during 1853, when rows of flounces were added.

Nevertheless, in 1856, skirts expanded even further; creating a dome shape, due to the invention of the first [[Cage crinoline|artificial cage crinoline]]. The purpose of the crinoline was to create an artificial hourglass silhouette by accentuating the hips, and fashioning an illusion of a small waist; along with the corset. The cage crinoline was constructed by joining thin metal strips together to form a circular structure that could solely support the large width of the skirt. This was made possible by technology which allowed iron to be turned into steel, which could then be drawn into fine wires.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although often ridiculed by journalists and cartoonists of the time as the crinoline swelled in size, this innovation freed women from the heavy weight of petticoats and was a much more hygienic option.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Meanwhile, the invention of synthetic dyes added new colours to garments and women experimented with gaudy and bright colours. Technological innovation of 1860s provided women with freedom and choices.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== 1860s dress style ==
[[File:1860 Cage Crinoline.jpg|alt=Emphasis has moved to the back, in order to create a Train.|left|thumb|uprght|1860s cage crinoline]]
[[File:1860's Dress featuring a Train..jpg|thumb|1860s dress featuring a train]]
[[File:1860's Dress.jpg|alt=Bodices ended at the natural waistline. Wide pagoda sleeves are in fashion, and skirts are longer at the back; depicting a train.|center|thumb|1860s dress]]

During the early and middle 1860s, crinolines began decreasing in size at the top, while retaining their amplitude at the bottom.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Queen to Empress - Victorian Dress 1837-1877|last=Goldthorpe|first=Caroline|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the shape of the crinoline became flatter in the front and more voluminous behind, as it moved towards the back since skirts consisted of [[Train (clothing)|trains]] now. Bodices on the other hand, ended at the natural waistline, had wide [[Sleeve|pagoda sleeves,]] and included high necklines and [[Collar (clothing)|collars]] for day dresses; low necklines for evening dresses. However, in 1868, the female silhouette had slimmed down as the crinoline was replaced by the bustle, and the supporting flounce overtook the role of determining the silhouette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Queen to Empress - Victorian Dress 1837-1877|last=Goldthorpe|first=Caroline|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirt widths diminished even further, while fullness and length remained at the back. In order to emphasise the back, the train was gathered together to form soft folds and [[Drapery|draperies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Victorian Costumes for Women|last=Audin|first=Heather|publisher=Crowood|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1870s dress style ==

[[File:1870's Dress.jpg|alt=Dresses featuring the Bustle &amp; Polonaise|left|thumb|1870s dress]]
[[File:1877 Dress.jpg|alt=Dresses fitted the figure, and featured a long tiered, draped train.|thumb|upright|1877 dress]]
[[File:Tournure.jpg|thumb|1870s tournure]]
The trend for broad skirts slowly disappeared during the 1870s, as women started to prefer an even slimmer silhouette. Bodices remained at the natural waistline, necklines varied, while sleeves began under the shoulder line. An [[overskirt]] was commonly worn over the bodice, and secured into a large bow behind. Over time though, the overskirt shortened into a detached [[Basque (clothing)|basque]], resulting in an elongation of the bodice over the hips. As the bodices grew longer in 1873, the [[Polonaise (clothing)|polonaise]] was thus introduced into the Victorian dress styles. A polonaise is a garment featuring both an overskirt and bodice together. The [[tournure]] was also introduced, and along with the polonaise, it created an illusion of an exaggerated rear end.

By 1874, skirts began to taper in the front and were adorned with trimmings, while sleeves tightened around the wrist area. Towards 1875 to 1876, bodices featured long but even tighter laced waists, and converged at a sharp point in front. Bustles lengthened and slipped even lower, causing the fullness of the skirt to further diminish. Extra fabric was gathered together behind in pleats, thus creating a narrower but longer tiered, draped train too. Due to the longer trains, petticoats had to be worn underneath in order to keep the dress clean.

However, when 1877 approached, dresses moulded to fit the figure,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as increasing slimmer silhouettes were favoured. This was allowed by the invention of the [[cuirass]] bodice which functions like a corset, but extends downwards to the hips and upper thighs. Although dress styles took on a more natural form, the narrowness of the skirt limited the wearer in regards to walking.

== 1880s dress style ==
[[File:1880's Dress.jpg|left|thumb|1880s dress]]
[[File:1885 Bustle.jpg|alt=Horizontal protrusion at the back.|thumb|1885 bustle]]
The early 1880s was a period of stylistic confusion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On one hand, there is the over-ornamented silhouette with contrasting texture and frivolous accessories. On the other hand, the growing popularity of tailoring gave rise to an alternative, severe style.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some credited the change in silhouette to the [[Victorian dress reform]], which consisted of a few movements including the [[Artistic Dress movement|Aesthetic Costume]] Movement and the [[Victorian dress reform|Rational Dress Movement]] in the mid-to-late Victorian Era advocating natural silhouette, lightweight underwear, and rejecting [[tightlacing]]. However, these movements did not gain widespread support. Others noted the growth in cycling and tennis as acceptable feminine pursuits that demanded a greater ease of movement in women's clothing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Still others argued that the growing popularity of tailored semi-masculine suits was simply a fashionable style, and indicated neither advanced views nor the need for practical clothes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Nonetheless, the diversification in options and adoption of what was considered menswear at that time coincided with growing power and social status of women towards the late-Victorian period.

The bustle made a re-appearance in 1883, and it featured a further exaggerated horizontal protrusion at the back. Due to the additional fullness, drapery moved towards the sides or front panel of the skirt instead. Any drapery at the back was lifted up into poufs. Bodices on the other hand, shortened and ended above the hips. Yet the style remained tailored, but was more structured.

However, by 1886, the silhouette transformed back to a slimmer figure again. Sleeves of bodices were thinner and tighter, while necklines became higher again. Furthermore, an even further tailored-look began to develop until it improved in the 1890s.

== 1890s dress style ==

[[File:1890's Dress.jpg|alt=Flared Skirts, Jacket Bodices.|thumb|upright|left|upright1890s dress]]

By 1890, the crinoline and bustle was fully abandoned, and skirts flared away naturally from the wearer’s tiny waist. It evolved into a bell shape, and were made to fit tighter around the hip area. Necklines were high, while sleeves of bodices initially peaked at the shoulders, but increased in size during 1894. Although the large sleeves required cushions to secure them in place, it narrowed down towards the end of the decade. Women thus adopted the style of the tailored jacket, which improved their posture and confidence, while reflecting the standards of early female liberation.

==Hats==
[[File:Ford.madox.brown.last.emma.study.jpg|thumb|''Emma Hill'' by [[Ford Madox Brown]] (1853), a woman wearing a later version of the [[poke bonnet]]]]
[[File:Adelina Patti 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|Opera singer [[Adelina Patti]] painted by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in 1863]]
Hats (and gloves) were crucial to a respectable appearance for both men and women. To go bareheaded was simply not proper. The top hat, for example, was standard formal wear for upper- and middle-class men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For women, the styles of hats changed over time and were designed to match their outfits.
 
During the early Victorian decades, voluminous skirts held up with [[crinoline]]s, and then [[hoop skirts]], were the focal point of the silhouette. To enhance the style without distracting from it, hats were modest in size and design, straw and fabric bonnets being the popular choice. [[Poke bonnet]]s, which had been worn during the late [[Regency period]], had high, small crowns and brims that grew larger until the 1830s, when the face of a woman wearing a poke bonnet could only be seen directly from the front. They had rounded brims, echoing the rounded form of the bell-shaped hoop skirts.

The silhouette changed once again as the Victorian era drew to a close. The shape was essentially an inverted triangle, with a wide-brimmed hat on top, a full upper body with puffed sleeves, no bustle, and a skirt that narrowed at the ankles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laver|first=James|title=Costume and Fashion: A Concise History|year=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20348-4|pages=224–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[hobble skirt]] was a fad shortly after the end of the Victorian era). The enormous wide-brimmed hats were covered with elaborate creations of silk flowers, ribbons, and above all, exotic plumes; hats sometimes included entire exotic birds that had been stuffed. Many of these plumes came from birds in the Florida everglades, which were nearly made entirely extinct by overhunting. By 1899, early environmentalists like [[Adeline Knapp]] were engaged in efforts to curtail the hunting for plumes. By 1900, more than five million birds a year were being slaughtered, and nearly 95 percent of Florida's shore birds had been killed by [[Plume hunting|plume hunter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everglades National Park|url=https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/parks/everglades/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shoes ==
The women's shoes of the early Victorian period were narrow and heelless, in black or white satin. By 1850s and 1860s, they were slightly broader with a low heel and made of leather or cloth. Ankle-length laced or buttoned boots were also popular. From the 1870s to the twentieth century, heels grew higher and toes more pointed. Low-cut pumps were worn for the evening.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Men's fashion ==
{{main|Menswear}}
[[File:Mens Coats 1872 Fashion Plate.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of Victorian men 1870s]]
During the [[1840s in fashion|1840s]], men wore tight-fitting, calf length [[frock coat]]s and a [[waistcoat]] or vest. The vests were single- or double-breasted, with shawl or notched collars, and might be finished in double points at the lowered waist. For more formal occasions, a cutaway morning coat was worn with light trousers during the daytime, and a dark tail coat and trousers was worn in the evening. Shirts were made of linen or cotton with low collars, occasionally turned down, and were worn with wide [[cravat]]s or neck ties. Trousers had fly fronts, and [[breeches]] were used for formal functions and when horseback riding. Men wore [[top hat]]s, with wide brims in sunny weather.

During the [[1850s in fashion|1850s]], men started wearing shirts with high upstanding or turnover [[collar (clothing)|collars]] and [[necktie#Four-in-hand|four-in-hand necktie]]s tied in a bow, or tied in a knot with the pointed ends sticking out like "wings". The upper-class continued to wear top hats, and [[bowler hat]]s were worn by the working class.

In the [[1860s in fashion|1860s]], men started wearing wider neckties that were tied in a bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin. Frock coats were shortened to knee-length and were worn for business, while the mid-thigh length [[sack coat]] slowly displaced the frock coat for less-formal occasions. Top hats briefly became the very tall "stovepipe" shape, but a variety of other hat shapes were popular.

During the [[1870s in fashion|1870s]], three-piece suits grew in popularity along with patterned fabrics for shirts. Neckties were the four-in-hand and, later, the [[Ascot tie]]s. A narrow ribbon tie was an alternative for tropical climates, especially in the Americas. Both frock coats and sack coats became shorter. Flat straw boaters were worn when boating.

During the [[1880s in fashion|1880s]], formal evening dress remained a dark tail coat and trousers with a dark waistcoat, a white bow tie, and a shirt with a winged collar. In mid-decade, the dinner jacket or [[tuxedo]], was used in more relaxed formal occasions. The [[Norfolk jacket]] and tweed or woolen breeches were used for rugged outdoor pursuits such as shooting. Knee-length topcoats, often with contrasting velvet or fur collars, and calf-length overcoats were worn in winter. Men's shoes had higher heels and a narrow toe.

Starting from the [[1890s in fashion|1890s]], the [[blazer]] was introduced, and was worn for sports, sailing, and other casual activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landow|first=George|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/costume/90s/2.html|title=Men's informal sporting dress, late 1880s and '90s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout much of the Victorian era most men wore fairly short hair.  This was often accompanied by various forms of facial hair including moustaches, side-burns, and full beards.  A clean-shaven face did not come back into fashion until the end of the 1880s and early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/costume/nunn21.html|title=Victorian Men's Fashions, 1850–1900: Hair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing what men really wore from what was marketed to them in periodicals and advertisements is problematic, as reliable records do not exist.&lt;ref name="shannon597"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Brent|title=Refashioning Men: Fashion, Masculinity, and the Cultivation of the Male Consumer in Britain, 1860–1914|journal=Victorian Studies|year=2004|volume=46|issue=4|pages=597–630|doi=10.1353/vic.2005.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mourning black==
[[File:Princess Beatrice mourning.jpg|thumb|Victoria's five daughters (Alice, Helena, Beatrice, Victoria and Louise), photographed wearing mourning black beneath a bust of their late father, Prince Albert (1862)]]

In Britain, black is the colour traditionally associated with mourning for the dead. The customs and etiquette expected of men, and especially women, were rigid during much of the Victorian era. The expectations depended on a complex hierarchy of close or distant relationship with the deceased. The closer the relationship, the longer the mourning period and the wearing of black. The wearing of full black was known as First Mourning, which had its own expected attire, including fabrics, and an expected duration of 4 to 18 months. Following the initial period of First Mourning, the mourner would progress to Second Mourning, a transition period of wearing less black, which was followed by Ordinary Mourning, and then Half-mourning. Some of these stages of mourning were shortened or skipped completely if the mourner's relationship to the deceased was more distant. Half-mourning was a transition period when black was replaced by acceptable colours such as lavender and mauve, possibly considered acceptable transition colours because of the tradition of [[Church of England]] (and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) clergy wearing lavender or mauve [[Stole (vestment)|stoles]] for funeral services, to represent the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Colors of the Church Year|url=http://fullhomelydivinity.org/articles/colors.htm|publisher=Consortium of Country Churches|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norms for mourning===

''Manners and Rules of Good Society, or, Solecisms to be Avoided'' (London, Frederick Warne &amp; Co., 1887) gives clear instructions, such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flanders|first=Judith|title=The Victorian House|year=2003|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=0-00-713189-5|pages=378–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|}

The complexity of these etiquette rules extends to specific mourning periods and attire for siblings, step-parents, aunts and uncles distinguished by blood and by marriage, nieces, nephews, first and second cousins, children, infants, and "connections" (who were entitled to ordinary mourning for a period of "1–3 weeks, depending on level of intimacy"). Men were expected to wear mourning black to a lesser extent than women, and for a shorter mourning period. After the mid-19th century, men would wear a black hatband and black suit, but for only half the prescribed period of mourning expected of women. Widowers were expected to mourn for a mere three months, whereas the proper mourning period expected for widows was up to four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flanders|first=Judith|title=The Victorian House|year=2003|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=0-00-713189-5|pages=378–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who mourned in black for longer periods were accorded great respect in public for their devotion to the departed, the most prominent example being Queen Victoria herself.

Women with lesser financial means tried to keep up with the example being set by the middle and upper classes by dyeing their daily dress. Dyers made most of their income during the Victorian period by dyeing clothes black for mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flanders|first=Judith|title=The Victorian House|year=2003|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=London|isbn=0-00-713189-5|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technological advancement ==
Technological advancements not only influenced the economy but brought a major change in the fashion styles worn by men and women. As the Victorian era was based on the principles of gender, race and class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=P|title=The Victorian Era|journal=Digital Library of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much advancement was in favor of the upper class as they were the ones who could afford the latest technology and change their fashion styles accordingly.  In 1830s there was introduction of horse hair crinoline that became a symbol of status and wealth as only the upper class women could wear it.  In 1850s there were more fashion technological advancements hence 1850s could rightly be called a revolution in the Victorian fashion industry such as the innovation of artificial cage crinoline that gave women an artificial hourglass silhouette this meant that women did not have to wear layers of petticoats anymore to achieve illusion of wide hips and it was also hygienic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shrimpton|first1=J|title=Victorian Fashion|publisher=Bloomsbury Shire Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic dyes were also introduced that added new bright colours to garments. These technological advancement gave women freedom and choices. In 1855's ''[[Haute couture]]'' was introduced as tailoring became more mainstream in years to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aspelund|first1=Karl|title=Fashioning Society|publisher=Fairchild Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Frederick Worth, a prominent English designer, became popular amongst the upper class though its city of destiny always is Paris. Haute couture became popular at the same time when sewing machines were invented.&lt;ref name="Haute Couture"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Richard|last2=Koda|first2=Harold|title=Haute Couture|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hand sewn techniques arose and were a distinction in compared to the old ways of tailoring. Princess Eugenie of France wore the Englishman dressmaker, Charles Frederick Worth's couture and he instantly became famous in France though he had just arrived in Paris a few years ago. In 1855, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Britain welcomed Napoleon And Eugenie of France to a full state visit to England. Eugenie was considered a fashion icon in France. She and Queen Victoria became instant friends. Queen Victoria, who had been the fashion icon for European high fashion, was inspired by Eugenie's style and the fashions she wore. Later Queen Victoria also appointed Charles Frederick Worth as her dress maker and he became a prominent designer amongst the European upper class. Charles Frederick Worth is known as the father of the haute couture as later the concept of labels were also invented in the late 19th century as custom, made to fit tailoring became mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saillard|first1=Olivier|last2=Zazzo|first2=Anne|title=Paris Haute Couture|publisher=Skira Flammarion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1860s, when Europe was all about made-to-fit tailoring, crinolines were considered impractical. In the 1870s, women preferred more slimmer silhouettes, hence bodices grew longer and the polonaise, a skirt and bodice made together, was introduced. In 1870s the Cuirass Bodice, a piece of armour that covers the torso and functions like a corset, was invented. Towards the end of Victoria's  reign, dresses were flared naturally as crinolines were rejected by middle class women. Designers such as Charles Frederick Worth were also against them. All these inventions and changes in fashion led to women's  liberation as tailored looks improved posture and were more practical.&lt;ref name="Haute Couture"/&gt;

[[File:1868-skirt-lengths-girl-ages-Harpers-Bazar.gif|thumb|upright|"The proper length for little girls' skirts at various ages", from ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', showing a 1900 idea of how the hemline should descend towards the ankle as a girl got older]]

Many myths and exaggerations about the period persist to the modern day. Examples include the idea of men's clothing is seen as formal and stiff, women's as elaborate and over-done; clothing covered the entire body, and even the glimpse of an ankle was scandalous. Critics contend that corsets constricted women's bodies and women's lives. Homes are described as gloomy, dark, cluttered with massive and over-ornate furniture and proliferating [[bric-a-brac]]. Myth has it that even piano legs were scandalous, and covered with tiny [[pantalette]]s.

In truth, men's formal clothing may have been less colourful than it was in the previous century, but brilliant [[waistcoat]]s and [[cummerbund]]s provided a touch of color, and [[smoking jacket]]s and [[robe|dressing gown]]s were often of rich Oriental [[brocade]]s. This phenomenon was the result of the growing textile manufacturing sector, developing mass production processes, and increasing attempts to market fashion to men.&lt;ref name="shannon597"/&gt;  [[Corset]]s stressed a woman's sexuality, exaggerating hips and bust by contrast with a tiny waist. Women's [[evening gown]]s bared the shoulders and the tops of the breasts. The [[jersey dress]]es of the 1880s may have covered the body, but the stretchy novel fabric fit the body like a glove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gernsheim |first=Alison |title=Victorian &amp; Edwardian Fashion: A Photographic Survey |year=1981 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |page=65|edition=New |isbn=0-486-24205-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home furnishing was not necessarily ornate or overstuffed. However, those who could afford lavish draperies and expensive ornaments, and wanted to display their wealth, would often do so. Since the Victorian era was one of increased social mobility, there were ever more ''[[nouveaux riches]]'' making a rich show.

The items used in decoration may also have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of [[soot]] from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently as they might be today.

There is no actual evidence that piano legs were considered scandalous. Pianos and tables were often draped with [[shawl]]s or cloths—but if the shawls hid anything, it was the cheapness of the furniture. There are references to lower-middle-class families covering up their [[pine]] tables rather than show that they couldn't afford [[mahogany]]. The piano leg story seems to have originated in the 1839 book, ''A Diary in America'' written by Captain [[Frederick Marryat]], as a satirical comment on American prissiness.

Victorian manners may have been as strict as  imagined—on the surface. One simply did not speak publicly about sex, childbirth, and such matters, at least in the respectable middle and upper classes. However, as is well known, discretion covered a multitude of sins. Prostitution flourished. Upper-class men and women indulged in [[adultery|adulterous]] liaisons.
