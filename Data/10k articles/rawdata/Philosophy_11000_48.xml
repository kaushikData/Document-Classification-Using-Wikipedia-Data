      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2362">'''Abdellatif Zeroual''' (1951 in [[Berrechid]], Morocco – 14 November 1974 at "Derb Moulay Chérif"  in [[Casablanca]]) was a philosophy teacher and  member of the national committee of the  "[[Ila al-Amam (Morocco)|Ila Al Amame]]" movement.

Abdellatif was the son of Haj Abdelkader Zeroual, a militant who fought the French before Morocco became independent.

In 1970, when the Moroccan authorities launched a crackdown on the Ila al-Aman movement, he went into hiding with [[Abraham Serfaty]] and was protected by [[Christine Daure-Serfaty]]. In 1973 he was sentenced to death in absentia by a Casabalanca court. On 5 November 1974 he disappeared after being snatched by a group of plain-clothed men while on his way to a meeting.

A week later a body was registered at a hospital in Rabat, which human rights organisations claim to be his, although the Moroccan authorities have never confirmed this.

[[File:"Waiting On Shore" Rosses Point - geograph.org.uk - 242932.jpg|thumb| "Waiting On Shore" [[Rosses Point]], Sligo. The sculpture, by Niall Breton, reflects the anguish of seafaring people who watch for the safe return of loved ones.]]
'''Anguish''' is derived from the Latin word angustiae, meaning extreme pain, distress or anxiety. The feeling of suffering from anguish is typically preceded by a tragedy or event that has a profound meaning to the being in question. Anguish can be felt physically or mentally (often referred to as emotional distress). Anguish is also a term used in [[philosophy]], often as a translation from the Latin word for ''[[angst]]''. It is a paramount feature of [[existentialism | existentialist]] philosophy, in which anguish is often understood as the experience of an utterly free being in a world with zero absolutes (existential despair). In the theology of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], it refers to a being with total [[free will]] who is in a constant state of spiritual fear that his freedom will lead him to fall short of the standards that God has laid out for them.

==Affect Decisions==
A study done at the University of Princeton’s Center for the Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior suggests that the presence of the emotion influences the decisions made. The study uses a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine to measure the brain waves of a subject when put into a difficult position. In this particular session, the subject was presented with a situation where she had to decide the fate of five people versus one person by the flip of a switch, and then decide the fate of five people versus one person by the physical acting of condemning a man to his death. The results of the fMRI stated that the decision of death by switch was easier than the decision of physically pushing a man to his death. It is theorized that the participant is being subjected to the emotion of anguish when faced with future possibility of physical condemning another person and therefore the brain enforces an “emotional block” to encourage the cessation of this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, H. (2004). Anguish and Ethics. Scientific American Special Edition, 14(1), 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental Health==
Anguish is made up of fear, distress, anxiety and panic. These stressors cause an enormous amount of dissonance, which could then lead to issues of mental health. While taken literally anguish may be defined as a physical event, but it may be extrapolated to an event of one’s psyche. It has been found that the anguish of a significant change in the way a young student lives (i.e. their new responsibilities, being on their own, multiple deadlines etc.) has contributed to significantly increased rates of college students suffering from anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;WILSON, R. (2015, September 4). An Epidemic of Anguish. Chronicle of Higher Education, pp. A38–A42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Music has a particular way of eliciting emotions into its listeners. The notes heard by one person may have a different connotation than another person hearing the same notes. Upon hearing a song, symphony, or sonnet filled with anguish, one might begin to reflect upon their own life and experiences that coincide with the notes, thereby bringing repressed memories beyond subconscious to our salient mind.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D. J. (2005). Musical Understanding, Musical Works, and Emotional Expression: Implications for education. Educational Philosophy &amp; Theory, 37(1), 93–103.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Anguish in Music===
*Mahler’s Ninth Symphony
*“What I’d Say” –Earl Thomas Conely
*“Eleanor Rigby” –The Beatles
*"Someone Like You" -Adele
*"Hurt" -Johnny Cash

==Quotes==
*“He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. 'Oh, Jane! my hope - my love - my life!' broke in anguish from his lips.” -Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre
*“What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music.” -Soren Kierkegaard
*“Pain, anguish and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed.” - Alexandre Dumas, The Man in the Iron Mask


==Philosophy==
Kierkegaard views anguish as the same as suffering. Everyone wants to find the "truth" but it takes anguish and suffering to "appropriate" the truth. Kierkegaard put it this way in 1847 and 1850. {{Quotation|text=All the knowledge allied with inquisitiveness, thirst for knowledge, natural talent, the self-seeking passion, all the knowledge the natural man promptly understands to be worth learning is also basically and essentially easy to learn, and aptitude is involved here from first to last. Therefore people are willing enough to learn when it is a matter of ''learning more'', but when it is a matter of ''learning anew'' through sufferings, then learning becomes hard and heavy, then aptitude does not help, but on the other hand no one is excluded even though he is ever so lacking in aptitude. The lowliest, the simplest, the most forsaken human being, someone whom all teachers give up but heaven has by no means given up-he can learn obedience fully as well as anyone else. 
|author=Søren Kierkegaard|title=''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong translation, pp. 252–253}}{{Quotation|text=Is “truth” the sort of thing one might conceivably appropriate without more ado by means of another man? Without more ado-that is without being willing to be developed and tried, to fight and to suffer, just as he did who acquired the truth for himself? Is not that as impossible as to sleep or dream oneself into the truth. Is it not just as impossible to appropriate it thus without more ado however wide awake one might be? Or is one really wide awake, is not this a vain conceit, when one does not understand or will not understand that with respect to the truth there is no shortcut which dispenses with the necessity of acquiring it, and with that respect to acquire it from generation to generation there is no essential shortcut, so that every generation and every individual in the generation must essentially begin again from the start? 
|author=Søren Kierkegaard|title=''Training in Christianity'', 1850, pp. 181–182; Lowrie translation 1941, 2004}}

In the teachings of [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], anguish is seen when an utterly captured being realizes the unpredictability of his or her action. For example, when walking along a cliff, you would feel anguish to know that you have the freedom to throw yourself down to your imminent death.

'''Animal rights''' is the idea in which some, or all, [[non-human]] [[animal]]s are entitled to the possession of their own lives and that their most basic interests—such as the need to avoid [[suffering]]—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2009), pp. 8, 19–20; Rowlands (1998), p. 31ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone—an idea known since 1970 as [[speciesism]], when the term was coined by [[Richard D. Ryder]]—arguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other.&lt;ref&gt;Horta (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden.&lt;ref&gt;That a central goal of animal rights is to eliminate the property status of animals, see Sunstein (2004), p. 11ff.
*For speciesism and fundamental protections, see Waldau (2011).
*For food, clothing, research subjects or entertainment, see Francione (1995), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as [[Jainism]], [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Animism]] also espouse some forms of animal rights.

In parallel to the debate about moral rights, [[animal law]] is now widely taught in law schools in North America, and several prominent legal scholars{{who|date=January 2013}} support the extension of basic legal rights and [[person]]hood to at least some animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are [[bonobo]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s. This is supported by some animal rights academics because it would break through the species barrier, but opposed by others because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on [[sentience]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;For animal law courses in North America, see [http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 "Animal law courses"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613170018/http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 |date=2010-06-13 }}, [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]]. Retrieved July 12, 2012.
*For a discussion of animals and personhood, see Wise (2000), pp. 4, 59, 248ff; Wise (2004); Posner (2004); [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-257091/animal-rights Wise (2007)].

Critics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a [[social contract]], and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt; Another argument, associated with the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition, is that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering&lt;ref name="Ethical"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liguori, G.| displayauthors=etal| year = 2017 | title = Ethical Issues in the Use of Animal Models for Tissue Engineering: Reflections on Legal Aspects, Moral Theory, 3Rs Strategies, and Harm-Benefit Analysis| journal = Tissue Engineering Part C Methods | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages= 850–862 | doi=10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0189| pmid=28756735}}&lt;/ref&gt;; they may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as "necessary" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests varies considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 11, 16.

===Moral status and animals in the ancient world===
{{main|Moral status of animals in the ancient world}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Aristotle]] argued that animals lacked reason (''logos''), and placed humans at the top of the natural world.&lt;ref name=Sorabji7/&gt;]]
Aristotle argued that animals lacked reason (logos), and placed humans at the top of the natural world, yet the respect for animals in ancient Greece was very high. Some animals were considered divine, e.g. dolphins.
The 21st-century debates about animals can be traced back to the savage stone age from horrible histories, and the idea of a divine hierarchy. In the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' 1:26 (5th or 6th century BCE), [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] is given "dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Dominion need not entail property rights, but it has been interpreted, by some, over the centuries to imply ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary philosopher [[Bernard Rollin]] writes that "''dominion'' does not entail or allow abuse any more than does dominion a parent enjoys over a child."&lt;ref name="Rollin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollin|first=Bernard E.|title=Animal Rights and Human Morality|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=978-1-61592-211-6|page=117}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rollin further states that the [[Biblical Sabbath]] requirement promulgated in the [[Ten Commandments]] "required that animals be granted a day of rest along with humans. Correlatively, the Bible forbids 'plowing with an ox and an ass together' (Deut. 22:10–11). According to the rabbinical tradition, this prohibition stems from the hardship that an ass would suffer by being compelled to keep up with an ox, which is, of course, far more powerful. Similarly, one finds the prohibition against 'muzzling an ox when it treads out the grain' (Deut. 25:4–5), and even an environmental prohibition against destroying trees when besieging a city (Deut. 20:19–20). These ancient regulations, virtually forgotten, bespeak of an eloquent awareness of the status of animals as ends in themselves", a point also corroborated by [[Norm Phelps]].&lt;ref name="Rollin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phelps2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelps|first=Norm|title=Animal Rights According to the Bible|year=2002|publisher=Lantern Books|isbn=978-1-59056-009-9|page=70|quote=The Bible's most important reference to the sentence and will of nonhuman animals is found in Deuteronomy 25:4, which became the scriptural foundation of the rabbinical doctrine of ''tsar ba'ale Chayim'', "the suffering of the living," which makes relieving the suffering of animals a religious duty for Jews. "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing." The point of muzzling the ox was to keep him from eating any of the grain that he was threshing. The point of the commandment was the cruelty of forcing an animal to work for hours at a time with his face only inches from delicious food while not allowing him to eat any of it. From time immemorial, Jew have taken great pride in the care they provide their animals.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher and mathematician, [[Pythagoras]] (c. 580–c. 500 BCE), urged respect for animals, believing that human and nonhuman souls were [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] from human to animal, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner (2005), p. 47; Taylor (2009), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), student to the philosopher [[Plato]], argued that nonhuman animals had no interests of their own, ranking them far below humans in the [[Great Chain of Being]]. He was the first to create a taxonomy of animals; he perceived some similarities between humans and other species, but argued for the most part that animals lacked reason (''logos''), reasoning (''logismos''), thought (''dianoia'', ''nous''), and belief (''doxa'').&lt;ref name=Sorabji7&gt;Sorabji (1993), p. 12ff.; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights Wise (2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophrastus]] (c. 371 – c. 287 BCE), one of Aristotle's pupils, argued that animals also had reasoning (''logismos'') and opposed eating meat on the grounds that it robbed them of life and was therefore unjust.&lt;ref name=Taylor35&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji (1993) p. 45 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Theophrastus did not prevail; [[Richard Sorabji]] writes that current attitudes to animals can be traced to the heirs of the Western Christian tradition selecting the hierarchy that Aristotle sought to preserve.&lt;ref name="  Sorabji7"/&gt;

Plutarch (1 C. CE) in his Life of Cato the Elder comments that while law and justice are applicable strictly to men only, beneficence and charity towards beasts is characteristic of a gentle heart. This is intended as a correction and advance over the merely utilitarian treatment of animals and slaves by Cato himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html|title=Plutarch • Life of Cato the Elder|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Beauchamp]] (2011) writes that the most extensive account in antiquity of how animals should be treated was written by the Neoplatonist philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (234–c. 305 CE), in his ''On Abstinence from Animal Food'', and ''On Abstinence from Killing Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (2011a), pp. 4–5.

===17th century: Animals as automata===

====Early animal protection laws in Europe====
&lt;!---[[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]] was the Shogun of Japan from 1680 until 1709 and enacted animal rights, protecting especially d ogs. Wiki community, Please make a pretty wiki article about this subject---&gt;According to [[Richard D. Ryder]], the first known animal protection legislation in Europe was passed in Ireland in 1635. It prohibited pulling wool off sheep, and the attaching of ploughs to horses' tails, referring to "the cruelty used to beasts."&lt;ref&gt;''The Statutes at Large''. Dublin, 1786, cited in Ryder (2000), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641, the first legal code to protect domestic animals in North America was passed by the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref name=Francione7/&gt; The colony's constitution was based on ''[[Massachusetts Body of Liberties|The Body of Liberties]]'' by the Reverend [[Nathaniel Ward]] (1578–1652), an English lawyer, [[Puritan]] clergyman, and University of Cambridge graduate. Ward's list of "rites" included rite 92: "No man shall exercise any Tirrany or Crueltie toward any brute Creature which are usually kept for man's use." Historian [[Roderick Nash]] (1989) writes that, at the height of René Descartes' influence in Europe—and his view that animals were simply automata—it is significant that the New Englanders created a law that implied animals were not unfeeling machines.&lt;ref name=Nash19&gt;Nash (1989), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puritans passed animal protection legislation in England too. Kathleen Kete writes that animal welfare laws were passed in 1654 as part of the ordinances of the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]]—the government under [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599–1658), which lasted from 1653 to 1659, following the [[English Civil War]]. Cromwell disliked blood sports, which included [[cockfighting]], [[cock throwing]], [[dog fighting]], [[bull baiting]] and bull running, said to tenderize the meat. These could be seen in villages and fairgrounds, and became associated with idleness, drunkenness, and gambling. Kete writes that the Puritans interpreted the biblical dominion of man over animals to mean responsible stewardship, rather than ownership. The opposition to blood sports became part of what was seen as Puritan interference in people's lives, and the animal protection laws were overturned during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was returned to the throne in 1660.&lt;ref name=Kete2&gt;Kete (2002), p. 19 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====René Descartes====
{{rquote|right|[Animals] eat without pleasure, cry without pain, grow without knowing it; they desire nothing, fear nothing, know nothing. — [[Nicolas Malebranche]] (1638–1715)&lt;ref name=Malebranche&gt;Harrison (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The great influence of the 17th century was the French philosopher, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), whose [[Meditations on First Philosophy|''Meditations'']] (1641) informed attitudes about animals well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Midgley1999/&gt; Writing during the [[scientific revolution]], Descartes proposed a [[Mechanistic#Universal mechanism|mechanistic theory]] of the universe, the aim of which was to show that the world could be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience.&lt;ref name=Cottingham&gt;Cottingham (1995), pp. 188–192.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses.
There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, [[Mechanism (philosophy)#Universal mechanism|mechanist]], has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? — [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778)&lt;ref&gt;"Bêtes, ''Dictionnaire Philosophique''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
His mechanistic approach was extended to the issue of animal [[consciousness]]. Mind, for Descartes, was a thing apart from the physical universe, a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|separate substance]], linking human beings to the mind of God. The nonhuman, on the other hand, were for Descartes nothing but complex [[Automaton|automata]], with no souls, minds, or reason.&lt;ref name="Midgley1999"&gt;Midgley, Mary (May 24, 1999-2000). [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/134849], ''The New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of animals as man's duty towards himself===

====John Locke, Immanuel Kant====
Against Descartes, the British philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) argued, in ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' (1693), that animals did have feelings, and that unnecessary cruelty toward them was morally wrong, but that the right not to be harmed adhered either to the animal's owner, or to the human being who was being damaged by being cruel. Discussing the importance of preventing children from tormenting animals, he wrote: "For the custom of tormenting and killing of beasts will, by degrees, harden their minds even towards men."&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1693).&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's position echoed that of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274). [[Paul Waldau]] writes that the argument can be found at [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] (9:9–10), when [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] asks: "Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake." Christian philosophers interpreted this to mean that humans had no direct duty to nonhuman animals, but had a duty only to protect them from the effects of engaging in cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), following Aquinas, opposed the idea that humans have direct duties toward nonhumans. For Kant, cruelty to animals was wrong only because it was bad for humankind. He argued in 1785 that "cruelty to animals is contrary to man's duty to ''himself'', because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other ''human beings'' is weakened."&lt;ref name=Kant1785&gt;Kant (1785), part II, paras 16 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century: Centrality of sentience===
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued for the inclusion of animals in [[natural law]].]]

====Jean-Jacques Rousseau====
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) argued in ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754) for the inclusion of animals in [[natural law]] on the grounds of [[sentience]]: "By this method also we put an end to the time-honored disputes concerning the participation of animals in natural law: for it is clear that, being destitute of intelligence and liberty, they cannot recognize that law; as they partake, however, in some measure of our nature, in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed, they ought to partake of natural right; so that mankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes. It appears, in fact, that if I am bound to do no injury to my fellow-creatures, this is less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings: and this quality, being common both to men and beasts, ought to entitle the latter at least to the privilege of not being wantonly ill-treated by the former."&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau (1754), quoted in Midgley (1984), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on education, ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'' (1762), he encouraged parents to raise their children on a vegetarian diet. He believed that the food of the culture a child was raised eating, played an important role in the character and disposition they would develop as adults. "For however one tries to explain the practice, it is certain that great meat-eaters are usually more cruel and ferocious than other men. This has been recognized at all times and in all places. The English are noted for their cruelty while the Gaures are the gentlest of men. All savages are cruel, and it is not their customs that tend in this direction; their cruelty is the result of their food."

====Jeremy Bentham====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Jeremy Bentham]]: "The time will come, when humanity will extend its mantle over every thing which breathes."&lt;ref&gt;Bentham (1781), Part III.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Four years later, one of the founders of modern utilitarianism, the English philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832), although opposed to the concept of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], argued that it was the ability to suffer that should be the benchmark of how we treat other beings. Bentham claims that the capacity for suffering gives the right to equal consideration, equal consideration is that the interest of any being affected by an action are to be considered and have the equal interest of any other being. If rationality were the criterion, he argued, many humans, including infants and the disabled, would also have to be treated as though they were things.&lt;ref name=Benthall&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8322.2007.00494.x Benthall (2007)], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not conclude that humans and nonhumans had equal moral significance, but argued that the latter's interests should be taken into account. He wrote in 1789, just as African slaves were being [[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|freed by the French]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the [[Hair follicle|villosity]] of the skin, or the termination of the ''[[Sacrum|os sacrum]]'' are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they ''reason''?, nor Can they ''talk''? but, Can they ''suffer?''&lt;ref name=Bentham&gt;Bentham (1789), quoted in Garner (2005), pp. 12—13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century: Emergence of ''jus animalium''===
{{Further|Badger baiting|Bull baiting|Cockfighting}}
[[File:Badger-baiting2.jpg|thumb|[[Badger baiting]], one of the rural sports campaigners sought to ban from 1800 onwards.]]
The 19th century saw an explosion of interest in animal protection, particularly in England. Debbie Legge and Simon Brooman write that the educated classes became concerned about attitudes toward the old, the needy, children, and the insane, and that this concern was extended to nonhumans. Before the 19th century, there had been prosecutions for poor treatment of animals, but only because of the damage to the animal as property. In 1793, for example, John Cornish was found not guilty of maiming a horse after pulling the animal's tongue out; the judge ruled that Cornish could be found guilty only if there was evidence of malice toward the owner.&lt;ref name=Legge40&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1800 onwards, there were several attempts in England to introduce animal protection legislation. The first was a bill against [[bull baiting]], introduced in April 1800 by a Scottish MP, Sir [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet|William Pulteney]] (1729–1805). It was opposed ''inter alia'' on the grounds that it was anti-working class, and was defeated by two votes. Another attempt was made in 1802, this time opposed by the Secretary at War, [[William Windham]] (1750–1810), who said the Bill was supported by Methodists and Jacobins who wished to "destroy the Old English character, by the abolition of all rural sports."&lt;ref name="Phelps 2007 pp. 96"&gt;Phelps (2007), pp. 96–98.

In 1809, [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Lord Erskine]] (1750-1823) introduced a bill to protect cattle and horses from malicious wounding, wanton cruelty, and beating.  He told the House of Lords that animals had protection only as property: "''The animals themselves are without protection''--the law regards them not ''substantively''--they have no rights!"&lt;ref&gt;''Cruelty to Animals: The Speech of Lord Erskine in the House of Peers'' [https://archive.org/details/b28748165 (London: Richard Phillips, 1809) p 2] Italics in original speech.

[[File:Trial of Bill Burns.jpg|thumb|The Trial of Bill Burns]]

{{further|wikisource:Martin's Act 1822}}

In 1821, the Treatment of Horses bill was introduced by Colonel [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]] (1754–1834), MP for Galway in Ireland, but it was lost among laughter in the House of Commons that the next thing would be rights for asses, dogs, and cats.&lt;ref name=Legge41&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "Humanity Dick" by George IV, Martin finally succeeded in 1822 with his "Ill Treatment of Horses and Cattle Bill"—or "Martin's Act", as it became known—which was the world's first major piece of animal protection legislation. It was given royal assent on June 22 that year as ''[[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822|An Act to prevent the cruel and improper Treatment of Cattle]]'', and made it an offence, punishable by fines up to five pounds or two months imprisonment, to "beat, abuse, or ill-treat any horse, mare, gelding, mule, ass, ox, cow, heifer, steer, sheep or other cattle."&lt;ref name=Legge40/&gt;

Legge and Brooman argue that the success of the Bill lay in the personality of "Humanity Dick", who was able to shrug off the ridicule from the House of Commons, and whose sense of humour managed to capture the House's attention.&lt;ref name=Legge40/&gt; It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act, when he had Bill Burns, a [[costermonger]]—a street seller of fruit—arrested for beating a donkey, and paraded the animal's injuries before a reportedly astonished court. Burns was fined, and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey.&lt;ref name=Phelps100&gt;Phelps 2007, pp. 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries followed suit in passing legislation or making decisions that favoured animals. In 1822, the courts in New York ruled that wanton cruelty to animals was a misdemeanor at common law.&lt;ref name=Francione7&gt;Francione 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In France in 1850, [[:fr:Loi Grammont|Jacques Philippe Delmas de Grammont]] succeeded in having the ''Loi Grammont'' passed, outlawing cruelty against domestic animals, and leading to years of arguments about whether bulls could be classed as domestic in order to ban bullfighting.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John.

{{Further|Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals}}
Richard Martin soon realized that magistrates did not take the Martin Act seriously, and that it was not being reliably enforced. Martin's Act was supported by various social reformers who were not parliamentarians and an informal network had gathered around the efforts of Reverend [[Arthur Broome]] (1779-1837) to create a voluntary organisation that would promote kindness toward animals. Broome canvassed opinions in letters that were published or summarised in various periodicals in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;"To Correspondents" ''The Kaleidoscope'', 6 March 1821 p 288. Also see ''The Monthly Magazine'' Vol. 51 April 1, 1821 p 3."The Brute Species". "Notice" in ''Morning Post'', 17 February 1821, p 3. Similarly see "Cruelty to Animals" ''The Sporting Magazine'', Vol. VIII New Series No. XLIII (April 1821), p 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the passage of Richard Martin's anti-cruelty to cattle bill in 1822, Broome attempted to form a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that would bring together the patronage of persons who were of social rank and committed to social reforms. Broome did organise and chair a meeting of sympathisers in November 1822 where it was agreed that a Society should be created and at which Broome was named its Secretary but the attempt was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;See Kathryn Shevelow, ''For the Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movemen''t (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), 268; Arthur W. Moss, ''Valiant Crusade: The History of the RSPCA'' (London: Cassell, 1961), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, Broome arranged a new meeting in Old Slaughter's Coffee House in [[St Martin's Lane]], a London café frequented by artists and actors. The group met on June 16, 1824, and included a number of MPs: Richard Martin, Sir [[James Mackintosh]] (1765–1832), Sir [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet|Thomas Buxton]] (1786–1845), [[William Wilberforce]] (1759–1833), and Sir [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|James Graham]] (1792–1861), who had been an MP, and who became one again in 1826.&lt;ref name=RSPCAhistory&gt;Anonymous (1972).

They decided to form a "Society instituted for the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals"; the [[RSPCA|Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], as it became known. It determined to send men to inspect slaughterhouses, [[Smithfield Market]], where livestock had been sold since the 10th century, and to look into the treatment of horses by coachmen.&lt;ref name="RSPCAhistory"/&gt; The Society became the Royal Society in 1840, when it was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria, herself strongly opposed to [[vivisection]].&lt;ref name=Legge47&gt;Legge and Brooman 1997, p. 47.

From 1824 onwards, several books were published, analyzing animal rights issues, rather than protection alone. [[Lewis Gompertz]] (1783/4–1865), one of the men who attended the first meeting of the SPCA, published ''Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes'' (1824), arguing that every living creature, human and nonhuman, has more right to the use of its own body than anyone else has to use it, and that our duty to promote happiness applies equally to all beings. [[Edward Nicholson (librarian)|Edward Nicholson]] (1849–1912), head of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the University of Oxford, argued in ''Rights of an Animal'' (1879) that animals have the same natural right to life and liberty that human beings do, disregarding Descartes' mechanistic view—or what he called the "Neo-Cartesian snake"—that they lack consciousness.&lt;ref name=Taylor62&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 62.

''[[On the Basis of Morality]]''. This edition Hackett Publishing, 1998, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The development in England of the concept of animal rights was strongly supported by the German philosopher, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860). He wrote that Europeans were "awakening more and more to a sense that beasts have rights, in proportion as the strange notion is being gradually overcome and outgrown, that the animal kingdom came into existence solely for the benefit and pleasure of man."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Phelps 2007, p. 153–154.
*Schopenhauer wrote in ''The Basis of Morality'': "It is asserted that beasts have no rights&amp;nbsp;... that 'there are no duties to be fulfilled towards animals.' Such a view is one of revolting coarseness, a barbarism of the West, whose source is Judaism." A few passages later, he called the idea that animals exist for human benefit a "Jewish stence." See Phelps, ''op cit''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He stopped short of advocating vegetarianism, arguing that, so long as an animal's death was quick, men would suffer more by not eating meat than animals would suffer by being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schopenhauer |first1=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Idea Vol.I |publisher=The Project Gutenberg, 2011 |pages=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer also theorized that the reason people succumbed to the "''unnatural diet''" of meat-eating was because of the unnatural, cold climate they emigrated to and the necessity of meat for survival in such a climate, for fruits and vegetables could not be dependably cultivated at those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schopenhauer |first1=Arthur |title=Parerga &amp; Paralipomena Vol. II |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=144, 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He applauded the animal protection movement in England—"To the honor, then, of the English, be it said that they are the first people who have, in downright earnest, extended the protecting arm of the law to animals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He also argued against the dominant [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian idea that animal cruelty is wrong only insofar as it brutalizes humans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, because Christian morality leaves animals out of account&amp;nbsp;... they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals; they are mere "things," mere ''means'' to any ends whatsoever. They can therefore be used for vivisection, hunting, coursing, bullfights, and horse racing, and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone. Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs, [[chandala]]s, and [[Mleccha|mlechchhas]], and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Schopenhauer96/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Percy Bysshe Shelley====
The English poet and dramatist [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822) wrote two essays advocating a vegetarian diet, for ethical and health reasons: ''[[A Vindication of Natural Diet]]'' (1813) and ''On the Vegetable System of Diet'' (1829, posth.).

====John Stuart Mill====
[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873), the English philosopher, also argued that utilitarianism must take animals into account, writing in 1864:{{verify source|type=year|date=November 2012}} "Nothing is more natural to human beings, nor, up to a certain point in cultivation, more universal, than to estimate the pleasures and pains of others as deserving of regard exactly in proportion to their likeness to ourselves.&amp;nbsp;... Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral,' let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned."&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), p. 12; [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.htm/ Mill (1874)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805172223/http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.htm |date=2012-08-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charles Darwin====
[[File:1878 Darwin photo by Leonard from Woodall 1884 - cropped grayed partially cleaned.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=portrait|[[Charles Darwin]] wrote in 1837: "Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?"]]
[[James Rachels]] writes that [[Charles Darwin]]'s (1809–1882) ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859)—which presented the [[theory of evolution]] by [[natural selection]]—revolutionized the way humans viewed their relationship with other species. Not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental and moral lives too, Darwin argued.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009/&gt; He wrote in his ''Notebooks'' (1837): "Animals – whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals. – Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?"&lt;ref&gt;Darwin (1837), quoted in Redclift (2010), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), he argued that "There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties", attributing to animals the power of reason, decision making, memory, sympathy, and imagination.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009&gt;Rachels (2009), pp. 124–126; Beauchamp (2009), pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachels writes that Darwin noted the moral implications of the cognitive similarities, arguing that "humanity to the lower animals" was one of the "noblest virtues with which man is endowed." He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals, including setting traps. He wrote in a letter that he supported [[vivisection]] for "real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror&amp;nbsp;..." In 1875, he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection, lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection, and the study of physiology. Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day, such as Frances Power Cobbe, did not see Darwin as an ally.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009/&gt;

====American SPCA, Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford====
[[File:FrancesPowerCobbe2.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Frances Power Cobbe]] founded two of the first anti-vivisection groups.]]
[[File:Anna Kingsford 2.JPG|thumb|140px|[[Anna Kingsford]], one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, published ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881), advocating vegetarianism.]]

An early proposal for legal rights for animals came from a group of citizens in [[Ashtabula County, Ohio]]. Around 1844, the group proposed an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] stating that if slaves from [[Slave and free states|slave states]] were receiving representation as 3/5 of a person on the basis that they were animal property, all the animal property of the free states should receive representation also.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/25466018|title=Petition from Citizens of Ashtabula County, Ohio for a Constitutional Amendment that Representation in Congress be Uniform throughout the Country|last=|first=|date=1844|website=[[National Archives Catalog]]|publisher=|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first animal protection group in the United States, the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), was founded by [[Henry Bergh]] in April 1866. Bergh had been appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to a diplomatic post in Russia, and had been disturbed by the mistreatment of animals he witnessed there. He consulted with the president of the RSPCA in London, and returned to the United States to speak out against bullfights, cockfights, and the beating of horses. He created a "Declaration of the Rights of Animals", and in 1866 persuaded the New York state legislature to pass anti-cruelty legislation and to grant the ASPCA the authority to enforce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2006/11/the-aspca-pioneers-in-animal-welfare/|title=The ASPCA–Pioneers in Animal Welfare - Advocacy for Animals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, the Irish social reformer [[Frances Power Cobbe]] (1822–1904) founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection, the world's first organization opposed to animal research, which became the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]]. In 1880, the English feminist [[Anna Kingsford]] (1846–1888) became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, after studying for her degree in Paris, and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals. She published ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881), advocating vegetarianism, and in the same year founded the Food Reform Society. She was also vocal in her opposition to experimentation on animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rudacille (2000), pp. 31, 46.
*Also see Vyvyan (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Cobbe set up the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]], with which she campaigned against the use of dogs in research, coming close to success with the 1919 Dogs (Protection) Bill, which almost became law.&lt;!--add source, plus something about Cobbe/Kingsford disputes--&gt;

Ryder writes that, as the interest in animal protection grew in the late 1890s, attitudes toward animals among scientists began to harden. They embraced the idea that what they saw as [[anthropomorphism]]—the attribution of human qualities to nonhumans—was unscientific. Animals had to be approached as physiological entities only, as [[Ivan Pavlov]] wrote in 1927, "without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states." It was a position that hearkened back to Descartes in the 17th century, that nonhumans were purely mechanical, with no rationality and perhaps even no consciousness.&lt;ref name=Ryder5&gt;Ryder (2000), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Friedrich Nietzsche====
Avoiding utilitarianism, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) found other reasons to defend animals. He argued that "The sight of blind suffering is the spring of the deepest emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Animal Rights: A Historical Anthology. By [[Andrew Linzey]], Paul A. B. Clarke&lt;/ref&gt; He once wrote: "For man is the cruelest animal. At tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto been happiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, that was his heaven on earth."&lt;ref&gt;The Selected Writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. {{ISBN|978-1-60459-332-7}} Wilder Publications April 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his writings, he speaks of the human being as an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciy.org/2010/06/10/6286/|title=Posthuman Destinies|publisher=sciy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Henry Salt====
In 1894, [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt]] (1851–1939), a former master at [[Eton College|Eton]], who had set up the Humanitarian League to lobby for a ban on hunting the year before, published ''Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the object of the essay was to "set the principle of animals' rights on a consistent and intelligible footing."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt; Concessions to the demands for ''jus animalium'' had been made grudgingly to date, he wrote, with an eye on the interests of animals ''qua'' property, rather than as rights bearers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient one—the assertion that animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that "restricted freedom" to which Herbert Spencer alludes.&lt;ref name=Salt1&gt;[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm Salt 1894, chapter 1]. Salt cited Spencer's definition of rights: "Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal liberty of any other man&amp;nbsp;... Whoever admits that each man must have a certain restricted freedom, asserts that it is right he should have this restricted freedom&amp;nbsp;... And hence the several particular freedoms deducible may fitly be called, as they commonly are called, his rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that there was no point in claiming rights for animals if those rights were subordinated to human desire, and took issue with the idea that the life of a human might have more moral worth. "[The] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day—it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt;

===20th century: Animal rights movement===

====Brown Dog Affair, Lizzy Lind af Hageby====
{{main|Brown Dog affair}}
[[File:International Anti-Vivisection Congress, 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] (centre, seated) in 1913.]]
In 1902, [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] (1878–1963), a Swedish feminist, and a friend, Lisa Shartau, traveled to England to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, intending to learn enough to become authoritative anti-vivisection campaigners. In the course of their studies, they witnessed several animal experiments, and published the details as ''The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology'' (1903). Their allegations included that they had seen a brown terrier dog dissected while conscious, which prompted angry denials from the researcher, [[William Bayliss]], and his colleagues. After [[Stephen Coleridge]] of the National Anti-Vivisection Society accused Bayliss of having violated the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876]], Bayliss sued and won, convincing a court that the animal had been anesthetized as required by the Act.&lt;ref name=Mason1997/&gt;

In response, anti-vivisection campaigners commissioned a statue of the dog to be erected in Battersea Park in 1906, with the plaque: "Men and Women of England, how long shall these Things be?" The statue caused uproar among medical students, leading to frequent vandalism of the statue and the need for a 24-hour police guard. The affair culminated in riots in 1907 when 1,000 medical students clashed with police, suffragettes and trade unionists in Trafalgar Square. Battersea Council removed the statue from the park under cover of darkness two years later.&lt;ref name=Mason1997&gt;Mason (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coral Lansbury]] (1985) and [[Hilda Kean]] (1998) write that the significance of the affair lay in the relationships that formed in support of the "Brown Dog Done to Death", which became a symbol of the oppression the women's suffrage movement felt at the hands of the male political and medical establishment. Kean argues that both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future. The students saw the women and trade unionists as representatives of anti-science sentimentality, while the women saw themselves as progressive, with the students and their teachers belonging to a previous age.&lt;ref&gt;Lansbury (1985), pp. 152–169; Kean (1998), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development of veganism====
{{main|Veganism}}
Members of the English Vegetarian Society who avoided the use of eggs and animal milk in the 19th and early 20th century were known as strict vegetarians. The International Vegetarian Union cites an article informing readers of alternatives to shoe leather in the Vegetarian Society's magazine in 1851 as evidence of the existence of a group that sought to avoid [[animal product]]s entirely. There was increasing unease within the Society from the start of the 20th century onwards with regards to egg and milk consumption, and in 1923 its magazine wrote that the "ideal position for vegetarians is [complete] abstinence from animal products."&lt;ref name="Salt 1880"&gt;[http://www.ivu.org/history/europe19b/salt_a_plea_for_vegetarianism.pdf Salt (1880)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616115150/http://www.ivu.org/history/europe19b/salt_a_plea_for_vegetarianism.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) argued in 1931 before a meeting of the Society in London that vegetarianism should be pursued in the interests of animals, and not only as a human health issue. He met both Henry Salt and Anna Kingsford, and read Salt's ''A Plea for Vegetarianism'' (1880). Salt wrote in the pamphlet that "a Vegetarian is still regarded, in ordinary society, as little better than a madman."&lt;ref name="Salt 1880"/&gt; In 1944, several members, led by [[Donald Watson]] (1910–2016), decided to break from the Vegetarian Society over the issue of egg and milk use. Watson coined the term "vegan" for those whose diet included no animal products, and they formed the British [[Vegan Society]] on November 1 that year.&lt;ref name=Leneman&gt;Leneman (1999)

====''Tierschutzgesetz''====
{{Further|Animal welfare in Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Hermann Goering 2.jpg|thumb|This cartoon appeared in ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', a German satirical magazine, on September 3, 1933, showing lab animals giving the [[Nazi salute]] to [[Hermann Göring]], after restrictions on [[animal testing]] were announced.]]

On coming to power in January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] passed a comprehensive set of animal protection laws. The laws were similar to those that already existed in England, though more detailed and with severe penalties for breaking them. Arnold Arluke and [[Boria Sax]] write that the Nazis tried to abolish the distinction between humans and animals, to the point where many people were regarded as less valuable than animals.&lt;ref name=Arluke1992&gt;Arluke and Sax (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1933 they passed laws regulating the slaughter of animals; one of their targets was [[kosher slaughter]]. In November the ''Tierschutzgesetz'', or animal protection law, was introduced, with [[Adolf Hitler]] announcing an end to animal cruelty: "''Im neuen Reich darf es keine Tierquälerei mehr geben.''" ("In the new Reich, no more animal cruelty will be allowed.") It was followed in July 1934 by the ''Reichsjagdgesetz'', prohibiting hunting; in July 1935 by the ''Naturschutzgesetz'', environmental legislation; in November 1937 by a law regulating animal transport in cars; and in September 1938 by a similar law dealing with animals on trains.&lt;ref&gt;Sax (2000) p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was a vegetarian in the later years of his life; several members of his inner circle, including [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], and [[Heinrich Himmler]], adopted some form of vegetarianism, though by most accounts their vegetarianism was not as strict as Hitler's.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor (1999), pp. 135–137; Sax (2000), pp. 35, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increase in animal use====
Despite the proliferation of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied to the idea of human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The over-exploitation of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.&lt;ref name="Legge50"/&gt;

Notwithstanding the interest in animal welfare of the previous century, the situation for animals arguably deteriorated in the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War. This was in part because of the increase in the numbers used in animal research—300 in the UK in 1875, 19,084 in 1903, and 2.8 million in 2005 (50–100 million worldwide), and a modern annual estimated range of 10 million to upwards of 100 million in the US&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_07_06_animaltesting.pdf "Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 2005"], Her Majesty's Stationery Office.

====Development of direct action====
{{further|Hunt Saboteurs Association|RSPCA Reform Group}}
In the early 1960s in England, support for animal rights began to coalesce around the issue of [[blood sport]]s, particularly hunting deer, [[Foxhunting|foxes]], and otters using dogs, an aristocratic and middle-class English practice, stoutly defended in the name of protecting rural traditions. The psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]] – who became involved with the animal rights movement in the late 1960s – writes that the new chair of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] tried in 1963 to steer it away from confronting members of the hunt, which triggered the formation that year of a [[direct action]] breakaway group, the Hunt Saboteurs Association. This was set up by a journalist, John Prestige, who had witnessed a pregnant deer being chased into a village and killed by the [[Devon and Somerset Staghounds]]. The practice of sabotaging hunts (for example, by misleading the dogs with scents or horns) spread throughout south-east England, particularly around university towns, leading to violent confrontations when the huntsmen attacked the "sabs".&lt;ref name=Ryder167&gt;Ryder (2000), p. 167ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy spread to the RSPCA, which had arguably grown away from its radical roots to become a conservative group with charity status and royal patronage. It had failed to speak out against hunting, and indeed counted huntsmen among its members. As with the League Against Cruel Sports, this position gave rise to a splinter group, the RSPCA Reform Group, which sought to radicalize the organization, leading to chaotic meetings of the group's ruling Council, and successful (though short-lived) efforts to change it from within by electing to the Council members who would argue from an animal rights perspective, and force the RSPCA to address issues such as hunting, factory farming, and animal experimentation. Ryder himself was elected to the Council in 1971, and served as its chair from 1977 to 1979.&lt;ref name=Ryder167/&gt;

====Formation of the Oxford group====
{{main|Oxford Group (animal rights)}}
The same period saw writers and academics begin to speak out again in favor of animal rights. [[Ruth Harrison]] published ''Animal Machines'' (1964), an influential critique of factory farming, and on October 10, 1965, the novelist [[Brigid Brophy]] had an article, "The Rights of Animals", published in ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;ref name="Ryder5"/&gt; She wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relationship of [[homo sapiens]] to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrails in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present&amp;nbsp;... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible that we do not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.&lt;ref name=Ryder5/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Richard D Ryder in 2012 film The Superior Human?.png|thumb|British psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]] was a member of the Oxford Group.]] --&gt;
[[Robert Garner]] writes that Harrison's book and Brophy's article led to an explosion of interest in the relationship between humans and nonhumans.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3&gt;Garner (2004), p. 3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Brophy's article was discovered in or around 1969 by a group of postgraduate philosophy students at the University of Oxford, Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch (husband and wife from Canada), John Harris, and [[David Wood (philosopher)|David Wood]], now known as the Oxford Group. They decided to put together a [[symposium]] to discuss the theory of animal rights.&lt;ref name=Ryder5/&gt;

Around the same time, Richard Ryder wrote several letters to ''The Daily Telegraph'' criticizing animal experimentation, based on incidents he had witnessed in laboratories. The letters, published in April and May 1969, were seen by Brigid Brophy, who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris. Ryder also started distributing pamphlets in Oxford protesting against experiments on animals; it was in one of these pamphlets in 1970 that he coined the term "[[speciesism]]" to describe the exclusion of nonhuman animals from the protections offered to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2001), pp. 5, 23–29.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a contributor to the Godlovitches' symposium, as did Harrison and Brophy, and it was published in 1971 as ''[[Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Godlovitch, Godlovitch, and Harris (1971); see the Introduction for the reference to the symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication of ''Animal Liberation''====
{{main|Animal Liberation (book)}}
In 1970, over lunch in Oxford with fellow student Richard Keshen, a vegetarian, Australian philosopher Peter Singer came to believe that, by eating animals, he was engaging in the oppression of other species. Keshen introduced Singer to the Godlovitches, and in 1973 Singer reviewed their book for ''The New York Review of Books''. In the review, he used the term "animal liberation", writing:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AnimalLiberation.jpg|140px|thumb|[[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975)]] --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are familiar with Black Liberation, Gay Liberation, and a variety of other movements. With Women's Liberation some thought we had come to the end of the road. Discrimination on the basis of sex, it has been said, is the last form of discrimination that is universally accepted and practiced without pretense&amp;nbsp;... But one should always be wary of talking of "the last remaining form of discrimination."&amp;nbsp;... ''Animals, Men and Morals'' is a manifesto for an Animal Liberation movement.&lt;ref name=SingerReview/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the strength of his review, ''The New York Review of Books'' took the unusual step of commissioning a book from Singer on the subject, published in 1975 as ''Animal Liberation'', now one of the animal rights movement's canonical texts. Singer based his arguments on the principle of utilitarianism – the view, in its simplest form, that an act is right if it leads to the "greatest happiness of the greatest number", a phrase first used in 1776 by Jeremy Bentham.&lt;ref name=SingerReview&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=9900 Singer (April 5, 1973)].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in favor of the [[equal consideration of interests]], the position that there are no grounds to suppose that a violation of the basic interests of a human—for example, an interest in not suffering—is different in any morally significant way from a violation of the basic interests of a nonhuman.&lt;ref name=Singer5&gt;Singer 1990, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer used the term "speciesism" in the book, citing Ryder, and it stuck, becoming an entry in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), p. 269, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's publication triggered a groundswell of scholarly interest in animal rights. [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]]'s ''Victims of Science: The Use of Animals in Research'' (1975) appeared, followed by [[Andrew Linzey]]'s ''Animal Rights: A Christian Perspective'' (1976), and [[Stephen R. L. Clark]]'s ''The Moral Status of Animals'' (1977). A Conference on Animal Rights was organized by Ryder and Linzey at Trinity College, Cambridge, in August 1977. This was followed by [[Mary Midgley]]'s ''Beast And Man: The Roots of Human Nature'' (1978), then ''Animal Rights–A Symposium'' (1979), which included the papers delivered to the Cambridge conference.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3/&gt;

From 1982 onwards, a series of articles by [[Tom Regan]] led to his ''[[The Case for Animal Rights]]'' (1984), in which he argues that nonhuman animals are "subjects-of-a-life", and therefore possessors of moral rights, a work regarded as a key text in animal rights theory.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3/&gt; Regan wrote in 2001 that philosophers had written more about animal rights in the previous 20 years than in the 2,000 years before that.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (2001), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Garner writes that Charles Magel's bibliography, ''Keyguide to Information Sources in Animal Rights'' (1989), contains 10 pages of philosophical material on animals up to 1970, but 13 pages between 1970 and 1989 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2004), p. 2.

====Founding of the Animal Liberation Front====
{{main|Animal Liberation Front}}
In 1971, a law student, [[Ronnie Lee]], formed a branch of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in Luton, later calling it the Band of Mercy after a 19th-century RSPCA youth group. The Band attacked hunters' vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows, calling it "active compassion". In November 1973, they engaged in their first act of arson when they set fire to a Hoechst Pharmaceuticals research laboratory, claiming responsibility as a "nonviolent guerilla organization dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of mankind."&lt;ref name=Molland70&gt;Molland (2004), pp. 70–74; Monaghan (2000), pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee and another activist were sentenced to three years in prison in 1974, paroled after 12 months. In 1976, Lee brought together the remaining Band of Mercy activists along with some fresh faces to start a [[leaderless resistance]] movement, calling it the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).&lt;ref name=Molland70/&gt; ALF activists see themselves as a modern [[Underground Railroad]], passing animals removed from farms and laboratories to sympathetic veterinarians, safe houses and sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;Best (2004), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some activists also engage in threats, intimidation, and arson, acts that have lost the movement sympathy in mainstream public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1998), pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decentralized model of activism is frustrating for law enforcement organizations, who find the networks difficult to infiltrate, because they tend to be organized around friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Gunn, former Chief Constable, Cambridge Constabulary, interviewed for "It Could Happen to You," True Spies, BBC Two, November 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the US Department of Homeland Security indicated how seriously it takes the ALF when it included them in a list of domestic terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;Rood, Justin. [http://www.cq.com/public/20050325_homeland.html "Animal Rights Groups and Ecology Militants Make DHS Terrorist List, Right-Wing Vigilantes Omitted"], ''Congressional Quarterly'', March 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates, such as Singer, who regard the movement as something that should occupy the moral high ground. ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that, as [[Ingrid Newkirk]] puts it, "Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out."&lt;ref name=NewkirkBest341&gt;Newkirk (2004), p. 341./&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s through to the early 2000s there was an increased level of violence by animal rights extremist groups directed at individuals and institutions associated with [[animal research]]. Activist groups involved included the [[Justice Department (animal rights)|Justice Department]], the [[Animal Rights Militia]] and [[SHAC]].&lt;ref&gt;Holder, T.

====Animal Rights International====
{{further|Animal protectionism}}

[[Henry Spira]] (1927–1998), a former seaman and civil rights activist, became the most notable of the new animal advocates in the United States. A proponent of gradual change, he formed Animal Rights International in 1974, and introduced the idea of "reintegrative shaming", whereby a relationship is formed between a group of animal rights advocates and a corporation they see as misusing animals, with a view to obtaining concessions or halting a practice. It is a strategy that has been widely adopted, most notably by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Francione and Garner (2010), p. 1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spira's first campaign was in opposition to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1976, where cats were being experimented on, research that he persuaded them to stop. His most notable achievement was in 1980, when he convinced the cosmetics company [[Revlon]] to stop using the [[Draize test]], which involves toxicity tests on the skin or in the eyes of animals. He took out a full-page ad in several newspapers, featuring a rabbit with sticking plaster over the eyes, and the caption, "How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty's sake?" Revlon stopped using animals for cosmetics testing, donated money to help set up the [[Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing]], and was followed by other leading cosmetics companies.&lt;ref name=Feder&gt;Feder, Barnaby J. (November 26, 1889). [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/magazine/pressuring-perdue.html "Pressuring Perdue"], ''The New York Times''.
*Also see Singer (1998), and Singer (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Revlon has since renewed testing on animals as it is unwilling to give up revenue from sales in China, where animal testing is required for cosmetics and other items.

===21st century: Developments===
In 1999, New Zealand passed a new Animal Welfare Act that had the effect of banning experiments on "non-human hominids".&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108/&gt;

Also in 1999, Public Law 106-152 (Title 18, Section 48) was put into action in the United States. This law makes it a felony to create, sell, or possess videos showing animal cruelty with the intention of profiting financially from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty/crush_videos.php#ixzz2C6yKSljR%3E|title=Stopping Crush Videos|publisher=pet-abuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Austrian Parliament|Austrian parliament]] banned experiments on apes, unless they are performed in the interests of the individual ape.&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108/&gt; Also in Austria, the Supreme Court ruled in January 2008 that a chimpanzee (called Matthew Hiasl Pan by those advocating for his [[personhood]]) was not a person, after the Association Against Animal Factories sought personhood status for him because his custodians had gone bankrupt. The chimpanzee had been captured as a baby in [[Sierra Leone]] in 1982, then smuggled to Austria to be used in pharmaceutical experiments, but was discovered by customs officials when he arrived in the country, and was taken to a shelter instead. He was kept there for 25 years, until the group that ran the shelter went bankrupt in 2007. Donors offered to help him, but under Austrian law only a person can receive personal gifts, so any money sent to support him would be lost to the shelter's bankruptcy. The Association appealed the ruling to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. The lawyer proposing the chimpanzee's personhood asked the court to appoint a legal guardian for him and to grant him four rights: the right to life, limited freedom of movement, personal safety, and the right to claim property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22670956/ It's official: In Austria, a chimp is not a person], Associated Press, January 15, 2008.

In June 2008, a committee of Spain's national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution to extend limited rights to nonhuman primates. The parliamentary Environment Committee recommended giving chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans the right not to be used in medical experiments or in circuses, and recommended making it illegal to kill apes, except in self-defense, based upon the rights recommended by the [[Great Ape Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2011), p. 108.

==== Petitions for Habeas Corpus ====
In 2015, the [[Nonhuman Rights Project]] (NhPR) filed three lawsuits in New York State on behalf of four captive chimpanzees, demanding that the courts grant them the right to bodily liberty via the [[Habeas corpus|writ of Habeas Corpus]] and to immediately send them to a sanctuary affiliated with the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2013/11/30/press-release-re-nhrp-lawsuit-dec-2nd-2013/ |title=Press Release re.

In the [[Nonhuman Rights Project#Court cases|case]] involving the chimpanzees Hercules and Leo, Justice Barbra Jaffe did not immediately dismiss the filing and instead ordered a hearing requiring the chimpanzee owner to show why the chimpanzees should be not be released and transferred to the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/04/20/judge-recognizes-two-chimpanzees-as-legal-persons-grants-them-writ-of-habeas-corpus/|title=Judge Recognizes Two Chimpanzees as Legal Persons, Grants them Writ of Habeas Corpus : The Nonhuman Rights Project|last=|first=|date=2015-04-20|website=Non Human Rights Project|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=December 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909212513/http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/04/20/judge-recognizes-two-chimpanzees-as-legal-persons-grants-them-writ-of-habeas-corpus/|archivedate=September 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the hearing, Justice Jaffe issued an order denying Hercules and Leo's petition.

Even though the petition was denied, NhRP interpreted Justice Jeffe's decision as a victory. In its press release it emphasized the fact that Justice Jeffe agreed with NhRP when finding that "'persons' are not restricted to human beings, and that who is a 'person' is not a question of biology, but of public policy and principle" and also stating that "Efforts to extend legal rights to chimpanzees are thus understandable; some day they may even succeed."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/08/04/thats-one-small-step-for-a-judge-one-giant-leap-for-the-nonhuman-rights-project/|title=That's One Small Step for a Judge, One Giant Leap for the Nonhuman Rights Project : The Nonhuman Rights Project|last=|first=|date=2015-08-04|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=December 11, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512074736/http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/08/04/thats-one-small-step-for-a-judge-one-giant-leap-for-the-nonhuman-rights-project/|archivedate=May 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Lord Mahavir Gold.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mahavira]], The Torch-bearer of [[Ahimsa]]. Ahimsa includes kindness and non-violence to all living organisms.]] [[Robert Garner]] writes that both [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] societies abandoned animal sacrifice and embraced vegetarianism from the 3rd century BCE. Several kings in India built hospitals for animals, and the emperor [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter, in line with ''[[ahimsa]]'', the doctrine of non-violence. Garner writes that [[Jainism]] took this idea further. Jains believe that no living creature should be harmed, and they are known to clear paths in front of them by sweeping them to protect any insect life that may be present.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palitana Temple.jpg|thumb|The temple town of [[Palitana]] is the world's first vegetarian-only city.]]

===Legal actions in the 21st century===
[[Paul Waldau]] writes that, in 2000, the High Court in [[Kerala]] used the language of "rights" in relation to circus animals, ruling that they are "beings entitled to dignified existence" under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The ruling said that if human beings are entitled to these rights, animals should be too. The court went beyond the requirements of the Constitution that all living beings should be shown compassion, and said: "It is not only our fundamental duty to show compassion to our animal friends, but also to recognize and protect their rights." Waldau writes that other courts in India and one court in Sri Lanka have used similar language.&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108&gt;Waldau (2011), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Indian government issued a ban on the use of live animals in education and much research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-17/india/31355109_1_cpcsea-control-and-supervision-cruelty|title=Govt bans use of live animals for education, research |publisher= The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
For some the basis of animal rights is in religion or [[animal worship]] (or in general [[nature worship]]), with some religions banning killing of any animal; One of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life&lt;!-- ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;234)--&gt;. According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. See also [[#Religions|in section above]].

In contrast, in other religions, animals can be [[unclean animal|unclean]], with in general allowing eating all except for these; "[[The Torah]] allows eating certain kinds of "winged swarming things" (i.e. insects) while prohibiting others".

===Islam===
{{Main|Animals in Islam}}

[[File:Amina Abaza with Dog.jpg|thumb|175px|Amina Tharwat Abaza{{snd}} Animal rights activist. Founder of [[Society for Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt]] holding a street dog.]]
Animal rights were recognized early by the [[Sharia]] (Islamic law). This recognition is based on both the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Hadith]]. In the Qur'an, there are many references to animals, detailing that they have souls, form communities, communicate with God and worship Him in their own way. [[Muhammad]] forbade his followers to harm any animal and asked them to respect the rights of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Animals|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a distinctive characteristic of the Shariah that all animals have legal rights. Othman Llewellyn even argues that Shariah has mechanisms for the full repair of injuries suffered by non-human creatures including their representation in court, assessment of injuries and awarding of relief to them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The classical Muslim jurist 'Izz ad-Din ibn 'Abd as-Salam, who flourished during the thirteenth century, formulated the following statement of animal rights:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rights of livestock and animals upon man: these are that he spend on them the provision that their kinds require, even if they have aged or sickened such that no benefit comes from them; that he not burden them beyond what they can bear; that he not put them together with anything by which they would be injured, whether of their own kind or other species, and whether by breaking their bones or butting or wounding; that he slaughters them with kindness when he slaughters them, and neither flay their skins nor break their bones until their bodies have become cold and their lives have passed away; that he not slaughter their young within their sight, but that he isolate them; that he makes comfortable their resting places and watering places; that he puts their males and females together during their mating seasons; that he not discard those which he takes as game; and neither shoots them with anything that breaks their bones nor brings about their destruction by any means that renders their meat unlawful to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last='Abd as-Salam|first='Izz ad-Din |title=Qawaa'id AlAhkaam fi Masaalih AlAnaam |publisher=AlMaktaba AlTijaariya AlKubra |location=Cairo |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, animal sacrifice is a prominent feature of [[Eid al-Adha#Traditions and practices|''Eid al-Adha'' observances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/42661/the-cost-of-sacrifice/ |title=Bakra Eid: The cost of sacrifice |publisher=Asian Correspondent |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and legal approaches==

===Overview===
{{Further|Consequentialism|Deontological ethics}}
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Martha Nussbaum]], Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, is a proponent of the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]] to animal rights.]]
The two main philosophical approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, and the latter by Tom Regan and [[Gary Francione]]. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those that focus on the principle behind the act, almost regardless of consequences (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts we should never perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Craig (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of positions that can be defended from a consequentalist or deontologist perspective, including the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]], represented by [[Martha Nussbaum]], and the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian approach]], which has been examined by Ingmar Persson and [[Peter Vallentyne]]. The capabilities approach focuses on what individuals require to fulfill their capabilities: Nussbaum (2006) argues that animals need a right to life, some control over their environment, company, play, and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum (2006), pp. 388ff, 393ff; also see Nussbaum (2004), p. 299ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark]], [[Mary Midgley]], and [[Bernard Rollin]] also discuss animal rights in terms of animals being permitted to lead a life appropriate for their kind.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2009): see Clark (1977); Rollin (1981); Midgley (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes the interests of the worse off more important than those of the better off.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25115834 Vallentyne (2005)]; Vallentyne (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, [[virtue ethics]], holds that in considering how to act we should consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents we should be. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands (2009), p. 98ff; Hursthouse (2000a); Hursthouse (2000b), p. 146ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Rowlands]] has proposed a [[Social contract|contractarian]] approach.&lt;ref name=Rowlands1998p118/&gt;&lt;!--expand Clark, Nussbaum, virtue ethics--&gt;

===Utilitarianism===
{{further|Equal consideration of interests|Utilitarianism}}
{{rquote|right|''They talk about this thing in the head; what do they call it?'' ["Intellect," whispered someone nearby.] ''That's it. What's that got to do with women's rights or Negroes' rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?'' — [[Sojourner Truth]]&lt;ref name=Singer1990p6&gt;Singer (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Nussbaum (2004) writes that utilitarianism, starting with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, has contributed more to the recognition of the moral status of animals than any other ethical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum (2004), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The utilitarian philosopher most associated with animal rights is Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University. Singer is not a rights theorist, but uses the language of rights to discuss how we ought to treat individuals. He is a [[Preference utilitarianism|preference utilitarian]], meaning that he judges the rightness of an act by the extent to which it satisfies the preferences (interests) of those affected.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of preference utilitarianism, see Singer (2011), pp. 14ff, 94ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

His position is that there is no reason not to give equal consideration to the interests of human and nonhumans, though his principle of equality does not require identical treatment. A mouse and a man both have an interest in not being kicked, and there are no moral or logical grounds for failing to accord those interests equal weight. Interests are predicated on the ability to suffer, nothing more, and once it is established that a being has interests, those interests must be given equal consideration.&lt;ref name=Singer7&gt;Singer (1990), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer quotes the English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] (1838–1900): "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view&amp;nbsp;... of the Universe, than the good of any other."&lt;ref name=Singer5/&gt;

[[File:Singer1.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Peter Singer]]: interests are predicated on the ability to suffer.]]
Singer argues that equality of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if the equality of the sexes were based only on the idea that men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer.&lt;ref name=Singer1990p4&gt;Singer (1990), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators on all sides of the debate now accept that animals suffer and feel pain, although it was not always so. [[Bernard Rollin]], professor of philosophy, animal sciences, and biomedical sciences at Colorado State University, writes that Descartes' influence continued to be felt until the 1980s. Veterinarians trained in the US before 1989 were taught to ignore pain, he writes, and at least one major veterinary hospital in the 1960s did not stock narcotic analgesics for animal pain control. In his interactions with scientists, he was often asked to "prove" that animals are conscious, and to provide "scientifically acceptable" evidence that they could feel pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117&gt;Rollin (1989), pp. xii, pp. 117–118; [http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n6/full/7400996.html Rollin (2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific publications have made it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), pp. 10–17, citing Stamp Dawkins (1980), Walker (1983), and Griffin (1984); Garner (2005), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals [[animal language|have no language]]. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that there is no reason to suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990) p. 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subjects-of-a-life===
{{further|The Case for Animal Rights}}
[[File:TomRegan2.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Tom Regan]]: animals are subjects-of-a-life.]]
Tom Regan, professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University, argues in ''The Case for Animal Rights'' (1983) that nonhuman animals are what he calls "subjects-of-a-life", and as such are bearers of rights.&lt;ref name=Regan243&gt;Regan (1983), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that, because the moral rights of humans are based on their possession of certain [[Cognition|cognitive]] abilities, and because these abilities are also possessed by at least some nonhuman animals, such animals must have the same moral rights as humans. Although only humans act as moral agents, both marginal-case humans, such as infants, and at least some nonhumans must have the status of "moral patients".&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt;

Moral patients are unable to formulate moral principles, and as such are unable to do right or wrong, even though what they do may be beneficial or harmful. Only moral agents are able to engage in moral action. Animals for Regan have "[[Intrinsic value (animal ethics)|intrinsic value]]" as subjects-of-a-life, and cannot be regarded as a means to an end, a view that places him firmly in the abolitionist camp. His theory does not extend to all animals, but only to those that can be regarded as subjects-of-a-life.&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt; He argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;individuals are subjects-of-a-life if they have beliefs and desires; perception, memory, and a sense of the future, including their own future; an emotional life together with feelings of pleasure and pain; preference- and welfare-interests; the ability to initiate action in pursuit of their desires and goals; a psychophysical identity over time; and an individual welfare in the sense that their experiential life fares well or ill for them, logically independently of their utility for others and logically independently of their being the object of anyone else's interests.&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas Singer is primarily concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes we ought to treat nonhuman animals as we would humans. He applies the strict [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] ideal (which Kant himself applied only to humans) that they ought never to be sacrificed as a means to an end, and must be treated as ends in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionism===
{{further|Abolitionism (animal rights)|Animals, Property, and the Law}}
[[File:Gary Francione (cropped).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Gary Francione]]: animals need only the right not to be regarded as property.]]
Gary Francione, professor of law and philosophy at [[Rutgers Law School]] in Newark, is a leading abolitionist writer, arguing that animals need only one right, the right not to be owned. Everything else would follow from that [[paradigm shift]]. He writes that, although most people would condemn the mistreatment of animals, and in many countries there are laws that seem to reflect those concerns, "in practice the legal system allows any use of animals, however abhorrent." The law only requires that any suffering not be "unnecessary". In deciding what counts as "unnecessary", an animal's interests are weighed against the interests of human beings, and the latter almost always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1990), pp. 4, 17ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francione's ''Animals, Property, and the Law'' (1995) was the first extensive jurisprudential treatment of animal rights. In it, Francione compares the situation of animals to the treatment of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]], where legislation existed that appeared to protect them, while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery itself rendered the protection unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers as an example the United States [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]], which he describes as an example of symbolic legislation, intended to assuage public concern about the treatment of animals, but difficult to implement.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), p. 208ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that a focus on animal welfare, rather than animal rights, may worsen the position of animals by making the public feel comfortable about using them and entrenching the view of them as property. He calls animal rights groups who pursue animal welfare issues, such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], the "[[Animal protectionism|new welfarists]]", arguing that they have more in common with 19th-century animal protectionists than with the animal rights movement; indeed, the terms "animal protection" and "protectionism" are increasingly favored. His position in 1996 was that there is no animal rights movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AmKARgx_FCgC&amp;pg=PA32 Francione (1996), p. 32ff]

===Contractarianism===
{{further|Social contract}}
[[Mark Rowlands]], professor of philosophy at the University of Florida, has proposed a contractarian approach, based on the [[original position]] and the [[veil of ignorance]]—a "state of nature" thought experiment that tests intuitions about justice and fairness—in [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971). In the original position, individuals choose principles of justice (what kind of society to form, and how primary social goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual characteristics—their race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they are able-bodied or disabled, rich or poor—and therefore unaware of which role they will assume in the society they are about to form.&lt;ref name=Rowlands1998p118&gt;Rowlands (1998), p. 118ff, particularly pp. 147–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is that, operating behind the veil of ignorance, they will choose a social contract in which there is basic fairness and justice for them no matter the position they occupy. Rawls did not include species membership as one of the attributes hidden from the decision makers in the original position. Rowlands proposes extending the veil of ignorance to include rationality, which he argues is an undeserved property similar to characteristics including race, sex and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Rowlands1998p118"/&gt;

===''Prima facie'' rights theory===
{{further|Prima facie right}}
American philosopher Timothy Garry has proposed an approach that deems nonhuman animals worthy of ''prima facie'' rights. In a philosophical context, a ''prima facie'' (Latin for "on the face of it" or "at first glance") right is one that appears to be applicable at first glance, but upon closer examination may be outweighed by other considerations. In his book ''Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory'', Lawrence Hinman characterizes such rights as "the right is real but leaves open the question of whether it is applicable and overriding in a particular situation".&lt;ref name="Hinman1998p208"&gt;Hinman, Lawrence M. Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory. Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace College, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that nonhuman animals are worthy of ''prima facie'' rights is to say that, in a sense, animals do have rights. However, these rights can be overridden by many other considerations, especially those conflicting a human's right to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Garry supports his view arguing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;if a nonhuman animal were to kill a human being in the U.S., it would have broken the laws of the land and would probably get rougher sanctions than if it were a human.  My point is that like laws govern all who interact within a society, rights are to be applied to all beings who interact within that society.  This is not to say these rights endowed by humans are equivalent to those held by nonhuman animals, but rather that if humans possess rights then so must all those who interact with humans.&lt;ref name=Garry2012p6&gt;Garry, Timothy J. Nonhuman Animals: Possessors of Prima Facie Rights (2012), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In sum, Garry suggests that humans have obligations to nonhuman animals; however, animals do not, and ought not to, have uninfringible rights against humans.

===Feminism and animal rights===
{{further|Women and animal advocacy|Ethics of care|Feminist ethics}}
[[File:Carol J. Adams with Snowball.jpg|thumb|180px|The American [[Ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] [[Carol J. Adams|Carol Adams]] has written extensively about the link between feminism and animal rights, starting with ''The Sexual Politics of Meat'' (1990).]]
Women have played a central role in animal advocacy since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lansbury et al"&gt;Lansbury (1985); Adams (1990); Donovan (1993); Gruen (1993); Adams (1994); Adams and Donovan (1995); Adams (2004); MacKinnon (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-vivisection movement in the 19th and early 20th century in England and the United States was largely run by women, including [[Francis Power Cobbe]], [[Anna Kingsford]], [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] and [[Caroline Earle White]] (1833–1916).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4289385 Kean (1995)].&lt;/ref&gt; Garner writes that 70 per cent of the membership of the Victoria Street Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by Cobbe) were women, as were 70 per cent of the membership of the British RSPCA in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), p. 141, citing Elston (1990), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern animal advocacy movement has a similar representation of women, though Garner (2005) writes that they are not invariably in leadership positions: during the March for Animals in Washington, D.C., in 1990—the largest animal rights demonstration held until then in the United States—most of the participants were women, but most of the platform speakers were men.&lt;ref name=Garner2005p142&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, several influential animal advocacy groups have been founded by women, including the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] by Cobbe in London in 1898; the [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] in 1962; and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], co-founded by [[Ingrid Newkirk]] in 1980. In the Netherlands, [[Marianne Thieme]] and [[Esther Ouwehand]] were elected to parliament in 2006 representing the Parliamentary group for Animals.

The preponderance of women in the movement has led to a body of academic literature exploring feminism and animal rights; feminism and vegetarianism or veganism, the oppression of women and animals, and the male association of women and animals with nature and emotion, rather than reason—an association that several feminist writers have embraced.&lt;ref name="Lansbury et al"/&gt; [[Lori Gruen]] writes that women and animals serve the same symbolic function in a patriarchal society: both are "the used"; the dominated, submissive "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gruen (1993), p. 60ff.&lt;/ref&gt; When the British feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) published ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1758–1835), a Cambridge philosopher, responded with an anonymous parody, ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'' (1792), claiming that Wollstonecraft's arguments for women's rights could be applied equally to animals, a position he intended as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--add something about language; treatment of female animals; feminist care ethic; suffragettes--&gt;

===Transhumanism===

Some [[transhumanism|transhumanists]] argue for animal rights, liberation, and "uplift" of animal consciousness into machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethics of Animal Enhancement|author=George Dvorsky|author-link=George Dvorsky|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/dvorsky20110729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transhumanism also understands animal rights on a gradation or spectrum with other types of sentient rights, including human rights and the rights of conscious artificial intelligences (posthuman rights).&lt;ref Name="Evans 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | journal = Teknokultura | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | date = 2015 | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310 | accessdate = December 5, 2016| doi = 10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics===

====R. G. Frey====
[[R. G. Frey]], professor of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in ''Interests and Rights'' (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences."&lt;ref&gt;Frey (1989), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carl Cohen====
[[Carl Cohen (professor)|Carl Cohen]], professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan, argues that rights holders must be able to distinguish between their own interests and what is right. "The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules, [they]&amp;nbsp;... must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked." Cohen rejects Singer's argument that, since a brain-damaged human could not make moral judgments, moral judgments cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen writes that the test for moral judgment "is not a test to be administered to humans one by one", but should be applied to the capacity of members of the species in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/phil1200, Spr07/cohen.pdf Cohen (1986)]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

====Richard Posner====
[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|150px|Judge [[Richard Posner]]: "facts will drive equality."&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;]]
Judge [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] debated the issue of animal rights in 2001 with Peter Singer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dialogues/features/2001/animal_rights/_2.html Singer (June 15, 2001)].&lt;/ref&gt; Posner posits that his [[Ethical intuitionism|moral intuition]] tells him "that human beings prefer their own. If a dog threatens a human infant, even if it requires causing more pain to the dog to stop it, than the dog would have caused to the infant, then we favour the child. It would be monstrous to spare the dog."&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/110101/entry/110129/ Posner (June 15, 2001)]; [http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm Posner-Singer debate in full], courtesy link on utilitarian.net.
*Also see Posner (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer challenges this by arguing that formerly unequal rights for gays, women, and certain races were justified using the same set of intuitions. Posner replies that equality in civil rights did not occur because of ethical arguments, but because facts mounted that there were no morally significant differences between humans based on race, sex, or sexual orientation that would support inequality. If and when similar facts emerge about humans and animals, the differences in rights will erode too. But facts will drive equality, not ethical arguments that run contrary to instinct, he argues. Posner calls his approach "soft utilitarianism", in contrast to Singer's "hard utilitarianism". He argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "soft" utilitarian position on animal rights is a moral intuition of many, probably most, Americans. We realize that animals feel pain, and we think that to inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition in the language of philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Roger Scruton, September 2002.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Roger Scruton]]: rights imply obligations.]]

====Roger Scruton====
[[Roger Scruton]], the British philosopher, argues that rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, "your right may be my duty." Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as "the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt;

He accuses animal rights advocates of "pre-scientific" [[anthropomorphism]], attributing traits to animals that are, he says, [[Beatrix Potter]]-like, where "only man is vile." It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.
*Scruton (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton singled out [[Peter Singer]], a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism. He wrote that Singer's works, including ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', "contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger.

==Continuity between humans and nonhuman animals==
[[File:Bonobo 009.jpg|thumb|A [[bonobo]], a nonhuman great ape]]

In 2010, research led by psychologist [[Diana Reiss]] and zoologist Lori Marino was presented to a conference in San Diego, suggesting that [[dolphin]]s are second in intelligence only to human beings, and concluded that they should be regarded as nonhuman persons. Marino used [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans to compare the dolphin and primate brain; she said the scans indicated there was "psychological continuity" between dolphins and humans. Reiss's research suggested that dolphins are able to solve complex problems, use tools, and pass the [[mirror test]], using a mirror to inspect parts of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Public attitudes ==

According to a paper published in 2000 by Harold Herzog and Lorna Dorr, previous academic surveys of attitudes towards animal rights have tended to suffer from small sample sizes and non-representative groups.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Harold; Dorr, Lorna (2000) "Electronically Available Surveys of Attitudes Toward Animals", ''Society &amp; Animals'' 10:2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of factors appear to correlate with the attitude of individuals regarding the treatment of animals and animal rights. These include gender, age, occupation, religion, and level of education. There has also been evidence to suggest that prior experience with [[pet|companion animals]] may be a factor in people's attitudes.&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006"&gt;Apostol, L., Rebega, O.L. &amp; Miclea, M. (2013). "Psychological and Socio-Demographic Predictors of Attitudes towards Animals". ''Social and Behavioural Sciences'', 78, pages 521–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are more likely to empathize with the cause of animal rights than men.&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Harold. (2007). "Gender Differences in Human-Animal Interactions: A Review". ''Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of The Interactions of People &amp; Animals''. 20:1. Pages 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 study of adolescents by Linda Pifer suggested that factors that may partially explain this discrepancy include attitudes towards [[feminism]] and science, scientific literacy, and the presence of a greater emphasis on "nurturance or compassion" among women.&lt;ref&gt;Pifer, Linda. (1996). "Exploring the Gender Gap in Young Adults' Attitudes about Animal Research". ''Society and Animals''. 4:1. Pages 37–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 survey to examine whether or not people who believed in evolution were more likely to support animal rights than [[creationism|creationists]] and believers in [[intelligent design]] found that this was largely the case – according to the researchers, the respondents who were strong [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]]s and believers in [[creationism]] were less likely to advocate for animal rights than those who were less fundamentalist in their beliefs. The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLeeuwa, Jamie; Galen, Luke; Aebersold, Cassandra; Stanton, Victoria (2007). "[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/745_s3.pdf Support for Animal Rights as a Function of Belief in Evolution, Religious Fundamentalism, and Religious Denomination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620141651/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/745_s3.pdf |date=2013-06-20 }}", ''Society and Animals'' 15, pages 353–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, Shelley L.; Herzog Jr., Harold A. (1992) "Ethical Ideology, Animal Rights Activism, And Attitudes Toward The Treatment Of Animals." ''Ethics &amp; Behavior'' 2.3. Pages 141–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two surveys found that attitudes towards animal rights tactics, such as [[direct action]], are very diverse within the animal rights communities. Near half (50% and 39% in two surveys) of activists do not support direct action. One survey concluded "it would be a mistake to portray animal rights activists as homogeneous."&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An attitude survey of animal rights activists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11941">'''Arthur P. Bochner''' is an American communication scholar known for his research and teaching on intimate relationships, qualitative inquiry, narrative, and [[autoethnography]]. He holds the rank of [[Distinguished University Professor]] at the [[University of South Florida]] and is an Honorary Professor at the [[Communication University of China]]. Bochner is the former President of the [[National Communication Association]] and Vice-President of the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. Among his publications are two books, two edited collections, and more than 100 book articles, chapters, and essays on communication theory, family and [[interpersonal communication]], love and marriage, and the philosophies and methodologies of the human sciences, especially [[narrative inquiry]] and [[autoethnography]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/abochner/.

== Early life ==
Bochner was raised in Pittsburgh. His father was a sign painter and his mother worked as an editorial assistant at ''The Jewish Chronicle''. Bochner’s interest in existential philosophy began at [[Taylor Allderdice High School]] where, in his senior thesis on [[Albert Camus]]' ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', he wrote, “All that was real—all that could be known—was what one could feel in his heart or touch through experience in the world. There is no truth beyond experience.”&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Bochner, A. (2014). Arthur P. Bochner, 2008 President National Communication Association. Review of Communication. 14, 71-88. DOI: 10.1080/15358593.2014.941687&lt;/ref&gt;  After high school he attended California State University in Pennsylvania where he participated in debate and extemporaneous speaking. He graduated with a B.S. in Speech Communication, then taught English and Speech at East High School in Auburn, New York. He earned an M.A. in Speech from [[Syracuse University]] and Ph.D. in Communication from [[Bowling Green State University]]. His doctoral dissertation was an experimental study of social relations entitled, ''A Multivariate Investigation of [[Machiavellianism]] and Task Structure in Four-Man Groups''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

== Research and teaching ==
Bochner’s early research focused on interpersonal and group communication in the empiricist tradition using experimental design and multivariate statistics.  He spent three years as Assistant Professor at Cleveland State University and ten years at Temple University where he ascended through the academic ranks, achieving promotion to professor in 1982.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 1976, Bochner published “Conceptual Frontiers in the Study of Families: An Introduction to the Literature,” a foundational essay for which he later received NCA’s Brommel Award for distinguished contributions to family communication. He also received awards for foundational essays on interpersonal competence (with Clifford Kelly)&lt;ref&gt;Bochner, A., &amp; Kelly, C. (1974). Interpersonal Competence: Rationale, Philosophy, and Implementation of a Conceptual Framework. Speech Teacher, 23, 279-301&lt;/ref&gt; and autoethnography (with [[Carolyn Ellis]]). Bochner has been honored with numerous awards for career achievements in research and teaching including The Michael Osborne Teacher/Scholar Award, The Charles Woolbert Award (with [[Carolyn Ellis]]), Ohio University’s Elizabeth Andersch Career Achievement Award, and the McKnight Foundation’s William R. Jones Award for mentoring minority graduate students.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Bochner acknowledges he is influenced by the communication theory of [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[R.D. Laing]], the humanistic psychology of [[Carl Rogers]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Rollo May]], and the fieldwork of [[Erving Goffman]], [[Jules Henry]], and [[Clifford Geertz]], inspiring him “to break away from received traditions—to innovate, create, and experiment with new or different methods of inquiring into and representing lived experiences” (p.&amp;nbsp;297).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Bochner, A. (2014). Coming to Narrative: A Personal History of Paradigm Change in the Human Sciences. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Bochner joined the Department of Communication at the University of South Florida. He became Chair of the department in 1985, guiding the department’s creation of the first Ph.D. program exclusively devoted to qualitative research in communication. In 1990, he left administration to collaborate with sociologist [[Carolyn Ellis]], and become Co-Director of the Institute for Interpretive Human Studies. In 1996, Ellis and Bochner co-edited, ''Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing'', a book widely recognized as the first volume to promote forms of autoethnographic inquiry designed to bridge humanities and social science research. Bochner and Ellis teamed up as editors of two book series emphasizing autoethnography and personal narrative, which have yielded more than thirty books representing evocative and novel forms of representing lived experience, bringing attention to emotions, [[subjectivity]], embodiment, and personal storytelling. He chaired the department for another two-year term in 1992. By 2004, the department had achieved distinction as a center of excellence in narrative and autoethnographic inquiry. In 2008, Bochner served as President of the [[National Communication Association]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2014, Bochner published ''Coming to Narrative: A Personal History of Paradigm Change in the Human Sciences'', an autoethnographic story that layers theory and story, weaving his professional and personal life with the social and historical contexts in which they developed. NCA’s Ethnography Division presented their 2014 “Best Book Award” to Bochner and their “Legacy Award” for distinguished lifetime achievement in ethnography. The [[National Communication Association]] also named Bochner as a Distinguished Scholar. In 2015, Coming to Narrative was honored with a "Best Book" Award by the International Congress for Qualitative Inquiry. Bochner made numerous innovations in the teaching curriculum of communication studies. He introduced courses on marital and family communication, and inaugurated undergraduate courses on Love and Communication, Writing Lives, and Relationships on Film, and graduate courses on Communication As Social Construction, Writing Workshop, Close Relationships, and Narrative Inquiry.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[statistics]] and [[machine learning]], the '''bias–variance tradeoff''' is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models with a lower [[bias (statistics)|bias]] in [[statistical parameter|parameter]] [[estimation theory|estimation]] have a higher [[variance]] of the parameter estimates across [[sample (statistics)|samples]], and vice versa. The '''bias–variance dilemma''' or '''problem''' is the conflict in trying to simultaneously minimize these two sources of [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error]] that prevent [[supervised learning]] algorithms from generalizing beyond their [[training set]]:{{Citation needed|reason=This is very generic statement, bias-variance is investigated in neural-networks and we need to put more references from Statistics literature |date=August 2017}}
* The [[Bias of an estimator|''bias'']] is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning [[algorithm]]. High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).
* The ''[[variance]]'' is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance can cause an algorithm to model the random [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] in the training data, rather than the intended outputs ([[overfitting]]).

The '''bias–variance decomposition''' is a way of analyzing a learning algorithm's [[expected value|expected]] [[generalization error]] with respect to a particular problem as a sum of three terms, the bias, variance, and a quantity called the ''irreducible error'', resulting from noise in the problem itself.

This tradeoff applies to all forms of [[supervised learning]]: [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]] (function fitting),&lt;ref name="geman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geman |first1=Stuart |authorlink1=Stuart Geman |author2=E.

==Motivation==
The bias-variance tradeoff is a central problem in supervised learning. Ideally, one wants to [[Model selection|choose a model]] that both accurately captures the regularities in its training data, but also [[Generalization|generalizes]] well to unseen data. Unfortunately, it is typically impossible to do both simultaneously. High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with low variance typically produce simpler models that don't tend to overfit but may ''underfit'' their training data, failing to capture important regularities.

Models with low bias are usually more complex (e.g. higher-order regression polynomials), enabling them to represent the training set more accurately. In the process, however, they may also represent a large [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] component in the training set, making their predictions less accurate - despite their added complexity. In contrast, models with higher bias tend to be relatively simple (low-order or even linear regression polynomials) but may produce lower variance predictions when applied beyond the training set.

==Bias–variance decomposition of squared error==
Suppose that we have a training set consisting of a set of points &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; and real values &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; associated with each point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. We assume that there is a function with noise &lt;math&gt;y = f(x) + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where the noise, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, has zero mean and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;.

We want to find a function &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, that approximates the true function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as well as possible, by means of some learning algorithm. We make "as well as possible" precise by measuring the [[mean squared error]] between &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt;: we want &lt;math&gt;(y - \hat{f}(x))^2&lt;/math&gt; to be minimal, both for &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; ''and for points outside of our sample''. Of course, we cannot hope to do so perfectly, since the &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; contain noise &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;; this means we must be prepared to accept an ''irreducible error'' in any function we come up with.

Finding an &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt; that generalizes to points outside of the training set can be done with any of the countless algorithms used for supervised learning. It turns out that whichever function &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt; we select, we can decompose its [[expected value|expected]] error on an unseen sample &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as follows:&lt;ref name="islr"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gareth James |author2=Daniela Witten |author3=Trevor Hastie |author4=Robert Tibshirani |title=An Introduction to Statistical Learning |publisher=Springer |year=2013 |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name="ESL"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Trevor |last1=Hastie |first2=Robert |last2=Tibshirani |first3=Jerome |last3=Friedman |year=2009 |title=The Elements of Statistical Learning |url=http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}\Big[\big(y - \hat{f}(x)\big)^2\Big]
 &amp; = \Big(\operatorname{Bias}\big[\hat{f}(x)\big] \Big) ^2 + \operatorname{Var}\big[\hat{f}(x)\big] + \sigma^2 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \operatorname{Bias}\big[\hat{f}(x)\big] = \operatorname{E}\big[\hat{f}(x) - f(x)\big]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{Var}\big[\hat{f}(x)\big] = \operatorname{E}[\hat{f}(x)^2] - \Big(\operatorname{E}[{\hat{f}}(x)]\Big)^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The expectation ranges over different choices of the training set &lt;math&gt;x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_n&lt;/math&gt;, all sampled from the same joint distribution &lt;math&gt;P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. The three terms represent:
* the square of the ''bias'' of the learning method, which can be thought of as the error caused by the simplifying assumptions built into the method. E.g., when approximating a non-linear function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; using a learning method for [[linear model]]s, there will be error in the estimates &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt; due to this assumption;
* the ''variance'' of the learning method, or, intuitively, how much the learning method &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt; will move around its mean;
* the irreducible error &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;. Since all three terms are non-negative, this forms a lower bound on the expected error on unseen samples.&lt;ref name="islr"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

The more complex the model &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is, the more data points it will capture, and the lower the bias will be. However, complexity will make the model "move" more to capture the data points, and hence its variance will be larger.

The derivation of the bias–variance decomposition for squared error proceeds as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Sethu |last1=Vijayakumar |title=The Bias–Variance Tradeoff |publisher=University Edinburgh |year=2007 |accessdate=19 August 2014 |url=http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlsc/Notes/Lecture4/BiasVariance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notes on derivation of bias-variance decomposition in linear regression |first=Greg|last=Shakhnarovich |year=2011 |accessdate=20 August 2014 |url=http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~gregory/courses/wis-ml2012/lectures/biasVarDecom.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821063842/http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~gregory/courses/wis-ml2012/lectures/biasVarDecom.pdf|archivedate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For notational convenience, abbreviate &lt;math&gt;f = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{f} = \hat{f}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. First, recall that, by definition, for any random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{Var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - \Big(\operatorname{E}[X]\Big)^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Rearranging, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \operatorname{Var}[X] + \Big(\operatorname{E}[X]\Big)^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[f] = f
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

This, given &lt;math&gt;y = f + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\varepsilon] = 0&lt;/math&gt;, implies &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[y] = \operatorname{E}[f + \varepsilon] = \operatorname{E}[f] = f&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[\varepsilon] = \sigma^2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{Var}[y] = \operatorname{E}[(y - \operatorname{E}[y])^2] = \operatorname{E}[(y - f)^2] = \operatorname{E}[(f + \varepsilon - f)^2] = \operatorname{E}[\varepsilon^2] = \operatorname{Var}[\varepsilon] + \Big(\operatorname{E}[\varepsilon]\Big)^2  = \sigma^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, since &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt; are independent, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}\big[(y - \hat{f})^2\big]
 &amp; = \operatorname{E}[y^2 + \hat{f}^2 - 2 y\hat{f}] \\
 &amp; = \operatorname{E}[y^2] + \operatorname{E}[\hat{f}^2] - \operatorname{E}[2y\hat{f}] \\
 &amp; = \operatorname{Var}[y] + \operatorname{E}[y]^2 + \operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}] + \operatorname{E}[\hat{f}]^2 - 2f\operatorname{E}[\hat{f}] \\
 &amp; = \operatorname{Var}[y] + \operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}] + \Big(f^2 - 2f\operatorname{E}[\hat{f}] + \operatorname{E}[\hat{f}]^2\Big) \\
 &amp; = \operatorname{Var}[y] + \operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}] + (f - \operatorname{E}[\hat{f}])^2 \\
 &amp; = \sigma^2 + \operatorname{Var}[\hat{f}] + \operatorname{Bias}[\hat{f}]^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Application to regression ==
The bias–variance decomposition forms the conceptual basis for regression [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] methods such as [[Lasso (statistics)|Lasso]] and [[ridge regression]]. Regularization methods introduce bias into the regression solution that can reduce variance considerably relative to the [[ordinary least squares|ordinary least squares (OLS)]] solution.  Although the OLS solution provides non-biased regression estimates, the lower variance solutions produced by regularization techniques provide superior MSE performance.

==Application to classification==
The bias–variance decomposition was originally formulated for least-squares regression. For the case of [[statistical classification|classification]] under the [[0-1 loss]] (misclassification rate), it is possible to find a similar decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Domingos |first=Pedro |title=A unified bias-variance decomposition |conference=ICML |year=2000 |url=http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/bvd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Giorgio |last1=Valentini |first2=Thomas G. |last2=Dietterich |title=Bias–variance analysis of support vector machines for the development of SVM-based ensemble methods |journal=[[Journal of Machine Learning Research|JMLR]] |volume=5 |year=2004 |pages=725–775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, if the classification problem can be phrased as [[probabilistic classification]], then the expected squared error of the predicted probabilities with respect to the true probabilities can be decomposed as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Christopher D. |last1=Manning |first2=Prabhakar |last2=Raghavan |first3=Hinrich |last3=Schütze |title=Introduction to Information Retrieval |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/ |pages=308–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
[[Dimensionality reduction]] and [[feature selection]] can decrease variance by simplifying models. Similarly, a larger training set tends to decrease variance. Adding features (predictors) tends to decrease bias, at the expense of introducing additional variance. Learning algorithms typically have some tunable parameters that control bias and variance; for example,
* ([[Generalized linear model|Generalized]]) linear models can be [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularized]] to decrease their variance at the cost of increasing their bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Belsley | first = David | title = Conditioning diagnostics : collinearity and weak data in regression | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0471528890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[artificial neural network]]s, the variance increases and the bias decreases with the number of hidden units increase.&lt;ref name="geman"/&gt; Like in GLMs, regularization is typically applied.
* In [[k-nearest neighbor]] models, a high value of {{mvar|k}} leads to high bias and low variance (see below).
* In [[instance-based learning]], regularization can be achieved varying the mixture of [[prototype]]s and exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliardi | first1 = F | year = 2011 | title = Instance-based classifiers applied to medical databases: diagnosis and knowledge extraction | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence in Medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 123–139 | doi = 10.1016/j.artmed.2011.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[decision tree]]s, the depth of the tree determines the variance. Decision trees are commonly pruned to control variance.&lt;ref name="islr"/&gt;{{rp|307}}

One way of resolving the trade-off is to use [[mixture models]] and [[ensemble learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Jo-Anne Ting, Sethu Vijaykumar, Stefan Schaal, Locally Weighted Regression for Control. In Encyclopedia of Machine Learning. Eds. Claude Sammut, Geoffrey I. Webb. Springer 2011. p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Fortmann-Roe. Understanding the Bias–Variance Tradeoff. 2012. http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[Boosting (machine learning)|boosting]] combines many "weak" (high bias) models in an ensemble that has lower bias than the individual models, while [[Bootstrap aggregating|bagging]] combines "strong" learners in a way that reduces their variance.

===''k''-nearest neighbors===
In the case of [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|{{mvar|k}}-nearest neighbors regression]], a [[closed-form expression]] exists that relates the bias–variance decomposition to the parameter {{mvar|k}}:&lt;ref name="ESL"/&gt;{{rp|37, 223}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{E}[(y - \hat{f}(x))^2\mid X=x] = \left( f(x) - \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k f(N_i(x)) \right)^2 + \frac{\sigma^2}{k} + \sigma^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_1(x), \dots, N_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; are the {{mvar|k}} nearest neighbors of {{mvar|x}} in the training set. The bias (first term) is a monotone rising function of {{mvar|k}}, while the variance (second term) drops off as {{mvar|k}} is increased. In fact, under "reasonable assumptions" the bias of the first-nearest neighbor (1-NN) estimator vanishes entirely as the size of the training set approaches infinity.&lt;ref name="geman"/&gt;

==Application to human learning==
While widely discussed in the context of machine learning, the bias-variance dilemma has been examined in the context of [[Cognitive science|human cognition]], most notably by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and co-workers in the context of learned heuristics. They have argued (see references below) that the human brain resolves the dilemma in the case of the typically sparse, poorly-characterised training-sets provided by experience by adopting high-bias/low variance heuristics. This reflects the fact that a zero-bias approach has poor generalisability to new situations, and also unreasonably presumes precise knowledge of the true state of the world. The resulting heuristics are relatively simple, but produce better inferences in a wider variety of situations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Stuart Geman|Geman]] et al.&lt;ref name="geman"/&gt; argue that the bias-variance dilemma implies that abilities such as generic object recognition cannot be learned from scratch, but require a certain degree of “hard wiring”   that is later tuned by experience.  This is because model-free approaches to inference require impractically large training sets if they are to avoid high variance.

The '''DatabaseObjects''' library is an open source tool for mapping relational database systems (MySQL, SQL Server, SQL Server Compact Edition, SQLite, Microsoft Access, Pervasive and HyperSQL) to an object-oriented structures. The library can simplify the development and maintenance of small and large systems by providing a mechanism to consolidate business logic, maintain data integrity, increasing productivity and minimise errors. The library is available for [[VB6]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and [[iOS]]/[[MonoTouch]] development environments.

===How Does it Work===
The DatabaseObjects library contains a large set of classes that interface to the underlying database system automatically generating the required SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE commands. It also supports CREATE/ALTER TABLE, CREATE/ALTER INDEX, table joins, arithmetic expressions, aggregates, grouping, ordering, unions, support for all common data types and more. The .NET and VB6 versions of the library both support access to Microsoft Access, SQL Server and MySQL database systems. The Pervasive database system is only supported in the .NET version of the library.

===Using the Library===
Implementing a database table using classes and the DatabaseObjects library involves creating two classes. The first class, represents a database table, while the second class represent each database record in the table. For the classes to "hook into" the library the first class (or collection class) must inherit from DatabaseObjects while the second class must inherit from DatabaseObject. By inheriting from DatabaseObjects the collection class can specify which table it is tied to, the table's unique field, whether it should only represent a subset of the table, how the table should be sorted, if there are any related tables, etc. while the second class can specify how a database record is to be copied to and from the class. The MustOverride functions in the DatabaseObjects class are used to automatically generate the appropriate SQL statements for common database functions such as inserting a new record, updating an existing record, searching through a table, enumerating through a set of records, returning the number of records in a table, etc.

The diagram below depicts how a Products database table might be implemented using the library. Two classes would be required; a Products class that inherits from DatabaseObjects and a Product class that inherits from DatabaseObject. Once the MustOverride functions have been implemented the library can then be used with the DatabaseObjects library's set of predefined, generic functions to automatically generate and execute the necessary SQL statements. For example, the Count property in the Products class could call one of the predefined DatabaseObjects functions: DatabaseObjects.ObjectsCount. This function creates an SQL statement using the value returned from DatabaseObjects.TableName (in this case "Products") to generate the following:

 SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM Products

The SQL statement is then executed and the result returned. If the DatabaseObjects.ObjectsCount function was called by passing a Customers class which had implemented DatabaseObjects.TableName to return "Customers" then the DatabaseObjects.ObjectsCount function would generate and execute the statement:

 SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM Customers

This technique is used by the DatabaseObjects library and it's set of generic functions to provide the mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented structure.

'''Evgeny Torchinov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]] Евгений Алексеевич Торчинов), (August 22, 1956 – July 12, 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torchinov.com/архив/публикации-и-литература-о-е-а-торчинове/о-научном-наследии-е-а-торчинова/|publisher=torchinov.com|accessdate=2014-02-12|script-title=ru:О научном наследии Е.А. Торчинова (1956-2003)|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Russian sinologist, Buddhist scholar, professor, and translator. He was best known as an eminent Russian researcher of ancient [[Religion in China|Chinese religion]] and [[philosophy]], [[author]] of many books and translations of classical Chinese texts (especially Buddhist and Taoist) into Russian. He founded the chair of [[Eastern philosophy]] and cultures at [[St. Petersburg State University]].

==Life and career==
Evgeny Torchinov was born on August 22, 1956, in the city of [[Vladikavkaz|Ordzhonikidze]] (then USSR), and soon his family moved to Saratov. After graduation from high-school in 1973, Torchinov was admitted to the Faculty of Oriental Studies of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) State University]], where he majored in Chinese philology. After graduation in 1978, he became a Ph.D. candidate at the State Museum of History of Religion and Atheism, where he worked as a research fellow from 1981 to 1984. From 1984 and until 1994, he worked as researcher at the St.Petersburg branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences.

In 1994, he defended his second doctoral dissertation entitled "Taoism: An attempt of historical-religious description". In 1998, he became the Chair of Philosophy of Religion and Religious Studies at St. Petersburg State University, and in 1999 created and led as the chair of Oriental Philosophy and Cultures.

Torchinov began to consider himself a Buddhist in 1975. He was the official representative in Russia and a member of the Board of directors of, consultant and laic Buddhist lecturer for [[Buddha's Light International Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://board.buddhist.ru/showthread.php?690-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%91%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0&amp;p=9597&amp;viewfull=1#post9597 Cosmology of Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://klein.zen.ru/zen-spirit/biblio/torchinov-01.htm Interview with revered professor Torchinov]&lt;/ref&gt; and president of St. Petersburg Buddhist association ''Fo Guan (Buddha's Light)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhismofrussia.ru/_journals/buddhism-of-russia-08-09.doc Nartang Bulletin No. 8-9]&lt;/ref&gt; Torchinov called himself off-sect Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torchinov.com/%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%85%D0%B8%D0%B2/%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D1%8C%D1%8E/%D0%BC-%D0%B2-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0/ Interview with E. Torchinov and V. Vorobyov]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked as a visiting professor at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Torchinov died on July 12, 2003, in [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Academic activity==
Torchinov made contributions to [[Taoism]] studies and translation of classical Taoist treatises. In his doctoral thesis he provided a detailed review of Taoism, its history, schools and concepts, relying on Chinese sources and global sinology. Later, he had the Taoist review published as a monograph aimed for non-specialist audience.

Many of Torchinov's publications give an insight into the practical aspects of Taoism such as [[Taoist alchemy#Outer alchemy (Waidan)|Outer Alchemy]], [[Taoist alchemy#Inner alchemy (Neidan)|Inner Alchemy]], [[meditation]] techniques, [[afterlife]] techniques, and esoteric [[Taoist sexual practices|sex practices]].

Torchinov's long studies of [[Buddhism]] resulted in publication of an academic manual, ''Introduction to Buddhology''.

His academic interest in this field was focused on [[Mahajana]] and Far East Buddhism. He translated several authoritative Buddhist works from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Old Chinese]] into Russian, including ''The Treatise on evocation of trust in Mahajana''.

Torchinov translated a number of [[Ch'an Buddhism]] treatises, classical and modern.

Generalizing his religious studies, Torchinov released a book entitled ''Religions of the world: Experience of the Transcendence'' dealing with transcendental states of consciousness and psychic techniques. The book provides in-depth analyses of [[Shamanism]], [[Prehistoric religion|ancient religions]], [[sect]]s, and modern [[world religions]].

Torchinov wrote several works in comparative religious studies. Some of his works are also dedicated to [[Kabbalah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">'''False pleasure''' may be a [[pleasure]] based on a false belief (as of supposedly having come into money), or a pleasure compared with more real, or greater pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Blackburn, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] maintained that philosophers should seek to "discern not true pleasures from false, for such a distinction is impossible to make, but the true and false goods that pleasure points to".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Y. Stavrakakis, ''Lacan and the Political'' (1999) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical philosophy==

[[Plato]] devoted much attention to the belief that "no pleasure save that of the wise is quite true and pure - all others are shadows only"&lt;ref&gt;Alain de Botton intro., ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; - both in [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]] and in his late dialogue [[Philebus]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine]] saw false pleasure as focused on the body, as well as pervading the dramatic and rhetorical entertainments of his time.&lt;ref&gt;B. Krondorfer, ''Male Confessions'' (2009) p. 83 and p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asceticism==

[[Buddhaghosa]] considered that "sense-pleasures are impermanent, deceptive, trivial...unstable, unreal, hollow, and uncertain"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. Conze ed., ''Buddhist Scriptures'' (1975) p. 108-9&lt;/ref&gt; - a view echoed in most of what [[Max Weber]] termed "world-rejecting asceticism".&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 166 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Vain pleasure==

A specific false pleasure often denounced in Western thought is the pleasure of [[vanity]] - [[Voltaire]] for example pillorying the character "corrupted by vanity...He breathed in nothing but false glory and false pleasures".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Candide, Zadig, and Selected Stories'' (1961) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly [[John Ruskin]] contrasted the adult's pursuit of the false pleasure of vanity with the way the child does not seek false pleasures; its pleasures are true, simple, and instinctive".&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice Vol 3'' p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex==

Sexual intercourse is sometimes seen as a true pleasure (or false one), contrasted with the less real pleasures of the past, as with [[John Donne|Donne]]'s "countrey pleasures, childishly".&lt;ref&gt;John Hayward, ''The Penguin Book of English Verse'' (1978) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of [[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]], a distinction was sometimes made between reactive and genuine sexuality&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 515-6&lt;/ref&gt; - analysis supposedly allowing people to "realize the enormous difference between what they once believed sexual pleasure to be and what they now experience".&lt;ref&gt;''La P. D. A.'', quoted in Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass media==

[[Popular culture]] has been a central arena for latter-day disputes over true and false pleasures. [[Modernism]] saw attacks on the false pleasures of consumerism from the right,&lt;ref&gt;D. Horowitz, ''Consuming Pleasures'' (2012) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from the left, with [[Herbert Marcuse]] denouncing the false pleasures of happy consciousness of "those whose life is the hell of the affluent society".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John O' Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

From another angle, [[Richard Hoggart]] contrasted the immediate, real pleasures of the working-class from the increasingly [[ersatz]] diet fed them by the media.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hoggart, ''The Uses of Literacy'' (1968) p. 132 and p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 20th Century wore on, however - while concern for the contrast of false and authentic pleasures, fragmented or integrated experiences, certainly remained&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; - the mass media increasingly became less of a scapegoat for the prevalence of false pleasure, figures like [[Frederic Jameson]] for example insisting instead on "the false problem of value" in a world where "reification or materialization is a key structural feature of both modernism and mass culture".&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Žižek==

[[Slavoj Žižek]] had added a further twist to the debate for the 21st century, arguing that in a postmodern age dominated by what he calls "the superego injunction to enjoy that permeates our discourse", the quest for pleasure has become more of a duty than a pleasure: for Žižek, "[[psychoanalysis]] is the only discipline in which you are allowed ''not'' to enjoy" !&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''The Parallax View'' (2006) p. 299 and 304&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">At [[common law]], the '''fleeing felon rule''' permits the [[use of force]], including [[deadly force]], against an individual who is suspected of a [[felony]] and is in clear flight.  According to David Caplan "Immediate stopping of the fleeing felon, whether actually or presumably dangerous, was deemed absolutely necessary for the security of the people in a free state, and for maintaining the "public security." ... "  Indeed, it has been said that the social policy of the common law in this matter was not only to threaten dangerous felons and hence deter them, but was also to induce them to "surrender peaceably" if they dared commit inherently dangerous felonies, rather than allow them to "escape trial for their crimes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Even Deadly Force |url=https://saf.org/journal/12/CAPLAN.htm| accessdate=2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. law==
Under [[U.S. law]] the fleeing felon rule was limited in 1985 to non-lethal force in most cases by ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]],'' {{ussc|471|1}}. The justices held that deadly force "may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others."&lt;ref name="robertankony"&gt;Robert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|text=A police officer may not seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead...however...Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.|sign=Justice Byron White|source=&lt;cite&gt;Tennessee v.

Garner |publisher=Justia |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fleeing felons may be followed into places not open to the public without a warrant if the officer is in "[[hot pursuit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

# civil rather than criminal action;
# did not affect Michigan's Fleeing Felon Rule; and
# that a citizen may use [[deadly force]] when restraining a fleeing felon in a criminal matter.

He lectured internationally, promoting global philosophical dialogue and cooperation. Likewise, he invited scholars from many countries to participate in seminars in [[Washington, D.C.]]

He served as founding President of [http://www.crvp.org The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy] (RVP) and general editor of its 300 volume publication series, "Cultural Heritage and Contemporary Change".

Professor McLean believed that many philosophical traditions, cultures, and schools seek the truth. His metaphor for this is that these are many roads that converge in “the holy mountain.”

A '''ghost lawyer''' is a [[lawyer]] who writes for other lawyers [[ghostwriter|without assuming credit]]. Ghost lawyers often offer their services to other lawyers who need help on a project-by-project basis without wanting to take on a full associate. There are concerns about the [[ethics]] of ghost lawyers with regard to [[pro se]] [[litigant]]s, but most states permit the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schoenthal|first1=Allison|title=Ethics of Ghost Lawyering|url=http://www.newyorklegalethics.com/the-ethics-of-ghost-lawyering/|website=New York Legal Ethics|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CONDUCT|work=State Bar of Nevada|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.nvbar.org/Ethics/Ethics_Opinions_DETAIL.htm#Opinion%2034|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-10-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608183221/http://www.nvbar.org/Ethics/Ethics_Opinions_DETAIL.htm#Opinion%2034|archivedate=2007-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of inquiry==
Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

'''Hermann Cohen''' (4 July 1842&amp;nbsp;– 4 April 1918) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Jew]]ish [[philosophy|philosopher]], one of the founders of the [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] School of [[Neo-Kantianism]], and he is often held to be "probably the most important Jewish philosopher of the nineteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/HermannCohen.html Jewish Virtual Library, ''Hermann Cohen'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cohen was born in [[Coswig, Anhalt]]. He early began to study philosophy, and soon became known as a profound [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] scholar. He was educated at the Gymnasium at [[Dessau]], at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]], and at the universities of [[University of Breslau|Breslau]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]]. In 1873, he became ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in the philosophical faculty of the [[University of Marburg]], the thesis with which he obtained the ''venia legendi'' being ''Die systematischen Begriffe in Kant's vorkritischen Schriften nach ihrem Verhältniss zum kritischen Idealismus''. Cohen was elected Professor extraordinarius at Marburg in 1875, and Professor ordinarius in the following year (see: "[[Academic ranks in Germany]]").

He was one of the founders of the "Gesellschaft zur Förderung der [[Wissenschaft des Judenthums]]", which held its first meeting in Berlin in November 1902.

Cohen edited and published [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s final philosophical work (''Logische Studien'', Leipzig, 1877). Cohen edited and wrote several versions of a long introduction and critical supplement to Lange's ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Second enlarged edition based on the 7th edition of the original, 1902, v I.&lt;/ref&gt;

He devoted three early volumes to the interpretation of Kant (''Kant's Theory of Experience'', ''Kant's Foundations of Ethics'', and ''Kant's Foundations of Aesthetics''), in 1902 he began publishing the three eminent volumes of his own systematic philosophy: ''Logik der reinen Erkenntnis'' (1902), ''Ethik des reinen Willens'' (1904) and ''Ästhetik des reinen Gefühls'' (1912). The planned fourth volume on psychology was never written.

His writings relating more especially to Judaism include several pamphlets, among them "Die Kulturgeschichtliche Bedeutung des Sabbat," 1881; "Ein Bekenntniss in der Judenfrage," Berlin, 1880; as well as the following articles: "Das Problem der Jüdischen Sittenlehre," in the "Monatsschrift," xliii. (1899), pp.&amp;nbsp;385–400, 433–449; "Liebe und Gerechtigkeit in den Begriffen Gott und Mensch." in "Jahrbuch für Jüdische Geschichte und Litteratur," III. (1900), pp.&amp;nbsp;75–132; "Autonomie und Freiheit," in the "Gedenkbuch für [[David Kaufmann]]," 1900.

Cohen's most famous Jewish works include: ''Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums'' (''Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism'', 1919),&lt;ref&gt;''Metzler Philosophical Lexikon'', article on Hermann Cohen&lt;/ref&gt; ''Deutschtum und Judentum'', ''Die Naechstenliebe im Talmud'', and ''Die Ethik des Maimonides''.
His essay "Die Nächstenliebe im Talmud" was written at the request of the Marburg Königliches Landgericht (3d ed., Marburg, 1888).
Cohen's Jewish writings are collected in his "Jüdische Schriften" (3 vols. ed. Bruno Strauss, Berlin 1924). There is an ongoing new academic edition of Cohen's works, edited by Helmut Holzhey, Hartwig Wiedebach u.a. (Olms, Hildesheim 1977 ff.)
An English translation of some of his Jewish writings is available in ''Reason and Hope: Selections from the Jewish Writings of Hermann Cohen'', translated by Eva Jospe, NY 1971.

Cohen was outspokenly opposed to [[Zionism]] and its aspiration to create a Jewish state and thus "return the Jews to History". In his view, Judaism was inherently a-historical, with a spiritual and moral mission far transcending the nationalist aims of Zionism.

Despite the above attitude to Zionism, [[Tel Aviv]] has a Hermann Cohen Street.

Cohen is buried at the [[Weißensee Cemetery]] in [[Berlin]].

The ideology espoused by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' ("Protection Squadron"; SS), a paramilitary force and instrument of terror of the [[Nazi Party]]  in [[Nazi Germany]], emphasized a [[Racism|racist]] vision of "[[Nazism and race|racial purity]]", [[antisemitism]],  and loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]].

SS men were indoctrinated with the belief they were members of a "[[master race]]". The '''ideology of the SS''' was, even more so than in [[Nazism]] in general, built on the belief in a superior "[[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan race]]". This led to the SS playing the main role in political violence and [[crimes against humanity]], including the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and [[Action T4|"mercy killing"]] of those with [[congenital illness]]es. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in [[World War II]], the SS and Nazi Party were found to be criminal organizations  at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].

== Ideological foundations ==
The ideology of the SS was built upon and mainly congruent with [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. At its center laid the belief in a superior "[[Nordic race]]" and the "inferiority" of other races.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=52–61}} The SS also served as the central institution for the extension of Nazi ideology and its realisation.{{sfn|Birn|2009|p=60}} Representing the ideological opponents of the regime in one form or fashion, historian George C. Browder identified the Nazi state's list of enemies as follows: enemy states, [[miscegenation]], the Jews, [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[freemasonry]], [[Communism]], the Republic (hostility directed at the liberal republican constitution and form of government), [[homosexuality]],{{Efn|The Nazis believed that homosexuality "defied the command structure of government and military institutions"{{sfn|Boden|2011|p=1}} }}{{Efn|Himmler wrote a 1942 memo urging "ruthless severity" to eliminate the "dangerous and infectious plague," and the death penalty was instituted for homosexuality in the SS.{{sfn|Giles|2002|p=269}} }} moral decay, [[Capitalism|capitalists]], and the "Old Guard" (hate and fear of traditionally powerful influences and institutions of the old society as unjust, retarding influences in German society).{{sfn|Browder|1996|p=275}} All of these "enemies" became the focus of the main power instrument of Nazi totalitarianism, the SS, as they sought to direct and influence ideology and ethics within the Reich.{{sfn|Mineau|2014|pp=307–309}}

Himmler intended the SS to be a hierarchical system of "ideological fighters" from the organization's inception.{{sfn|Mineau|2011|p=23}} The SS proved to be that and more, becoming the instrument most responsible for the actualization of Nazi beliefs. SS ideology comprised perhaps the single most significant philosophical dimension of Nazism, employing ontological, anthropological, and ethical elements to their methods under the guise of science, shaping the Nazi state's doctrine and crystallizing ideals (no matter how callous) into dogmatic truths. SS principles and thinking provided pseudo-scientific rationales for the devaluation of humanity, and ideological justification for Nazi violence and genocide.{{sfn|Mineau|2011|pp=110–111}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-11-12, Dachau, Konzentrationslager, Besuch Himmlers.jpg|thumb|''Reichsführer-SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] inspecting [[Dachau concentration camp]] in 1936.]]
The SS placed an intense emphasis in their indoctrination upon elitism and portrayed themselves as part of an "elite" order which "explicitly modelled [themselves] on an historical version of religious orders, such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] or the Jesuits, whose dedication to a higher idea was admired in these otherwise anti-clerical circles".{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=191}}{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=191}}
Even though Himmler and the other SS leaders repeatedly demanded sobriety within their ranks, alcoholism was a frequent problem. For example, between 1937–38 some 700 members were excluded from the SS for "listlessness and laziness."  In the same period a further 12,000 left the SS for unknown reasons, calling into question the institution's claims of "loyalty for life".{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=37–38}}

==Indoctrination==
[[File:DasSchwarzeKorps1937.jpg|thumb|Cover of a 1937 issue of ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'']]
The strict training program was focused on the fundamental ideological principles of the [[Nazi Party]], namely the belief in a "superior [[Nordic race]]", loyalty and absolute obedience to [[Adolf Hitler]], and hatred for those who were considered "inferior people", with great emphasis on [[antisemitism]].{{sfn|Spielvogel|1992|pp=107–108}}{{sfn|Koonz|2005|p=238}} Students studied the most anti-Semitic passages of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ("My Struggle"), Hitler's autobiographical manifesto, and the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', a fraudulent anti-Semitic document first published in Russia in 1903, which purported to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. The SS educational leaders were also responsible for general anti-religious training,{{sfn|Webman|2012|pp=41–42}} which was  part of the Nazi attempt at "reversing the bourgeois-Christian system of values."{{sfn|Bialas|2014|p=16}} Educational training was clearly linked with "racial selection, at the end of which stood the 'weeding out' and selective breeding of human beings"; this facet coincided the impending Nazi effort to Germanize Europe and formed part of the policy for the racial-imperialist conquest in the East.{{sfn|Frei|1993|p=88, 119}}

Following the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, membership in the SS grew considerably, prompting an increase in ideological instruction. The [[SS Education Office|''SS-Schulungsamt'']] took over the task of heading the educational matters of the SS, led by Karl Motz.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=44}} The SS published two additional magazines for ideological propaganda: the monthly ''FM-Zeitschrift'', funded by 350,000 non-member [[Förderndes Mitglied der SS|financial patrons of the SS]], and the weekly ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'', the second biggest weekly paper in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=45–47}} As part of an effort to professionalize their officers, the SS founded a Leadership School in 1934 at the Bavarian town of Bad Tölz; a second school at was established at Braunschweig—these came to be known as [[Junker Schools]].{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=206}}{{Efn|By the time [[World War II]] in Europe was underway, additional SS Leadership Schools at Klagenfurt, Posen-Treskau and Prague had been founded.{{sfn|Pine|2010|p=89}} }}{{Efn|General military instruction over logistics and planning was also provided but much of the training concentrated on small-unit tactics associated with raids, patrols, and ambushes.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=207}} Training an SS officer took as much as nineteen months overall and encompassed additional things like map reading, tactics, military maneuvers, political education, weapons training, physical education, combat engineering and even automobile mechanics, all of which were provided in varying degrees at additional training facilities based on the cadet’s specialization.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=207–208}} }}

Beginning in 1938, the SS intensified the ideological indoctrination of the ''[[Hitler Youth|Hitler-Jugend Landdienst]]'' ("Hitler Youth Land Service"). It set out the ideal of the German "''[[Wehrbauer]]''" ("Soldier Peasant"). Special high schools were created under SS control to form a Nazi agrarian "elite" that was trained according to the principle of [[Blood and Soil|"blood and soil"]].{{sfn|Hartmann|1972|pp=143–147}} While SS leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] remained concerned about the racial elitism of his SS, it was [[Reinhard Heydrich]], Himmler's deputy and protégé, who focused his attention on their political indoctrination through the creation of "racial detectives" who would become Hitler's "ideological Shock Troops".{{sfn|Banach|1998|pp=98–100}} This being done through the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (Security Service; SD) which was tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi leadership and the neutralization of any opposition. The SD used its organization of agents and informants, all part of the development of an extensive SS state and a totalitarian regime without parallel.{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=350–362}}

The SS practiced a wide variety of disciplinary measures, with punishments composed of reprimands, prohibition to wear the uniform, detention, demotion, suspension, and expulsion. Contrary to claims made by many SS-members after 1945, no one had to fear being incarcerated in a concentration camp for delinquencies. Starting in June 1933, the SS had its own courts to deal with crimes and misdemeanors within its ranks. On 17 October 1939, Himmler succeeded in having the SS put under its own special jurisdiction. Once this change occurred, SS-members could no longer be tried in civil courts.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=39}}{{sfn|Nolzen|2009|p=35}}

=== Meritocracy===
The SS itself was meritocratic in its general operational structure, following the Nazi principle of ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]''.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=35}} In contrast to the German army's traditions, officer promotions in the SS were based on the individual's commitment and political reliability, not on [[Junker]] status or upper-class family background.{{sfn|Ziegler|1989|pp=52–53, 113, 135}}{{sfn|Wegner|1985|pp=430–434}} Consequently, the SS officer schools offered a military career option for those of modest social background, which was not usually possible in the [[Wehrmacht]]. The relationship between officers and soldiers was also less formal than in the regular armed forces.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=193–194}} Though SS membership was open to all who met Himmler's eugenic and genealogical standards, many of the men first to enter the SS came from the aristocracy.{{sfn|Ziegler|1989|p=127}} In addition, academics were twofold over-represented in the SS in comparison to the general population.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=37}}

==Racial policies==
Consistent with the [[Nazi eugenics|eugenic and racial policies]] of the Third Reich, Himmler advocated racial elitism for his SS members.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=59, 62}} Racial criteria like proving pure "Aryan" lineage back to 1750 or 1800 constituted part of the vetting for entrance into the SS.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=192}} Throughout the existence of the SS, its members were regularly encouraged to procreate to maintain and increase the "Aryan-Nordic bloodline"; the SS members, along with their wives and children, were to become an exclusive racial community (''Sippengemeinschaft'') within the Nazi state. Along these lines, Himmler stated on 8 November 1937 at a ''[[Gruppenführer]]'' meeting in [[Munich]] in the officers' quarters:
::The SS is a National Socialist order of soldiers of Nordic race and a community of their clans bound together by oath&amp;nbsp;... what we want for Germany is a ruling class destined to last for centuries and the product of repeated selection, a new aristocracy continuously renewed from the best of the sons and daughters of our nation, a nobility that never ages, stretching back into distant epochs in its traditions, where these are valuable, and representing eternal youth for our nation.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=352}}

Hitler subscribed to these views and once remarked that the "elite" of the future Nazi state would stem from the SS since "only the SS practices racial selection."{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|2008|p=83}} Wives of SS members were scrutinized accordingly for their "racial fitness", and marriages had to be approved through official channels as part of the SS ideological mandate.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=353–358}} According to their ideology, SS men were believed to be the bearers of the very best of the so-called Nordic blood, and it was their ideological tenets and scholarly justifications that shaped numerous Nazi actions and policies, merging racial determinism, Nordicism, and antisemitism.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=51–63}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F051638-0067, Lebensbornheim, Säuglingszimmer.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[Lebensborn]]'' facility in 1936]]

An SS Doctors' Leader School was established in the small village of Alt-Rehse which encouraged the practice of "racial hygiene" and focused on the future of "German genetic streams" (''deutsche Erbströme'').{{sfn|Proctor|1988|pp=83–84}} Medical journal articles written by SS intellectuals stressed the importance of genetic heritage, arguing that "biology and genetics are the roots from which the [[National Socialist]] worldview has derived its knowledge, and from which it continues to derive new strength."{{sfn|Proctor|1988|pp=85–86}} In order to promote its role as a preserver of the Germanic heritage, the SS founded the ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'' institute in 1935. It conducted anthropological, historic, and archeologic studies to provide scientific backing to Himmler's ideological ideas. In the years until 1939, the institute worked in a hybrid state between important findings such as the Viking village [[Hedeby]] and erratic studies into the ''[[Welteislehre]]'' and medieval [[witch-hunt]]s, which Himmler thought to have been murders committed by the Roman Catholic church against Germanic women of "good blood". After World War II started, the ''Ahnenerbe'' was heavily involved in experiments conducted in concentration camps, costing the lives of thousands of inmates.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=52–55}}

Not only was contact with racial "others" a concern, but attrition through war was an additional factor. Fear of losing a large percentage of Germanic racial stock once the Second World War began drove SS ideology, as victory in the field could not prevail without a corresponding biological legacy of children to carry on the mission.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=60}} Himmler stressed that SS men were obliged to procreate to preserve Germany's genetic legacy so the "master race" could secure and sustain the "[[New Order (Nazism)|Thousand Year Reich]]" of the future.{{sfn|Carney|2013|pp=74, 77}}

However, SS men did not fulfill the expectations: at the end of 1938, 57% of the members were still unmarried, only 26% had fathered a child and just 8% had reached Himmler's desired goal of at least four children.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=57}}  Also in 1935, the SS initiated ''[[Lebensborn]]'', an association created to provide unmarried, pregnant women of "good blood" with opportunities to deliver their children, who were then given up for adoption into families deemed racially suited. The ''Lebensborn'' facilities were situated in remote locations, guaranteeing the anonymity of the women. ''Lebensborn'' was only moderately successful, producing only an estimated 8,000 - 11,000 births in the ten years of its existence.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=55–58}}

After the beginning of World War II, the SS recruited large numbers of non-Germans from the "inferior races" espoused by the Nazi and SS ideology. To justify this contradiction, Himmler began to stress a shared European identity more strongly in the early 1940s, promising that "all those who are of good blood will be given the possibility to grow into the German ''Volk''".{{sfn|Birn|2009|pp=65–73}} According to historian Mark P. Gingerich, of the one million ''Waffen-SS'' men who served during the war, over half were not even German citizens.{{sfn|Gingerich|1997|p=815}}
{{Clear}}

==Attitude toward religion==
According to Himmler biographer [[Peter Longerich]], Himmler saw a main task of the SS to be that of "acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a Germanic way of living" as part of preparations for the coming conflict between "humans and subhumans".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} Longerich writes that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, "by linking de-Christianisation with re-Germanization, Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own."{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the "principle of Christian mercy", both of which he saw as a dangerous obstacle to his planned battle with "subhumans".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} In 1937, he said that the movement was an era of the "ultimate conflict with Christianity" and that "It is part of the mission of the SS to give the German people in the next half century the non-Christian ideological foundations on which to lead and shape their lives."{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=270}}

The SS developed an anti-clerical agenda. Chaplains were not allowed in its units for instance (although they were allowed in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|regular army]]). The ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (Security Service; SD) department of the SS and Gestapo under [[Reinhard Heydrich]] were used to identify and assist other Nazi organizations in suppressing Catholic influence in the press, youth clubs, schools, publications, "pilgrimages and processions".{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=234–239}}

Himmler used the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] as the model for the SS, since he found they had the core elements of absolute obedience and the cult of the organisation.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=135}}{{sfn|Lapomarda|1989|pp=10–11}} Hitler is said to have called Himmler "my [[Ignatius of Loyola]]".{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=135}} As an order, the SS needed a coherent doctrine that would set it apart.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=146}} Himmler attempted to construct such an ideology, and deduced a "pseudo-Germanic tradition" from history.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=146}} Himmler dismissed the image of Christ as a Jew and rejected Christianity's basic doctrine and its institutions.{{sfn|Steigmann-Gall|2003|pp=132–133}} Starting in 1934, the SS hosted "solstice ceremonies" (''Sonnenwendfeiern'') to increase team spirit within their ranks.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=47}} In a 1936 memorandum, Himmler set forth a list of approved holidays based on pagan and political precedents meant to wean SS members from their reliance on Christian festivities.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=138, 143, 156}} In an attempt to replace Christianity and suffuse the SS with a new doctrine, SS-men were able to choose special ''Lebenslauffeste'', substituting common Christian ceremonies such as baptisms, weddings and burials. Since the ceremonies were held in small private circles, it is unknown how many SS-members opted for these kind of celebrations.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=50}}

=== Rejection of Christian precepts ===
Many of the concepts promoted with the SS violated accepted Christian doctrine, but neither Himmler nor his deputy Heydrich expected the Christian church to support their stance on abortion, contraception or sterilization of the unfit – let alone their shared belief in polygamy for the sake of racial propagation.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=102}} This did not however represent disbelief in a higher power from either man nor did it deter them on their ideological quest. In fact, [[atheism]] was banned within the SS as Himmler believed it to be a form of egotism that placed the individual at the center of the universe, and thus constituted a rejection of the SS principle of valuing the collective over the individual.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=303, 396}} All SS men were required to list themselves as [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Catholic or ''[[Gottgläubig|gottgläubig]]'' ("Believer in God").{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=195}} Himmler preferred the neo-pagan "expression of spirituality". Still, by 1938 "only 21.9 percent of SS members described themselves as ''gottgläubig'', whereas 54 percent remained Protestant and just under 24 percent Catholic."{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=102-103}}  Belief in God among the SS did not constitute adherence to traditional Christian doctrine nor were its members consummate theologians, as the SS outright banned certain Christian organizations like the International Bible Research Association, a group whose pacifism the SS rejected.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=200}} Dissenting religious organizations like the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] were severely persecuted by the SS for their pacifism, failure to participate in elections, non-observance of the Hitler salute, not displaying the Nazi flag, and for their non-participation in Nazi organizations; many were sent to concentration camps where they perished.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=105}} Heydrich once quipped that any and all opposition to Nazism originated from either "Jews or politicized clergy."{{sfn|Steigmann-Gall|2003|p=133}}

=== Neo-pagan doctrine ===
[[File:570 Wewelsburg.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Wewelsburg]] was the most important site in Himmler's pseudo-Germanic religious doctrine.]]
In order to promote his religious ideas and link them to an alleged Germanic tradition, Himmler began to establish cult sites. The most important of these was the [[Wewelsburg]], close to [[Paderborn]].{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=273}} The SS leased the castle in 1934, after Himmler had first seen it in November 1933 while campaigning with Hitler. Originally planned as a school for high ranking SS-men, the castle soon became the object of far reaching construction plans, with an aim at establishing the Wewelsburg as the "ideological center" of the SS and its pseudo-Germanic doctrine.{{sfn|Schulte|2009|pp=6-7}}{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=52}} In accordance with the other efforts of Himmler to replace Christian rituals and establish the SS as the Nazi "elite", the Wewelsburg received special rooms, such as crypts, a General's hall with a [[Sun cross|sun wheel]] embedded in the floor and a crest hall.{{sfn|Schulte|2009|p=9}} As a second location, Himmler ordered for a memorial of 4,500 giant foundlings to be placed near [[Verden an der Aller]], the scene of the infamous [[Massacre of Verden]] in 782, calling the place ''Sachsenhain''. At the sight of the [[Externsteine]], which at the time was believed to be close to the scene of the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], Himmler ordered excavations to take place there in order to prove that Christian monks had destroyed a Germanic cult site known as ''[[Irminsul]]'' during the Middle Ages. As a last site of Himmler's cult, the SS took over and remodelled [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], burial place of [[Henry the Fowler]], who was celebrated by Himmler for his refusal to be anointed by a Roman bishop.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=51}}

Himmler also instituted these rites and rituals to try and foster a greater sense of belonging to a fraternal order. For example, each year on the anniversary of the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]], the SS men duty-bound for the military units were sworn in at 10:00 pm in front of Hitler. There by torchlight they swore "obedience unto death".{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=38-49}}

However, these attempts to establish a new, [[neo-pagan]] religion were not successful. Historian Heinz Höhne observes that the "neo-pagan customs" Himmler introduced into the SS "remained primarily a paper exercise".{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=138, 143, 156}} Most of Himmler's attempts to link "old Teutonic" traditions into the spiritual life of the SS and society at large were criticised by the Church as a form of "new heathenism."{{sfn|Frei|1993|p=85}} Although the SS never endorsed Christian beliefs, the traditional rituals and practices of the Christian faith were generally tolerated and respected.{{sfn|Steigmann-Gall|2003|pp=130–132}} According to Bastian Hein, two reasons contributed to Himmler's ''Ersatz'' religion never catching on: On the one hand, Himmler himself was in a constant search for religious certainty, leaving his doctrine vague and unclear. On the other hand, Hitler personally intervened after the churches lamented the "neo-heathenish" tendencies within the SS, telling Himmler and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] to "cut out the cultic nonsense".{{sfn|Hein|2015|pages=48–49}}

==Culture of violence==
[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Executions of Jews by SS-led mobile killing units (''Einsatzgruppen'') near [[Ivanhorod]], now Ukraine.]]

The SS was built on a culture of violence, which was exhibited in extreme form by the mass murder of civilians and prisoners on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Fritz|2011|pp=69–70, 94–108}} Historian Hans Buchheim wrote that the mentality and ideal values of the SS men were to be "hard," with no emotions such as love or kindness; hatred for the "inferior" and contempt for anyone who was not in the SS; unthinking obedience; "camaraderie" with fellow members of the SS; and an intense militarism that saw the SS as part of an "elite order" fighting for a better Germany.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=320–321}} The principal "enemy" of the SS, represented as a force of uncompromising, utter evil and depravity, was "world Jewry".{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=321}} Members of the SS were encouraged to fight against the "Jewish Bolshevik sub-humans".{{sfn|Himmler|1936|p=8}}

The SS value of "fighting for fighting's sake" could be traced back to the values of the front-line German soldiers in World War I and the post-war ''[[Freikorps]]'', and in turn led SS members to see violence as the highest possible value, and conventional morality as a hindrance to achieving victory.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=323–327}} The SS mentality fostered violence and "hardness".{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=320}} The ideal SS man was supposed to be in a state of permanent readiness. As historian Hans Buchheim quips, "the SS man had to be forever on duty."{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=323}} For members of the SS their mentality was such that for them, nothing was impossible no matter how arduous or cruel, to include the "murder of millions".{{sfn|Frei|1993|p=107}} SS men who attempted to live by that principle of violence had an unusually high suicide rate.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=193}} The "soldierly" values of the SS were specific to the German post-World War I concept of the "political soldier" who was indoctrinated to be a "fighter" who would devote his life to struggling for the nation.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=321–323}}

Although not an SS document, the 1930 book ''Krieg und Krieger'' ("War and Warriors"), edited by [[Ernst Jünger]], with contributions by [[Friedrich Georg Jünger]], [[Friedrich Hielscher]], [[Werner Best]] and [[Ernst von Salomon]], served as an excellent introduction to the intellectual traditions from which the SS ideal arose.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=323}} The essays in ''Krieg und Krieger'' called for a revolutionary reorganization of German society, which was to be led by "heroic" leaders who would create a "new moral code" based upon the idea that life was a never-ending, [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinian]] "struggle" that could only be settled with violence.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=324}} The book claimed that Germany had only been defeated in the First World War because the country had been insufficiently "spiritually mobilized", and what was required to win the next war was the proper sort of "heroic" leaders, unhindered by conventional morality, who would do what was necessary to win.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=325}} The values of the "heroic realism" literature gloried the principle and practice of fighting to the death regardless of the military situation.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=191–195}}

Out of the intellectual heritage of the "heroic realism" literature came a rejection of the traditional values of Christianity and the enlightenment (principles which were considered too sentimental); what emerged in its place was a cold indifference to the value of human life.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=194–195}} Marriage of the image of the "fighter" from "heroic realism" literature and the practical need of the SS to serve as political cadres for the National Socialist state, led to the elevation of the concept of "duty" as the highest obligation of the SS man.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=326–327}} The SS [[ethos]] called for "achievement for achievement's sake", where achievement ranked as the highest measurement of success.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=328}} As such, winning at all costs regardless the sacrifice became a supreme SS virtue.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=193–195}} The SS principle of loyalty above all, as reflected in the official slogan "My honour is loyalty", was severed from traditional moral considerations and instead focused entirely upon Hitler.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=195}} The idealized and distorted version of German history, which the organisation espoused, was intended to instill pride in members of the SS.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=154–155}} Himmler admonished the SS against pity, neighborly love, and humility, instead celebrating hardness and self-discipline.{{sfn|Koonz|2005|p=246}}{{sfn|Schroer|2012|p=35}} Indoctrinating the SS to perceive racial "others" and state enemies as undeserving of their pity, helped create an environment and a mental framework where the men saw acts of wanton violence against those same enemies, not as a crime, but part of their patriotic obligation to the Nazi state.{{sfn|Bialas|2013|pp=358–359}}

==Ideology of genocide==
{{Main article|The Holocaust}}
[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising BW.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[A Jewish boy surrenders in Warsaw |Photo]] from [[Jürgen Stroop]]'s [[Stroop Report |report]] to Heinrich Himmler from May 1943 on liquidation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].]]
As historian Claudia Koonz points out, "the cerebral racism of the SS provided the mental armor for mass murderers."{{sfn|Koonz|2005|p=250}} When Himmler visited [[Minsk]] and witnessed a mass killing of 100 people, he made a speech to the executioners emphasizing the need to put orders over conscience, saying that "soldiers&amp;nbsp;... had to carry out every order unconditionally".{{sfn|Hilberg|1961|pp=218–219}} According to historian George Stein, unquestioning obedience and "submission to authority" on the part of the SS represented one of the ideological "foundation stones" to combat the party's enemies.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=123}} As the ''Waffen-SS'' took part in the invasions of eastern European countries and the Soviet Union, the men wrote of their "great service in saving western civilization from being overrun by Asiatic Communism."{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=124}}

One ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting pamphlet told potential members that answering the call meant being "especially bound to the National Socialist ideology," a doctrine which implied both an ideological battle and a racial struggle against subhumans (''[[Untermenschen]]'') accompanied by an unprecedented brutalization of warfare.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=125–128}} Participation in the "repellant task" of becoming psychologically involved in the killings was a rite of initiation of sorts and showed just how "internalized" the Nazi beliefs were for members of the SS. It was also part of the rhetoric of legitimation that gave meaning to their acts of extermination and habituated the SS to an ideology of genocide.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=205–208}}

Special SS [[death squad]]s known as ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' were used for large-scale extermination and [[genocide]] of [[Jew]]s, [[Romani people|gypsies]], [[Asian people|Asians]], and [[communist]]s.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=14}}{{sfn|Breitman|1990|pp=341–342}} On 17 June 1941, Heydrich briefed the leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and their subordinate units on the general policy of killing Jews in the Soviet lands. SD member Walter Blume later testified that Heydrich called Eastern Jews the "reservoir of intellectuals for Bolshevism," and said that the "state leadership held the view that [they] must be destroyed." {{sfn|Breitman|1991|pp=434–435}}

The SS ''Einsatzgruppen'' were supplemented by the specially created Order Police (drawn from Germany and/or the local populations) who were indoctrinated by the SS to also take part in mass killings.{{sfn|Rhodes |2003|p=158}} One Order Police participant named Kurt Möbius testified during a postwar trial, that he believed the SS propaganda about the Jews being "criminals and sub-humans" who had caused "Germany's decline after the First World War."  He went on to state that evading "the order to participate in the extermination of the Jews" never entered his mind.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=159}} One SS officer, Karl Kretschmer, "saw himself as a representative of a cultured people fighting a primitive, barbaric enemy," and wrote to his family of the need to desensitize himself from the mass killings.{{sfn|Schroer|2012|p=38}} Burleigh and Wippermann write: "Members of the SS administered, tortured, and murdered people with a cold, steely precision, and without moral scruples."{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=274}}

[[File:Selection Birkenau ramp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|An SS officer selecting Jews for extermination in gas chambers at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]]]

The SS and its accompanying principles represented the realization of Nazi ideology and played a crucial role in the [[Final solution|extermination of European Jews]] that followed the Nazis' rise to power. As historian Gerald Reitlinger states, while the idealism and machinery of the SS as a state within a state will all be forgotten, their acts of "...racial transplantations, the concentration camps, the interrogation cells of the Gestapo, the medical experiments of the living, the mass reprisals, the manhunts for slave labor and the racial exterminations will be remembered forever."{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=454}} 

Historian Hans Buchheim argues there was no coercion to murder Jews and others, and all who committed such actions did so out of free will.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=372–373}} He wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders "were both more numerous and more real than those concerned are generally prepared to admit".{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=373}} Buchheim commented that until the middle of 1942, the SS had been a strictly volunteer organization, and that anyone who joined the SS after the Nazis had [[Machtergreifung|taken over the German government]] either knew or came to know that he was joining an organization that would be involved in atrocities of one sort or another.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=390}} There is no known record of an SS officer refusing to commit an atrocity; they willingly did so, and then cherished the awards they received for doing it.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=16}}

Initially the victims were killed with [[gas van]]s or firing squad by SS ''Einsatzgruppen'' units, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of the scale carried out by the Nazi state.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=256–257}} In August 1941, SS leader Himmler attended the shooting of 100 Jews at [[Minsk]]. Nauseated and shaken by the experience,{{sfn|Gilbert|1987|p=191}} he was concerned about the impact such actions would have on the mental health of his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=547}}{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=199}}  On his orders, by spring 1942 the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded, including the addition of [[gas chamber]]s, where victims were killed using the pesticide [[Zyklon B]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=295, 299–300}} Industrialized killing at the SS operated extermination camps made these Nazi-conceived institutions into places where the productive output was corpses.{{sfn|Traverso|2003|pp=38–39}} By the end of the war, at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}{{sfn|Holocaust Memorial Museum}} and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 [[Porajmos|Romani people]]{{sfn|Hancock|2004|pp=383–396}}{{sfn|Holocaust Memorial Museum}} had been killed by the Nazi state with assistance by [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] governments and recruits from occupied countries.{{sfn|Rummel|1994|p=112}}{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}} Historian Enzo Traverso asserts that massacring millions of people was part of the Nazi ideology comprising "total war," which constituted their attempt at conquest for both "racial" and colonial purposes.{{sfn|Traverso|2003|p=75}} Acting on Hitler's orders, Himmler was a main architect of [[the Holocaust]]{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=236}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=3}} and the SS was the main branch of the Nazi Party that implemented it.{{sfn|Longerich|2000|p=14}}

==Post-war==
On 23 May 1945, Himmler, who had been responsible for so much of the SS doctrine and that of the Nazi state, committed suicide after he was captured by the Allies.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=729}} Other senior members of the SS fled.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=410}} Chief of the Reich Main Security Office, SS-''Obergruppenführer'' [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], who was the ranking member of the SS upon Himmler's suicide, was captured in the [[Bavarian Alps]] and tried at the Nuremberg Tribunal along with other leading Nazis like Hermann Göring, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, among others. Kaltenbrunner was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946.{{sfn|Wistrich|2001|p=136}}

Other SS intellectuals and physicians were also brought to trial and convicted, including the SS ''Ahnenerbe'' doctors who killed the enfeebled and/or disabled persons deemed "unworthy to live" or who performed medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|pp=295–296}} During questioning after the war, many of the SS doctors from the concentration camps avowed that the allegiance they had sworn to Hitler superseded any of the rituals performed at medical school to say nothing of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] they had otherwise ignored.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=207}} SS members absolved themselves through the pseudo-scientific justification that they were merely acting as instruments (men of action) on behalf of the German people in pursuit of "racial hygiene."{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=258–259}} Similar strategies of negation and dismissal of responsibility were displayed by SS men during their post-war trials, either by way of legitimizing their actions as a result of unconditional obedience to their superiors (intimating responsibility onto them) or through the use of [[Euphemisms for death|innocuous sounding bureaucratic language]].{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=228–248}}

Given the impact that the Nazi ideology had on the European continent in causing a catastrophic war and unparalleled crimes, the Allied powers determined Germany shall be demilitarized and the country divided into four [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]].{{sfn|Bessel|2010|pp=169–210}} They also began the process of [[denazification]] (''Entnazifizierung''). This was essentially an effort to "purge" the German people of the Nazi ideology that had pushed them to war and resulted in the [[Holocaust]].{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|pp=348–362}} Astonishingly, many members of the SS, including some from the upper echelons, faced little more than a stint in a POW camp, a short denazification hearing and were treated with "remarkable leniency".{{sfn|Höhne|2001|p=581}}

'''Johann Anton Leisewitz''' (born 9 May 1752 in [[Hanover]], died 10 September 1806 in [[Braunschweig]]) was a [[Germany|German]] lawyer and dramatic [[poet]], and a central figure of the [[Sturm und Drang]] era. He is best known for his play ''[[Julius of Tarent]]'' (1776), that inspired [[Friedrich Schiller]] and is considered the forerunner of Schiller's quintessential Sturm und Drang work ''[[The Robbers]]'' (1781).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335498/Johann-Anton-Leisewitz?anchor=ref141414 Johann Anton Leisewitz], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He went to [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] in 1770, and became a member of the circle of poets called [[Göttinger Hainbund|Der Hainbund]], which included [[Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg|Stolberg]] and [[Johann Heinrich Voss|Voss]], and contributed two poems to the ''[[Göttinger Musenalmanach]]'' for 1775, both essentially dramatic and democratic in tone. In 1775, at [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], and later at [[Berlin]] and [[Weimar]], he met and soon counted among his friends [[Johann Joachim Eschenburg|Eschenburg]], [[Moses Mendelssohn]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Friedrich Nicolai|Nicolai]], [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]. His single complete play, ''[[Julius of Tarent]]'' (1776), was written in Lessing's style and with much of the latter's dramatic technique. The play was a favorite of [[Friedrich Schiller]], and was frequently acted in Germany. It also inspired [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]], who was employed as playwright by Leisewitz' father-in-law [[Abel Seyler]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Sophie Leisewitz née Seyler.jpg|thumb|His wife Sophie Seyler]]

He married ''Sophie'' Marie Katharina [[Seyler family|Seyler]] (1762–1833) in Hamburg in 1781. She was the daughter of famed Swiss-born theatre director [[Abel Seyler]] and stepdaughter of actress [[Friederike Sophie Seyler]], and grew up with her uncle [[J.G.R. Andreae]] in Hanover. Her brother was banker [[Ludwig Erdwin Seyler]], who became by marriage a member of the [[Berenberg-Gossler-Seyler banking dynasty|Berenberg-Gossler banking dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz50045.html Leisewitz, Johann Anton], ''[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Leisewitz was a distant relative of his wife on the Andreae side, and had been a frequent visitor in the Andreae home, with its large library, in his youth. He would later refer to J.G.R. Andreae as his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Warren Noble, ''The life and works of Johann Anton Leisewitz'', University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1976, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; His diaries and his letters to his wife have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Anton Leisewitzen: ''Briefe an seine Braut'', Gesellschaft der Bibliophilen, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; The letters sent between Johann Anton Leisewitz and Sophie Seyler have been described as some of the most beautiful love letters of the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Herrmann, ''Liebesbekenntnisse berühmter deutscher Männer und Frauen; 100 bewegende Briefe von Luther bis Rilke'', p. 90, M.

==Family background==
[[File:Het beleg van Deventer (1591) door Prins Maurits - The siege of Deventer in 1591 by Prince Maurice (Bartholomeus Willemsz. Dolendo).jpg|thumb|The siege of Deventer in 1591]]
Johannes van Heeck was one of five children in a family of wealthy merchants. His father was Willem, son of Willem van Heeck, and his mother was Lutgardt, daughter of Gerrit. Between 1587 and 1591 his father, a Catholic, was one of Deventer's political leaders, elected senator and consul in 1589. For this reason, when Protestant forces under [[Maurice of Nassau]] took the city in 1591, Willem van Heeck was fined 150 guilders for being a leader of the Catholic party and a collaborator of the hated [[Phillip II of Spain]].&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/joannes-eck_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=ECK, Joannes in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=Treccani.it|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johannes received a humanist education, studying Latin, Greek, theology, astronomy and astrology, and making an exact observation of the comet that appeared in 1591, which he described in one of his later treatises as a bad omen for a life full of bitterness and pain. Under [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] rule, the position of his family became more precarious in Deventer and eventually his parents decided to send him to Italy to continue his education.

==Early career==
Van Heeck traveled to [[Milan]], [[Parma]], [[Ferrara]], [[Venice]], [[Bologna]] and [[Rome]]. He stayed for a while in [[Spoleto]] as a guest of Count Gelosi, with whom he maintained a connection throughout his life, and on whose estate was the villa known as the "museum deauratum" where many of his manuscripts were composed.&lt;ref&gt;David Freedberg, The Eye of the Lynx: Galileo, His Friends, and the Beginnings of Modern Natural History, University of Chicago Press,2003 p.196&lt;/ref&gt; Here he wrote works of a moral literary character, such as his 1596 ''Epigrammata'', as well as medical, magical and astrological topics. Among these was his ''Liber de Regimine Sanitatis Eorum Qui Studio Litterarum Incumbunt'' in which, inspired by [[De vita libri tres|De Vita Libri Tres]] ('The Threefold Life') of [[Marsilio Ficino]], he examined the hygiene, diet and amorous habits of the literati. The second part of the work dealt with Ficino's ideas on magic. He discussed the influence of images on the spirit, and the occult virtues of certain plants, approaching his enquiry from the medical point of view rather than from that of the magician. He concluded the treatise with a list of secrets for healing common illnesses by using certain plants, and with a collection of "magic" recipes.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; 

Following ''De Regimine'' there are four undated manuscripts dealing with plants and medicine:

* ''De Fructibus Tractatus'' ('Treatise on Fruits')
* ''Tractatus de Radicibus Herbarum Diversarum'' ('Treatise on the Roots of Various Herbs')
* ''Tractatus de Herbis'' ('Treatise on Herbs') and 
* ''Tractatus de Herbis et Holeribus'' ('Treatise on Herbs and Vegetables')

In these he described the characteristics of various fruits, herbs and vegetables, their regions of origin, the time of their flowering, ways of preparing them and their specific medicinal use. He wrote on the basis of first-hand observation, supported by ancient sources, notably [[Dioscorides]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; 

With financial backing from a supportive bishop, he then studied medicine at the [[University of Perugia]], obtaining his doctor's degree in 1601. During this period, his writing focused on logic, theology and metaphysics. Among the more significant of his works while he studied at university were: 

* ''Homines et Alia Animalia Prodigiosa Variarum Ignotarum Regionum'' (''Of Humans and Other Animals'')
* ''De mundiali machina'' (1598), a summary of astronomical knowledge
* ''De Planetarum Radiationibus in Singulis Zodiaci Signis'' (''On the Movement of the Planets Through the Signs of the Zodiac'') 
*  another treatise on astronomy with numerous diagrams drawn by himself
* a treatise on [[apoplexy]]
* a treatise on [[Angina|angina pectoris]] entitled ''De Syncope'' (''On Fainting'')
* ''Cura Coelestis quae Inferorum Appellatur'' (''Heavenly Care''), written for doctors and for all who 'love philosophy' 
* ''Super Plinii II Historias Naturales'', a commentary on [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny's 'Natural History']], extended in scope beyond the original, with the ambitious subtitle 'Liber de Mirabilibus Creaturarum Dei' (Book of the Marvels of God's Creation'). In this work, van Heeck dealt with a number of contemporary concerns of natural science, such as [[geocentric]] theory and other [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] views, against which he argued strongly.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; 

He practised as a doctor first in [[Maenza]] and then in [[Scandriglia]] in the province of [[Rieti]], part of the domain of Duke Giovanni Antonio [[Orsini_family#Pitigliano_line|Orsini]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the course of his medical work, van Heeck became involved in a strange dispute. He treated his patients, who were mostly poor, with great zeal, using simple herbal medicines. For this reason he came into conflict with the apothecary of Scandriglia, one Casolini Ranieri, who made his living selling medicines with exotic names, more magical than scientific. Ranieri conceived a firm hatred of the foreign doctor, whose work threatened to ruin his lucrative business. One night Ranieri positioned himself on the route where van Heeck habitually passed and attacked him while he was alone. Van Heeck fell from his horse but fended off his attacker with a sword. Still bleeding from his injuries, he was brought before the magistrate. Despite his plea of self-defense, he was imprisoned.  The apothecary later died of his wounds, and van Heeck would have been left to rot in prison if he had not been released through the intervention of Prince [[Federico Cesi]], who sent [[Francesco Stelluti]] to get him out of prison and then invited him to his house in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Carutti, ''Breve storia dell'Accademia dei Lincei'', Roma, Salviucci, 1883, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The period when Cesi, van Heeck and Stelluti lived together after van Heeck's release from prison was one of an intense exchange of ideas and the shaping of plans, which led to the idea of forming a mutual-instruction society.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Stillman Drake, Essays on Galileo and the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Toronto Press, 1999 vol.1 p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accademia dei Lincei==
This close partnership between Cesi, van Heeck and Stelluti soon led to their founding the Accademia dei Lincei, together with Anastasio de Filiis, on 17 August 1603. There is no doubt that van Heeck played a key role in the conception and organization of the Academy. He was the most experienced, educated and famous member of the group, and he clearly took the lead in many of its ventures,&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake, Essays on Galileo and the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Toronto Press, 1999 vol.1 p.130&lt;/ref&gt; though he was the second youngest among them. Like all its members, he adopted a pseudonym ("Illuminato"), an emblem (a quarter-moon illuminated by a triangle from the sun) and the motto "A Patre luminum" ('from the father of lights'). It was van Heeck who chose as the Academy's patron saint [[John the Baptist]], the apostle of arcane visions.  He also drafted its articles of association and devised its ceremonial.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Van Heeck referred to the Accademia as 'the most sagacious investigators of the secrets of nature, and dedicated to the [[Paracelsus|Paracelsan]] disciplines' - indicating thereby that like the Swiss physician, they believed that empirical observation was essential for developing an understanding of the world, rather than reliance on established scholarly authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, Curiosity: How Science Became Interested in Everything, University of Chicago Press, 2013 p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been speculation that the connections between the Accademia's members were not confined to the intellectual sphere, and, specifically in the case of the relationship between Federico Cesi and Johannes van Heeck, that they were probably sexual in nature.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Philip Ball, Curiosity: How Science Became Interested in Everything, University of Chicago Press, 2013 p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David F Noble, A World Without Women: The Christian Clerical Culture of Western Science, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovation.ucdavis.edu/people/publications/Biagioli%201995%20Knowledge%20Freedom%20Brotherly%20Love.pdf|format=PDF|title=Knowledge, Freedom, and Brotherly Love : Homosociality and the Accademia dei Lincei|author=Mario Biagioli|website=Innovation.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travels in Europe==
In the spring of 1604, Prince Cesi's father the Duke of [[Acquasparta]] was so concerned about the activities of the Accademia dei Lincei and what he considered the nefarious influence of van Heeck over his son that he denounced him to the [[Roman Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Heilbron, Galileo, Oxford University Press, 2012 p.175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; This effectively broke the four friends up, and van Heeck was obliged to leave Rome, embarking on a tour of numerous European countries. He went first to [[Siena]], [[Pisa]] and [[Florence]], then to [[Milan]] and [[Turin]], where he met [[Giovanni Botero]] at the Court of [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]]. Later he crossed the Alps and went to [[England]], [[Norway]], [[France]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]] and [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

While van Heeck was travelling, Federico Cesi sent him money regularly, to buy rare books on alchemy and the natural sciences, which were then added to his collection the Accademia dei Lincei.&lt;ref&gt;Flavia Bruni &amp; Andrew Pettegree, Lost Books: Reconstructing the Print World of Pre-Industrial Europe, Brill,  2016 p.388&lt;/ref&gt; As well as collecting books, objects and rare plants for the Accademia's collections, van Heeck was also a kind of roving ambassador, telling educated men in each city about the group's work and publicising its activities to win the sympathy of the powerful and the learned.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Conan, Baroque Garden Cultures: Emulation, Sublimation, Subversion, Dumbarton Oaks, vol.25 2005 p.126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake, Essays on Galileo and the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Toronto Press, 1999 vol.1 p.132&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels, he was attacked by robbers and forced to swallow his membership ring of the Accademia in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of his attackers.{{efn|group=note|His many observations on his travels are held today in the Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Montpellier under the title ''Fructus itineris ad Septentrionales''.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;}}

After several  months on the road he eventually found a place in [[Prague]] at the court of Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], an enlightened and generous man who was interested in the research of the Accademia dei Lincei. Rudolf's court was a major international centre for scholars and researchers on many fields, and he owned one of the largest [[cabinets of curiosities]] ever assembled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/rudolph-ii-and-prague/]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been patron to [[Tycho Brahe]] until the latter's death in 1601, and at the time of van Heeck's arrival, was still patron to [[Johan Kepler]].

In October 1604, a new star was seen. By night, it was the brightest star in the sky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/20670-johannes-kepler-supernova-white-dwarf.html|title=Kepler's Supernova: Huge 17th-Century Star Explosion Comes into Focus|website=Space.com|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was visible during the day as well for more than three weeks, before eventually dimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2118054-cold-case-the-unsolved-mystery-of-what-lit-keplers-supernova/|title=Cold case: The unsolved mystery of what lit Kepler’s supernova|first=Joshua|last=Sokol|website=Newscientist.com|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Lodovico delle Colombe]]{{efn|group=note|Delle Colombe's book was entitled ''Discorso di L.

Van Heeck was ready to publish before them, sending his manuscript of ''De Nova Stella Disputatio'' ('Discussion of the New Star') to Federico Cesi in Rome in January 1605.

The critical question for all three writers was whether the new phenomenon could be explained within the generally-accepted model of the universe, known as the [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian model]] or the [[Geocentric model|Ptolmaic system]]. This held that the stars were remote, fixed in their positions and unchanging, while movement and variance were associated with the planets, closer to the earth.  An unusual event in the sky might take place close to the earth, and could therefore be explained within the standard [[cosmology|cosmological]] model.  However if it took place beyond the planets, this indicated that the stars, contrary to what was commonly believed, could not be fixed in a '[[firmament]]'.&lt;ref name="Barbara"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barbara Caredda|title=Aspetti e Momenti del Dibattito Astronomica nella Prima Accademia dei Lincei (1603-1616)|journal=Dottorato in Storia, Filosofia e Didattica delle Scienze, Università degli Studi di Cagliari|date=2008|page=53|url=http://veprints.unica.it/482/1/b_caredda_td.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers (still working with the unaided naked eye at this time) took measurements of [[parallax]] to determine whether an object was near the earth or far away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgfax.com/school/distance_history.pdf|format=PDF|title=Distance : A History of Parallax and Brief Introduction to Standard Candles|author=B.J. Guillot |website=Bgfax.com|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cesi believed that the Accademia needed to publish something of scientific significance in order to establish its scholarly credibility, and that a book from van Heeck which reaffirmed orthodox Catholic positions would both remove suspicions about the group's activities and pave the way for his return to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Deramaix, Les Académies dans l'Europe humaniste: idéaux et pratiques, Librairie Droz, 2008 p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Van Heeck's theses however posed a number of problems. He critiqued twelve positions put forward by other astronomers on the origins and location of supernovae. Claiming to use the measurement techniques developed by [[Tycho Brahe]], he concluded that the supernova of 1604 showed no sign of [[Parallax#Distance_measurement|parallax]], which meant that the event could not have taken place near the earth, among the planets, but must have been located much further away, among the 'fixed' stars of the firmament or perhaps even further beyond. In this, he agreed with Tycho Brahe and other recent astronomers.  However he reconciled this conclusion with the Aristotelian model by arguing that the apparently new star was not new at all; while permanent, like other stars, it was only occasionally visible for special reasons. He went further, accusing those who argued for a fluid heaven of writing contrary to Holy Writ, and attacking Tycho Brahe for his religious beliefs as well as for his purported scientific errors. Broadening his polemic against all erroneous ideas, he attacked Ptotestantism, thereby drawing Kepler into his argument.&lt;ref&gt;W.G.L. Randles, The Unmaking of the Medieval Christian Cosmos, 1500–1760: From Solid Heavens to Boundless Æther, Routldge 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barbara Caredda|title=Aspetti e Momenti del Dibattito Astronomica nella Prima Accademia dei Lincei (1603-1616)|journal=Dottorato in Storia, Filosofia e Didattica delle Scienze, Università degli Studi di Cagliari|date=2008|page=50|url=http://veprints.unica.it/482/1/b_caredda_td.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language and tone of van Heeck's text was most intemperate. He berated the 'babbling new Philosophers' for their 'profane ignorance' and 'stupid ostentation' in departing from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Westman, The Copernican Question: Prognostication, Skepticism, and Celestial Order, University of California Press, 2011 p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

Cesi greatly esteemed Kepler, and therefore edited van Heeck's text, removing anything hostile to him or to other astronomers. He also removed much of the defence of the Aristotelian cosmology, as it was important for the Accademia to align itself to new astronomical discoveries and not become entrenched in defending Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Heilbron, Galileo, Oxford University Press, 2012 p.176&lt;/ref&gt; He then had the pamphlet published without the lynx emblem of the Accademia on its frontespiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barbara Caredda|title=Aspetti e Momenti del Dibattito Astronomica nella Prima Accademia dei Lincei (1603-1616)|journal=Dottorato in Storia, Filosofia e Didattica delle Scienze, Università degli Studi di Cagliari|date=2008|page=61|url=http://veprints.unica.it/482/1/b_caredda_td.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Heeck was furious at these editorial changes, which had been undertaken without his knowledge or permission.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

==Later life==
Van Heeck's correspondence with Cesi in 1604 and 1605 suggest that he was experiencing some kind of crisis of confidence about his relationship with the other Lincei. He wrote at one point of marrying and not returning to Rome, but Cesi prevailed on him to come back. In April 1605 they asked him to prepare a new book attacking heresy, which was perhaps more suited to his interests at the time. In October 1605 he returned to Italy, but went to Rome only briefly in 1606 before leaving Italy again.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1608 he was in [[Madrid]], where he had apparently gone to see the famous Mexican herbarium in the [[Escorial]]. He probably practiced medicine there, and wrote a treatise entitled ''Politeia Catholica de Bono et Malo cum Civil Antidote'', now lost. In 1610, Federico Cesi's father died&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; and this meant that the members of the Accademia could associate more freely. It is perhaps significant that despite this, van Heeck still did not return to his friends in Rome. Although he continued to contribute to the work of the Accademia, this was on a more sporadic basis and the apparent crisis in his nerves diminished his involvement. 

One of the Accademia's original founders, Anastasio de Filiis, had died in 1608&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincei-celebrazioni.it/ide_filiis.html|title=Accademia dei Lincei - Protagonisti -Anastasio de Filiis|website=Lincei-celebrazioni.it|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cesi invited the elderly and highly esteemed [[Giambattista della Porta]] to join in his place.&lt;ref&gt;Frank N. Egerton, Roots of Ecology: Antiquity to Haeckel, University of California Press, 2012 p.45&lt;/ref&gt; This helped the Accademia to re-establish itself and gave it greatly enhanced respectability after the mistrust it had experienced in its earlier years. The next person to join after Della Porta was [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

Nothing more is known about him until 26 July 1614, when he made a fleeting appearance in Rome, accompanied by Stelluti, for an academic conference on the Greek and Latin languages. A note, probably from 1615, by the Linceian [[Theophilus Müller]] at the end of his book 'De Animalibus' indicates that he visited van Heeck in the abbey of Sant'Angelo in Capoccia.  Van Heeck appeared to be in the grip of a persecution mania, and told him that the king of Spain was persecuting him and insisting that he marry his daughter. The very last known reference to him is in a minute from the 24 March 1616 meeting of the Accademia dei Lincei, which records that he was temporarily excluded from meetings until he was once again of sound mind.

'''John Malcolm MacEachran''' (January 16, 1877 – 1971) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]], whose most notable credentials involved the development of the Psychology and Philosophy Department at the [[University of Alberta]]. He was a co-founder of the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] and the appointed Chairman of the [[Alberta Eugenics Board]] which was responsible for approving sterilization of thousands of [[Alberta]]ns.

==Early years (1877-1909)==

John Malcolm MacEachran was born in [[Glencoe, Ontario|Glencoe]], [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]] to David and Christina MacEachran. After finishing his primary education in the public school system of Glencoe, he was admitted to [[Queen's University]] in Ontario. There, MacEachran obtained an MA in Mental and Moral Philosophy (1902), became the appointed assistant to [[John Watson (philosopher)|Professor John Watson]], and obtained his first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1906. Following his apprenticeship, MacEachran traveled to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], where he worked with the well-known scholars [[Friedrich Paulsen]] and [[Carl Stumpf]], further increasing his knowledge of modern psychology, [[ethics]], and the philosophy of [[education]]. MacEachran then officially commenced schooling in Germany where he became a student of the psychologist/philosopher [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[Leipzig University]] (1907). Here he wrote his doctoral thesis ''Der Pragmatismus'' (1909) earning him his second PhD. MacEachran then traveled to [[Paris]] where he studied [[sociology]] under [[Émile Durkheim]] and took a class under [[Alfred Binet]], who had recently developed the [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] test (1908). MacEachran's academic relationship with [[Henri Bergson]] spurred his interest in combining the disciplines of philosophy and biological science. Dr. MacEachran accepted an offer from the then newly founded [[University of Alberta]] to head its Department of Philosophy and Psychology in 1909.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Greene, B. M., editor. (1945-46) Who's Who in Canada. Toronto: International Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.M. [possibly initials of John Macdonald] (1945) For merit... J. M. MacEachran, M.A., PhD., LL.D. The new trail, 3 (April 2): 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. M. MacEachran 1877-1971. (1971) New Trail, 27(4):26&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Alberta years (1909-1945)==

In 1909, J.M. MacEachran was appointed head of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Alberta. As the head of a new department, MacEachran fabricated the curriculum from scratch and in his first year at the U of A, MacEachran offered introductory courses in [[experimental psychology|experimental]] and modern [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc. Toronto. 1982.p. 192-97&lt;/ref&gt; As the program developed, MacEachran made junior and senior level courses available and in 1911, he made it possible to graduate with a [[Master of Arts|M.A]] and [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A]] in the field of psychology. Other classes that were added to the curriculum included: psychology and [[logic]], [[comparative psychology]] (animal [[evolution]], [[Developmental psychology|child psychology]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] psychology), [[physiological psychology]], [[abnormal psychology]] and [[psychology of religion]]. At this point, MacEachran had developed and supported the whole of the undergraduate philosophy and psychology programs and supervised at least one Masters level student.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} He MacEachran also began administrative duties for the university in 1911, and officially accepted the position as the University of Alberta's first [[Provost (education)|Provost]] in 1912. All of these responsibilities earned him a salary of $4,900.&lt;ref&gt;Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc. Toronto. 1982, p. 192-97&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]] (1916-1918), J.M. MacEachran enlisted as [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in the [[196th Western Universities Battalion]] on March 15, 1916. He also served with the [[19th Reserve Battalion]], the [[C.E.F. Young Soldiers' Battalion]], and the [[13th Brigade C.F.]] in [[France]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After MacEachran's return to the University of Alberta after World War I (1918), a central focus was developing applied psychology. Courses such as applied psychology, [[educational psychology]], [[industrial psychology]], [[legal psychology]] and psychology and economic problems were introduced into the curriculum. While studying at [[Leipzig University]], Wilhelm Wundt lectured to MacEachran that experimental psychology would have to be meticulously studied for two or three centuries before it was to be applied – MacEachran installed applied psychology at the University of Alberta only one decade later.&lt;ref&gt;Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc. Toronto, 1982, p. 197-200&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 MacEachran co-founded the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] and became the first honorary President in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc. Toronto. 1982. p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

With the  additional faculty, the number and range of classes broadened. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, laboratory psychology was crafted. In August 1945, after shaping the Department of Philosophy and Psychology, and much of the Universities' administrative routine, MacEachran retired as [[Emeritus]] Professor of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His successor was John MacDonald.&lt;ref&gt;Wright M.J., and C.R. Rogers. History of Academic Psychology in Canada. C.J. Hogrefe, Inc. Toronto, 1982, p. 192-97&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 the Department of Philosophy and Psychology split into independent departments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/aboutus/history.php|publisher=University of Alberta Psychology Dept.|accessdate=June 19, 2013|title=About Us &amp;#124; Department of Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the University of Alberta was the last western university to complete the transitions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Alberta Eugenics Board (1928-1965)==

J.M. MacEachran was appointed Head of [[Alberta Eugenics Board]] in 1928, immediately after the [[Alberta government]] enacted the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]]. MacEachran was appointed Chairman for the purpose of developing a philosophical justification for the [[eugenics]] movement. He was an ideal candidate for the position because of his extensive background in philosophy and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, T. M. (1982) Psychology at Alberta. In M. J. Wright and C. R. Myers, editors, History of Academic Psychology in Canada. Toronto: C. J. Hogrefe. pp. 192-219 (p.200)&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Alberta Eugenics board is outlined in section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 4(1) of the Sexual Sterilization Act empowered the medical superintendent of a mental hospital to cause a patient of the mental hospital whom it proposed to discharge to be examined by or in the presence of the eugenics board, with a view to sterilization. Section 5 of the Act established two grounds for sterilization: that  procreation by the person under consideration would result in the transmission of any mental disability or deficiency to his or her progeny or involved the risk of mental injury either to such a person or his or her progeny.&lt;ref&gt;Muir v. Alberta, [1996] 4 Western Weekly Reports, at 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

J.M MacEachran of [[Edmonton]] (U of A, Chairman), [[E.L. Pope]] of Edmonton (U of A, Professor of [[Medicine]]), [[E.G. Mason]] of [[Calgary]], and Mrs [[J.H Field]] of [[Spurfield]] (Secretary) were the original four members of the board whose job was to approve or reject patients for sterilization with respect to the guidelines of the Sexual Sterilization Act.&lt;ref&gt;Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after the first meeting of the Alberta Eugenics Board in 1929, at the annual meeting of the [[Canadian Medical Association]] (CMA) in 1934, it was noted that 288 cases had been approved by the Eugenics Board for sterilization, and that 60% of these cases involved serious mental or nervous disease in the patients family record. Two classes of individuals were sterilized - those with low mental IQ's and those who had suffered serious mental breakdowns, and therefore could not be recommended for [[parenting|parenthood]] by any [[physician]]. It was also noted that any operations to be completed on the patients first required personal consent, or consent from family. If no one was eligible to provide consent and the patient was not capable of signing personal consent due to physical or mental barriers, the Minister of Health could do so. In 1933, the Eugenics Board consented that the Chairman, Dr. MacEachran, would have the authority to dictate when an operation for sterilization would take place.&lt;ref&gt;Jana Marie Grekul. Dissertation: Social construction of the feebleminded threat - Implementation of the Sexual Sterilization Act in Alberta, 1929-1972. p.146&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the CMA, agreed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Evidence [had] shown overwhelmingly that sterilization [was] a sound, humane and effective procedure, and [was] one of the chief means of coping with the grave problem of the increasingly large number of mentally sick and mentally deficient persons that each province [was] being called upon to care for.&lt;ref&gt;Association notes – The sixty-fifth annual meeting of the Canadian medical association, (October 1934) 433-436 (Canadian Medical Association Journal. 1934. October; 31(4):433-436.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937, the [[Social Credit]] government passed an amendment that strongly restricted the need for the Eugenics Board to obtain consent of the patients to be sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, H. Alberta barren. Saturday Night, June, 1997, pp. 30-74&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the efficiency of the sterilization process, as more patients could be approved for sterilization by the Eugenics board. In the 44 years that the board was empowered by the government of Alberta, 2822 sterilizations were processed.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson in Muir v. Alberta, 232&lt;/ref&gt; MacEachran resigned from Chairman of the Alberta Eugenics Board on June 30, 1965, serving for 38 consecutive years. During his term as Chairman, MacEachran signed over 3200 applications approving for sterilization of adults and children (~60% of approvals resulted in sterilizations). His successor was [[R.K. Thomson]] who was chairman until 1972 when the Sexual Sterilization Act was repealed.&lt;ref&gt;Jana Marie Grekul. Dissertation: Social construction of the feebleminded threat - Implementation of the Sexual Sterilization Act in Alberta, 1929-1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Alberta ceases honors in MacEachran's name (1990s)==

In 1975, the University of Alberta's Department of Psychology inaugurated an annual lecture series honoring MacEachran.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, R. (1975, March 12). New lecture series established at University. UA News Release (University of Alberta)&lt;/ref&gt; Every year a distinguished scholar of psychology would be invited to give a lecture to students and faculty in MacEachran's honor. Awards and scholarships were also distributed in MacEachran's honor, first in 1958 and then 1972 with endowments from his estate. After 1972, the [[University of Alberta Faculty of Education|Faculty of Education]] and the Departments of Philosophy and Psychology awarded annual scholarships to students honoring MacEachran's accomplishments.

On September 3, 1997, a committee at the University of Alberta voted to rename the lecture series due to MacEachran's involvement in the unlawful sterilization of many Albertans.&lt;ref&gt;Agenda and minutes for the 69th Council Meeting. (1997, September 3). University of Alberta, Department of Psychology&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a University of Alberta panel submitted a request to halt the distribution of awards in J.M. MacEachran's name.&lt;ref&gt;Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 1&lt;/ref&gt; This request was based on data obtained from the [[Leilani Muir]] versus the Province of Alberta trial, which showed that many of the sterilizations were unlawfully approved by the Alberta Eugenics Board. The board, headed by J.M. MacEachran, approved sterilizations without clear evidence that the patients deficiencies would be transmitted to their progeny.&lt;ref name="Kahane 1998. p 3"&gt;Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 3&lt;/ref&gt; The board approved sterilizations of patients who did not fall into the category of "mental defective".&lt;ref name="Kahane 1998. p 3"/&gt; A section of the Sterilization Act stated that upon sterilization, the patient would be discharged from the holding facility and in many instances, patients were sterilized even though discharge was not imminent.&lt;ref name="Kahane 1998. p 3"/&gt;

The board also approved the sterilization of patients already known to be [[infertile]] (patients with [[Down Syndrome]]). Furthermore, castrations were approved in order to obtain [[testicular]] tissue for research purposes.&lt;ref name="Kahane 1998. p 3"/&gt; The board approved sterilizations with the understanding that patient's [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] would be altered, therefore eliminating sexual deviancy,&lt;ref name="Kahane 1998. p 4"&gt;Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 4&lt;/ref&gt; and also with the goal of stopping [[menstruation]] in women.&lt;ref name="Kahane 1998. p 4"/&gt; MacEachran had also signed application forms, approving sterilization before the patients had been interviewed by the board.&lt;ref&gt;Kahane, Sharp and Tweedale. MacEachran Report: Report of the MacEachran Subcommittee, Department of Philosophy, April 1998. p 6&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to the Leilani Muir vs. Alberta trial, Madame Justice [[Joanne B. Veit]] noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Thompson's [a former chair holder of the Alberta Eugenics Board] evidence demonstrates that the operations of the Board initiated on a purported scientific rationale, degenerated into unscientific practices. The decisions of the Board were not made according to the standards imposed on them by the legislation, but because the members of the Board... thought that it was socially appropriate to control reproduction of "these people".&lt;ref&gt;Muir v. Alberta, 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of the previously stated reasons, in 1998, the Department of Philosophy at the University of Alberta stopped giving out rewards honoring MacEachran's name. A single MacEachran award was given out in 2003 from the Department of Philosophy, and then no more thereafter. The University of Alberta's Department of Psychology has continued to distribute awards in MacEachran's honor.&lt;ref&gt;University of Alberta Student Awards. Personal communication, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Passmore''' [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]] (9 September 1914 – 25 July 2004) was an [[Australia]]n [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Passmore was born in [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], [[Sydney]], where he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;John Passmore, ''Memoirs of a Semi-Detached Australian'', Melbourne University Press, Carlton South, 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Sydney Boys High School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/australian-honours.pdf ORDER OF AUSTRALIA]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] with first-class honours in [[English literature]] and [[philosophy]], and continued his studies to become a secondary-school teacher. In 1934 he accepted the position of assistant lecturer in philosophy at the University of Sydney, continuing teaching there until 1949. In 1948 he went to study at the [[University of London]].

From 1950 to 1955 he was professor of philosophy at the [[University of Otago]] in [[New Zealand]]. In 1955 he spent a year at the [[University of Oxford]] on a Carnegie grant. Upon his return to Australia he took up a post at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the [[Australian National University]], where he was professor of Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences from 1958 to 1979. 

In 1960 he was Ziskind visiting professor at [[Brandeis University]] in the [[United States]]. He subsequently lectured in [[England]], the United States, [[Mexico]], [[Japan]], and in various [[Europe]]an countries.

In 1994 he was appointed a Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (AC), Australia's highest civilian honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=881273&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour: AC]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 2004 and was survived by his wife Doris and two daughters.

==Work==
Passmore was as much an historian of ideas as a philosopher, and his scholarship always paid careful attention to the complex historical context of philosophical problems. He published about twenty books, many of which have been translated. Passmore will be remembered as a thinker who helped to shape public debate and to open up domains of applied philosophy and the history of ideas to the wider world.

In his book ''Man's Responsibility for Nature'' (1974) Passmore argued that there is urgent need to change our attitude to the environment, and that humans cannot continue unconstrained exploitation of the biosphere. However, he rejected the view that we need to abandon the Western tradition of scientific rationalism, and was unsympathetic towards attempts to articulate environmental concern through radical revisions of our ethical framework, as advocated by [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]], which he conceived as misguided mysticism or irrationalism. Passmore's unequivocal [[anthropocentrism]] made him a reference point in the discourse of [[environmental ethics]] and many treatises in the field begin with (or include) a criticism of his views. Passmore's skepticism about attempts to attribute intrinsic value to nature, and his preferred position of valuing nature in terms of what it contributes to the flourishing of sentient creatures (including humans), is perhaps not as unfashionable now as it was in the years following the publication of ''Man's Responsibility for Nature''. Passmore described himself as a "pessimistic humanist" who regarded neither human beings nor human societies as perfectible.

Passmore took a keen interest in film and in performing arts and was a director of the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]].

'''Joseph Widmer''' (15 August 1779 – 10 December 1844) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Catholic]] [[theologian]].  A native of [[Hohenrain]], he died in [[Beromünster]].

He studied [[philosophy]] at [[Lucerne]], and [[theology]] at [[Landshut]] (1802-4) under Sailer and Zimmer, the former exercising a great and abiding influence over him. After [[ordination]] Widmer was appointed [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] in 1804, and of moral and pastoral theology in 1819 at the [[lyceum]] of Lucerne. In 1833 he was removed from his position by the Government and received a [[Canon (priest)|canonry]] in the collegiate chapter at Beromunster; in 1841 he became the provost of this chapter. In connection with [[Joseph Heinrich Aloysius Gügler]] Widmer did good service in opposing the teachings of [[Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg]], and in reviving ecclesiastic life in Switzerland. Among his writings are: "Der katholische Seelsorger" (Munich, 1819–23); "Systematische Uebersicht der in Sailer's Handbuch der christlichen Moral ausführlich entwickelten and dargestellten Grundsätze" (Sarmenstorf, 1839); "Vortrage uber Pastoraltheologie" (Sarmenstorf, 1840). He edited the works of Sailer (Sulzbach, 1830–46), of Franz Geiger (Fluelen, 1823–39), and Gügler (Lucerne, 1828–40).

'''Kowtow''', which is borrowed from ''kau tau'' in Cantonese (''koutou'' in Mandarin Chinese), is the act of deep respect shown by [[prostration]], that is, [[kneeling]] and bowing so low as to have one's head touching the ground. An alternative Chinese term is ''ketou''; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: ''kou'' (叩) has the general meaning of ''knock'', whereas ''ke'' (磕) has the general meaning of "touch upon (a surface)", ''tou'' (頭) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], or the [[Warring States Period]] of China's history because it is already known to have been a custom by the time of the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 206 BC).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In [[East Asia|East Asian]] culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has become reduced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Traditional usage==
In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial Chinese]] protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the "three kneelings and nine kowtows", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu|Immanuel Hsu]] describes the "full kowtow" as "three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Rise of Modern China|edition= |last= Hsu|first= Immanuel|year= 1970|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|lccn= 78083022|page= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three people 'kowtowing' to an altar, one woman crying, othe Wellcome V0015171.jpg|thumb|Kowtowing in China]]
As government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the [[Imperial examination]]s is permitted a seat.

Since one is required by [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.

[[Confucius]] believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Theistic%20and%20Non-theistic%20Belief.pdf "Theistic and Non-theistic Belief in China"]. Joseph A. Adler Kenyon College Public Lecture at John Carroll University March 29, 2012. Retrieved 24 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;!-- A citation from the analects or another reliable source would be helpful--&gt; Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.

==Modern Chinese usage==

The kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing [[Bowing|bow]] has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.

The kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, [[Chinese martial arts]] schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.

==Religion==
{{Main|Prostration (Buddhism)}}
Prostration is a general practice in [[Buddhism]], and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either "worship with the crown (of the head)" (頂禮 ding li) or "casting the five limbs to the earth" (五體投地 wuti tou di)—referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows—stand up and kneel down again between each set—as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term ''three kneelings and nine head knockings'' ({{lang|zh-hant|三跪九叩}}). Also, some Buddhist [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the [[Triple Gem]] of Buddhism, the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], the [[Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. Nowadays in modern times people show the regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet.

==Diplomacy==
The word "kowtow" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from  the physical act and the East Asian context.

The kowtow was a significant issue for diplomats, since it was required to come into the presence of the [[Emperor of China]], but it meant submission before him. The British embassies of [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney]] (1793) and [[William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst]] (1816) were allegedly unsuccessful, partly because kowtowing would mean acknowledging their King as a subject of the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]].

Dutch ambassador [[Isaac Titsingh]] did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794–1795 mission to the imperial court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus. (1798). [http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B2962471X/ ''An authentic account of the embassy of the Dutch East-India company, to the court of the emperor of China, in the years 1794 and 1795''], Vol. I (English edition). pp. 285 in original (p. 335 of pp. 339 in digitized format).&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Titsingh mission, including [[Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest]] and [[Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes]], made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex Imperial court etiquette.

On two occasions, the kowtow was performed by Chinese envoys to a foreign ruler – specifically the Russian Tsar. T'o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina [[Anna of Russia|Anna]], as per instructions by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg. &lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Immunel C.-Y. (1999), ''The Rise of Modern China'', New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 115–118 &lt;/ref&gt; Hsu notes that [[Kanghsi Emperor]], Yongzheng's predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China.  

The kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896 when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:仁祖 34卷, 15年 (1636) 正月30日 |publisher=[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]]|language=Chinese|quote=龍胡入報, 出傳汗言曰: “前日之事, 欲言則長矣。 今能勇決而來, 深用喜幸。” 上答曰: “天恩罔極。” 龍胡等引入, 設席於壇下北面, 請上就席, 使淸人臚唱。 上行'''三拜九叩頭禮'''。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground ({{lang|zh|三拜九叩頭禮}}), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/personal/tsuruta/sei0005.htm|title=重点領域研究「沖縄の歴史情報研究 (History Study of Okinawa)|quote= – 「通航一覧・琉球国部 正編 巻之二十三　琉球国部二十三、唐国往来」"|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">'''Meditation music''' is music performed to aid in the practice of [[meditation]]. It can have a specific religious content, but also more recently has been associated with modern composers who use meditation techniques in their process of composition, or who compose such music with no particular religious group as a focus. The concept also includes music performed as an act of meditation.

==History==
Modern meditation music in the 20th century began when composers such as [[John Cage]], [[Stuart Dempster]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Terry Riley]], [[La Monte Young]] and [[Lawrence Ball]] began to combine meditation techniques and concepts, and music. Specific works include [[Tony Scott (musician)|Tony Scott]]'s ''[[Music for Zen Meditation]]'' (1964), [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Inori (Stockhausen)|Inori]]'' (1974), ''[[Mantra (Stockhausen)|Mantra]]'' (1970), ''[[Hymnen]]'' (1966–67), ''[[Stimmung]]'' (1968), and ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'' (1968), [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s ''[[Quartet for the End of Time]]'' (1941), and [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]], whose ''Visions and Spells'' (a realization of ''Vigil'' (1976)), requires a meditation period prior to performance. [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s concepts of clairaudience (clean hearing) as well as the ones found in his ''The Tuning of the World'' (1977) are meditative {{harv|Von Gunden|1983|loc=103–104}}.

Stockhausen describes ''Aus den sieben Tagen'' as "[[intuitive music]]" and in the piece "Es" from this cycle the performers are instructed to play only when not thinking or in a state of nonthinking (Von Gunden asserts that this is contradictory and should be "think about your playing"). John Cage was influenced by Zen and pieces such as ''[[Imaginary Landscape]] No. 4'' for twelve radios are "meditations that measure the passing of time" {{harv|Von Gunden|1983|loc=104}}.

==Christian meditation music==
Some Christian faiths, particularly the Catholic Church, reject meditation practice from outside their traditions, particularly new-age music ({{harvnb|Anon.|2003}}; {{harvnb|Arie|2003}}; {{harvnb|Krumboltz and Chan|2005|loc=358}}; {{harvnb|Pontifical Council for Culture, and Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue|2003}}). However, the Olivier Messiaen piece referenced above is explicitly Christian, and Messiaen himself was a practicing Catholic and a church organist.{{clarify|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--Why is this relevant? The Messiaen composition is not described as "new-age music", nor as being outside the traditions of the Catholic Church.--&gt;

Pylkkö has addressed such topics as [[logic]], [[semiotics]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[cognitive science]]. Pylkkö has published several works focused specifically on the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]], and his works have examined the often problematic relationships between language and subjectivity, nationalism, the limits of scientific rationality, and the semiotic and linguistic mechanics of fascism.

'''Peacekeeping''' refers to activities intended to create conditions that favour lasting peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/|title=United Nations Peacekeeping|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.

Within the [[United Nations]] (UN) group of nation-state governments and organisations, there is a general understanding that at the international level, peacekeepers monitor and observe [[Peacebuilding|peace processes]] in post-conflict areas, and may assist ex-combatants in implementing [[peace agreement]] commitments that they have undertaken. Such assistance may come in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the [[rule of law]], and economic and social development. Accordingly, the [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeepers]] (often referred to as '''Blue Berets '''or '''Blue Helmets''' because of their light blue [[beret]]s or helmets) can include soldiers, [[United Nations Police|police]] officers, and civilian personnel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Peacekeeping |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/about/dpko/ |title=Department of Peacekeeping Operations(DPKO) |publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Peacekeeping |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/about/dfs/ |title=Department of Field Support(DFS) |publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations is not the only organisation to implement peacekeeping missions. Non-UN peacekeeping forces include the [[Kosovo Force|NATO mission in Kosovo]] (with United Nations authorisation) and the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] on the [[Sinai Peninsula]] or the ones organised by the [[European Union]] (like [[EUFOR RCA]], with UN authorisation) and the [[African Union]] (like the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]]). The [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]] is one NGO widely considered to have expertise in general peacemaking by non-governmental volunteers or activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Jobs Donate Offices |url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/ |title=Nonviolent Peaceforce |publisher=Nonviolent Peaceforce |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and types of peacekeeping operations==

=== United Nations peacekeeping missions ===

====Chapter VI and Chapter VII mission types====
There are a range of various types of operations encompassed in peacekeeping. In Page Fortna's book ''Does Peacekeeping Work?'', for instance, she distinguishes four different types of peacekeeping operations.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?: Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, these types of missions and how they are conducted are heavily influenced by the mandate in which they are authorized. Three of Fortna's four types are consent-based missions, i.e. so-called "[[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VI]]" missions, with the fourth being a "[[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]]" Mission. 
Chapter VI missions are consent based, therefore they require the consent of the belligerent factions involved in order to operate. Should they lose that consent, Peacekeepers would be compelled to withdraw. Chapter VII missions, by contrast, do not require consent, though they may have it. If consent is lost at any point, Chapter VII missions would not be required to withdraw.
# ''Observation Missions'' which consist of small contingents of military or civilian observers tasked with monitoring cease-fires, troop withdrawals, or other conditions outlined in a ceasefire agreement. They are typically unarmed and are primarily tasked with observing and reporting on what is taking place. Thus, they do not possess the capability or mandate to intervene should either side renege on the agreement. Examples of observation missions include [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission II|UNAVEM II]] in [[Angola]] in 1991 and [[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]] in the [[Western Sahara]].
# ''Interpositional Missions'', also known as traditional peacekeeping, are larger contingents of lightly armed troops meant to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions in the aftermath of a conflict. Thus, they serve as a buffer zone between the two sides and can monitor and report on the compliance of either side with regard to parameters established in a given ceasefire agreement. Examples include [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III|UNAVEM III]] in Angola in 1994, and [[MINUGUA]] in [[Guatemala]] in 1996.
# ''Multidimensional missions'' are carried out by military and [[United Nations Police|police]] personnel in which they attempt to implement robust and comprehensive settlements. Not only do they act as observers, or in an interpositional role, but they also participate in more multidimensional tasks—such as electoral supervision, police and security forces reform, institution building, economic development and more. Examples include [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group|UNTAG]] in [[Namibia]], [[ONUCA and ONUSAL|ONUSAL]] in [[El Salvador]], and [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|ONUMOZ]] in [[Mozambique]].
# ''Peace enforcement Missions'' are Chapter VII missions and unlike the previous Chapter VI missions, they do not require the consent of the belligerent parties. These are multidimensional operations comprising both civilian and military personnel. The military force is substantial in size and fairly well-equipped by UN Peacekeeping standards. They are mandated to use force for purposes beyond just self-defence. Examples include [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] and [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]] in [[West Africa]] and [[Sierra Leone]] in 1999, as well as the [[NATO]] operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]—[[Implementation Force|IFOR]] and [[SFOR]].&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7"/&gt;

==== UN missions during and after the Cold War ====

During the [[Cold War]], peacekeeping was primarily interpositional in nature—thus being referred to as traditional peacekeeping. UN Peacekeepers were deployed in the aftermath of interstate conflict in order to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions and ensure compliance with the terms of an established peace agreement. Missions were consent-based, and more often than not observers were unarmed—such was the case with [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation|UNTSO]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[UN mediation of Kashmir|UNCIP]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Others were armed—such as [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF-I]], established during the [[Suez Crisis]]. They were largely successful in this role.

In the [[Post–Cold War era|post-Cold War]] era, the United Nations has taken on a more nuanced, multidimensional approach to Peacekeeping. In 1992, in the aftermath of the Cold War, then [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] put together a report detailing his ambitious concepts for the United Nations and Peacekeeping at large. The report, titled ''[[An Agenda for Peace]]'', described a multi-faceted and interconnected set of measures he hoped would lead to effective use of the UN in its role in post-Cold War international politics. This included the use of preventative diplomacy, peace-enforcement, peace-making, peace-keeping and post-conflict reconstruction.

==== Broader aims of UN missions ====

In ''The UN Record on Peacekeeping Operations'', [[Michael W. Doyle|Michael Doyle]] and Nicolas Sambanis summarise Boutros Boutros’ report as preventative diplomacy, confidence-building measures such as fact-finding missions, observer mandates, and the potential deployment of UN mandated forces as a preventative measure in order to diminish the potential for violence or the danger of violence occurring and thus increasing the prospect for lasting peace. Their definitions are as follows:
# ''Peace-enforcement'', meant to act with or without the consent of the belligerents in order to ensure any treaty or cease-fire mandated by the United Nations Security Council is maintained. This is done primarily under the auspices of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and the forces are generally heavily armed as opposed to the unarmed, or lightly-armed personnel frequently deployed as observers.
# ''Peace-making'', meant to compel belligerents to seek a peaceful settlement for their differences via mediation and other forms of negotiation provided by the UN under the auspices of Chapter VI of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].
# ''Peace-keeping'', deployment of a lightly-armed United Nations presence in the field with the consent of the belligerents involved in order to build confidence and monitor any agreements between concerned parties. Additionally, diplomats would continue to work toward comprehensive and lasting peace, or for the implementation of an agreed upon peace.
# ''Post-Conflict Reconstruction,'' intended to develop economic and social cooperation meant to mend relations between the belligerents. Social, political, and economic infrastructure would ideally prevent potential violence and conflict in the future and help to contribute to a lasting and robust peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|date=2007|title=The UN Record On Peacekeeping Operations|url=|journal=International Journal|volume=63|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all international peacekeeping forces have been directly controlled by the United Nations. In 1981, an agreement between Israel and Egypt formed the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] which continues to monitor the [[Sinai Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="10TAGpgA-1"&gt;10 Tactical Air Group: ''Canadian Contingent Multinational Force and Observers Handbook'' (unclassified), page A-1. DND, Ottawa, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) is working on building an African Peace and Security Architecture that fulfils the mandate to enforce peace and security on the continent. In cases of [[genocide]] or other serious human-rights violations, an AU-mission could be launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned, as long as it is approved by the AU General Assembly. The establishment of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) which includes the African Standby Force (ASF) is planned earliest for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/african-peace-and-security-architecture-already-proving-useful-even-though-it-still-work |title=The African Peace and Security Architecture is already proving useful even though it is still work in progress |publisher=dandc.eu |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping (UCP) are civilian personnel that carry out non-violent, non-interventionist and impartial set of tactics in order to protect civilians in conflict zones from violence in addition to supporting additional efforts to build a lasting peace. While the term UCP is not entirely ubiquitous among non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in the field: many utilize similar techniques and desire shared outcomes for peace; such as accompaniment, presence, rumour control, community security meetings, the securing of safe passage, and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rachel|first=Julian|last2=Schweitzer|first2=Christine|date=2015|title=The Origins And Development of Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping|url=|journal=Peace Review|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
{{Main|History of United Nations peacekeeping}}

===Creation and early years===

United Nations Peacekeeping started in 1948 when the [[United Nations Security Council]] authorised the deployment of UN unarmed military observers to the Middle East in order to monitor the armistice agreement that was signed between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the wake of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]]. This operation was called the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) and is still in operation today.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/history.shtml|title=History of Peacekeeping|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passage of resolution 73 (1949) by the Security Council in August 1949, UNTSO was given the task of fulfilling four Armistice Agreements between the state of Israel and the Arab states which had participated in the war. Thus, UNTSO's operations were spread through five states in the region—Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/untso/background.shtml|title=UNTSO Background|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War peacekeeping===
In the wake of independence in India and Pakistan in August 1947 and the subsequent bloodshed that followed the Security Council adopted resolution 39 (1948) in January 1948 in order to create the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), with the purpose of mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and the fighting related to it. This operation was non-interventionist in nature and was additionally tasked with supervision of a ceasefire signed by Pakistan and India in the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]]. With the passage of the [[Karachi Agreement|Karachi agreement]] in July 1949, UNCIP would supervise a ceasefire line that would be mutually overseen by UN unarmed military observers and local commanders from each side in the dispute. UNCIP's mission in the region continues to this day, now under the operational title of the [[UN mediation of Kashmir|United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmogip/background.shtml|title=UNMOGIP Background|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, sixty-nine peacekeeping operations have been authorised and have deployed to various countries all over the world.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The great majority of these operations have begun in the post-Cold War world. Between 1988 and 1998 thirty-five UN operations had been established and deployed. This signified a substantial increase when compared with the periods between 1948 and 1978; which saw the creation and deployment of only thirteen UN Peacekeeping operations and zero between 1978 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed intervention first came in the form of UN involvement in the wake of the Suez Crisis in 1956. [[United Nations Emergency Force]] (UNEF-1), which existed from November 1956 to June 1967 was essentially the first ever United Nations peacekeeping force. It was given the mandate of ensuring the cessation of hostilities between [[Egypt]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Israel]] in addition to overseeing the withdrawal of French, Israeli and British troops from Egyptian territory. Upon completion of said withdrawal, UNEF would serve as a buffer force between Egyptian and Israeli forces in order to supervise conditions of the ceasefire and contribute to a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1mandate.html|title=UNEF Mandate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC), was deployed in 1960. This operation involved upwards of 20,000 military personnel at its peak, and resulted in the death of 250 UN personnel, including then Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld|Dag Hammarskjold]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/early.shtml|title=The Early Years of UN Peacekeeping|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONUC was meant to ensure the withdrawal of [[Belgium|Belgian]] forces in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], who had reinserted themselves after Congolese independence in the wake of a revolt carried out by the [[Force Publique]] (FP), in order to protect Belgian citizens and economic interests. ONUC was also tasked with establishing and maintaining law and order (helping to end the FP revolt and ethnic violence) as well as provide technical assistance and training to Congolese security forces. An additional function was added to ONUC's mission, in which the force was tasked with maintaining the territorial integrity and political independence of the Congo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/onuc.htm|title=ONUC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—resulting from the secession of the mineral-rich provinces of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and [[South Kasai]]. The UN forces there, somewhat controversially, more or less became an arm of the Congolese government at the time and helped to forcefully end the secession of both provinces.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the UN created multiple short-term missions all over the world including the Mission of the Representative of the Secretary-General in the Dominican Republic (DOMREP), the UN Security Force in West New Guinea (UNSF), the [[United Nations Yemen Observation Mission|UN Yemen Observation Mission]] (UNYOM), in conjunction with more long-term operations such as the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] (UNFICYP), the UN Emergency Force II (UNEF II), the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UN Interim Force]] in [[Lebanon]] (UNIFIL).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:UNpeacekeeping.svg|thumb|right|[[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions as of 2012]]

===Since 1991===
[[File:Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-un-holds-head.jpg|thumb|[[Norway|Norwegian]] Peacekeeper during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], 1992 - 1993, photo by [[Mikhail Evstafiev]].]]Experiences of peacekeeping during the [[Yugoslav Wars]], especially failures such as the [[Srebrenica Massacre]], led, in part, to the [[United Nations Peacebuilding Commission]], which works to implement stable peace through some of the same civic functions that peacekeepers also work on, such as elections. The Commission currently works with six countries, all in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/beyond-peace-deals-united-nations-experiment-peacebuilding |title=Beyond Peace Deals: The United Nations Experiment in "Peacebuilding"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[U.N. Security Council]] unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women's participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas.&lt;ref name="AWID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |title=UN Security Council Takes a Historic Stand Supporting Abortion Access for Women Raped in War / Library / Homepage |publisher=AWID |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101025/http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), a UN women's rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women's Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women's rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13885&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR -|website=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that [[non-state actor]]s, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

One of the findings of Page Fortna about where peacekeepers go is that “peacekeeping is a matter of supply and demand” From the supply side, she observes that there is unlikely a Peacekeeping mission in civil wars on countries close to one of the members of the Security Council. From the demand side, there is diverse evidence that peacekeeping missions are deployed in the countries who need it the most, this is where the risk of a recurring war is high.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7" /&gt;

== Composition of peacekeeping forces ==

===Nations that participate in peacekeeping missions===
[[File:Irish troops UNMIL.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Irish [[UNMIL]] troops on patrol in Liberia, July 2006.]]
The [[United Nations Charter]] stipulates that to assist in maintaining peace and security around the world, all member states of the UN should make available to the Security Council necessary armed forces and facilities. Since 1948, about 130 nations have contributed military and civilian police personnel to peace operations. While detailed records of all personnel who have served in peacekeeping missions since 1948 are not available, it is estimated that up to one million soldiers, police officers and civilians have served under the UN flag in the last 56 years. As of March 2008, 113 countries were contributing a total 88,862 military observers, police, and troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/contributors/2008/mar08_1.pdf|title=Contributors to United Nations peacekeeping operations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large number of contributors, the greatest burden continues to be borne by a core group of developing countries. The ten largest troop (including police and military experts) contributing countries to UN peacekeeping operations as of May, 2017 were [[Ethiopia]] (8229), [[India]] (7665), [[Pakistan]] (7135), [[Bangladesh]] (6958), [[Rwanda]] (6256), [[Nepal]] (5158), [[Burkina Faso]] (2969), [[Senegal]] (2847), [[Ghana]] (2751), [[Indonesia]] (2719).&lt;ref name="unpko-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml|title=Troop and police contributors|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2008, in addition to military and police personnel, 5,187 international civilian personnel, 2,031 UN Volunteers, and 12,036 local civilian personnel worked in UN peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/bnote.htm|title=Background Note - United Nations Peacekeeping Operations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 30 June 2014, 3,243 people from over 100 countries have been killed while serving on peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/fatalities/documents/stats_2.pdf|title=United Nations peacekeeping - Fatalities By Year up to 30 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those came from [[India]] (157), [[Nigeria]] (142), [[Pakistan]] (136), [[Ghana]] (132), [[Canada]] (121), [[France]] (110) and the [[United Kingdom]] (103). Thirty percent of the fatalities in the first 55 years of UN peacekeeping occurred between 1993 and 1995.

[[Developing nations]] tend to participate in peacekeeping more than developed countries.  This may be due in part because forces from smaller countries avoid evoking thoughts of imperialism. The rate of reimbursement by the UN for troop contributing countries per peacekeeper per month include: $1,028 for pay and allowances; $303 supplementary pay for specialists; $68 for personal clothing, gear and equipment; and $5 for personal weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/faq/q10.htm|title=United Nations Peacekeepers - How are peacekeepers compensated?|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a significant source of revenue for a developing country. By providing important training and equipment for the soldiers as well as salaries, UN peacekeeping missions allow them to maintain larger armies than they otherwise could. About 4.5% of the troops and civilian police deployed in UN peacekeeping missions come from the [[European Union]] and less than one percent from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/overview.shtml |title=Peacekeeping Fact Sheet |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's participation in peacekeeping===
Security Council Resolution 1325 was the first major step taken by the UN to include women as active and equal actors in “the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security”.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women (2013). "Landmark Resolution on Women Peace and Security", United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/wps/#resolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Security Council (October 31, 2000) "Resolution 1325", S/RES/1325, United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of this resolution is that UNSCR 1325 proposes the implementing gender mainstreaming, however the progress that has been accomplished in this area has focused on women, rather than on assessing the impacts of planned action on both men and women. In 2010, a comprehensive 10-year impact study was conducted to assess the success of this resolution and found that there was limited success with the implementation, particularly in the increasing women's participation in peace negotiations and peace agreements, and sexual and gender-based violence has continued to be prevalent, despite efforts to reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field Support (2010).

[[File:Ghana IntPeaceCorps 2016-05-29 B002a.jpg|thumb|Ghanaian women serve in UN Peacekeeping]]
In 2013 the [[U.N. Security Council]] unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women's participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas.&lt;ref name="AWID"/&gt; Also in 2013, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), a UN women's rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women's Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women's rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction &lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt; The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that non-state actors, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

As of July 2016, women serve in every UN peacekeeping mission either as troops, police, or civilian staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/gender.shtml|title=Gender statistics. United Nations Peacekeeping|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, women made up 1% of deployed uniformed personnel. In 2014, out of approximately 125,000 peacekeepers, women constitute 3% of military personnel and 10% of police personnel in UN Peacekeeping missions, as well as 29% of international and 17% of national staff in peacekeeping and special political missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/women/womeninpk.shtml|title=Women in Peacekeeping.

== Theoretical basis for why peacekeeping missions should keep and preserve peace ==
While much has been written about Peacekeeping and what Peacekeepers do, very little empirical research has taken place in order to identify the manner in which Peacekeepers can have an impact in a post-conflict environment. [[Columbia University]] Professor, Virginia Page Fortna attempts to lay out four causal mechanisms through which peacekeepers have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices After Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortna's four mechanisms are as follows:
# Change the incentives of recent belligerents, making peace more desirable or war more costly.
# Reduce the uncertainty and fear that drives security dilemma spirals.
# Prevent or control accidents or the actions of rogue groups that might otherwise escalate back to war.
# Prevent political abuse by one side (generally the government) that might cause actors losing the peace to take up arms anew.
Fortna argues that peacekeepers have a positive impact on the peace process, despite often being sent to places where peace is most difficult to achieve. Peacekeeping is often looked at by detractors as ineffective, or unnecessary. Peace prevails when belligerents already have a vested interest in sustaining peace and therefore it could be argued that Peacekeepers play only a minor role in creating a strong foundation for enduring peace. Yet these causal reasons illustrate the important roles that Peacekeepers play in ensuring that peace lasts, especially when contrasted against situations in which belligerents are left to their own devices. These causal reasons thus illustrate the need for Peacekeeping and lay a foundation for the manner in which Peacekeeping operations can have a substantive impact on the post-conflict environment.

In order to change the incentives for war and make peace more appealing the UN can provide a military force by way of an enforcement mandate which provides deterrence to would-be spoilers. They can monitor the situation making the potential for surprise attack by one of the belligerents less likely to occur or by making it more difficult to carry out such an attack. A lightly-armed observer mission can also serve as an early-warning force or “tripwire” for the aforementioned enforcement mission. Aid and recognition provided to the belligerents by the international community should be made conditional and based on compliance with objectives laid out in the negotiating process. And lastly, peace dividends should be provided in the forms of jobs, public works and other benefits.

To reduce uncertainty and fear the UN Peacekeeping force can monitor the aforementioned compliance, facilitate communication between belligerents in order to ease security dilemma concerns thus reassuring belligerents that the other side will not renege, and allow for belligerents to signal their legitimate intentions for peace to the other side. That is to say, provide a meaningful pathway for communication between both sides to make their intentions known and credible.

Prevention and control of potential accidents that may derail the peace process can be achieved by the peacekeeping force by deterring rogue groups. Belligerent forces are often undisciplined without a strong central source of [[command and control]], therefore while a peace is being negotiated there is potential for a rogue group on one side to renege and spoil the peace process. UN forces can serve to prevent this. Additionally, the UN force can serve as a moderator and make communication easy between both parties and bring in political moderates from either side. By providing law and order UN peacekeeping forces can temporarily replace a state's security forces and prevent a bias overreaction to an alleged violation by one side which could in turn result in escalation and a renewal in the violence.

Prevention of political abuse can be achieved through the reformation of institutions associated with the government. Training and monitoring the security forces (e.g. army or police) help to make them an unbiased protector of the people rather than a weapon of suppression for the ruling government. Hopefully this training can bring trust by the people for the security establishment. UN forces can also run and monitor elections in order to ensure a fair process. In other cases, the UN may provide a neutral interim government to administer the country during a transitional period wherein the associated government institutions are being retrained, reformed or better developed. Lastly, military groups such as armed rebels can be encouraged to put down their weapons and transformed into political organisations using appropriate non-violent means to mete out their grievances and compete in the election cycle. This is especially important as many of these groups serve as the chief opposition to a given government, but lack the means or know-how to operate effectively as political organisations.

Different peacekeeping missions take place as a result of different causal mechanisms. More military deterrence and enforcement are meant for those missions operating under the auspices of Chapter VII, while Chapter VI missions are meant to serve more as monitoring forces and interpositional operations are meant to target and prevent potential political abuse—these are primarily multidimensional missions and are heavily involved in the post-conflict political situation.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?: Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness of peacekeeping missions ==

According to a 2014 survey of the academic literature, "there is considerable evidence that [United Nations peacekeeping operations] are effective in maintaining peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoeffler|first=Anke|date=2014-03-11|title=Can international interventions secure the peace?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2233865914525380|journal=[[International Area Studies Review]]|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=75–94|doi=10.1177/2233865914525380}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fortna, there is strong evidence that the presence of peacekeepers significantly reduces the risk of renewed warfare; more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer battlefield deaths; and more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2015/09/24/enough-with-the-pessimism-about-peacekeeping/|title=Enough with the Pessimism about Peacekeeping|date=2015-09-24|website=Political Violence at a Glance|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by political scientists at [[Uppsala University]] and [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] estimates that an ambitious UN peacekeeping policy with a doubled peacekeeping operation and strong mandates would "reduce the global incidence of armed conflict by two thirds relative to a no-PKO scenario."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hegre|first=Håvard|last2=Hultman|first2=Lisa|last3=Nygård|first3=Håvard Mokleiv|date=2018-11-28|title=Evaluating the Conflict-Reducing Effect of UN Peacekeeping Operations|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700203|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/700203|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fordham University political scientist Anjali Dayal, "Scholars have found that peacekeeping keeps wars from bleeding across borders. Having more peacekeepers on the ground also seems to correspond with fewer civilians targeted with violence. And peace operations at times have successfully served as transitional authorities, handing power back to local authorities, although this is decreasingly true."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/01/is-u-n-peacekeeping-under-fire-heres-what-you-need-to-know/|title=Is U.N. peacekeeping under fire? Here’s what you need to know.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that the promise to deploy peacekeepers can help international organizations bring combatants to the negotiation table and increase the likelihood that they will agree to a cease-fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which international organizations can settle civil wars?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=DOI 10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By controlling for specific factors that affect where peacekeepers are deployed and what the potential chances for peace are, Page Fortna's statistical research shows that there is a statistically significant impact on lasting peace when peacekeepers are deployed. Despite the fact that peacekeepers are sent to locations where peace is least likely to succeed, Fortna finds that conservative estimates suggest that the presence of UN peacekeepers diminishes the risk for renewed violence by at least 55%-60%; with less conservatives estimates upwards of 75%-85%.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 116"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, her analysis concludes that there is little difference in the effectiveness between Chapter VI consent-based missions and Chapter VII enforcement missions. Indeed, enforcement missions only remain effective if the UN peacekeeping force can prove and sustain their credibility in the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=109, 116, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stresses the importance of a UN mission maintaining the consent of the peacekept. Ultimately, Fortna finds that peacekeeping is an effective tool for ensuring a lasting peace; especially compared to situations in which belligerents' are left to their own devices. Utilising the previously mentioned causal mechanisms for peacekeeping, a UN peacekeeping force can have a substantial and substantive impact on sustaining a lasting peace. Having a relative consensus of the positive impact of peacekeeping for ensuring a lasting peace, Fortna and Howard suggest that  the literature is moving towards the study of  i) the effectiveness of the types of peace-keepers, ii) the transitional administrations, iii) the links between peacekeeping and democratisation, and iv) the perspectives of the “peacekept".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|title=Pitfalls and Prospects in the Peacekeeping Literature*|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|last2=Howard|first2=Lise Morjé|date=2008-05-20|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle and Sambanis' analysis finds that lasting peace is more likely after non-ethnic wars in countries with a relatively high level of development in addition to whether or not UN peacekeeping forces and financial assistance are available. They conclude that in the short run lasting peace is more dependent on a robust UN deployment coupled with low levels of hostility between belligerents. They note that increased economic capacity can provide an incentive not to renew hostilities. In the long run, however, economic capacity matters far more whereas the degree of hostility between belligerents is less important. As successful as UN deployments can be, they have inadequately spurred independent economic development within the countries where they have intervened. Thus, the UN plays a strong, but indirect role and success in lasting peace is predicated on the development of institutions that support peace, rather than serving as a deterrent for renewed war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making War and Building Peace : United Nations Peace Operations|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly analyses show varying success rates for peacekeeping missions, with estimate ranging from 31 percent to 85 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Autesserre|first1=Severine|title=Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors that Impact Lasting Peace ===
There are many factors that can have a negative impact on lasting peace such as hidden information about the relative strength possessed by the belligerents; a rebel group's involvement in illicit financing through means such as through the export of diamonds and other minerals; participation in the trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings; whether or not military victory was achieved by one side; the length of the war as well as how costly it was; commitment problems and security dilemma spirals experienced by both sides; whether a cease-fire or treaty signed by the belligerents; lack of transparency in the motives and actions carried out by belligerents in the immediate aftermath of the conflict; extremist spoilers; participants in the conflict that may benefit from its continuation; indivisibility and more.

Perhaps one of the most statistically significant contributors to a lasting peace is whether or not military victory was achieved by one side. According to Fortna's research, civil wars in which one side wins, resulting in a cease-fire or truce, have an approximately 85%-90% lower chance of renewed war. Moreover, peace treaties further reduce the risk by 60%-70%.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 116"/&gt;

If a group is funded by drugs, diamonds or other illicit trade then there is a substantial increase in the chance of renewed violence—100%-250%-- which is to say that in such circumstances war is two to three-and-a-half times more likely to begin again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?

Costly wars and wars fought along identity lines both provide varied chances of the renewal of violence.

== Impacts of peacekeeping on participating forces ==

===Military normalisation===
Some commentators have highlighted the potential to leverage peacekeeping operations as a mechanism for advancing military normalisation. Michael Edward Walsh and Jeremy Taylor have argued that [[Japan]]'s peacekeeping operations in [[South Sudan]] provide those promoting Japan's military normalisation with "a unique opportunity to further erode the country’s pacifist constitution."&lt;ref name="nbr.org"&gt;Jeremy Taylor and Michael Edward Walsh (7 January 2014), ''[http://www.nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/psa/taylor-walsh_commentary_010714.pdf UN Operations in Africa Provide a Mechanism for Japan’s Military Normalization Agenda]'', retrieved 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "Unable to accept the full weight of modern peacekeeping operations without fundamental political, legal, and social changes," they conclude that "Japan’s peacekeepers remain ill-prepared to tackle many serious contingencies requiring use of deadly force."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edward Walsh and Jeremy Taylor (23 December 2013), ''[http://africanarguments.org/2013/12/23/time-to-reconsider-the-japanese-peacekeeping-mission-in-south-sudan-by-michael-edward-walsh-jeremy-taylor/ Time to Reconsider the Japanese Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan]'', retrieved 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, they suggest that Japan's continued participation in UN peacekeeping operations might force policy changes that ultimately push the country toward "a tipping point from which the normalisation of Japan’s military (will be) the only outcome."&lt;ref name="nbr.org"/&gt;

===Political impact on sending countries===
[[Diana Muir|Diana Muir Appelbaum]], has expressed concern that the creation of a military in [[Fiji]] for the purpose of serving in international peacekeeping missions, has produced a military powerful enough to stage four coups d’état (1987, 1999–2000, 2006, and 2009) and to rule Fiji as a military dictatorship for over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Diana Muir (27 August 2012), ''[http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/4867/features/how-the-sinai-peacekeeping-force-staged-a-military-coup-in-fiji/ How the Sinai Peacekeeping Force Staged a Military Coup in Fiji]'', retrieved 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2018 study published in the Journal of Peace Research, found that countries where militaries are highly dependent on the funds they receive from UN peacekeeping were less likely to experience coups d’états than comparable countries less dependent on such funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|date=2018|title=Backdoor peacekeeping: Does participation in UN peacekeeping reduce coups at home?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343317747668|journal=Journal of Peace Research|doi=10.1177/0022343317747668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts on individual peacekeepers ===

Studies of peacekeeping soldiers show both positive and negative effects. A study of 951 US Army soldiers assigned to Bosnia revealed that 77% reported some positive consequences, 63% reported a negative consequence, and 47% reported both.&lt;ref&gt;Newby, John H., et al. "Positive and negative consequences of a military deployment." ''Military Medicine'' (2005) 170#10 pp: 815-819&lt;/ref&gt;  The peacekeepers are exposed to danger caused by the warring parties and often in an unfamiliar climate. This gives rise to different mental health problems, suicide, and substance abuse as shown by the percentage of former peacekeepers with those problems. Having a parent in a mission abroad for an extended period is also stressful to the peacekeepers' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fernandes Souza | first1 = Wanderson | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder in peacekeepers: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 199 | issue = 5| pages = 309–312 | doi=10.1097/nmd.0b013e3182175180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint raises the problem that the peacekeeping may soften the troops and erode their combat ability, as the mission profile of a peacekeeping contingent is totally different from the profile of a unit fighting an all-out war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926001502/http://www.usafa.af.mil/jscope/ISME2007/Papers/Prof%20Paulin%20Kaurin%20War%20Stories.doc Kaurin, P.

==Criticism==

===Peacekeeping, human trafficking, and forced prostitution===
{{Main|Peacekeeping child sexual abuse scandal}}
Since the 1990s, UN Peacekeepers have been the subject of numerous accusations of abuse ranging from [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], to [[pedophilia]] and [[human trafficking]]. Complaints have arisen from [[Cambodia]], [[East Timor]] and [[West Africa]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] prostitution associated with trafficked women skyrocketed and often operated just beyond the gates of U.N. compounds. David Lamb, a regional human rights officer in Bosnia from 2000 to 2001 claimed “The sex slave trade in Bosnia largely exists because of the U.N. peacekeeping operation. Without the peacekeeping presence, there would have been little or no forced prostitution in Bosnia.” In addition, hearing held by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2002 found that members of SFOR were frequenting Bosnian brothels and engaging in sex with trafficked women and underage girls.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allred|first=KJ|date=2006|title=Peacekeepers And Prostitutes: How Deployed Forces Fuel the Demand for Trafficked Women and New Hope for Stopping It|url=|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|volume=33|issue=1|page=7|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in [[Cambodia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and [[Kosovo]] after UN and, in the case of the latter two, NATO peacekeeping forces moved in. In the 1996 UN study called "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children", former first lady of Mozambique [[Graça Machel]] documented: "In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in [[child prostitution]]".&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf|title=The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gita Sahgal]] spoke out in 2004 with regard to the fact that prostitution and [[sex abuse]] crops up wherever [[humanitarian intervention]] efforts are set up. She observed that the "issue with the UN is that [[peacekeeping operation]]s unfortunately seem to be doing the same thing that other militaries do. Even the guardians have to be guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1126/p06s02-wogi.html Sex charges haunt UN forces; In places like Congo and Kosovo, peacekeepers have been accused of abusing the people they're protecting," ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 26 November 2004, accessed 16 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein]], then Permanent Representative of [[Jordan]] to the United Nations, in 2006 resulted in a comprehensive report which detailed some of this abuse in detail— particularly that which occurred in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Sexual exploitation frequently came in the form of prostitution, wherein some money (an average of $1-$3 per encounter) was exchanged for sex. In other instances food, or jobs were utilized to ply women for sex. Other young women reported of “rape disguised as prostitution”, whereabouts Peacekeepers would rape them and were then given some money or food in order to make the act seem consensual.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hussein, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid. (2005) "A Comprehensive Strategy to Eliminate Future Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations." Report to the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Between May and September 2004, there were seventy-two allegations of sexual exploitation—68 against military and 4 against civilian personnel. By the end of 2004 there would be a total of 105 allegations. The majority of these allegations were in regards to sex with person under the age of 18 years (45 percent) and sex with adult prostitutes (31 percent). Rape and sexual assault made up approximately 13 and 5 percent respectively, with the remaining 6 percent of allegations relating to other forms of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hussein, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid. (2005) "A Comprehensive Strategy to Eliminate Future Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations." Report to the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations: 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the allegations were against peacekeepers from [[Pakistan]], [[Uruguay]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

[[Uruguay]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;an President [[Jose Mujica]] apologized to Haitian President [[Michel Martelly]] over the alleged rape of an 18-year-old Haitian man by Uruguayan UN peacekeeping troops. Martelly said "a collective rape carried out against a young Haitian" would not go unpunished. Four soldiers suspected of being involved in the rape have been detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/07/us-haiti-uruguay-un-idUSTRE78603I20110907|title=Uruguay apologises over alleged rape by U.N. peacekeepers|work=Reuters|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=236953|title=Uruguay to apologise over alleged rape by UN peacekeepers|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 the United Nations [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO) confined an entire contingent of 734 Moroccans in the [[Ivory Coast]] in the wake of allegations that some had sexually abused underage girls. In the following years, there were 80 investigations carried out by the UN [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services|Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simic|first=Olivera|date=2012|title=UN Peacekeeping Operations: The Emerging Problem Of Sexual Exploitation|url=|journal=Regulation of Sexual Conduct in UN Peacekeeping Operations|pages=13–38|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, allegations were levelled on personnel from [[France]], [[Gabon]], and [[Burundi]] operating in the [[Central African Republic]]. These include accusations of sexual abuse and exploitation of at least 108 from [[Kémo|Kemo Prefecture]] and that the vast majority of the cases involved minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/africa/un-peacekeeping-hit-by-new-allegations-of-sickening-sex-abuse.html?_r=0|title=U.N.

[[Tanzania]] and the UN opened a joint inquiry into the alleged abuse, which involved Tanzanian troops. There have been 18 reports of sexual abuse, eight of which involved minors. Sixteen Tanzanian soldiers, a [[Malawi]]an and a South African are implicated in the accusations. The UN reported in March 2016 that there was a large increase in allegations; which involved troops from twenty one countries. Most of the allegations involved troops from African countries including: [[Cameroon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Tanzania]], [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Burundi]], [[Ghana]], [[Madagascar]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/probe-opens-un-troops-alleged-sex-abuse-dr-155023758.html|title=Probe Opens into UN Troops' Alleged Sex Abuse in DR Congo|last=|first=|date=2016|work=|access-date=17 April 2016|via=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peacekeepers and the Haiti cholera crisis===

[[Cholera]] is a waterborne disease that causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and it can kill in a matter of hours if patients do not receive rehydration intervention. As of July 2012, Haiti's cholera epidemic was the worst in the world:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/haiti_cholera.htm Haiti Cholera: One Year Later, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] 25 October 2011, accessed 30 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; about 7,500 had died and about 585,000 Haitians (about 1 in every 20 Haitians) had become ill with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspp.gouv.ht/site/downloads/Rapport%20journalier%20MSPP%20du%2022%20juillet%202012.pdf|title=Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population Cholera Report of July 22, 2012, 22 July 2011, accessed 30 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN-appointed Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti, the conditions at the Peacekeeping base were unsafe, and allowed contamination of Haiti's river systems in at least two ways: "The construction of the water pipes in the main toilet/showering area [was] haphazard, with significant potential for cross-contamination...especially from pipes that run over an open drainage ditch that runs throughout the camp and flows directly into the Meye Tributary System".&lt;ref name="UNCholeraReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf|title=Final Report of the Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti, pages 21-22, July 2011, accessed 30 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Independent Panel reported that on a regular basis black water waste from the Mirebalais base and two other bases was deposited in an open, unfenced septic pit that was susceptible to flooding and would overflow into the Meye Tributary during rainfall.&lt;ref name="UNCholeraReport" /&gt;

In November 2011, over 5,000 victims of the cholera epidemic filed a claim with the UN's internal claims mechanism seeking redress in the form of clean water and sanitation infrastructure necessary to control the epidemic, compensation for individual losses, and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15648110|title=Haiti cholera demand against UN|date=9 November 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, 104 Members of the [[U.S. Congress|United States Congress]] signed a letter affirming that the "actions of the UN" had brought cholera to Haiti and that the UN should "confront and ultimately eliminate cholera".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18928405|title=Haiti cholera 'UN responsibility'|first=Mark|last=Doyle|date=20 July 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the UN rejected the claim and the victims' lawyers have pledged to sue the UN in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/cholera-litigation/ |title=Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti: Cholera Litigation |publisher=Ijdh.org |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural Concerns Related to Contemporary Peacekeeping ===
There is a notable intermingling of varied cultures when it comes to peacekeeping. From the vast number of troops, police and personnel that are brought together from various contributing countries to the oftentimes challenging ethnic regions which peacekeeping forces are often deployed. Because of these varied cultures, complicated cultural interactions take place which not only affect mission effectiveness, but can also lead to friction with the population the peacekeepers are meant to be assisting.

In most cases prior to 1988, specific countries often provided peacekeepers. At that point, only twenty six countries had sent personnel to participate in peacekeeping deployments. Today, that number has risen to more than eighty.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|pages=146–147|doi=10.1080/13533310008413823|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an extremely heterogeneous group. Thus, UN Peacekeeping deployments must not only contend with language complications, but also myriad cultural and social differences that can create operational difficulties that are hard to overcome. These difference can create problems with regard to interactions (whether personal or between institutions/units), misunderstandings, inadvertent offensive behaviour and prejudices that may be associated with a particular contingent from a given country.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

In terms of operations, effectiveness can be hindered by the varying tactics, techniques and procedures employed by the military or police personnel that are a part of a given deployment. Because UN forces are cobbled together from so many different sources, there is a discrepancy in capabilities, training, equipment, standards and procedures. Moreover, substantial differences exist in the form of command and control between contributing members personnel. In addition, some nations may not wish to be subordinated to another, complicating [[unity of command]]. This can lead to deep-seated divisions between contingents  within the UN force that results in a lack of mutual support between units in the field. This can be demonstrated in the experiences of UN peacekeeping forces deployed to [[East Timor]], where the [[Australia]]ns engaged in a robust operation that maximised force protection in contrast to a pro-active heart and minds approach utilised by Great Britain's [[Gurkha|Ghurka]] personnel.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Maintaining the consent of the peacekept is an important facet of modern peacekeeping. Notably in Bosnia, [[Somalia]] and Rwanda, fundamental principles of retaining that consent was ignored on the grounds of a humanitarian intervention—reflecting the nature of an Article VII intervention. Yet in order to stress and maintain the legitimacy of an intervention it is important that the UN's forces continue to enjoy the consent of the population and government of the country to which they were deployed. This means making the peacekept feel a part of the process in addition to important cultural knowledge of the area in which peacekeepers are operating, in order to reduce friction and provide for a successful operation.

There has been little study on the interaction of cultures that exist within a peacekeeping force and the population within which they operate. However, in 1976 Galtun and Hveem studied [[Norway|Norwegian]] personnel who participated in UNEF-1 (in Gaza) and ONUC (Congo). They posited that knowledge of the culture and an understanding of the inhabitants in a given country were not only necessary, but crucial for the success of the mission. They found that personnel from the Norwegian contingent wanted greater insight into the conflict and the culture in which they operated. They also wanted more robust training with regard to working with people from other countries. Yet the study revealed the troops received very little from briefings and that the majority of the information regarding the conflict was gained through the news, reading books or speaking with other UN personnel—rather than any established UN training program.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|pages=150–151|doi=10.1080/13533310008413823|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a study conducted on the relations between members of UNIFIL and local population in Lebanon, carried out by Heiberg and Holst, all but confirmed the findings. In their example, they found that the countries that were able to integrate more fully with the population and show a depth of knowledge about the local culture were more successful, while those that were ambitious, but less integrated into the local scene found themselves far removed from the individuals with which they were supposed to be engaged with, and their success, or lack thereof, illustrated this.&lt;blockquote&gt;Only the Italian contingent of some 2,200 people operated as part of the local environment and became an active element in restoring normal living conditions. Its soldiers were provided with the training required to acquaint them with the cultural, political and social situation of the people among whom they worked. Operating in a sector that contained approximately 600,000 inhabitants, mostly Shi'ites, the Italians carefully nurtured contact with the ordinary citizens and the political leaders in their area... While the Americans thought they were becoming involved in Lebanese politics, they entered into Lebanese culture and history with little or no understanding of the way things worked-- or didn't work... Most Americans did not understand the subtleties of short-term alliances, the length of memories and blood feuds, the strength of ''aln'' [kin] in Arab culture nor the nuances of religious differences.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This illustrates the importance of understanding the significance that culture plays in the conduct of successful peacekeeping operations. However, despite the existence of a UN training manual that attempts to advise peacekeepers on necessary techniques, there is no unifying doctrine, or standardised procedure among peacekeeping contingents, which will ultimately hinder the potential for success.

=== Limitations on Contemporary Intervention and Conflict Resolution ===
Throughout the duration of the Cold War external intervention and mediation in civil conflicts took on a state-centric mechanism in which sovereignty was inviolable. Rarely did the international community intervene in internal conflicts involving a state's government and domestic belligerents that opposed it. Since the end of the Cold War, however, that has changed. Today, mediation by international actors in civil conflict rest on a standardised resolution mechanism that accords broadly equal standing to all factions within a conflict, and attempts to reach a settlement accepted by all.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|date=1998|title=Rwanda: The Perils of Peace|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|publisher=|volume=35|issue=2|pages=193–210|doi=10.1177/0022343398035002003|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Cold War presented an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the [[United States]] and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put a premium on [[Human rights|basic human rights]] and [[democratization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty was not to be violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as [[Third World|third world]] governments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Now, however, with legitimacy being extended to non-state actors, as well as the opportunity for a minority to secede from a given state and form a new country there has been a dramatic shift in the international status quo. Moreover, the international community's model for conflict resolution is heavily influenced by academic thought developed in western countries. This model encourages intervening in civil wars in order to stop political violence and come to a negotiated settlement which often involves democratising efforts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Critics such as Christopher Clapham and [[David Shearer]], argue that this intervention can provide mechanisms for continued conflict to the detriment of the civilian population. Clapham's argument is principally in relation to the situation in [[Rwanda]] leading up to the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; whereas Shearer focuses on the negative aspects of intervention, primarily regarding [[Sierra Leone]], which prevents total victory by one side and results in the creation of asymmetries between belligerents which opens the door for continued bloodshed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shearer|first=David|date=1997|title=Exploring the Limits of Consent: Conflict Resolution in Sierra Leone|url=|journal=Millennium- Journal of International Studies|volume=26|issue=3|pages=845–860|doi=10.1177/03058298970260030601|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rwanda, third-party attempts at a negotiated settlement between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] afforded an opportunity for Hutu extremists to prepare for the killing of Hutu moderates and the genocide of the Tutsi. The international community, led by regional states from the [[Organisation of African Unity]], sought to negotiate a settlement and find a solution for the ongoing ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi via the Arusha Peace Process. This process lasted just over a year, included substantial international involvement, and incorporated many regional actors such as [[Tanzania]] (host of the process), [[Burundi]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zaire]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) was a major beneficiary of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha accords]] and was able to redress many of its grievances, many of the gains that it made could have been achieved through military action. Arusha, according to Clapham, affected the relative power of the participants in the two following ways: a ceasefire which froze the distribution of territorial control at a particular point and secondly the importance it ascribed to the participants of the negotiations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Meaning that it froze the conflict and prevented continued territorial gains being made by the RPF, in addition to designating the degree of importance with regard to the factions within the negotiations. A faction's importance was weighted not on their relative popularity or military strength, but on artificial weight assigned by the mediators. Thus, the entire process served to undermine the RPF's position while stalling their hitherto successful military campaign, while allowing Hutu extremists to prepare for a genocide.

Shearer argues that modern strategies that rely solely on consent-based negotiations are severely limited and that victory by military means should not be ignored. He states that a shift in battlefield fortunes can often bring one belligerent to the negotiation table and will likewise moderate their demands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Consent is of great importance when it comes to negotiation and mediation. The current international system and the conflict resolution model which the international community has utilised most since the end of the Cold War puts a premium on consent. But Shearer asks that if a belligerent uses negotiations and cease-fires as a method of delay in order to allow them to reposition military forces and continue fighting, then should consent-based strategies still be pursued, regardless of the potential for lengthening a conflict and the associated human cost?&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the empirical analysis cited by Shearer, past civil wars with negotiated settlements have had little success. He cites a study from John Stedman that notes between 1900 and 1980 85% of civil wars were solved by one side winning outright (this excludes colonial wars). 15% percent ended as a result of negotiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, Roy Licklider's study supports these conclusions by noting the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"From 1945 to 1989, 58 out of a total of 93 civil conflicts, as he categorised them, were settled in some form, while the remainder continued. However, only 14 (or 24 percent) of those settled were solved by negotiation. The others (76 percent) ended with military victories. Additionally, fighting resumed in seven of the 14 conflict which were initially ended by negotiation. The overall success rate of negotiated settlements, therefore, was around 12 percent out of the internal wars that ended."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Sierra Leone the [[Revolutionary United Front]], led by [[Foday Sankoh]], fought an ongoing and bloody civil war with the government from 1991 to 1996. The conflict attracted little international attention, but managed to devastate the country and destroy its economy. Neither belligerent was willing to concede or compromise on their demands, despite multiple attempts at a negotiated settlement. It was not until the intervention of the [[Private military company|private military corporation]] [[Executive Outcomes]] and a reversal in the RUF's battlefield fortunes that Sankoh would come to the table.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the aftermath the RUF was a depleted threat, civilians were able to return from refugee camps and begin rebuilding their lives. But the peace was fragile and negotiations were ongoing. The RUF was reluctant to put down their arms, concerned over potential retribution at the hands of army units and civilian militias alike. There was a planned deployment of UN peacekeepers meant to ease these concerns and help with the transition to peace, but things began to unravel. International contributors began to shy away from further peacekeeping initiatives; such as an expensive and open-ended mission in a strategically unimportant country. As a result, the UN's intervention force was slow to come to fruition and then came to a halt completely when Sankoh argued the size of the contingent of 740 UN peacekeepers was too large.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The UN refused to engage without total consent from both parties, thus preventing the deployment of a peacekeeping force. This consent-based approach, Shearer argues, illustrates the limits the UN can play in the volatile and fragile state of affairs that exist during and after civil wars. "In Sierra Leone, it meant that an important component needed to shore up the peace-building process was absent. It also meant that Sankoh was dictating terms."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This consent-based approach effectively allowed the leadership of a brutal rebel group to hinder the potential for peace.

The situation was exacerbated by the fact that the newly elected [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|President]] of Sierra Leone terminated the Executive Outcomes contract undermining his [[hard power]] advantage. Things were further inflamed when disaffected officers of the [[Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces|army]] overthrew the government in 1997.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The war quickly renewed. A small UN force of monitors was deployed to observe the security situation. [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNOMSIL]], as it was called, was deployed between July 1998 and October 1999, but was forced to withdraw from the country when the RUF took the country's [[Freetown|capitol]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]] was eventually formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, it was meant to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community to cut and run, as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War|campaign]] was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL's mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF's military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the [[Abuja Agreement (disambiguation)|Abuja agreements]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unamsil/|title=UNAMSIL: United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN's mission can be deemed a success, the way in which the situation developed illustrates Shearer's point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents' interest may not necessarily lead to success. As we see, fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. It was not until the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF's capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, did the RUF finally come to the negotiating table and allow for the establishment of peace.

Some authors question the idea of international interventions at all. In a 2005 working paper for the Center for Global Development, [[Jeremy Weinstein]] of [[Stanford University]] provides a theory of “autonomous recovery,” in which states can achieve sustainable peace without international intervention. Using case studies of [[Uganda]], [[Eritrea]], and [[Somalia]], Weinstein demonstrates how states can develop effective institutions out of warfare. This method has cost and benefits that must be weighed against the potential outcome of international intervention. External intervention can stop mass atrocities, but also stop institutional change. Autonomous recovery elevates the strongest leader, but also rewards the strongest fighters who may be less inclined to share power. Furthermore, intervention depends on external influence while autonomous recovery is based on internal factors. The conclusions of his argument could suggest intervention is not ideal policy, but Weinstein argues the international community's “[[responsibility to protect]]” doctrine has moral importance for intervention and the conditions for “autonomous recovery” are very rare. Weinstein argues the fundamental challenge is how to incentivise good governance and assistance to rebel groups without disrupting the connection of citizens to rulers in terms of revenue collection that enables accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Jeremy M. 2005.

=== Mission Creep ===
Although acknowledging a number of practical and moral reasons for peacekeeping operations, James Fearon and David Laitin assert that they have a tendency under some circumstances to become tangled with [[state-building]] efforts.  In weak states facing successful guerrilla campaigns, peacekeepers face pressures to build state institutional and administrative capacity in order to achieve lasting peace.  These pressures can lead to mission creep beyond the original purview of the peacekeeping operation; without engaging in state-building, the peacekeepers risk allowing the peacekept country to revert to violence following their exit.  Thus, Fearon and Laitin advocate for the greater integration of state-building in peacekeeping efforts through a new framework of "neotrusteeship," which would see foreign powers exercising a great deal of control over a weak state's domestic affairs in order to ensure the prevention of future violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James D|last2=Laitin|first2=David D|date=2004|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=|journal=International Security|volume=28|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of Engagement with the Populace===
A growing critique of peacekeeping is the lack of engagement between the peacekeeping officials and the local populace. As [[Séverine Autesserre]] outlines in a 2015 Foreign Policy article,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/06/trouble-in-peaceland-united-nations-congo-development/|title=Trouble in Peaceland|last=Autesserre|first=Severine|date=|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this creates an environment where the peacekeeping officials develop plans to ‘keep’ the peace, but they are disconnected from reality, having the opposite effect on the ground. Additionally, it creates a reinforcement mechanism for the peacekeeping officials, because the officials on the ground report that their plan was successfully implemented, but, in reality, it had adverse effects. If the situation on the ground turns into another outbreak of violence, the local populace will be blamed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

This criticism is similar to the critic levelled at development in developing countries by authors such as James C. Scott,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed|last=Scott|first=James C.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Ferguson, and L. Lohman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson1 LLohmann2|first=James1 L2|date=1994|title="The anti-politics machine: ’development’ and bureaucratic power in Lesotho."|url=|journal=the Ecologist|volume=24|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although peacekeeping and development are two different things, the logic behind the criticism is the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This is not out of maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Proposed reform==

===Brahimi analysis===
In response to criticism, particularly of the cases of sexual abuse by peacekeepers, the UN has taken steps toward reforming its operations. The [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping|Brahimi Report]] was the first of many steps to recap former peacekeeping missions, isolate flaws, and take steps to patch these mistakes to ensure the efficiency of future peacekeeping missions. The UN has vowed to continue to put these practices into effect when performing peacekeeping operations in the future. The technocratic aspects of the reform process have been continued and revitalised by the DPKO in its "Peace Operations 2010" reform agenda. This included an increase in personnel, the harmonisation of the conditions of service of field and headquarters staff, the development of guidelines and standard operating procedures, and improving the partnership arrangement between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[African Union]], and [[European Union]]. A 2008 capstone doctrine entitled "United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbpu.unlb.org/pbps/Library/Capstone_Doctrine_ENG.pdf|title=Peacekeeping Resource Hub|website=pbpu.unlb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates and builds on the Brahimi analysis.

One of the main issues that the Brahimi report identifies is the lack of coordination and planning of the Peacekeeping Operations. Also, the difference between the objectives of the Peacekeeping Operations and the resources destined to fund the missions. Therefore, the report asks the Security Council to make clear the goals and the resources to accomplish them.  According to Fearon and Laitin, the Brahimi Report provides a political instrument for the secretary-general to negotiate with the Security Council the goals, the troops, and the resources need it to the operations. This instrument tries to avoid the cases of underfunding presented in Missions such as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fearon | first1 = James D | last2 = Laitin | first2 = David D | year = 2004 | title = Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 5–43 | doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Nigri''' ([[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] from '''Schwartz'''), known also as '''Peter George Niger''' (b. 1434 at [[Kaaden]] in [[Bohemia]]; d. between 1481 and 1484), was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian, preacher and controversialist.

==Life==

He studied at different universities ([[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[University of Montpellier|Montpellier]], [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], etc.) and entered the Dominican Order in 1452 at [[Eichstätt]], [[Bavaria]]. After his religious profession he took up philosophy and theology at [[Leipzig]], where he also produced his first literary work ''De modo praedicandi'' (1457). In 1459 he defended publicly in [[Freiburg]] a series of theses so successfully that the provincial chapter then in session there sent him to the [[University of Bologna]] for advanced courses in [[theology]] and [[canon law]].&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Peter George Niger|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalled after two years, he was made lector of theology and engaged in teaching and preaching. In 1465 he taught philosophy and was regent of studies in [[Cologne]]; in 1467 taught theology at [[Ulm]]; in 1469 or 1470 was elected prior in Eichstätt, on 31 May 1473, the newly founded [[University of Ingolstadt]] conferred on him the degree of [[Doctor of Theology]]; in 1474 he taught theology in the convent at [[Ratisbon]] and in 1478 became professor of [[Old Testament]] [[exegesis]] in the University of Ingolstadt.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

Shortly after, on the invitation of the patron of learning, [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of Hungary, he became rector of his newly erected Academy of Philosophy, Theology, and Sacred Scripture at [[Buda]], in gratitude for which Nigri dedicated to the king his ''Clypeus Thomistarum adversus omnes doctrinae doctoris angelici obtrectatores'' (Venice, 1481), in which he defends the teaching of [[Thomas Aquinas]] against the [[Scotists]] and [[Nominalists]].&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

==Works==

Niger was an eminent theologian and preacher, and an orthodox disciple of Aquinas. In his theological works he mainly limits himself to the discussion of questions of logic and psychology.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

He devoted most of his time to preaching to the [[Jews]]. He had learned their language and become familiar with their literature at Salamanca and Montpellier by associating with Jewish children and attending the lectures of the rabbis. At Ratisbon, [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Frankfort-on-the-Main]] he preached in German, Latin, and Hebrew, frequently challenging the rabbis to a disputation.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

He wrote two [[anti-Semitic]] works, one in Latin, ''Tractatus contra Perfidos Judaeos'' (Esslingen, 1475), which is probably the earliest printed anti-Jewish work, and in which he severely attacked the Jews and the ''[[Talmud]]''. The other, written in German, is entitled ''Stern des Messias'' (Esslingen, 1477). [[Reuchlin]] in his ''Augenspiegel'' declared them absurd.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

Both works have appendices giving the [[Hebrew alphabet]] in Hebrew and Latin type, rules of grammar and for reading Hebrew, the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] in Hebrew, and some [[messiah|Messianic]] texts from the Old Testament. They are among the earliest specimens of Hebrew printing in Germany, and the first attempt at [[Hebrew grammar]] in that country by a Christian scholar. They were later published separately as ''Commentatio de primis linguae Hebraicae elementis'' (Altdorf, 1764).&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

Peter Teuto, O. P. ([[Quétif]], I, 855) and Peter Eystettensis ([[Johann Eck|Eck]], "Chrysopassus Cent.", XLIX) are most probably to be identified with this Peter Nigri.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

'''Pythagorean tuning''' is a system of [[musical tuning]] in which the [[frequency ratio]]s of all [[interval (music)|intervals]] are based on the ratio [[Perfect fifth|3:2]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Bruce Benward and Marilyn Nadine Saker (2003).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[generator (music)|generator]] is the ratio [[Perfect fifth|3:2]] (i.e., the untempered [[perfect fifth]]), which is ~702 [[cent (music)|cents]] wide.

The system had been mainly attributed to [[Pythagoras]] (sixth century BC) by modern authors of music theory, while [[Ptolemy]], and later [[Boethius]], ascribed the division of the [[tetrachord]] by only two intervals, called "semitonium", "tonus", "tonus" in Latin (256:243 x 9:8 x 9:8), to [[Eratosthenes]]. The so-called "Pythagorean tuning" was used by musicians up to the beginning of the 16th century. "The Pythagorean system would appear to be ideal because of the purity of the fifths, but some consider other intervals, particularly the major third, to be so badly out of tune that major chords [may be considered] a dissonance."&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt;

The '''Pythagorean scale''' is any [[scale (music)|scale]] which may be constructed from only pure perfect fifths (3:2) and octaves (2:1)&lt;ref&gt;Sethares, William A. (2005). ''Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale'', p.163. {{ISBN|1-85233-797-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Greek music it was used to [[Tetrachord#Pythagorean tunings|tune tetrachords]] and the twelve tone Pythagorean temperament was developed by medieval music theorists using the same method of tuning in perfect fifths, however there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself went beyond the tetrachord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter A. |last=Frazer |url=http://midicode.com/tunings/Tuning10102004.pdf |title=The Development of Musical Tuning Systems |date=April 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506221411/http://www.midicode.com/tunings/Tuning10102004.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-06 |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction can be made between extended Pythagorean tuning and a 12-tone Pythagorean temperament. Extended Pythagorean tuning corresponds 1-on-1 with western music notation and there is no limit to the number of fifths. In 12-tone Pythagorean temperament however one is limited by 12-tones per octave and one cannot play most music according to the Pythagorean system corresponding to the enharmonic notation, instead one finds that for instance the diminished sixth becomes a "wolf fifth".

==Method==

12-tone Pythagorean temperament is based on a stack of intervals called perfect fifths, each tuned in the ratio 3:2, the next simplest ratio after 2:1. Starting from D for example (''D-based'' tuning), six other notes are produced by moving six times a ratio 3:2 up, and the remaining ones by moving the same ratio down:

:E♭&amp;ndash;B♭&amp;ndash;F&amp;ndash;C&amp;ndash;G&amp;ndash;'''D'''&amp;ndash;A&amp;ndash;E&amp;ndash;B&amp;ndash;F♯&amp;ndash;C♯&amp;ndash;G♯

This succession of eleven 3:2 intervals spans across a wide range of [[frequency]] (on a [[piano keyboard]], it encompasses 77 keys). Since notes differing in frequency by a factor of 2 are given the same name, it is customary to divide or multiply the frequencies of some of these notes by 2 or by a power of 2. The purpose of this adjustment is to move the 12 notes within a smaller range of frequency, namely within the interval between the '''base note''' D and the D above it (a note with twice its frequency). This interval is typically called the '''basic octave''' (on a piano keyboard, an [[octave]] encompasses only 13 keys ).

For instance, the A is tuned such that its frequency equals 3:2 times the frequency of D&amp;mdash;if D is tuned to a frequency of 288 [[Hertz|Hz]], then A is tuned to 432&amp;nbsp;Hz. Similarly, the E above A is tuned such that its frequency equals 3:2 times the frequency of A, or 9:4 times the frequency of D&amp;mdash;with A at 432&amp;nbsp;Hz, this puts E at 648&amp;nbsp;Hz. Since this E is outside the above-mentioned basic octave (i.e. its frequency is more than twice the frequency of the base note D), it is usual to halve its frequency to move it within the basic octave. Therefore, E is tuned to 324&amp;nbsp;Hz, a 9:8 (= one [[epogdoon]]) above D. The B at 3:2 above that E is tuned to the ratio 27:16 and so on. Starting from the same point working the other way, G is tuned as 3:2 below D, which means that it is assigned a frequency equal to 2:3 times the frequency of D&amp;mdash;with D at 288&amp;nbsp;Hz, this puts G at 192&amp;nbsp;Hz. This frequency is then doubled (to 384&amp;nbsp;Hz) to bring it into the basic octave.

When extending this tuning however, a problem arises: no stack of 3:2 intervals (perfect fifths) will fit exactly into any stack of 2:1 intervals (octaves). For instance a stack such as this, obtained by adding one more note to the stack shown above

:A♭&amp;ndash;E♭&amp;ndash;B♭&amp;ndash;F&amp;ndash;C&amp;ndash;G&amp;ndash;'''D'''&amp;ndash;A&amp;ndash;E&amp;ndash;B&amp;ndash;F♯&amp;ndash;C♯&amp;ndash;G♯

will be similar but not identical in size to a stack of 7 octaves. More exactly, it will be about a quarter of a [[semitone]] larger, called the [[Pythagorean comma]]. Thus, A{{music|b}} and G{{music|#}}, when brought into the basic octave, will not coincide as expected. The table below illustrates this, showing for each note in the basic octave the conventional name of the [[interval (music)|interval]] from D (the base note), the formula to compute its frequency ratio, its size in [[Cent (music)|cents]], and the difference in cents (labeled ET-dif in the table) between its size and the size of the corresponding one in the equally tempered scale.

In the formulas, the ratios 3:2 or 2:3 represent an ascending or descending perfect fifth (i.e. an increase or decrease in frequency by a perfect fifth, while 2:1 or 1:2 represent an rising or lowering octave.

In equal temperament, pairs of [[enharmonic]] notes such as A{{music|b}} and G{{music|#}} are thought of as being exactly the same note&amp;mdash;however, as the above table indicates, in Pythagorean tuning they have different ratios with respect to D, which means they are at a different frequency. This discrepancy, of about 23.46 cents, or nearly one quarter of a semitone, is known as a ''[[Pythagorean comma]]''.

To get around this problem, Pythagorean tuning constructs only twelve notes as above, with eleven fifths between them. For example, one may use only the 12 notes from E{{music|b}} to G{{music|#}}. This, as shown above, implies that only eleven just fifths are used to build the entire chromatic scale. The remaining interval (the diminished sixth from G{{music|#}} to E{{music|b}}) is left badly out-of-tune, meaning that any music which combines those two notes is unplayable in this tuning. A very out-of-tune interval such as this one is known as a ''[[wolf interval]]''. In the case of Pythagorean tuning, all the fifths are 701.96 cents wide, in the exact ratio 3:2, except the wolf fifth, which is only 678.49 cents wide, nearly a quarter of a [[semitone]] flatter.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[media:Wolf fifth.ogg|Wolf fifth.ogg]]  (33.1KB) is a sound file demonstrating this out of tune fifth. The first two fifths are perfectly tuned in the ratio 3:2, the third is the D{{Music|#}}&amp;ndash;E{{Music|b}} wolf fifth. It may be useful to compare this to [[media:Et fifths.ogg|Et fifths.ogg]] (38.2KB), which is the same three fifths tuned in [[equal temperament]], each of them tolerably well in tune.
--&gt;
If the notes G{{music|sharp}} and E{{music|flat}} need to be sounded together, the position of the wolf fifth can be changed. For example, a C-based Pythagorean tuning would produce a stack of fifths running from D{{music|flat}} to F{{music|sharp}}, making F{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|flat}} the wolf interval. However, there will always be one wolf fifth in Pythagorean tuning, making it impossible to play in all [[key (music)|keys]] in tune.

== Size of intervals ==
The table above shows only intervals from D. However, intervals can be formed by starting from each of the above listed 12 notes. Thus, twelve intervals can be defined for each '''interval type''' (twelve  unisons, twelve [[semitone]]s, twelve intervals composed of 2 semitones, twelve intervals composed of 3 semitones, etc.).

[[Image:Interval ratios in D-based symmetric Pythagorean tuning (powers for large numbers).PNG|frame|right|Frequency ratio of the 144 intervals in D-based Pythagorean tuning.

[[Wolf interval]]s are highlighted in red.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt; Numbers larger than 999 are shown as powers of 2 or 3.]]

[[Image:Size of intervals in D-based symmetric Pythagorean tuning.PNG|frame|right|Approximate size in cents of the 144 intervals in D-based Pythagorean tuning. [[Interval (music)#Quality|Interval names]] are given in their shortened form. [[5-limit tuning#The justest ratios|Pure interval]]s are shown in '''[[boldface|bold]]''' font. [[Wolf interval]]s are highlighted in red.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;]]

As explained above, one of the twelve fifths (the wolf fifth) has a different size with respect to the other eleven. For a similar reason, each of the other interval types, except for the unisons and the octaves, has two different sizes in Pythagorean tuning. This is the price paid for seeking [[just intonation]]. The tables on the right and below show their frequency ratios and their approximate sizes in cents. [[Interval (music)#Quality|Interval names]] are given in their standard shortened form. For instance, the size of the interval from D to A, which is a perfect fifth ('''P5'''), can be found in the seventh column of the row labeled '''D'''. [[5-limit tuning#The justest ratios|Strictly just]] (or pure) intervals are shown in '''[[boldface|bold]]''' font. [[Wolf interval]]s are highlighted in red.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;Wolf intervals are operationally defined herein as intervals composed of 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 semitones (i.e. major and minor thirds or sixths, perfect fourths or fifths, and their [[enharmonic equivalent]]s) the size of which deviates by more than one [[syntonic comma]] (about 21.5 cents) from the corresponding justly intonated interval. Intervals made up of 1, 2, 6, 10, or 11 semitones (e.g. major and minor seconds or sevenths, tritones, and their [[enharmonic]] equivalents) are considered to be [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] even when they are justly tuned, thus they are not marked as wolf intervals even when they deviate from just intonation by more than one syntonic comma.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason why the interval sizes vary throughout the scale is that the pitches forming the scale are unevenly spaced. Namely, the frequencies defined by construction for the twelve notes determine two different [[semitone]]s (i.e. intervals between adjacent notes):

# The minor second ('''m2'''), also called diatonic semitone, with size &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt; S_1 = {256 \over 243} \approx 90.225 \ \hbox{cents} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; (e.g. between D and E{{Music|b}})
# The augmented unison ('''A1'''), also called chromatic semitone, with size &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt; S_2 =  {3^7 \over 2^{11}} = {2187 \over 2048} \approx 113.685 \ \hbox{cents} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; (e.g. between E{{Music|b}} and E)

Conversely, in an [[Twelve tone equal temperament|equally tempered]] chromatic scale, by definition the twelve pitches are equally spaced, all semitones having a size of exactly
:&lt;math&gt; S_E = \sqrt[12]{2} = 100.000 \ \hbox{cents}. &lt;/math&gt;
As a consequence all intervals of any given type have the same size (e.g., all major thirds have the same size, all fifths have the same size, etc.). The price paid, in this case, is that none of them is justly tuned and perfectly consonant, except, of course, for the unison and the octave.

By definition, in Pythagorean tuning 11 perfect fifths ('''P5''' in the table) have a size of approximately 701.955 cents (700+ε cents, where ε ≈ 1.955 cents). Since the average size of the 12 fifths must equal exactly 700 cents (as in equal temperament), the other one must have a size of 700&amp;minus;11ε cents, which is about 678.495 cents (the wolf fifth). Notice that, as shown in the table, the latter interval, although [[enharmonically equivalent]] to a fifth, is more properly called a [[diminished sixth]] ('''d6'''). Similarly,
* 9 [[minor third]]s ('''m3''') are ≈ 294.135 cents (300&amp;minus;3ε), 3 [[augmented second]]s ('''A2''') are ≈ 317.595 cents (300+9ε), and their average is 300 cents;
* 8 [[major third]]s ('''M3''') are ≈ 407.820 cents (400+4ε), 4 [[diminished fourth]]s ('''d4''') are ≈ 384.360 cents (400&amp;minus;8ε), and their average is 400 cents;
* 7 diatonic [[semitone]]s ('''m2''') are ≈ 90.225 cents (100&amp;minus;5ε), 5 chromatic semitones ('''A1''') are ≈ 113.685 cents (100+7ε), and their average is 100 cents.

In short, similar differences in width are observed for all interval types, except for unisons and octaves, and they are all multiples of ε, the difference between the Pythagorean fifth and the average fifth.

Notice that, as an obvious consequence, each augmented or diminished interval is exactly 12ε (≈ 23.460) cents narrower or wider than its enharmonic equivalent. For instance, the d6 (or wolf fifth) is 12ε cents narrower than each P5, and each A2 is 12ε cents wider than each m3. This interval of size 12ε is known as a [[Pythagorean comma]], exactly equal to the opposite of a [[diminished second]] (≈ &amp;minus;23.460 cents). This implies that ε can be also defined as one twelfth of a Pythagorean comma.

== Pythagorean intervals ==
{{Main article|Pythagorean interval|Interval (music)}}
Four of the above-mentioned intervals take a specific name in Pythagorean tuning. In the following table, these specific names are provided, together with alternative names used generically for some other intervals. Notice that the Pythagorean comma does not coincide with the diminished second, as its size (524288:531441) is the reciprocal of the Pythagorean diminished second (531441:524288). Also ''ditone'' and ''semiditone'' are specific for Pythagorean tuning, while ''tone'' and ''tritone'' are used generically for all tuning systems. Despite its name, a semiditone (3 semitones, or about 300 cents) can hardly be viewed as half of a ditone (4 semitones, or about 400 cents). All the intervals with prefix ''sesqui-'' are [[just intonation|justly]] tuned, and their [[Interval ratio|frequency ratio]], shown in the table, is a [[superparticular number]] (or epimoric ratio). The same is true for the octave.

==History and usage==
Because of the [[wolf interval]] when using a 12-tone Pythagorean temperament, this tuning is rarely used today, although it is thought to have been widespread. In music which does not change [[key (music)|key]] very often, or which is not very [[harmony|harmonically]] adventurous, the wolf interval is unlikely to be a problem, as not all the possible fifths will be heard in such pieces. In extended Pythagorean tuning there is no wolf interval, all perfect fifths are exactly 3:2.

Because most fifths in 12-tone Pythagorean temperament are in the simple ratio of 3:2, they sound very "smooth" and consonant. The thirds, by contrast, most of which are in the relatively complex ratios of 81:64 (for major thirds) and 32:27 (for minor thirds), sound less smooth depending on the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;However, 3/2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; is described as "almost exactly a just major third." Sethares (2005), p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1510 onward, as thirds came to be treated as consonances, [[meantone temperament]], and particularly [[quarter-comma meantone]], which tunes thirds to the relatively simple ratio of [[sesquiquartum|5:4]], became the most popular system for tuning keyboards. At the same time, syntonic-diatonic [[just intonation]] was posited first by [[Bartolomé Ramos de Pareja|Ramos]] and then by [[Zarlino]] as the normal tuning for singers.

However, meantone presented its own harmonic challenges. Its wolf intervals proved to be even worse than those of the Pythagorean tuning (so much so that it often required 19 keys to the octave as opposed to the 12 in Pythagorean tuning). As a consequence, meantone was not suitable for all music. From around the 18th century, as the desire grew for instruments to change key, and therefore to avoid a wolf interval, this led to the widespread use of [[well temperament]]s and eventually [[equal temperament]].

Pythagorean temperament can still be heard in some parts of modern classical music from singers and from instruments with no fixed tuning such as the [[violin family]]. Where a performer has an unaccompanied passage based on scales, they will tend towards using Pythagorean intonation as that will make the scale sound best in tune, then reverting to other temperaments for other passages (just intonation for chordal or arpeggiated figures, and equal temperament when accompanied with piano or orchestra).  This can be seen in the first bar of Bach's Sonata no.1 for unaccompanied violin, where the b-flat in the opening chord is played naturally in just intonation and sounds flatter than the subsequent b-flat which appears in a descending scale and is naturally Pythagorean. Such changes are never explicitly notated and are scarcely noticeable to the audience, just sounding 'in tune'.

'''Research''' comprises "[[creativity|creative]] and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of [[knowledge]], including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2015), Frascati Manual 2015: Guidelines for Collecting and Reporting Data on Research and Experimental Development, The Measurement of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Activities, OECD Publishing, Paris. Retrieved on 27 October 2017 from [https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264239012-en].&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support [[theorem]]s, or develop new [[theory|theories]]. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports.  To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.  The primary purposes of [[basic research]] (as opposed to [[applied research]]) are [[documentation]], [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]], [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], or the [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on [[epistemology|epistemologies]], which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: [[scientific]], [[humanities]], [[artistic]], economic, [[social research|social]], business, [[marketing research|marketing]], [[practitioner research]], life, [[technological]], etc.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Aristotle]], (384–322 BC), one of the early figures in the development of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.pbs.org/saf/1307/features/knows.htm The Origins of Science]". ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The word ''research'' is derived from the [[French language|Middle French]] "''recherche''", which means "to go about seeking", the term itself being derived from the [[Old French]] term "''recerchier''" a compound word from "re-" + "cerchier", or "sercher", meaning 'search'.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/research|title=Research|author=|first=|date=|website=Merriam Webster (https://www.merriam-webster.com/)|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;

== Definitions ==
Research has been defined in a number of different ways, and while there are similarities, there does not appear to be a single, all-encompassing definition that is embraced by all who engage in it.

One definition of research is used by the OECD, "Any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2312|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms - Research and development � UNESCO Definition|last=|first=|date=|website=stats.oecd.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219233912/http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2312|archive-date=2007-02-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of research is given by [[John W. Creswell]], who states that  "research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue". It consists of three steps: pose a question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). Educational Research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as "studious inquiry or examination;  ''especially'' : investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws"&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;

== Forms of research{{anchor|Original research}} ==

{{selfref|"Original research" redirects here. For the Wikipedia policy, see [[Wikipedia:No original research]]}}
'''Original research''' is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a [[primary source]] character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new [[knowledge]], rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form (''e.g.'', summarized or classified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Original Research?  Original research is considered a primary source|url=http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html|publisher=Thomas G. Carpenter Library, University of North Florida|accessdate=9 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709085129/http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html|archivedate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlIH4R9Z_k8C&amp;pg=PT75|title=Schaum's Quick Guide to Writing Great Research Papers|first=Laurie|last=Rozakis|date=15 June 2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|via=Google Books|isbn=9780071511223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In experimental work, it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject(s), e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the [[methodology]], results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In [[Scientific modelling|analytical]] work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the [[Academic authorship|researcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aare.edu.au/09pap/li091380.pdf |title=Early career researcher originality: Engaging Richard Florida's international competition for creative workers |first=Michael |last=Singh |author2=Li, Bingyi |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=Centre for Educational Research, University of Western Sydney |page=2 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64cuvN4SB?url=http://www.aare.edu.au/09pap/li091380.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=no |access-date=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in [[academic journal]]s and usually established by means of [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callaham |first=Michael |last2=Wears|first2= Robert|last3=Weber|first3=Ellen L. |title=Journal Prestige, Publication Bias, and Other Characteristics Associated With Citation of Published Studies in Peer-Reviewed Journals |journal=Jama |volume=287 |issue=21 |pages=2847–50 |year=2002 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/287/21/2847.short |doi=10.1001/jama.287.21.2847|pmid=12038930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graduate student]]s are commonly required to perform original research as part of a [[dissertation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oFFWt5oyA3oC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=%22original+research%22&amp;cd=90#v=onepage&amp;q=%22original+research%22&amp;f=false|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-2007 edition|first=The United States Department of|last=Labor|date=26 June 2006|publisher=Mcgraw-hill|via=Google Books|isbn=9780071472883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific research''' is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing [[curiosity]]. This research provides [[science|scientific]] information and theories for the explanation of the [[nature]] and the properties of the world. It makes practical applications possible. Scientific research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many companies. Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines. Scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution, but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution, because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching (these do not necessarily correlate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Business%20School%20Prestige.pdf | title = Business School Prestige: Research versus Teaching | author1 = J.

'''Research in the humanities''' involves different methods such as for example [[hermeneutics]] and [[semiotics]]. Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead, explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural, or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in [[historical method]]. Historians use [[primary sources]] and other [[evidence]] to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past. Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities, without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these. These studies may be qualitative or quantitative, and can use a variety of approaches, such as queer theory or feminist theory.&lt;ref name="Roffee 4–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A|last2=Waling|first2=Andrea|date=18 August 2016|title=Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying|journal=Research Ethics|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=10.1177/1747016116658693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artistic research''', also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.

Generally, research is understood to follow a certain structural [[Process (science)|process]]. Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and applied:
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Observations and formation of the topic]]: Consists of the subject area of one's interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research. The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow. A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable. The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
# [[Hypothesis]]: A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
# [[Conceptual definition]]: Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
# [[Operational definition]]:  Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
# [[Data collection|Gathering of data]]: Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments. The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
# [[Data analysis|Analysis of data]]: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it.
# [[Data Interpretation]]: This can be represented through tables, figures, and pictures, and then described in words.
# [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|Test, revising of hypothesis]]
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Conclusion, reiteration if necessary]]

A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, [[null hypothesis]]). Generally, a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment.  If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see [[falsifiability]]). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.

A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction. In this case, a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables.

[[File:Leopold von Ranke 1868.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886), considered to be one of the founders of modern source-based history.]]

The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis. This includes [[lower criticism]] and sensual criticism. Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following concepts are part of most formal historical research:&lt;ref name="Garraghan  (1946)"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Historical Method |last=Garraghan |first=Gilbert J. |year=1946 |publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8371-7132-6 |page=168 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artistic research ===
The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesage  |first1=Dieter |date=Spring 2009 |title=Who's Afraid of Artistic Research? On measuring artistic research output |journal=Art&amp;Research – A Journal of Ideas, Contexts and Methods  |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= |url=http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n2/pdfs/lesage.pdf |issn=1752-6388 |accessdate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept [[subjectivity]] as opposed to the classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the [[social science]]s in using [[qualitative research]] and [[intersubjectivity]] as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Eisner | first1 = E.

Artistic research has been defined by the [[University of Dance and Circus]] (Dans och Cirkushögskolan, DOCH), [[Stockholm]] in the following manner - "Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices, methods, and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context."&lt;ref name="DOCH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doch.se/web/Artistic_Research.aspx |title=Artistic research at DOCH |author=Unattributed |website=Dans och Cirkushögskolan (website) |publisher= |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, M. (2009). Draft Proposal. Journal for Artistic Research. Bern University of the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; A more simple understanding by [[Julian Klein]] defines Artistic Research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, J. (2010). What is artistic research?

Carayannis [= ARIS, Vol. 1]. Wien/New York: Springer 2015, pp. 197–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to artist [[Hakan Topal]], in artistic research, "perhaps more so than other disciplines, intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/whose-terms-a-glossary-for-social-practice-research|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909042922/http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/whose-terms-a-glossary-for-social-practice-research|dead-url=no|archive-date=2014-09-09|title=Topal, H.

This may be factual, historical, or background research. Background research could include, for example, geographical or procedural research.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman A (2003) Research for Writers, pp 4–5. London: A&amp;C Black Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steps in conducting research ==
Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research.&lt;ref&gt;Trochim, W.M.K, (2006). Research Methods Knowledge Base.&lt;/ref&gt; The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results. The major steps in conducting research are:&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd).

* Specifying the purpose of research
* Determining specific research questions

* Choice of a methodology (for data collection)

The steps generally represent the overall process; however, they should be viewed as an ever-changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps.&lt;ref&gt;Gauch, Jr., H.G. (2003). Scientific method in practice. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-81689-0}} (page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Most research begins with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, T.S., Hatcher, T., &amp; Creswell, J.W. (2011). The handbook of scholarly writing and publishing. San Francisco, CA: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-470-39335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often, a [[literature review]] is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified.  A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question.  The research question may be parallel to the [[hypothesis]].  The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.  The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging in what is known as [[empirical research]]. The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the [[null hypothesis]] are then reported and evaluated. At the end, the researcher may discuss avenues for [[Further research is needed|further research]]. However, some researchers advocate for the reverse approach: starting with articulating findings and discussion of them, moving "up" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review. The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry, research questions, research method, relevant research literature, and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted.

[[Rudolph Rummel]] says, "... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MTF.CHAP9.HTM|title=QUESTIONS ABOUT FREEDOM, DEMOCIDE, AND WAR|author=|date=|website=www.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] in [[Meno]] talks about an inherent difficulty, if not a paradox, of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way, "If you know what you're searching for, why do you search for it?! [i.e., you have already found it] If you don't know what you're searching for, what are you searching for?!"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, &amp; Bluck, R. S. (1962). Meno. Cambridge, UK: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilleman-Walter-Reed.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Maurice Hilleman]] is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sullivan P |date=13 April 2005 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48244-2005Apr12.html |title=Maurice R.

The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue. This process takes three main forms (although, as previously discussed, the boundaries between them may be obscure):
* [[Exploratory research]], which helps to identify and define a problem or question.
* [[Constructive research]], which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question.
* [[Empirical research]], which tests the feasibility of a solution using [[empirical evidence]].
There are two major types of empirical research design: qualitative research and quantitative research. Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer:

;[[Qualitative research]]
:This involves understanding human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior, by asking a broad question, collecting data in the form of words, images, video etc that is analyzed, and searching for themes. This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables. It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time-consuming and typically limited to a single set of research subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Qualitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[social constructionism]].

[[Social media]] posts are used for qualitative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snelson|first1=Chareen L.|title=Qualitative and Mixed Methods Social Media Research|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|date=March 2016|volume=15|issue=1|pages=160940691562457|doi=10.1177/1609406915624574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Quantitative research]]
:This involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships, by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing [[Descriptive statistical technique|statistical]] methods. The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive).&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). ''Educational Research:  Planning, Conducting, and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ. Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables.  Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[positivism]].

The quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} These methods produce results that are easy to summarize, compare, and generalize.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest.

If the research question is about people, participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uwec.edu/piercech/ResearchMethods/Data%20collection%20methods/DATA%20COLLECTION%20METHODS.htm|title=Data Collection Methods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=uwec.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect primary or secondary data.  Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires.  Secondary data is data that already exists, such as census data, which can be re-used for the research.  It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.102. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.114. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer. For example, a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights.&lt;ref name="Creswell Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creswell|first1=John W.|title=Research design : qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=978-1-4522-2609-5|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Big data]] has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection; furthermore, methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|date = 1 January 2015|isbn = 9781118900772|first = Alex|last = Liu|doi = 10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0325|title = Emerging Trends in the Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages = 1–15|chapter = Structural Equation Modeling and Latent Variable Approaches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Non-empirical research
Non-empirical ([[theory|theoretical]]) research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation. As such, non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source. This, however, does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge. Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach. Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science. Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained; then theoretical research tries to explain them, and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses; these hypotheses are then tested empirically, giving more observations that may need further explanation; and so on. See [[Scientific method]].

A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge; another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge. Much of [[cosmology|cosmological research]] is theoretical in nature. [[Mathematics]] research does not rely on externally available data; rather, it seeks to prove [[theorem]]s about [[mathematical object]]s.

== Research ethics&lt;!--'Research ethics' redirects here--&gt; ==
'''Research ethics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; involves the application of fundamental ethical principles to a variety of topics involving research, including [[scientific research]]. These principles include [[deontology]], [[consequentialism]], [[virtue ethics]] and [[value (ethics)]]. Ethical issues may arise in the design and implementation of research involving [[human experimentation]] or [[animal experimentation]], such as: various aspects of [[academic scandal]], including [[scientific misconduct]] (such as fraud, [[fabrication (science)|fabrication of data]] and [[plagiarism]]), [[whistleblowing]]; regulation of research, etc.  Research ethics is most developed as a concept in [[medical research]]. The key agreement here is the 1964 [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. The [[Nuremberg Code]] is a former agreement, but with many still important notes. Research in the [[Ethical research in social science|social sciences]] presents a different set of issues than those in medical research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research {{!}} On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research|date=2009|publisher=The National Academies Press|edition=Third|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12192/chapter/2#2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can involve issues of researcher and participant safety, empowerment and access to justice.&lt;ref name="Roffee 4–22"/&gt;

When research involves human subjects, obtaining [[informed consent]] from them is essential.&lt;ref name="Creswell Book" /&gt;

== Problems in research ==

=== Methods of research ===
In many disciplines, Western methods of conducting research are predominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reverby|first=Susan M.|date=1 April 2012|title=Zachary M. Schrag. Ethical Imperialism: Institutional Review Boards and the Social Sciences, 1965–2009. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 2010. Pp. xii, 245. $45.00|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/117/2/484.2|journal=The American Historical Review|language=en|volume=117|issue=2|pages=484–485|doi=10.1086/ahr.117.2.484-a|issn=0002-8762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study. The increasing participation of [[indigenous peoples]] as researchers has brought increased attention to the lacuna in culturally-sensitive methods of data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples|url=https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/decolonizing-methodologies/|last=Smith|first=Linda Tuhiwai|publisher=Zed Books|year=2012|isbn=9781848139503|edition=2nd|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies. For example, "[[Hua Oranga]]" was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in [[Māori people|Māori]] populations, and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the Māori people – "taha wairua (the spiritual dimension), taha hinengaro (the mental dimension), taha tinana (the physical dimension), and taha whanau (the family dimension)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Lisa|title=Commentary on Cultural Diversity Across the Pacific: The Dominance of Western Theories, Models, Research and Practice in Psychology|url=http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1834490912000013|journal=Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=27–31|doi=10.1017/prp.2012.1|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguicism ===
Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and [[linguicism]] in research and academic publication. As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English, multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canagarajah|first=A. Suresh|date=1 January 1996|title=From Critical Research Practice to Critical Research Reporting|jstor=3588146|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=30|issue=2|pages=321–331|doi=10.2307/3588146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingual scholars' influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference.&lt;ref name="Canagarajah"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canagarajah|first=Suresh|date=October 1996|title="Nondiscursive" Requirements in Academic Publishing, Material Resources of Periphery Scholars, and the Politics of Knowledge Production|url=|journal=Written Communication|volume=13|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|via=SagePub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publication Peer Review ===
{{update|reason=This subsection's claims are potentially outdated in the "digital age" given that near-total penetration of Web access among scholars worldwide enables any scholar[s] to submit papers to any journal anywhere|date=May 2017}}
[[Peer review]] is a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. In academia, [[scholarly peer review]] is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication. Usually, the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view, and this is usually done free of charge. The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peerviewer.com/freelance-peer-review-scholarly-journals/|title=Peer Review of Scholarly Journal|website=www.PeerViewer.com|language=en-US|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe, because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry.&lt;ref name="Canagarajah" /&gt; These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars' research efforts, and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide.

=== Influence of the open-access movement ===
The open access movement assumes that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a "public domain", that of "humanity".&lt;ref name="Christen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christen|first=Kimberly|date=2012|title=Does Information Really Want to be Free? Indigenous Knowledge Systems and the Question of Openness|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1618|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=6|issue=|doi=|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation. For instance, most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships.&lt;ref name="Christen" /&gt;

There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system. On the one hand, "digital right management" used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy, while simultaneously when similar functions are used by cultural groups (i.e. indigenous communities) this is denounced as "access control" and reprehended as censorship.&lt;ref name="Christen" /&gt;



=== Future perspectives ===
Even though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research, some scholars, such as Simon Marginson, argue for "the need [for] a plural university world".&lt;ref name="Marginson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/sun-sets-on-western-dominance-as-east-asian-confucian-model-takes-lead/415300.article|title=Sun sets on Western dominance as East Asian Confucian model takes lead|date=24 February 2011|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model.

This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West. Focussed on emphasizing educational achievement, East Asian cultures, mainly in China and South Korea, have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion.&lt;ref name="Marginson" /&gt; In contrast, in the Western academic world, notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States, funding cuts for university research have occurred, which some {{who|date=February 2017}} say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research.

== Professionalisation {{anchor|Professionalization}} ==
{{globalize|section|date=January 2014}}
{{see also|Academic ranks|Academics|Scientists}}
In several national and private academic systems, the [[professionalisation]] of research has resulted in formal [[job title]]s.

=== In Russia ===
In present-day Russia, the former [[Soviet Union]] and in some [[post-Soviet states]] the term ''researcher'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Научный сотрудник}}, ''nauchny sotrudnik'') is both a generic term for a person who carried out scientific research, as well as a job position within the frameworks of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], Soviet universities, and in other research-oriented establishments. The term is also sometimes translated as ''[[research fellow]]'', ''[[research associate]]'', etc.

The following ranks are known:

*Junior Researcher (Junior Research Associate)
*Researcher (Research Associate)
*Senior Researcher (Senior Research Associate)
*Leading Researcher (Leading Research Associate)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aup.ru/docs/d2/210.htm Job qualifications for Leading Researcher] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chief Researcher (Chief Research Associate)

== Publishing ==
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 4 November 1869.]]
[[Academic publishing]] is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to [[peer review]] the work and make it available for a wider audience. The system varies widely by field and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine.
[https://fine-research-paper.com research paper guides]
Most established [[List of academic disciplines|academic fields]] have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication, though many [[academic journal]]s are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, from the print to the electronic format. A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/Armstrong/Replications.pdf| title = Replication Research in Marketing Revisited: A Note on a Disturbing Trend| author = Heiner Evanschitzky, Carsten Baumgarth, Raymond Hubbard and J.

Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/Armstrong/MakingProgressinForecasting.pdf | title = Monetary Incentives in Mail Surveys | author1 = J.

== Research funding ==
{{Main|Funding of science}}
Most funding for scientific research comes from three major sources: [[Corporation|corporate]] [[research and development]] departments; [[private foundation]]s, for example, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]; and government research councils such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Reporter|url=http://report.nih.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research but also as a source of merit.

The [[Social Psychology Network]] provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government and private foundation funding sources.

{{quote|The Zen lay practitioners [[Yamaoka Tesshū]], Takahashi Deishu and other top leaders of our country asked Soryu-kutsu Imakita Kosen Roshi, the chief abbot of [[Engaku-ji]] Temple in Kamakura, to establish a group for intensive Zen meditation (the later Ryobo-Kai) in order to train promising figures, being anxious for the future of the State.&lt;ref name=ningen-home&gt;[http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/home.shtml Ningen Zen Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316112314/http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/home.shtml |date=2013-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It attracted figures such as [[Imakita Kōsen]] (1816–1892) (abbot of the Rinzai [[monastery]] [[Engakuji]], and teacher of [[Soyen Shaku]]), [[Nakajima Nobuyuki]], [[Kawajiri Hōkin]], and [[Nakae Chomin]] (1847–1901). Kōsen was its honorary leader but not its founder.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

It served as an intellectual society for the discussion of Buddhism and [[zazen]] practice.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; The rules of the society were as follows:
# Members could discuss anything they wanted except politics and "worldly affairs".
# Meals were limited to rice, [[sake]], and three bowls of vegetables.
# Participants would be honest and polite.
# New participants would be introduced by an existing member and affirm their vows every month.

===Lay practice===
Ryōmō Kyōkai was revived by [[Tetsuo Sōkatsu]], dharma descendant of [[Soyen Shaku]].&lt;ref name=ningen-home /&gt; The revival was more frequently called "Ryōbō Zen Kyōkai" or "Ryōbō Kai" in Japan, owing to a more modern [[kanji]] reading. Tetsuo Sōkatsu received the name ''Ryobo-an'' from Ryoga-kutsu Roshi.&lt;ref name=ningen /&gt; He opened Ryōbō Kai for lay practitioners, and went so far as to give dharma transmission to lay practitioners, which before was restricted to priests.&lt;ref name=ningen /&gt; 

In 1906 Sōkatsu traveled to the USA with a group of students, among them [[Sokei-an| Sokei-an Sasaki]] and [[Gotō Zuigan]], who would become two of his dharma heirs. A branch was established on Sutter Street in San Francisco after Sōkatsu arrived in America.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Fields, ''How the Swans Came to the Lake'', p. 177. Boulder: Shambhala, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted lay Buddhists and possibly inspired the form of Zen practice centers throughout the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, Robert. "The Zen of Japanese Nationalism." In ''The Curators of the Buddha: The Study of Buddhism under Colonialism'', ed. Donald S. Lopez. Chicago: U Chicago Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Sōkatsu stayed in the USA four years before returning to Japan, leaving only Sokei-an behind. 

Sokei-an lived most of his adult life in the United States, returning to Japan only briefly on four occasions, principally to complete his Zen training and receive his final dharma transmission from Sōkatsu. In 1930 he established the [[Buddhist Society of America]] in New York City, initially as a branch of Ryōmō Kyōkai; this was renamed the First Zen Institute of America after World War II, and continues to this day, in spite of having no resident teacher.

The Japanese revival was disbanded after World War II,&lt;ref name=ningen&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184306/http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/ningen-zen-kyodan.html Ningen-shu History] ([http://www.gakunan-zen.com/next03.html mirror])&lt;/ref&gt; and the San Francisco branch likely was lost during the [[Japanese American internment]].

===Ningen Zen Kyodan===
Ryobo-an Roshi gave dharma transmission to Koun-an Tatsuta Eizan Roshi, Ichimu-an Ohazama Chikudo Roshi, Gotō Zuigan Roshi, and Sokei-an Sasaki Shigetsu Roshi. Koun-an Roshi founded ''Ningen Zen'', "Zen cultivation of the human spirit".&lt;ref name=ningen /&gt; The ''Ningen Zen Kyodan''. Its mission is "to establish an earthly paradise".&lt;ref name=ningen /&gt; In this, it sees itself as "essentially different from the traditional Zen Buddhists who aimed principally at Dharma-transmission for the sake of Dharma-transmission".&lt;ref name=ningen /&gt; The ''Ningen Zen Kyodan'' has sixteen groups and sixteen meditation centers, and twelve [[Zen master]]s, who received dharma transmission from Koun-an Roshi.&lt;ref name=ningen-home /&gt;

==A founding element of the Joseon capital==

Along with the royal palace (Gyeongbokgung) and the [[Jongmyo]] shrine, the Sajik shrine is a fundamental symbol of the new capital city created during its first year. It is located west of the palace, at the feet of [[Inwangsan]], in the neighborhood of [[Seochon]], and gave its name to the Sajik park that surrounds it, as well as to its administrative neighborhood [[Sajik-dong, Seoul|Sajik-dong]].

On this square altar were honored on key moments of the lunar calendar the national deities of earth (Sa) and grains (Jik). 

Certain ceremonies have been recently revived in the square altars, to mirror the rites of [[Jongmyo jerye]], now on the [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">'''Samuel Colliber''' ([[fl.]] 1718–1737) was an English writer, a lay author on theological and naval matters. [[John Knox Laughton]] suggested he was a Royal Navy volunteer or schoolmaster.

==Works==
Colliber published in 1727 ''Columna Rostrata'', a naval history with significant coverage of the [[Anglo-Dutch wars]] of the 17th century. It took account of Dutch and French sources. A second edition was published in 1742.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Colliber, Samuel|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Colliber wrote also a number of religious tracts, including:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''The Known God, or the Author of Nature unveiled'' (1737).

Colliber took up the ideas of [[Samuel Clarke]] on the [[existence of God]], and his modifications influenced [[Edmund Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&amp;pg=PA716|accessdate=8 September 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|pages=716}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Priestley]] cited Colliber against [[Cartesian plenism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E.

'''Soumaya Mestiri''' (born 1976) is a Tunisian philosopher.

== Life ==
After her studies, she was a lecturer at the [[University of Paris|University Paris]], where she supported a thesis in 2003 entitled "The Conception of the Person in the Philosophy of John Rawls: Trial of Reconstruction of the Theory of Justice as Equity," in front of a jury chaired by Emmanuel Picavet, and also including Catherine Audard and [[Monique Canto-Sperber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Dictionnaire universel des créatrices|last=|first=|publisher=Éditions des femmes|year=|isbn=9782721006516|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theses"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soumaya|first1=Mestiri,|title=La conception de la personne dans la philosophie de John Rawls : essai de reconstruction de la théorie de justice comme équité|url=http://www.theses.fr/2003PA010567|website=Theses|accessdate=10 March 2018|date=1 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, she conducted postdoctoral research at the [[Université catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain-la-Neuve]] and, in 2005, returned to teach in Tunisia. She was a professor at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tunis.

Her thesis was published as a book in 2007 by the House of the Sciences of the Man and was renamed ''From the Individual to the Citizen: Rawls and the Problem of the Person'', followed in 2009 by another book, ''Rawls: Justice and Equity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=André|first=Sleiman,|date=2009-12-31|title=Soumaya Mestiri, De l’individu au citoyen.

"|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2009, her research took a new directions, specifically Arab-Muslim themes such as democracy and Islam,  Al-Kindi and [[Ibn Khaldun|Ibn Khaldoun]] and [[Amartya Sen]]. She also studies the relationship between feminism, Western society and Islamic society, and also explores the debate in France on [[burkini]]s, highlighting French feminist reactions which call burkinis a form of "overhanging compassion" vis-à-vis the Muslim woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2016/09/22/le-feminisme-est-il-trop-blanc_1506207|title=Le féminisme est-il trop blanc ?|work=Libération.fr|access-date=2018-03-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sperm donation''' is the provision (or "donation") by a man (known as a sperm donor) of his [[sperm]] (known as donor sperm), principally for it to be used in the [[artificial insemination]] of a woman or women who are not his sexual partners for the purpose of achieving a pregnancy.

Sperm may be donated privately and directly to the intended recipient, or through a [[sperm bank]] or fertility clinic. Sperm donation enables a man to [[father]] a child for third-party women, and is therefore, categorized as a form of [[third party reproduction]]. Pregnancies are usually achieved by using donor sperm in [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) techniques which include [[artificial insemination]] (either by [[intracervical insemination]] (ICI) or [[IUI|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) in a clinic, or intravaginal insemination at home). Less commonly, donor sperm may be used in in vitro fertilization ([[IVF]]). The primary recipients of donor sperm are single women, lesbian couples and heterosexual couples suffering from [[male infertility]].&lt;ref name = TheTimes/&gt;

Donor sperm and 'fertility treatments' using donor sperm may be obtained at a [[sperm bank]] or fertility clinic. Sperm banks or clinics may be subject to state or professional regulations, including restrictions on donor anonymity and the number of offspring that may be produced, and there may be other legal protections of the rights and responsibilities of both recipient and donor. Some sperm banks, either by choice or regulation, limit the amount of information available to potential recipients; a desire to obtain more information on donors is one reason why recipients may choose to use a known donor or private donation (i.e. a de-identified donor).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivf.com.au/fertility-treatment/donor-program/require-a-sperm-donor|title=Donor Sperm for Fertility Treatment {{!}} IVF Australia|website=www.ivf.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Reference Added: IVF Australia

==Laws==
{{main article|Sperm donation laws by country}}

A sperm donor is generally not intended to be the legal or ''[[de jure]]'' father of a child produced from his sperm. The law may however, make implications in relation to legal fatherhood or the absence of a father. The law may also govern the fertility process through sperm donation in a fertility clinic. It may make provision as to whether a sperm donor may be anonymous or not, and it might give an adult donor conceived offspring the right to trace his or her biological father. Where sperm is donated by [[natural insemination]], i.e. where the donor has sexual intercourse with the recipient woman, the law in every country will always provide that the male is the father of any child produced, even where the sperm is provided by a third party male who is not the woman's usual sexual partner and where the express intention was to secure a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/arta2007367/index.html#s38|title=ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY ACT 2007|website=www8.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws regulating sperm donation address issues such as permissible reimbursement or payment to sperm donors, rights and responsibilities of the donor towards his biological offspring, the child's right to know his/her father's identity, and procedural issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacqueline Acker |year=2013 |title=The Case for Unregulated Private Sperm Donation |journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2qj3t4t1#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In general, laws are more likely to disregard the sperm donor's biological link to the child, so that he will neither have child support obligations nor rights to the child. In the absence of specific legal protection, courts may order a sperm donor to pay child support or recognize his parental rights, and will invariably do so where the insemination is carried  out by natural, as opposed to artificial means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Malvern|first=Jack | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sperm donor forced to pay child support after lesbian couple split|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2994783.ece|date=2007-12-04|access-date=2009-06-29|work=The Times|location=London|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008030202/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2994783.ece|archive-date=2009-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ABA Journal|last=Neil|first=Martha| name-list-format = vanc |title=Court Says Sperm Donor Owes Child Support|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/court-says-sperm-donor-owes-child-support|date=2007-05-10|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carne|first=Lucy| name-list-format = vanc |title=$PERM WAIL BY DONOR MUST PAY SORT 18 YRS.

Laws in many jurisdictions limit the number of offspring that a sperm donor can give rise to, and who may be a recipient of donor sperm.

==Uses==
The purpose of sperm donation is to provide pregnancies for women whose male partner is infertile or, more commonly, for women who do not have a male partner. Direct sexual contact between the parties is avoided since the donor's sperm is placed in the woman's body by artificial means (but see [[Natural insemination|Natural Insemination]]). 

Sperm donation preserves the sexual integrity of a recipient, but the woman is nevertheless able to benefit from the reproductive capacity of a man to provide her with a pregnancy.

Donor sperm is prepared for use in [[artificial insemination]] in intrauterine insemination ([[IUI]]) or [[Intracervical insemination|intra-cervical insemination]] (ICI). Less commonly, donor sperm is prepared for use in other assisted reproductive techniques such as [[IVF]] and [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI).  Donor sperm may also be used in [[surrogacy]] arrangements either by artificially inseminating the [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogate]] (known as traditional surrogacy) or by implanting in a surrogate embryos which have been created by using donor sperm together with eggs from a donor or from the 'commissioning female' (known as ''gestational surrogacy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://surrogate.com/about-surrogacy/types-of-surrogacy/what-is-gestational-surrogacy/|title=What is Gestational Surrogacy, How it Works  {{!}} Surrogate.com|website=surrogate.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Spare embryos from this process may be donated to other women or surrogates. Donor sperm may also be used for producing embryos with donor eggs which are then donated to a female who is not genetically related to the child she produces.

In medical terms, a pregnancy achieved using donor sperm is no different from a pregnancy achieved through sexual intercourse, and genetically a child produced by sperm donation will be the child of the sperm donor and the woman whose egg was fertilized by his sperm (although not necessarily the birth mother).

Procedures of any kind, e.g., artificial insemination or IVF, using donor sperm to impregnate a female who is not the partner of, nor related to the male who provided the sperm, may be referred to as ''donor treatments''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A Swedish study concluded that 94% of potential donors would be willing to donate to single women and 85% would be willing to donate to lesbian single women or lesbian couples.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; A review of two studies found that 50 to 68% of actual donors would donate for lesbian couples, and 40 to 64% would donate to single women.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

==Provision==
A sperm donor may donate sperm privately or through a [[sperm bank]], sperm agency, or other brokerage arrangement. Donations from private donors are most commonly carried out using [[artificial insemination]].

Generally, a male who provides sperm as a sperm donor gives up all legal and other rights over the biological children produced from his sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s60h.html|title= Family Law Act 1975 – SECT 60H: Children born as a result of artificial conception procedures|website=www5.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in private arrangements, some degree of [[co-parenting]] may be agreed, although the enforceability of those agreements varies by jurisdiction.

Donors may or may not be paid, according to local laws and agreed arrangements. Even in unpaid arrangements, expenses are often reimbursed. Depending on local law and on private arrangements, men may donate anonymously or agree to provide identifying information to their offspring in the future.&lt;ref name="Cryos2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7168|title=Frequently asked questions - Cryos International Sperm Bank|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7168|archive-date=28 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private donations facilitated by an agency often use a "directed" donor, when a male directs that his sperm is to be used by a specific person. Non-anonymous donors are also called "known donors", "open donors" or "identity disclosure donors".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A review of surveys among donors came to the results that the media and advertising are most efficient in attracting donors, and that the internet is becoming increasingly important in this purpose.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Recruitment via couples with infertility problems in the social environment of the sperm donor does not seem to be important in recruitment overall.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

===Sperm banks===
{{main article|Sperm bank}}
A sperm donor will usually donate sperm to a sperm bank under a contract, which typically specifies the period during which the donor will be required to produce sperm, which generally ranges from six to 24 months depending on the number of pregnancies which the sperm bank intends to produce from the donor. If a sperm bank has access to world markets e.g. by direct sales, or sales to clinics outside their own jurisdiction, a male may donate for a longer period than two years, as the risk of [[consanguinity]] is reduced (although local laws vary widely).

The contract may also specify the place and hours for donation, a requirement to notify the sperm bank in the case of acquiring a sexual infection, and the requirement not to have intercourse or to masturbate for a period of usually 2–3 days before making a donation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.australianeedsyoursperm.com.au/sperm-donor-process-australia-needs-your-sperm-help-someone-in-need/|title=Sperm Donor Process {{!}} Australia Needs Your Sperm {{!}} Help a family in need|work=Australia Needs Your Sperm|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sperm provided by a sperm bank will be produced by a donor attending at the sperm bank's premises in order to ascertain the donor's identity on every occasion. The donor [[masturbation|masturbates]] to provide an ejaculate or by the use of an electrical stimulator, although a special [[condom]], known as a [[collection condom]], may be used to [[semen collection|collect the semen]] during sexual intercourse. The ejaculate is collected in a small container, which is usually [[Semen extender|extended with chemicals]] in order to provide a number of vials, each of which would be used for separate inseminations. The sperm is frozen and quarantined, usually for a period of six months, and the donor is re-tested prior to the sperm being used for artificial insemination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Sperm agencies===
In some jurisdictions, sperm may be donated through an agency. The agency may recruit donors, usually via the Internet. Donors may undergo the same kind of checks and tests required by a sperm bank, although clinics and agencies are not necessarily subject to the same regulatory regimes. In the case of an agency, the sperm will be supplied to the recipient female fresh rather than frozen.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/apr/30/health.uknews|title=Internet sperm agencies plan to sidestep new rules|last=Lewis|first=Paul| name-list-format = vanc |date=2007-04-30|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female chooses a donor and notifies the agency when she requires donations. The agency notifies the donor who must supply his sperm on the appropriate days nominated by the recipient. The agency will usually provide the sperm donor with a male collection kit usually including a [[collection condom]] and a container for shipping the sperm. This is collected and delivered by courier and the female uses the donor's sperm to inseminate herself, typically without medical supervision. This process preserves anonymity and enables a donor to produce sperm in the privacy of his own home. A donor will generally produce samples once or twice during a recipient's fertile period, but a second sample each time may not have the same fecundity of the first sample because it is produced too soon after the first one. Pregnancy rates by this method vary more than those achieved by sperm banks or fertility clinics. Transit times may vary and these have a significant effect on sperm viability so that if a donor is not located near to a recipient female the sperm may deteriorate. However, the use of fresh, as opposed to frozen, semen will mean that a sample has a greater fecundity and can produce higher pregnancy rates.

Sperm agencies may impose limits on the number of pregnancies achieved from each donor, but in practice this is more difficult to achieve than for sperm banks where the whole process may be more regulated. Most sperm donors only donate for a limited period, however, and since sperm supplied by a sperm agency is not processed into a number of different vials, there is a practical limit on the number of pregnancies which are usually produced in this way. A sperm agency will, for the same reason, be less likely than a sperm bank to enable a female to have subsequent children by the same donor.

Sperm agencies are largely unregulated and, because the sperm is not quarantined, may carry [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. This lack of regulation has led to authorities in some jurisdictions bringing legal action against sperm agencies. Agencies typically insist on [[STI testing]] for donors, but such tests cannot detect recent infections. Donors providing sperm in this way may not be protected by laws which apply to donations through a sperm bank or fertility clinic and will, if traced, be regarded as the legal father of each child produced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Private or "directed" donations===
Couples or individuals who need insemination by a third-party may seek assistance privately and directly from a friend or family member, or may obtain a "private" or "directed" donation by advertising or through a broker. A number of web sites seek to link recipients with sperm donors, while advertisements in gay and lesbian publications are common.

Recipients may already know the donor, or if arranged through a broker, the donor may meet the recipients and become known to them. Some brokers facilitate contact that maintains semi-anonymous identities for legal reasons. Where a private or directed donation is used, sperm need not be frozen.

Private donations may be free of charge - avoiding the significant costs of a more medicalised insemination - and fresh rather than frozen semen is generally deemed to increase the chances of pregnancy. However, they also carry higher risks associated with unscreened sexual or body fluid contact. Legal treatment of donors varies across jurisdictions, and in most jurisdictions (e.g., Sweden)&lt;ref name=notisum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notisum.se/rnp/Sls/lag/20060351.htm|title=Lag (2006:351) om genetisk integritet m.m.|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; personal and directed donors lack legal safeguards that may be available to anonymous donors. However, the laws of some countries (e.g. New Zealand) recognize written agreements between donors and recipients in a similar way to donations through a sperm bank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Kits are available, usually on-line, for [[artificial insemination]] for private donor use, and these kits generally include a collection pot, a syringe, ovulation tests and pregnancy tests. A vaginal speculum and a soft cup may also be used. STI testing kits are also available but these only produce a 'snap-shot' result and, since sperm will not be frozen and quarantined, there will be risks associated with it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Natural insemination===
Insemination through sexual intercourse is known as natural insemination (NI). Where natural insemination is carried out by a person who is not the woman's usual sexual partner, and in circumstances where the express intention is to secure a pregnancy, this may be referred to as 'sperm donation by natural insemination'. 

Natural insemination has not been recognised in any state as other than a natural procreation process whereby the sperm donor and biological father is liable for care and support of the child. A woman who becomes pregnant through natural insemination will therefore always have a legal right to claim child support from the donor and the donor has a legal right to the custody of the child. Conceiving through natural insemination is considered a natural process, so the biological father will always be liable for child support and custody rights of the child.&lt;ref name="vanda"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is natural insemination?|url=http://sg.theasianparent.com/natural-insemination|access-date=4 December 2015 |quote=Natural insemination has not been recognised in any state as other than a natural procreation process whereby the sperm donor and biological father is liable for care and support of the child.  A woman who becomes pregnant through natural insemination will therefore always have a legal right to claim child support from the donor and the donor has a legal right to the custody of the child.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law therefore makes a fine distinction based on the method of conception: the biological relationship between the father and the child and the reason for the pregnancy having been achieved will be the same whether the child was conceived naturally or by artificial means, but the legal position will be different.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some countries and in some situations, sperm donors may be legally liable for any child they produce, but with NI the legal risk of paternity for a donor is always absolute. Natural insemination donors will therefore often donate without revealing their identity.

Despite this, some private sperm donors offer both natural and artificial insemination, or they may offer natural insemination after attempts to achieve conception by artificial insemination have failed. Some women also seek natural insemination for various reasons including the desire by them for a "natural" conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8261034.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Secret world of sperm donations |date=September 18, 2009 |access-date=May 23, 2010 |first=Samantha |last=Washington| name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/27/jennie-withers-co-parents-fertility |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Conceivable ideas: meet the modern sperm donor |date=June 27, 2010 |first=Emma |last=John| name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural insemination by a donor usually avoids the need for costly medical procedures that may require the intervention of third parties. It may lack some of the safety precautions and screenings usually built into the artificial insemination process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-have-babies-sperm-donor-ed-houben|title=How One Man Fathered 106 Babies (and Counting)|last=Paterniti|first=Michael|date=2015-10-01|work=GQ|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but proponents claim that it produces higher pregnancy rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kidspot.com.au/birth/conception/getting-pregnant/would-you-get-freaky-with-a-stranger-to-make-a-baby/news-story/7c692d3a112d91e71c9981756a6b9af6|title=Would you have sex with a stranger to make a baby?|last=Wylie|first=Rebel| name-list-format = vanc |website=www.kidspot.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more 'natural' conception does not involve the intervention and intrusion of third parties. However, it has not been medically proved that natural insemination has an increased chance of pregnancy.

NI is generally only carried out at the female's fertile time, as with other methods of insemination, in order to achieve the best chances of a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/getting-pregnant|title=Getting pregnant| work = Australia Healthdirect |date=2018-08-01|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of NI is PI, or partial intercourse, where penetration by the donor takes place immediately before ejaculation, thus avoiding prolonged physical contact between the parties.

==Sperm bank processes==
A sperm donor is usually advised not to ejaculate for two to three days before providing the sample, to increase sperm count. A sperm donor produces and collects sperm at a sperm bank or clinic by [[masturbation]] or during sexual intercourse with the use of a [[collection condom]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Preparing the sperm===
Sperm banks and clinics may "wash" the sperm sample to extract sperm from the rest of the material in the semen. Unwashed semen may only be used for ICI (intra-cervical) inseminations, to avoid cramping, or for IVF/ICSI procedures. It may be washed after thawing for use in IUI procedures. A [[cryoprotectant]] [[semen extender]] is added if the sperm is to be placed in frozen storage in [[liquid nitrogen]], and the sample is then frozen in a number of vials or straws.&lt;ref name=Cryos3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7179|title=Frequently asked questions - Cryos International Sperm Bank|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7179|archive-date=28 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One sample will be divided into 1–20 vials or straws depending on the quantity of the [[ejaculate]], whether the sample is washed or unwashed, or whether it is being prepared for IVF use. Following analysis of an individual donor's sperm, straws or vials may be prepared which contain differing amounts of motile sperm post-thaw. The number of sperm in a straw prepared for IVF use, for example, will be significantly less than the number of motile sperm in a straw prepared for ICI or IUI and there will therefore be more IVF straws per ejaculate. Following the necessary quarantine period, the samples are thawed and used to inseminate women through artificial insemination or other [[assisted reproductive technology|ART]] treatments.

===Medical issues===

====Screening====
{{Main article|Screening of potential sperm bank donors}}
Sperm banks typically screen potential donors for [[genetic diseases]], [[chromosomal abnormalities]] and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s that may be transmitted through sperm. The screening procedure generally also includes a quarantine period, in which the samples are frozen and stored for at least six months after which the donor will be re-tested for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STIs). This is to ensure no new infections have been acquired or have developed during the period of donation. Providing the result is negative, the sperm samples can be released from quarantine and used in treatments. [[Donor conceived person|Children conceived through sperm donation]] have a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1983-09-01/The-Sperm-Crisis.aspx|title=The Male Fertility Crisis|work=Mother Earth News|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Samples required per donor offspring====
The number of donor samples (ejaculates) that is required to help give rise to a child varies substantially from donor to donor, as well as from clinic to clinic. However, the following equations generalize the main factors involved:

For [[intracervical insemination]]:
:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{V_s \times c \times r_s}{n_r} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Success rates by amount of sperm.svg|thumb|right|250px|Approximate [[pregnancy rate]] (''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) varies with amount of sperm used in a cycle (''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;). Values are for intrauterine insemination, with sperm number in [[total sperm count]], which may be approximately twice the [[total motile sperm count]]. (Old data, rates are likely higher today)]]

:''N'' is how many children a single sample can help give rise to.
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of a sample (ejaculate), usually between 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[milliliters|mL]] and 6.5&amp;nbsp;mL &lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Essig |first=Maria G. | name-list-format = vanc |editor1-first=Susan |editor1-last=Van Houten |editor2-first=Tracy |editor2-last=Landauer |title=Semen Analysis |work=Healthwise |publisher=WebMD |date=2007-02-20 |url=http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/semen-analysis?page=1 |access-date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''c'' is the concentration of motile sperm in a sample ''after freezing and thawing'', approximately 5-20 million per ml but varies substantially
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[pregnancy rate]] per cycle, between 10% to 35%&lt;ref name=cryos&gt;[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/clinics/questions-answers.aspx#5351 Cryos International - What is the expected pregnancy rate (PR) using your donor semen?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107151459/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/clinics/questions-answers.aspx |date=2011-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=utrecht&gt;[http://faqs.cs.uu.nl/na-dir/medicine/infertility-faq/part4.html Utrecht CS News] Subject: Infertility FAQ (part 4/4)&lt;/ref&gt;
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[total motile sperm count]] recommended for vaginal insemination (VI) or intra-cervical insemination ([[Intracervical Insemination|ICI]]), approximately 20 million pr. ml.&lt;ref name=Cryos5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7169|title=Frequently asked questions - Cryos International Sperm Bank|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7169|archive-date=28 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pregnancy rate increases with increasing number of motile sperm used, but only up to a certain degree, when other factors become limiting instead.

{{For|derivation of the equation|Artificial insemination#Samples per child}}

With these numbers, one sample would on average help giving rise to 0.1–0.6 children, that is, it actually takes on average 2–5 samples to make a child.

For [[intrauterine insemination]], a ''centrifugation fraction'' (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) may be added to the equation:
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the fraction of the volume that remains after centrifugation of the sample, which may be about half (0.5) to a third (0.33).

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{V_s \times f_c \times c \times r_s}{n_r} &lt;/math&gt;

Only 5 million motile sperm may be needed per cycle with IUI (''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;=5 million)&lt;ref name=cryos/&gt;

Thus, only 1–3 samples may be needed for a child if used for IUI.

Using [[assisted reproductive technology|ART]] treatments such as [[IVF]] can result in one donor sample (or ejaculate) producing on average considerably more than one birth. However, the actual number of births per sample will depend on the actual [[assisted reproductive technology|ART]] method used, the age and medical condition of the female bearing the child, and the quality of the embryos produced by fertilization. Donor sperm is less commonly used for [[IVF]] treatments than for [[artificial insemination]]. This is because [[IVF]] treatments are usually required only when there is a problem with the female conceiving, or where there is a 'male factor problem' involving the female's partner. Donor sperm is also used for [[IVF]] in surrogacy arrangements where an embryo may be created in an [[IVF]] procedure using donor sperm and this is then implanted in a surrogate. In a case where [[IVF]] treatments are employed using donor sperm, surplus embryos may be donated to other women or couples and used in [[embryo transfer]] procedures. When donor sperm is used for [[IVF]] treatments, there is a risk that large numbers of children will be born from a single donor since a single ejaculate may produce up to 20 straws for IVF use. A single straw can fertilise a number of eggs and these can have a 40% to 50% pregnancy rate. 'Spare' embryos from donor treatments are frequently donated to other women or couples. Many sperm banks therefore limit the amount of semen from each donor which is prepared for [[IVF]] use, or they may restrict the period of time for which such a donor donates his sperm to perhaps as little as three months (about nine or ten ejaculates).

===Choosing donors===

====Information about donor====
In the US, sperm banks maintain lists or catalogues of donors which provide basic information such as racial origin, skin color, height, weight, color of eyes, and blood group.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/060523_bad_banks.html|title=The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Sperm|work=LiveScience.com|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these catalogues are available via the Internet, while others are only made available to patients when they apply for treatment. Some sperm banks make additional information about each donor available for an additional fee, and others make additional basic information known to children produced from donors when those children reach the age of eighteen. Some clinics offer "exclusive donors" whose sperm is only used to produce pregnancies for one recipient female. How accurate this is, or can be, is not known, and neither is it known whether the information produced by sperm banks, or by the donors themselves, is true. Many sperm banks will, however, carry out checks to verify the information requested, such as checking the identity of the donor and contacting his own doctor to verify medical details. Simply because such information is not verifiable does not imply that it is in any way inaccurate, and a sperm bank will rely upon its reputation which, in turn, will be based upon its success rate and upon the accuracy of the information about its donors which it makes available.

In the UK, most donors are anonymous at the point of donation and recipients can only see non-identifying information about their donor (height, weight, ethnicity, etc.). Donors need to provide identifying information to the clinic and clinics will usually ask the donor's GP to confirm any medical details they have been given. Donors are asked to provide a pen portrait of themselves which is held by the [[HFEA]] and can be obtained by the adult conceived from the donation at the age of 16, along with identifying information such as the donor's name and last known address at 18. Known donation is permitted and it is not uncommon for family or friends to donate to a recipient couple.

Qualities that potential recipients typically prefer in donors include the donors being tall, college educated, and with a consistently high sperm count.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Almeling |first1=Rene | name-list-format = vanc |title=Selling Genes, Selling Gender: Egg Agencies, Sperm Banks, and the Medical Market in Genetic Material |journal=American Sociological Review |date=24 June 2016 |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=319–340 |doi=10.1177/000312240707200301}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review came to the result that 68% of donors had given information to the clinical staff regarding physical characteristics and education but only 16% had provided additional information such as hereditary aptitudes and temperament or character.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

====Other screening criteria====
Sexually active gay men are prohibited or discouraged from donating in some countries, including the US. Sperm banks also screen out some potential donors based on height, baldness, and family medical history.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"/&gt;

===Number of offspring===
{{Further information|Sperm donation laws by country}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}Where a donor donates sperm through a sperm bank, the sperm bank will generally undertake a number of checks to ensure that the donor produces sperm of sufficient quantity and quality and that the donor is healthy and will not pass diseases through the use of his sperm. The donor's sperm must also withstand the freezing and thawing process necessary to store and quarantine the sperm. The cost to the sperm bank for such tests is considerable,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2016}} which normally means that clinics may use the same donor to produce a number of pregnancies in multiple women.

The number of children permitted from a single donor varies by law and practice. These laws are designed to protect the children produced by sperm donation as well as the donor's natural children from [[consanguinity]] in later life: they are not intended to protect the donor himself and those donating sperm will be aware that their donations may give rise to numerous pregnancies in different jurisdictions. Such laws, where they exist, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and a sperm bank may also impose its own limits. The latter will be based on the reports of pregnancies which the sperm bank receives, although this relies upon the accuracy of the returns and the actual number of pregnancies may therefore be somewhat higher. Nevertheless, sperm banks frequently impose a lower limit on geographical numbers than some jurisdictions and may also limit the overall number of pregnancies permitted from a single donor. The limitation on the number of children which a donor's sperm may give rise to is usually expressed in terms of 'families', on the expectation that children within the family are prohibited from sexual relations under incest laws. In effect, the term ''family'' means a "woman" and usually includes the donor's partner or ex-partner, so that multiple donations to the same woman are not counted in the limit. The limits usually apply within one jurisdiction, so that donor sperm may be used in other jurisdictions. There is no limit on the number of donations that can be made to the same woman.

There is no limit to the number of offspring which may be produced from private donors.

Despite laws limiting the number of offspring, some donors may produce substantial numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/31/fathered-34-children-sperm-donation|title=I fathered 34 children through sperm donation|last=Whitman|first=Chris| name-list-format = vanc |date=2014-01-31|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; of children, particularly where they donate through different clinics, where sperm is onsold or is exported to different jurisdictions, and where countries or jurisdictions do not have a central register of donors.

Sperm agencies, in contrast to sperm banks, rarely impose or enforce limits on the number of children which may be produced by a single donor partly because they are not empowered to demand a report of a pregnancy from recipients and are rarely, if ever, able to guarantee that a female may have a subsequent sibling by the donor who was the biological father of her first or earlier children.

In the media, there have been reports of some donors producing anywhere from over 40 offspring &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/health/44-donor-siblings-and-counting/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5739670c47a7 44 siblings and counting]&lt;/ref&gt; to several hundred or more. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/health/06donor.html One Sperm Donor, 150 Offspring]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siblings====
Where a female wishes to conceive additional children by sperm donation, she will often wish to use the same donor. The advantage of having subsequent children by the same donor is that these will be full biological siblings, having the same biological father and mother. Many sperm banks offer a service of storing sperm for future pregnancies, but few will otherwise guarantee that sperm from the original donor will be available.

Sperm banks rarely impose limits on the numbers of second or subsequent siblings. Even where there are limits on the use of sperm by a particular donor to a defined number of families (as in the UK) the actual number of children produced from each donor will often be far greater.

Since 2000, donor conceived people have been locating their biological siblings and even their donor through web services such as the [[Donor Sibling Registry]] as well as DNA testing services such as [[Ancestry.com]] and [[23andMe]]. By using these services, donors can find offspring despite the fact that they may have donated anonymously. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/sperm-donor-dna-testing-1.4500517&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://stluciatimes.com/2018/10/01/super-sperm-donor-may-have-1000-children/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donor payment===
The majority of donors who donate through a sperm bank receive some form of payment, although this is rarely a significant amount. A review including 29 studies from 9 countries found that the amount of money donors received varied from $10 to €70 per donation or sample.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; The payments vary from the situation in the United Kingdom where donors are only entitled to their expenses, to the situation with some US sperm banks where a donor receives a set fee for each donation plus an additional amount for each vial stored. At one prominent California sperm bank for example, TSBC, donors receive roughly $50 for each donation which has acceptable motility/survival rates both at donation and at a test-thaw a couple of days later. Because of the requirement for the two-day abstinence period before donation, and geographical factors which usually require the donor to travel, it is not a viable way to earn a significant income. Some private donors may seek remuneration although others donate for altruistic reasons. According to the [[EU Tissue Directive]] donors in EU may only receive compensation, which is strictly limited to making good the expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. A survey among sperm donors in Cryos International Sperm bank &lt;ref name=Cryos4&gt;[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/media/132834/0612_001.pdf Attitudes among sperm donors …] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722064939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/media/132834/0612_001.pdf |date=2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that altruistic as well as financial motives were the main factors for becoming a donor. However, when the compensation was increased 100% in 2004 (to DKK 500) it did not significantly affect the numbers of new donor candidates coming in or the frequency of donations from the existing donors. When the compensation was reduced to the previous level (DKK 250) again one year later in 2005 there was no effect either. This led to the assumption that altruism is the main motive and that financial compensation is secondary.

Equipment to collect, freeze and store sperm is available to the public notably through certain US outlets, and some donors process and store their own sperm which they then sell via the Internet.

The selling price of processed and stored sperm is considerably more than the sums received by donors. Treatments with donor sperm are generally expensive and are seldom available free of charge through national health services. Sperm banks often package treatments into e.g. three cycles, and in cases of IVF or other ART treatments, they may reduce the charge if a patient donates any spare embryos which are produced through the treatment. There is often more demand for fertility treatment with donor sperm than there is donor sperm available, and this has the effect of keeping the cost of such treatments reasonably high.

===Onselling===
{{Main article|Onselling of sperm}}
There is a market for vials of processed sperm and for various reasons a sperm bank may sell-on stocks of vials which it holds (known as 'onselling'). Onselling enables a sperm bank to maximize the sale and disposal of sperm samples which it has processed. The reasons for onselling may be where part of, or even the main business of, a particular sperm bank is to process and store sperm rather than to use it in fertility treatments, or where a sperm bank is able to collect and store more sperm than it can use within nationally set limits. In the latter case, a sperm bank may sell on sperm from a particular donor for use in another jurisdiction after the number of pregnancies achieved from that donor has reached its national maximum.

==Psychological issues==
{{anchor|psychological}}
{{Further information|Donor conceived people#Psychological and social}}

===Informing the child===
Many donees do not inform the child that they were conceived through sperm donation, or, when non-anonymous donor sperm has been used, they do not tell the child until they are old enough for the clinic to provide contact information about the donor. Some believe that it is a human right for a person to know who their biological mother and father are, and thus it should be illegal to conceal this information in any way and at any time. For donor conceived children who find out after a long period of secrecy, their main grief is usually not the fact that they are not the genetic child of the couple who have raised them, but the fact that the parent or parents have kept information from or lied to them, causing loss of trust.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt;

There are certain circumstances where the child very likely should be told:
* When many relatives know about the insemination, so that the child might find it out from somebody else.&lt;ref name=barratt&gt;''Donor Insemination'' Edited by C.L.R. Barratt and I.D. Cooke. Cambridge (England): Cambridge University Press, 1993. 231 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When the adoptive father carries a significant genetic disease, relieving the child from fear of being a carrier.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt;

The parents' decision-making process of telling the child is influenced by many intrapersonal factors (such as personal confidence), interpersonal factors, as well as social and family life cycle factors.&lt;ref name=Indekeu2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Indekeu A, Dierickx K, Schotsmans P, Daniels KR, Rober P, D'Hooghe T | title = Factors contributing to parental decision-making in disclosing donor conception: a systematic review | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 714–33 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23814103 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, health care staff and support groups have been demonstrated to influence the decision to disclose the procedure.&lt;ref name=Indekeu2013/&gt; The appropriate age of the child at disclosure is most commonly given at between 7 and 11 years.&lt;ref name=Indekeu2013/&gt;

Single mothers and lesbian couples are more likely to disclose from a young age. Donor conceived children in heterosexual coupled families are more likely to find out about their disclosure from a third party.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"/&gt;

===Families sharing same donor===
Having contact and meeting among families sharing the same donor generally has positive effects.&lt;ref name=scheibJuly&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheib JE, Ruby A | title = Contact among families who share the same sperm donor | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–43 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18023432 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.05.058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;[http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/3/505 T.

From Thursday's Globe and Mail. February 26, 2009 at 8:58 AM EDT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other family members===
Parents of donors, who are the grandparents of donor offspring and may therefore be the oldest surviving progenitors, may regard the donated genetic contribution as a family asset, and may regard the donor conceived people as their grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/my-scattered-grandchildren/article1286201/ My scattered grandchildren] ''The Globe and Mail''. Alison Motluk. Sunday, September 13, 2009 07:53PM EDT&lt;/ref&gt;

A review came to the result that a minority of actual donors involved their partner in the decision-making process of becoming a donor.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In one study, 25% of donors felt they needed permission from their partner.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In another study, however, 37% of donors with a partner did not approve of a consent form for partners and rather felt that donors should make their own decisions.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In a Swedish study, donors reported either enthusiastic or neutral responses from their partners concerning sperm donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

It is considered common for donors to not tell their spouses that they are or have been sperm donors. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sperm-donor-dad-when-strangers-shared-dna-become-family-n937366 From sperm donor to 'Dad': When strangers with shared DNA become a family]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mother-child relation===
Studies have indicated that donor insemination mothers show greater emotional involvement with their child, and they enjoy motherhood more than mothers by natural conception and adoption. Compared to mothers by natural conception, donor insemination mothers tend to show higher levels of disciplinary aggression.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilioi EC, Golombok S | title = Psychological adjustment in adolescents conceived by assisted reproduction techniques: a systematic review | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–96 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25281685 | pmc = 4255607 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have indicated that donor insemination fathers express more warmth and emotional involvement than fathers by natural conception and adoption, enjoy fatherhood more, and are less involved in disciplining their adolescent. Some donor insemination parents become overly involved with their children.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"/&gt;

Adolescents born through sperm donation to lesbian mothers have reported themselves to be academically successful, with active friendship networks, strong family bonds, and overall high ratings of well-being. It is estimated that over 80% of adolescents feel they can confide in their mothers, and almost all regard their mothers to be good role models.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"/&gt;

===Motivation vs reluctance to donate===
A [[systematic review]] came to the result that [[altruism]] and financial compensation are the main motivations to donate, and to a lesser degree procreation or genetic fatherhood and questions about the donor's own fertility.&lt;ref name="Broeck2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van den Broeck U, Vandermeeren M, Vanderschueren D, Enzlin P, Demyttenaere K, D'Hooghe T | title = A systematic review of sperm donors: demographic characteristics, attitudes, motives and experiences of the process of sperm donation | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–51 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23146866 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial compensation is generally more prevalent than altruism as a motivation among donors in countries where the compensation is large, which is largely explained by a larger number of economically driven people becoming donors in such countries.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Among men who do not donate, the main reason thereof has been stated to be a lack of motivation rather than concerns about the donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

Reluctance to donate may be caused by a sense of ownership and responsibility for the well-being of the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McMahon CA, Saunders DM | title = Attitudes of couples with stored frozen embryos toward conditional embryo donation | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 140–7 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18053994 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for donors===
In the UK, the [[National Gamete Donation Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ngdt.co.uk/ National Gamete Donation Trust&lt;/ref&gt; is a charity which provides information, advice and support for people wishing to become egg, sperm or embryo donors. The Trust runs a national helpline and online discussion list for donors to talk to each other.

In one Danish study, 40% of donors felt happy thinking about possible offspring, but 40% of donors sometimes worried about the future of resulting offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

A review came to the result that one in three actual donors would like counselling to address certain implications of their donation, expecting that counselling could help them to give their decision some thought and to look at all the involved parties in the donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

A [[systematic review]] in 2012 came to the conclusion that the psychosocial needs and experiences of the donors, and their follow-up and counselling are largely neglected in studies on sperm donation.&lt;ref name="Broeck2012"/&gt;

==Ethical and legal issues==
===Anonymity===&lt;!--limited donor information redirects here--&gt;
Anonymous sperm donation occurs under the condition that recipients and offspring will never learn the identity of the donor. A non-anonymous donor, however, will disclose his identity to recipients. A donor who makes a non-anonymous sperm donation is termed a ''known donor'', an ''open identity donor'',  or an ''identity release donor''.

Non-anonymous sperm donors are, to a substantially higher degree, driven by altruistic motives for their donations.&lt;ref name=werner/&gt;

Even in the case of anonymous donation, some information about the donor may be released to recipients at the time of treatment. ''Limited donor information'' includes height, weight, eye, skin and hair colour. In Sweden, this is the extent of disclosed information. In the US, however, additional information may be given, such as a comprehensive biography and sound/video samples.

Several jurisdictions (e.g., Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Britain, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand, and others) only allow non-anonymous sperm donation. This is generally based on the principle that a child has a right to know his or her biological origins. In 2013, a German court precedent was set based on a case brought by a 21-year-old woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/court-rules-sperm-donors-children-have-right-to-know/a-16580116|title=Court rules sperm donors' children have right to know | date = 6 February 2013 | work = Deutsche Welle |access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these jurisdictions require sperm banks to keep up-to-date records and to release identifying information about the donor to his offspring after they reach a certain age (15–18). See [[Sperm donation laws by country]].

====Attitudes towards anonymity====
For most sperm recipients, anonymity of the donor is not of major importance at the obtainment or [[Single parent#Choice parent|tryer]]-stage.&lt;ref name=werner&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ekerhovd E, Faurskov A, Werner C | title = Swedish sperm donors are driven by altruism, but shortage of sperm donors leads to reproductive travelling | journal = Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences | volume = 113 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–13 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18991243 | doi = 10.3109/2000-1967-241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous sperm is often less expensive. Another reason that recipients choose anonymous donors is concern about the role that the donor or the child may want the donor to play in the child's life. Sperm recipients may prefer a non-anonymous donor if they anticipate disclosing donor conception to their child and anticipate the child's desire to seek more information about their donor in the future. A Dutch study found that lesbian couples are significantly more likely (98%) to choose non-anonymous donors than heterosexual couples (63%). Of the heterosexual couples that opted for anonymous donation, 83% intended never to inform their child of their conception via sperm donation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/820.full.pdf Breaeys, A., de Bruyn, J.K., Louwe, L.A., Helmerhorst, F.M., "Anonymous or identity registered sperm donors? A study of Dutch recipients choices", ''Human Reproduction'' Vol. 20, No. 3 pp. 820–824, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

For children conceived by an anonymous donor, the impossibility of contacting a biological father or the inability to find information about him can potentially be psychologically burdensome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-11-06/news/donor-babies-search-for-their-anonymous-fathers/1|title=Donor Babies Search for Their Anonymous Fathers |first=Craig |last=Malisow | name-list-format = vanc |date=5 November 2008|work=houstonpress.com|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study estimated that approximately 67% of [[adolescent]] [[donor conceived children]] with an identity-release donor plan to contact him when they turn 18.&lt;ref name="IlioiGolombok2014"/&gt;

=====Among donors and potential donors=====
Among donors, a [[systematic review]] of 29 studies from nine countries concluded that 20–50% of donors would still be willing to donate even if anonymity could not be guaranteed.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Between 40 and 97% of donors agree to release non-identifying information such as physical characteristics and level of education.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; The proportion of actual donors wishing for contact with their offspring varies between 10 and 88%.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Most donors are not open to contact with offspring, although more open attitudes are observed among single and homosexual donors.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; About half of donors feel that degree of involvement should be decided by the intended parents.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Some of the donors prefer contact with offspring in a non-visible way, such as where the child can ask questions but the donor will not reveal his identity.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; One study recruited donors through the [[Donor Sibling Registry]] who wanted contact with offspring or who had already made contact with offspring. It resulted that none of the donors said that there was "no relationship", a third of donors felt it was a special relationship, almost like a very good friend, and a quarter felt it was merely a genetic bond and nothing more. Fifteen percent of actual donors considered offspring to be "their own children".&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;  On the whole, donors feel that the first step towards contact should come from offspring rather than parents or the donor himself.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Some even say that it is the moral responsibility of the donor not to seek contact with offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

The same review indicated that up to 37% of donors reported changes in their attitude towards anonymity before and after donation, with one in four being prepared to be more open about themselves after the donation than before (as a "potential donor").&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Among potential donors, 30–46% of potential donors would still be willing to donate even if anonymity could not be guaranteed.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Still, more than 75% of these potential donors felt positive towards releasing non-identifying information to offspring, such as physical characteristics and level of education.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Single or homosexual men are significantly more inclined to release their identity than married, heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Potential donors with children are less inclined to want to meet offspring than potential donors without children (9 versus 30% in the review).&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Potential donors in a relationship are less inclined to consider contact with offspring than single potential donors (7 versus 28% in the review).&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; From US data, 20% would actively want to know and meet offspring and 40% would not object if the child wished to meet but would not solicit a meeting themselves.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; From Swedish data, where only non-anonymous donation is permitted in clinics, 87% of potential donors had a positive attitude towards future contact with offspring, although 80% of these potential donors did not feel that the donor had any moral responsibilities for the child later in life.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Also from UK data, 80% of potential donors did not feel responsible for whatever happened with their sperm after the donation.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; With variation between different studies, between 33% and 94% of potential donors want to know at least whether or not the donation resulted in offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Some of these potential donors merely wanted to know if a pregnancy had been achieved but did not want to know any specific information about the offspring (e.g. sex, date of birth).&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; Other potential donors felt that knowing the outcome of the donation made the experience more meaningful.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt; In comparison, a German study came to the result that 11% of donors actually asked about the outcome in the clinic where they donated.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

An Australian study concluded that potential donors who would still be willing to donate without a guarantee of anonymity were not automatically more open to extended or intimate contact with offspring.&lt;ref name=Broeck2012/&gt;

====Donor tracking====
Even when donors choose to be anonymous, offspring may still find ways to learn more about their biological origins. Registries and DNA databases have been developed for this purpose. Registries that help donor-conceived offspring identify half-siblings from other mothers also help avoid [[accidental incest]] in adulthood.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.donorchildren.com/|title=DonorChildren|website=www.donorchildren.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-07/dingle-the-reality-of-sperm-donors-is-hitting-home/7006906|title=The reality of sperm donation is hitting home|date=2015-12-07|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tracking by registries=====
{{Further information|Donor sibling registration}}
Offspring of anonymous donors may often have the ability to obtain their biological father's donor number from the fertility clinic or sperm bank used for their birth. They may then share their number on a registry. By finding shared donor numbers, offspring may find their genetic half-siblings. The donor may also find his number on a registry and choose to make contact with his offspring or otherwise reveal his identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=====Tracking by DNA databases=====
Even sperm donors who have chosen anonymity and not to contact their offspring through a registry are now increasingly being traced by their children. Improved DNA technology has brought into question the possibility of assuring a donor's anonymity. For example, at least one child found his biological father using his own DNA test and internet research, and was able to identify and contact his anonymous donor.&lt;ref name="newscien"&gt;

===Fertility tourism and international sperm markets===
{{Further information|Fertility tourism#Donor insemination destinations}}
Different factors motivate individuals to seek sperm from outside their home state. For example, some jurisdictions do not allow unmarried women to receive donor sperm. Jurisdictional regulatory choices as well as cultural factors that discourage sperm donation have also led to international [[fertility tourism]] and sperm markets.

====Sweden====
When [[Sweden]] banned anonymous sperm donation in 1980, the number of active sperm donors dropped from approximately 200 to 30.&lt;ref name=sydsvenskan&gt;Sydsvenskan:[Här börjar livet för 100 svenska barn varje år (Google translate:Here begins the lives of 100 Swedish children each year).] By Karen Söderberg 17 April 2005 00:00&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden now has an 18-month waiting list for donor sperm.&lt;ref name=werner/&gt; At least 250&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt; Swedish sperm recipients travel to Denmark annually for insemination. Some of this is also due to the fact that [[Denmark]] also allows single women to be inseminated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100905072034/http://theimpudentobserver.com/world-news/single-women-head-for-denmark-for-guess-what/ Single Women Head For Denmark For Guess What?] ''The Impudent Observer''.

====United Kingdom====
After the [[United Kingdom]] ended anonymous sperm donation in 2005, the numbers of sperm donors went up, reversing a three-year decline.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3411.html |title=New donor registrations |work = Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Strategy and Information Directorate, Web |last=team, |date= |publisher =hfea.gov.uk |access-date=29 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606000000/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3411.html |archive-date=6 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still a shortage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3422.html#3426|title=4Sperm, Egg and Embryo Donation |work=hfea.gov.uk|access-date=29 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127025158/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/3422.html#3426|archive-date=27 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and some doctors have suggested raising the limit of children per donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/337/nov11_3/a2318|title=Sperm donation in the UK|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some UK clinics import sperm from [[Scandinavia]].

Despite the shortage, sperm exports from the UK are legal and donors may remain anonymous in this context. However, the HFEA does impose safeguards on the export of sperm, such as that it must be exported to fertility clinics only and that the result of any treatment must be traceable. Sperm banks impose their own limits on the number of pregnancies obtained from exported sperm.

Since 2009, the import of sperm via registered clinics for use in the UK has been authorised by the HFEA. The sperm must have been processed, stored and quarantined in compliance with UK regulations. The donors have agreed to be identified when the children produced with their sperm reach the age of eighteen. The number of children produced from such donors in the UK will, of course, be subject to HFEA rules (i.e. currently a limit of ten families,) but the donors' sperm may be used worldwide in accordance with the clinic's own limit of one child per 200.000 of population, subject to national or local limits which apply.  By 2014 the UK was importing nearly 40% of its sperm requirements, up from 10% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldglobe.com/index.php/sid/223347153/scat/2411cd3571b4f088/ht/UK-facing-major-sperm-shortage-due-to-donor-shortfall|title=UK facing major sperm shortage due to donor shortfall - Herald Globe|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 it was reported that almost half of the imported sperm into Britain came from Denmark (3,000 units).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/25/why-are-british-women-using-danish-sperm-to-get-pregnant-7881940/|title=Why are British women using Danish sperm to get pregnant?|last=Olsen|first=Martine Berg|date=2018-08-25|work=Metro|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social controversy===
The use of sperm donation is most common among single women and lesbians.&lt;ref name = "TheTimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/times2/looking-for-a-sperm-donor-swipe-right-l8zth7lgp|title=Looking for a sperm donor?

This produces many ethical issues around the ideals of conventional parenting and has wider issues for society as a whole, including the issues of the role of men as parents, family support for children, and financial support for women with children.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-30/the-ins-and-outs-of-sperm-donation/6732288|title=The ins and outs of sperm donation|date=2015-08-30|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of sperm banks and fertility clinics, the use of sperm agencies and the availability of anonymous donor sperm have served to make sperm donation a more respectable, and therefore a more socially acceptable, procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-21/women-choosing-diy-ivf-sperm-insemination-to-become-mums/8702818|title=Single women taking DIY path to motherhood|date=2017-07-21|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention of doctors and others may be seen as making the whole process a respectable and merely a medical procedure which raises no moral issues, where donor inseminations may be referred to as 'treatments' and donor children as 'resulting from the use of a donor's sperm', or 'born following donation' and subsequent children may be described as 'born using the same donor' rather than as biological children of the same male.

A 2009 study has indicated that both men and women view the use of donor sperm with more skepticism compared with the use of donor eggs, suggesting a unique underlying perception regarding the use of male donor gametes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg ML, Smith JF, Millstein SG, Walsh TJ, Breyer BN, Katz PP | title = Perceived negative consequences of donor gametes from male and female members of infertile couples | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 921–6 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 19523614 | pmc = 2888643 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As acceptance of sperm donation has generally increased, so has the level of questioning as to whether 'artificial' means of conception are necessary, and some donor children too, have been critical of the procedures which were taken to bring them into the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Against this background has been the increase in the use of [[Insemination|NI]] as a method of sperm donation. However, while some donors may be willing to offer this as a method of impregnation, it has many critics and it also raises further legal and social challenges.

Some donor children grow up wishing to find out who their fathers were, but others may be wary of embarking on such a search since they fear they may find scores of half-siblings who have been produced from the same sperm donor. Even though local laws or rules may restrict the numbers of offspring from a single donor, there are no worldwide limitations or controls and most sperm banks will [[wikt:onsell|onsell]] and export all their remaining stocks of vials of sperm when local maxima have been attained (see 'onselling' above).

One item of research has suggested that donor children have a greater likelihood of [[substance abuse]], [[mental illness]] and [[criminal]] behavior when grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2256212|title=New study shows sperm-donor kids suffer.|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its motivation and credibility have been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_65970.asp|title=BioNews - 'My Daddy's Name is Donor': Read with caution!|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming forward publicly with problems is difficult for donor-conceived people as these issues are very personal and a public statement may attract criticism. Additionally, it may upset their parents if they speak out. A website called Anonymous Us&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anonymousus.org/stories/index.php?cid=2|title=The Anonymous Us Project: Stories from Donor Conceived|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been set up where they can post details of their experiences anonymously, on which there are many accounts of problems.

==Religious responses==
{{further information|Religious response to assisted reproductive technology}}

There are a wide range of religious responses to sperm donation, with some religious thinkers entirely in support of the use of donor sperm for pregnancy, some who support its use under certain conditions, and some entirely against.

===Catholicism===
Catholicism officially opposes both the donation of sperm and the use of donor sperm on the basis that it compromises the sexual unity of the marital relationship and the idea "that the procreation of a human person be brought about as the fruit of the conjugal act specific to the love between spouses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20081208_dignitas-personae_en.html#_ftnref20 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: Instruction on Dignitas Personae on Certain Bioethical Questions], para. 12, quoting Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Instruction Donum vitae, II, B, 4: AAS 80 (1988), 92., and Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Instruction Donum vitae, Introduction, 3: AAS 80 (1988), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Jewish thinkers hold a broad range of positions on sperm donation. Some Jewish communities are totally against sperm donation from donors that are not the husbands of the recipient, while others have approved the use of donor insemination in some form, while liberal communities accept it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mazornet.com/infertility/insemination.htm Artificial Insemination: Infertility and Judaism]", Mazornet.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorff, Elliot, "[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Bioethics/Fertility_Technology/Artificial_Insemination.shtml Artificial Insemination in Jewish Law]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard V.

Wolowelsky, PhD, "[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/ethic/donor-1.htm Donor Gametes for Assisted Reproduction in Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics]", Assisted Reproduction Reviews 2:3 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] holds that sperm donation from a third party violates the marital bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Woodruff | first=Teresa| name-list-format = vanc | author-link = Teresa Woodruff | title=Oncofertility: Ethical, Legal, Social, and Medical Perspectives| publisher=Springer| year=2010| isbn=1441965173| page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1884, Professor William Pancoast of Philadelphia's Jefferson Medical College performed an insemination on the wife of a sterile Quaker merchant, which may be the first insemination procedure that resulted in the birth of a child. Instead of taking the sperm from the husband, the professor [[Chloroform#Anesthetic|chloroformed]] the woman, then let his medical students vote which one of among them was "best looking", with that elected one providing the sperm that was then syringed into her [[cervix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intent.com/blog/2008/12/07/donor-babies-search-anonymous-fathers Donor Babies Search for the Anonymous Fathers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209025735/http://www.intent.com/blog/2008/12/07/donor-babies-search-anonymous-fathers |date=2008-12-09 }} From: Donorconceived Adult. Posted: Sunday, December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the husband's request, his wife was never told how she became pregnant. As a result of this experiment, the merchant's wife gave birth to a son, who became the first known child by donor insemination. The case was not revealed until 1909, when a letter by Addison Davis Hard appeared in the American journal ''Medical World'', highlighting the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Medical World |date=April 1909 |pages=163–164 |title=Letter to the Editor: Artificial Impregnation |url=http://familyscholars.org/2011/02/17/4579/ |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724221400/http://familyscholars.org/2011/02/17/4579/ |archive-date=2012-07-24 |df= }} (cited in {{cite journal | vauthors = Gregoire AT, Mayer RC | title = The Impregnators.

Since then, a few doctors began to perform private donor insemination. Such procedures were regarded as intensely private, if not secret, by the parties involved. Records were usually not maintained so that donors could not be identified for paternity proceedings. Technology permitted the use of fresh sperm only, and it is thought that sperm largely came from the doctors and their male staff, although occasionally they would engage private donors who were able to donate on short notice on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/whitny-braun/a-doctor-a-quaker-woman-a_b_8891324.html|title=A Doctor, a Quaker Woman and a Galvanized Rubber Syringe: The 19th Century Origins of Artificial Insemination in America|last=Braun|first=Whitny| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-12-31|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, [[Mary Barton (obstetrician)|Mary Barton]] and others published an article in the British Medical Journal on sperm donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barton M, Walker K, Wiesner BP | title = Artificial Insemination | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 4384 | pages = 40–3 | date = January 1945 | pmid = 20785841 | pmc = 2056529 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.4384.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barton, a gynecologist, founded a clinic in London which offered [[Artificial Insemination by Donor|artificial insemination]] using donor sperm for women whose husbands were infertile. This clinic helped conceive 1,500 babies of which Mary Barton's husband, [[Bertold Wiesner|Bertold Weisner]], probably fathered about 600.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9193014/British-man-fathered-600-children-at-own-fertility-clinic.html |title=British man 'fathered 600 children' at own fertility clinic - Telegraph |last=Smith |first=Rebecca | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-10 |website= |publisher=The Telegraph |access-date=2016-10-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810041629/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9193014/British-man-fathered-600-children-at-own-fertility-clinic.html |archive-date=2016-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful human pregnancy using frozen sperm was in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-kramer/a-brief-history-of-donor-conception_b_9814184.html|title=A Brief History of Donor Conception|last=Kramer|first=Wendy| name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-05-10|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ombelet W, Van Robays J | title = Artificial insemination history: hurdles and milestones | journal = Facts, Views &amp; Vision in ObGyn | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–43 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26175891 | pmc = 4498171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Donor insemination remained virtually unknown to the public until 1954".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OBFNCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Donor+insemination+remained+virtually+unknown+to+the+public+until+1954.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rFR4N0PTyz&amp;sig=Wbh_uLfugR1pv2jf-CoKjXVk-_U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiKx63DvpbdAhXMdt4KHSXVCqgQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Donor%20insemination%20remained%20virtually%20unknown%20to%20the%20public%20until%201954.&amp;f=false|title=Hitler's Doubles: Fully-Illustrated|last=Kapnistos|first=Peter Fotis| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-04-08|publisher=Peter Fotis Kapnistos|isbn=9781496071460|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year the first comprehensive account of the process was published in [[The British Medical Journal]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cryobank.com/learning-center/sperm-banking-101/sperm-banking-history/|title=Sperm Banking History {{!}} California Cryobank|website=cryobank.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donor insemination provoked heated public debate. In the United Kingdom, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] established the first in a long procession of commissions that, over the years, inquired into the practice. It was at first condemned by the [[Lambeth Conference]], which recommended that it be made a criminal offence. A Parliamentary Commission agreed. In Italy, the Pope declared donor insemination a sin, and proposed that anyone using the procedure be sent to prison.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Sperm donation gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=sperm%20donation%20&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1;,sperm%20donation;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|author=|date=|work=google.com|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many western countries, sperm donation is now a largely accepted procedure. In the US and elsewhere, there are a large number of [[sperm bank]]s. A sperm bank in the US pioneered the use of on-line search catalogues for donor sperm, and these facilities are now widely available on the websites of sperm banks and fertility clinics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Recent years have also seen sperm donation become relatively less popular among heterosexual couples, who now have access to more sophisticated fertility treatments, and more popular among single women and lesbian couples&lt;ref name = TheTimes/&gt; - whose access to the procedure is relatively new and still prohibited in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/13/fertility-treatment-bans-in-europe-draw-criticism.html|title=Fertility Treatment Bans In Europe Draw Criticism|date=2012-04-13|newspaper=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1954, the Superior Court of [[Cook County, Illinois]] granted a husband a divorce because, regardless of the husband's consent, the woman's donor insemination constituted adultery, and that donor insemination was "contrary to public policy and good morals, and considered adultery on the mother's part." The ruling went on to say that, "A child so conceived, was born out of wedlock and therefore illegitimate. As such, it is the child of the mother, and the father has no rights or interest in said child."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.kentlaw.edu/files/doornbos-v-doornbos-appeal-139-n.e.-2d-844-_1956-1.pdf Doornbos v. Doornbos, 23 U.S.L.W. 2308] (Superior Court, Cook County, Ill., December 13, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the following year, Georgia became the first state to pass a statute legitimizing children conceived by donor insemination, on the condition that both the husband and wife consented in advance in writing to the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0shCDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38&amp;lpg=PT38&amp;dq=Georgia+became+the+first+state+to+pass+a+statute+legitimizing+children+conceived+by+donor+insemination,+on+the+condition+that+both+the+husband+and+wife+consented+in+advance+in+writing+to+the+procedure.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=deRG3UOpE3&amp;sig=Lvqfej8K1YwrZqv7s25itOZa84o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwii7MS6wJbdAhXFFYgKHeb4AUQQ6AEwCXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Georgia%20became%20the%20first%20state%20to%20pass%20a%20statute%20legitimizing%20children%20conceived%20by%20donor%20insemination,%20on%20the%20condition%20that%20both%20the%20husband%20and%20wife%20consented%20in%20advance%20in%20writing%20to%20the%20procedure.&amp;f=false|title=Donor Conception and the Search for Information: From Secrecy and Anonymity to Openness|last=Allan|first=Sonia| name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317177814|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and a year later, the [[American Bar Association]], approved the [[Uniform Parentage Act]]. This act provides that if a wife is artificially inseminated with donor semen under a physician's supervision, and with her husband's consent, the husband is legally considered the natural father of the donor inseminated child. That law was followed by similar legislation in many states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/parentage/upa73.pdf |title=Uniform Parentage Act 1973 |date=1973 |website=Uniform Law Commission |access-date= 31 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the Warnock Committee was formed in July 1982 to consider issues of sperm donation and assisted reproduction techniques.&lt;ref name="hfea.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/1319.html|title=How legislation on fertility treatment developed| work = Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Strategy and Information Directorate |publisher =hfea.gov.uk|access-date=29 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223630/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/1319.html|archive-date=14 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donor insemination was already available in the UK through unregulated clinics such as [[BPAS]]. Many of these clinics had started to offer sperm donation before the widespread use of freezing techniques. 'Fresh sperm' was donated to order by donors at the fertile times of patients requiring treatments. Commonly, infertility of a male partner or sterilisation was a reason for treatment. Donations were anonymous and unregulated.

The Warnock Committee's report was published on July 18, 1984.&lt;ref name="hfea.gov.uk"/&gt; and led to the passing of the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. That act provided for a system of licensing for fertility clinics and procedures. It also provided that, where a male donates sperm at a licensed clinic in the UK and his sperm is used at a UK clinic to impregnate a female, the male is not legally responsible for the resulting child.

The 1990 Act also established a UK central register of donors and donor births to be maintained by the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] (the 'HFEA'), a supervisory body established by the Act. Following the Act, for any act of sperm donation through a licensed UK clinic that results in a living child, information on the child and the donor must be recorded on the register. This measure was intended to reduce the risk of [[consanguinity]] as well as to enforce the limit on the number of births permitted by each donor. The natural child of any donor has access to non-identifying information about their donor, starting at the child's eighteenth birthday.

The emphasis of the 1990 Act was on protecting the unborn child. However, a general shortage of donor sperm at the end of the 20th century, exacerbated by the announcement of the removal of anonymity in the UK, led to concerns about the excessive use of the sperm of some donors. These concerns centered on the export and exchange of donor sperm with overseas clinics, and also the interpretation of the term 'sibling use' to include donated embryos produced from one sperm donor, and successive births by surrogates using eggs from different women but sperm from the same sperm donor. Donors were informed that up to ten births could be produced from their sperm, but the words 'other than in exceptional circumstances' in the consent form could potentially lead to many more pregnancies. These concerns led to the SEED Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/docs/SEEDReport05.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004080621/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/docs/SEEDReport05.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned by the HFEA, which was in turn followed by new legislation and rules meant to protect the interests of donors: When a male donates his sperm through a UK clinic, that sperm is not permitted to give rise to more than ten families total, anywhere in the world.

==International comparison==
{{Further information|Sperm donation laws by country}}
On the global market, Denmark has a well-developed system of sperm export. This success mainly comes from the reputation of Danish sperm donors for being of high [[sperm quality|quality]]&lt;ref name=ncbio/&gt; and, in contrast with the law in the other Nordic countries, gives donors the choice of being either anonymous or non-anonymous to the receiving couple.&lt;ref name=ncbio&gt;[http://www.norden.org/da/publikationer/publikationer/2006-505/at_download/publicationfile Assisted Reproduction in the Nordic Countries] ncbio.org&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Nordic sperm donors tend to be tall, with rarer features like blond hair or different color eyes and a light complexion, and highly educated&lt;ref name=newser&gt;[http://www.newser.com/story/34788/fda-rules-block-import-of-prized-danish-sperm.html FDA Rules Block Import of Prized Danish Sperm] Posted August 13, 08 7:37 AM CDT in World, Science &amp; Health&lt;/ref&gt; and have altruistic motives for their donations,&lt;ref name=newser/&gt; partly due to the relatively low monetary compensation in Nordic countries. More than 50 countries worldwide are importers of Danish sperm, including [[Paraguay]], [[Canada]], [[Kenya]], and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=ncbio/&gt; Several UK clinics also export donor sperm, but they must take steps to ensure that the maximum number of ten families produced from each donor is not exceeded. The use of the sperm outside the UK will also be subject to local rules. Within the EU there are now regulations governing the transfer of human tissue including sperm between member states to ensure that these take place between registered sperm banks. However, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of the US has banned import of any sperm, motivated by a risk of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease|mad cow disease]], although such a risk is insignificant, since artificial insemination is very different from [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease#Transmission|the route of transmission of mad cow disease]].&lt;ref name=kotler&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/the-god-of-sperm/17290/ The God of Sperm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704215550/http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/the-god-of-sperm/17290/ |date=2008-07-04 }} By Steven Kotler&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease#Incidence and prevalence|prevalence of mad cow disease]] is one in a million, probably less for donors. If prevalence was the case, the infectious proteins would then have to cross the [[blood-testis barrier]] to make transmission possible.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt; Transmission of the disease by an insemination is approximately equal to the risk of getting killed by lightning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/09162007/news/regionalnews/a_baby_bjorn_sperm_crisis.htm A 'BABY BJORN' SPERM CRISIS] NEW YORK POST. September 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional representation==
Movie plots involving artificial insemination by donor are seen in ''[[Made in America (1993 film)|Made in America]]'', ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', ''[[The Back-Up Plan]]'', ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'', ''[[The Switch (2010 film)|The Switch]]'', ''[[Starbuck (film)|Starbuck]]'', and ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'', the latter also involving [[surrogacy]].&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/chi-0621-fertility-dramasjun21,0,2997759.story chicagotribune.com --&gt; Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen] Colleen Mastony, ''Chicago Tribune''. June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of [[assisted reproductive technology]] have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s (decade), although the techniques have been available for decades.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt; Yet, the number of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever growing, and the variety of trials and struggles is huge.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt;

A 2012 [[Bollywood]] comedy movie, ''[[Vicky Donor]]'', was based on sperm donation. The film release saw an effect; the number of men donating sperm increased in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharma|first=Radha| name-list-format = vanc |title='Vicky Donor' causes flood of sperm donors|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-07/ahmedabad/31610098_1_sperm-banks-sperm-donors-sperm-donation|access-date=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=7 May 2012|location=Ahmedabad, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Louis Goldman''' (born 1941) is the Andrew W. Mellon Distinguished Professor in the Humanities at [[Lehigh University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VXwlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z_UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5672,576069&amp;dq=steven-l-goldman&amp;hl=en|title=Morning series will explore global issues|date=9 February 1988|work=[[The Washington Afro American]]|page=2D|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short Biography==
Goldman studied as an undergraduate at [[Polytechnic University of New York]], earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics.  He then attended [[Boston University]], where he received Master of Arts and PhD degrees in Philosophy.

In the 1970s, Goldman was on faculty in the philosophy department at the [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] campus of [[Pennsylvania State University]].  At Pennsylvania State, he was involved in the development of one of the first U.S. academic programs in [[Science and technology studies|science, technology, and society studies]] (STS).  In 1977, Goldman joined the faculty at [[Lehigh University]], as Andrew W. Mellon Distinguished Professor in the Humanities.  From 1977-1988 he was the director of the STS program at Lehigh.

Goldman helped found the Lehigh University Press, and is a recipient of the Lindback Distinguished Teaching Award from Lehigh. He is a co-founder of the National Association of Science, Technology, and Society Studies, and has served as a national program consultant for the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].

Goldman is the author/editor of eight books.

==Long Biography==
Steven Goldman has degrees in physics (B.Sc., Polytechnic University of New York) and philosophy
(M.A., Ph.D., Boston University) and, since 1977, has been the Andrew W. Mellon Distinguished
Professor in the Humanities at Lehigh University. 
He has a joint appointment in the departments of philosophy and history because his teaching and research focus on the history, philosophy, and social relations of modern science and technology. Professor Goldman came to Lehigh from the philosophy department at the State College campus of Pennsylvania State University, where he was a co-founder of
one of the first U.S. academic programs in science, technology, and society (STS) studies. For 11 years (1977–1988), he served as director of Lehigh’s STS program and was a co-founder of the National Association of Science, Technology and Society Studies. Professor Goldman has received the Lindback Distinguished Teaching Award from Lehigh University and a Book-of-the-Year Award for a book he coauthored (another book was a finalist and translated into 10 languages). He has been a national lecturer for Sigma Xi—the scientific research society—and a national program consultant for the National Endowment for the Humanities. He has served as a board member or as editor/advisory editor for a number of professional organizations and journals and was a co-founder of Lehigh University Press and, for many years, co-editor of its Research in Technology Studies series.

Since the early 1960s, Professor Goldman has studied the historical development of the conceptual framework of modern science in relation to its Western cultural context, tracing its emergence from medieval and Renaissance approaches to the study of nature through its transformation in the 20th century.

He has published numerous scholarly articles on his social-historical approach to medieval and Renaissance nature philosophy and to modern science from the 17th to the 20th centuries and has lectured on these subjects at conferences and universities across the United States, in Europe, and in Asia. In the late 1970s, the professor began a similar social-historical study of technology and technological innovation since the Industrial Revolution. In the 1980s, he published a series of articles on innovation as a socially driven process and on the role played in that process by the knowledge created by scientists and
engineers. These articles led to participation in science and technology policy initiatives of the federal government, which in turn led to extensive research and numerous article and book publications through the 1990s on emerging synergies that were transforming relationships among knowledge, innovation, and global commerce.

Goldman is the author of the following courses for [[The Teaching Company]]: 
*[[Science in the Twentieth Century: A Social Intellectual Survey]] (2004) 
*[[Science Wars: What Scientists Know and How They Know It]] (2006)
*[[Great Scientific Ideas That Changed the World]] (2007)

'''Sydney Sparkes Orr''' was Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Tasmania]] and the centre of the "Orr case", a celebrated academic scandal of the 1950s.

Born in [[Belfast]] in 1914, Orr achieved a first-class-honours BA in Philosophy and received an MA with special commendation at [[Queen's University of Belfast|Queen's University]] before commencing his teaching career at the [[University of St Andrews]] and the [[University of Melbourne]]. In 1952 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of Tasmania, after falsifying his academic record in his application. In 1955 the University dismissed him for sexual relations with an undergraduate student. He denied the accusation but his appeals to the [[Tasmanian Supreme Court]] and the [[High Court of Australia]] were unsuccessful. Many academics believed Orr had been denied due process and his position was declared "black". Many also thought that Orr had been made a scapegoat due to his openly challenging the University authorities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Martin B ''[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/91kpa.html Knowledge and Power in Academia]'' [[Honi Soit]] 6 August 1991, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Orr died in 1966, shortly after reaching a monetary settlement with the University.

'''''The Copernican Revolution''''' is a 1957 book by the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], in which the author provides an analysis of the [[Copernican Revolution]], documenting the pre-Ptolemaic understanding through the [[Ptolemaic system]] and its variants until the eventual acceptance of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian system]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn&gt;{{cite book

Kuhn argues that the Ptolemaic system provided broader appeal than a simple astronomical system but also became intertwined in broader philosophical and theological beliefs. Kuhn argues that this broader appeal made it more difficult for other systems to be proposed.&lt;ref name=butter&gt;

==Summation==
Kuhn summarized at the end of ''The Copernican Revolution'', citing the permanent achievements of Copernicus and Newton, while comparing the incommensurability of Newtonian physics with Aristotelian concepts that preceded the then new physics. Kuhn also noted that discoveries, such as that produced by Newton, were not in agreement with the prevailing world view during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=westman/&gt;

'''''The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism''''' is a 1993 [[political science]] book by [[L. Susan Brown]]. She begins by noting that [[liberalism]] and [[anarchism]] seem at times to share common components, but on other occasions are in direct opposition to one another. She argues that what they have in common is "existential individualism", the belief in freedom for freedom's sake. However, she notes that in liberal works there exists also an "instrumental individualism", by which she means freedom to satisfy individual interests. Brown argues that the latter annihilates the intentions of the former because it allows individuals the "freedom" to disrupt the freedom of other individuals in its aim of achieving individual goals. On the other hand, instrumental individualism requires some degree of existential individualism to sustain itself.

Next Brown looks at how these ideas of [[individualism]] were used in the [[liberal feminism|liberal feminist]] writings of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Janet Radcliffe Richards]], and [[Carole Pateman]]. She finds that the existential individualism expressed in some passages of these authors writings are effectively countered by notions of instrumental individualism contained elsewhere. Next she looks at how individualism was used by anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]], and sees them as maintaining a consistency of existential individualism. However, she sees this as being less the case for other anarchists, including [[Pierre Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], and [[Murray Bookchin]], who, rather than seeing individuals as [[existentialism|existentially]] free to create their own destiny, devise other means to explain why such a society would work. For instance, she criticizes Kropotkin and Bakunin's efforts to define [[human nature]] as innately cooperative as unnecessary, seeing human nature as inexistent or as socially developed. Brown sees existentialism as a better alternative, because it allows anarchists "to shift the grounds of debate away from 'human nature' with all its attendant problems, toward a consideration of ''how'' we can create freedom for ourselves and others."{{ref|1|1}} She next looks at the existentialist works of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], seeing her overall notion of the world as created by human individuals as compatible with anarchism.

She ends by arguing that anarchism has to be feminist or ceases to be anarchism, and those anarchists who are not feminists only compromise their commitment to anarchism by ignoring the domination of women by men. Brown argues that this is true not only for feminism, but for all forms of [[identity politics]]. Although she does not argue that feminism has to be anarchist, she does say that anarchism has much to offer feminism as a movement. The same, she says, is true for anarchism, which generally does not often take into account feminist ideas of child-raising and education. For instance, the idea of raising children existentially free from their parents and educated nonhierarchically by a community, is an area of thought not often considered by anarchists.

[[File:Triodos Zeist B.jpg|thumb|Triodos bank in [[Zeist]], [[Netherlands]]]]

'''Triodos Bank N.V.''' is a [[bank]] based in the [[Netherlands]] with branches in [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]]. It claims to be a pioneer in [[ethical bank]]ing. Triodos Bank finances companies which it thinks add cultural value and benefit both people and the environment. That includes companies in the fields of solar energy, organic farming or culture. The name Triodos is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "τρὶ ὁδος - tri hodos," meaning "three-way approach" (people, planet, profit). Triodos Bank's balance sheet was worth EUR 5.3 billion by the end of 2012.&lt;ref name="AR2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://report.triodos.com/en/2012/managementreport/results/triodosbankgroup.html | title = Triodos Bank Annual Report 2012 | accessdate = 2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank was founded as an [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] initiative and continues to honor the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]] as the inspiration for its approach to banking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.triodos.co.uk/downloads/articles-of-association-triodos-bank-NV.pdf?audience=About%20Triodos Triodos Bank, Articles of Association 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.triodos.com/downloads/about-triodos-bank/corporate-governance/articles-of-association-triodos-bank.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Savers can open conventional [[savings account]]s, as well as ethical funds and venture capital. Triodos also has an active international department, supporting [[microfinance]] initiatives across the [[developing world]]. Triodos is the only commercial [[bank]] in the UK to provide an annual list of all the [[loans]] the bank has made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/money/banksavingsaccounts.aspx | title = Guide to savings accounts | accessdate = 2012-09-16 | date = February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1980 Triodos launched the first "green fund", a fund for environmentally friendly projects, on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Marco |last=Visscher |url=http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/30/banking_on_change/ |title=Banking on Change |publisher=Odemagazine.com |date=Jan–Feb 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015211122/http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/30/banking_on_change/ |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friends of the Earth]] in the [[Netherlands]] claims that transferring 10,000 euros in savings from a "climate laggard" such as [[ABN Amro]] to Triodos will effectively result in a carbon dioxide emissions saving equivalent to what would be achieved by not driving a car for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Green campaigner sees red over those eco-unfriendly big banks | date= 2007-07-07| publisher= | url =https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/07/ethicalmoney.accounts | work =[[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 2013-08-21| language = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank compensates 100% of its own CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://report.triodos.com/en/2012/ourgroup/abouttriodosbank/keyfigures.html | title = Triodos Bank Annual Report 2012: Key Figures | accessdate = 2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Triodos took over the British ethical bank [[Mercury Provident]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;Paul Gosling, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/ethical-banks-to-merge-1410422.html "Ethical banks to merge"], The Independent, 30 January 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Triodos Bank has 700.000 customers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.triodos.nl/over-triodos-bank|language=nl| title = Over Triodos Bank| accessdate = 2018-11-07 | date = November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank operations and customer relations are mainly based on the web, but adapt to local customs. In Spain, for example, physical offices are preferred by the clients and therefore several commercial offices have been opened in the major towns.

== Policy ==
Triodos Bank maintains the following policy concerning the financial activities and investments:

Triodos is unusual in that it only lends to businesses and charities judged to be of social or ecological benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bankwijzer.be/nl|title=Fair Finance Guide on Triodos (Belgium)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eerlijkegeldwijzer.nl/bankwijzer/banken/triodos-bank/|title=Fair Finance Guide Netherlands on Triodos|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairfinanceguide.de/ffg-d/banken/triodos-bank/|title=Fair Finance Guide Germany on Triodos|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "positive screening" extends its policies beyond those of ethical banks which solely avoid investing in companies judged to be doing harm ("negative screening").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Sandra| last= Haurant| coauthors= | title=Put your money where your mouth is | date= 2004-03-04| publisher= | url =https://www.theguardian.com/money/2004/mar/04/isas.moneyinvestments | work =[[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 2013-08-21 | language = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philanthropy-impact.org/news/triodos-bank-named-%E2%80%98sustainable-bank-year%E2%80%99-ft|title=Triodos Bank named ‘Sustainable Bank of the Year’ by Financial Times (2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank uses money deposited by close to 100,000 savers and lends it to hundreds of organisations, such as [[fair trade]] initiatives, [[organic farming|organic farms]], cultural and arts initiatives, [[renewable energy]] projects, and [[social enterprise]]s.

"[Triodos] does not lend to organisations, businesses and projects that are directly involved for more than 5% of its activities in non-sustainable products and services or non-sustainable working processes.

'''Universal logic''' is the field of [[logic]] that studies the common features of all logical systems, aiming to be to logic what [[universal algebra]] is to [[algebra]]. A number of approaches to universal logic have been proposed since the twentieth century, using [[model theory|model theoretic]], and [[category theory|categorical]] approaches.

== Development ==
The roots of universal logic may go as far back as some work of [[Alfred Tarski]] in the early twentieth century, but the modern notion was first presented in the 1990s by Swiss logician [[Jean-Yves Béziau]].&lt;ref name=road&gt;The Road to Universal Logic: Festschrift for 50th Birthday of Jean-Yves Béziau Volume I,
edited by Arnold Koslow and Arthur Buchsbaum 2014 Birkhäuser {{ISBN|978-3319101927}} pp 2-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Béziau2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jean-Yves Béziau|title=Logica universalis: towards a general theory of logic|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-8353-4|edition=2nd
|url=https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/mathematics/book/978-3-7643-8353-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'universal logic' has also been separately used by logicians such as [[Richard Sylvan]] and [[Ross Brady]] to refer to a new type of (weak) [[relevant logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Brady, R.  2006.  ''Universal Logic''.  Stanford: CSLI Publications.  {{ISBN|1-57586-255-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context defined by Béziau, three main approaches to universal logic have been explored in depth:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Răzvan Diaconescu|title=Institution-independent model theory|year=2008|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-7643-8707-5|pages=2–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEpn60-EDXwC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An [[abstract model theory]] system axiomatized by [[Jon Barwise]],&lt;ref&gt;Jon Barwise. Axioms for abstract model theory. Annals of Mathematical Logic,7:221–265, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[topological]]/categorical approach based on [[Sketch (mathematics)|sketches]] (sometimes called categorical model theory),&lt;ref&gt;Steffen Lewitzka "A Topological Approach to Universal Logic" [[Logica Universalis]] 2007 Birkhauser pp 35-61&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Category theory|categorical]] approach originating in Computer Science based on [[Joseph Goguen|Goguen]] and [[Rod Burstall|Burstall]]'s notion of [[Institution (computer science)|institution]].&lt;ref&gt;Razvan Diaconescu, "Three decades of institution theory"
in Universal Logic: An Anthology edited by Jean-Yves Béziau 2012 Springer
{{ISBN|978-3-0346-0144-3}} pp 309-322&lt;/ref&gt;

While logic has been studied for centuries, Mossakowski et al commented in 2007 that "it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of “a logic”.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;T. Mossakowski, J. A. Goguen, R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", [[Logica Universalis]] 2007 Birkhauser,  pp. 113–133.&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches to universal logic thus aim to address and formalize the nature of what may be called 'logic' as a form of "sound reasoning".&lt;ref name=whatis/&gt;

== World Congresses and Schools on Universal Logic ==

Since 2005, [[Jean-Yves Béziau|Béziau]] has been organizing world congresses and schools on universal logic. These events bring together hundreds of researchers and students in the field and offer tutorials and research talks on a wide range of subjects. Traditionally, the congresses have a contest and a secret speaker whose identity is only revealed when his or her talk begins.
* [http://www.uni-log.org/one1.html First World Congress and School on Universal Logic], 26 March–3 April 2005, [[Montreux, Switzerland]]. Participants included [[Jean-Yves Béziau|Béziau]], [[Dov Gabbay]], and [[David Makinson]]. (Secret Speaker: [[Saul Kripke]].)
* [http://www.uni-log.org/enter2.html Second World Congress and School on Universal Logic], 16–22 August 2007, [[Xi'an, China]].
* [http://www.uni-log.org/enter-lisbon Third World Congress and School on Universal Logic], 18–25 April 2010, [[Lisbon, Portugal]]. (Secret Speaker: [[Jaakko Hintikka]].)
* [http://www.uni-log.org/enter-rio Fourth World Congress and School on Universal Logic], 29 March–7 April 2013, [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]].
* [http://www.uni-log.org/enter-istanbul Fifth World Congress and School on Universal Logic], 20–30 June 2015, [[Istanbul, Turkey]].
* [http://www.uni-log.org/vichy2018 Sixth World Congress and School on Universal Logic], 16–26 June 2018, [[Vichy, France]].

== Publications in the field ==

A journal dedicated to the field, ''[[Logica Universalis]]'', with Béziau as [[editor-in-chief]] started to be published by [[Birkhäuser Basel]] (an imprint of [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/mathematics/journal/11787&lt;/ref&gt; Springer also started to publish a [[book series]] on the topic, ''Studies in Universal Logic'', with Béziau as series editor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/series/7391&lt;/ref&gt;

An anthology titled Universal Logic was published in 2012, giving a new light on the subject.&lt;ref name="Béziau2012"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jean-Yves Béziau|title=Universal Logic: an Anthology - From Paul Hertz to Dov Gabbay|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-0346-0144-3|url=https://www.springer.com/mathematics/book/978-3-0346-0144-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
