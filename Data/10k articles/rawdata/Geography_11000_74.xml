'''Amasia''' is a possible, future [[supercontinent]] that could be formed by the merger of [[Asia]]  and [[North America]]. This prediction relies mostly on the fact that the [[Pacific Plate]] is already [[subduction|subducting]] under [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]], a process which if continued will eventually cause the Pacific to close.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Alasdair. "[http://io9.com/5744636/a-geological-history-of-supercontinents-on-planet-earth A Geological History of Supercontinents on Planet Earth]" at ''io9''. 27 Jan 2011. Accessed 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, because of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[mid-ocean ridge]], North America would be pushed westward. Thus, the Atlantic at some point in the future would be larger than the Pacific. In [[Siberia]], the boundary between the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[North American Plate]]s has been stationary for millions of years. The combination of these factors would cause North America to be combined with Asia, thus forming a supercontinent. A February 2012 study predicts Amasia will form over the North Pole, in about 50 million to 200 million years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith Kerri, [http://www.nature.com/news/supercontinent-amasia-to-take-north-pole-position-1.9996 Supercontinent Amasia to take North Pole Position], Nature.com, 8 Feb 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apamea''' or '''Apameia''' ({{lang-el|Απάμεια}}) was a [[Hellenistic]] city on the left (viz.,the east) bank of the [[Euphrates]], opposite the famous city of [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]], at the end of a bridge of boats (Greek: ''zeugma'') connecting the two, founded by [[Seleucus I Nicator]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], v. 21). The city was rebuilt by [[Seleucus I]]. The site, once partially covered by the village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Tilmusa|tr|3=Tilmusa, Birecik}} (formerly [[Rumkale]]), [[Şanlıurfa Province]], [[Turkey]], is now flooded by the lake formed by the [[Birecik Dam]] (Birejik Dam).&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Apamea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith, William]] (editor); ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064;query=id%3D%23825;layout=;loc=apameia-geo-2 "Apameia"], [[London]], (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient term Zeugma actually referred to the twin cities on the opposing banks of the river. Today the name Zeugma is usually understood to refer to the settlement on the west bank, called Seleucia ({{lang-el|Σελεύκεια}}) after the [[Seleucus I Nicator|founder]], while the one on the East bank was called Apamea after his Persian wife [[Apama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5726/ Archeological Site of Zeugma]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Synclinal perche.jpg|thumb|A [[syncline]] forms this double summit in [[Patagonia]]]]

One well known double summit is [[Austria]]’s highest mountain, the [[Großglockner]], where the main summit of the Großglockner is separated from that of the [[Kleinglockner]] by the Glocknerscharte col in the area of a geological fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geologie.ac.at/SEARCH/BASIS/gbadb1/db1www2/OK_50_1/DDW?W=OK_ID=%27153%27 |publisher=[[Geologische Bundesanstalt]] |title=Geologische Karte der Republik Österreich, 1:50.000, Blatt 153, Wien 1994 |access-date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other double summits have resulted from [[Folding (geology)|geological folding]]. For example, on Mont Withrow in [[British Columbia]] resistant sandstones form the limbs of the double summit, whilst the softer rock in the core of the fold was eroded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/natmap/cf/intro_e.php Mt.

Triple peaks occur more rarely -  one example is the [[Rosengartenspitze]] in the [[Dolomites]]. The [[Illimani]] in Bolivia is an example of a quadruple summit.

'''Doğançay Waterfall''' ({{lang-tr|Doğançay Şelalesi}}) is a [[waterfall]] in [[Sakarya Province]], northwestern Turkey. It is a registered [[natural monument]] of the country.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

The waterfall is located in Maksudiye village of [[Geyve]] district in Sakarya Province. It is {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from [[Adapazarı]] and {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Sakarya-[[Bilecik]] highway {{TUR-D|650}}.&lt;ref name="sosim"/&gt;

On May 13, 2013, the waterfall and its surroundings covering an area of {{convert|42.33|da|sqft|abbr=on}}, was registered as natural monument of the country by the Nature Reserve and Nature Parks Administration of the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]].&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sosim"/&gt;

{{short description|System to capture, manage and present geographic data}}

A '''geographic information system''' ('''GIS''') is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or [[geographic data and information|geographic data]]. GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, K. C., 1986. Advances in geographic information systems, computers, environment and urban systems, Vol. 10, pp. 175–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maliene V, Grigonis V, Palevičius V, Griffiths S 2011 1–6"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.palgrave-journals.com/udi/journal/v16/n1/abs/udi201025a.html | vauthors=Maliene V, Grigonis V, Palevičius V, Griffiths S|title=Geographic information system: Old principles with new capabilities |journal=Urban Design International |volume=16 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–6 |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1057/udi.2010.25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS (more commonly GIScience) sometimes refers to  [[Geographic information science|geographic information science (GIScience)]],  the science underlying geographic concepts, applications, and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.5311/JOSIS.2010.1.2|title=Twenty years of progress: GIScience in 2010|year=2010|last1=Goodchild|first1=Michael F|journal=Journal of Spatial Information Science|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GIS can refer to a number of different technologies, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications related to engineering, planning, management, transport/logistics, insurance, telecommunications, and business.&lt;ref name="Maliene V, Grigonis V, Palevičius V, Griffiths S 2011 1–6"/&gt; For that reason, GIS and [[location intelligence]] applications can be the foundation for many location-enabled services that rely on analysis and visualization.

GIS can relate unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. Locations or extents in the Earth [[space–time]] may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z [[coordinate]]s representing, [[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[elevation (geography)|elevation]], respectively. All Earth-based spatial–temporal location and extent references should be relatable to one another and ultimately to a "real" physical location or extent. This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry.

==History of development==
The first known use of the term "geographic information system" was by [[Roger Tomlinson]] in the year 1968 in his paper "A Geographic Information System for Regional Planning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 50th Anniversary of GIS|url=http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/fall12articles/the-fiftieth-anniversary-of-gis.html|publisher=ESRI|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomlinson is also acknowledged as the "father of GIS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!-- no author given --&gt; |url=http://ucgis.org/ucgis-fellow/roger-tomlinson |title=Roger Tomlinson |publisher=UCGIS |date=2014-02-21 |accessdate=2015-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217012639/http://ucgis.org/ucgis-fellow/roger-tomlinson |archivedate=2015-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Snow-cholera-map.jpg|thumb|right|300px| [[E. W. Gilbert]]'s version (1958) of [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s 1855&amp;nbsp;map of the [[Soho]] [[cholera]] outbreak showing the clusters of cholera cases in the [[London]] epidemic of 1854]]
Previously, one of the first applications of spatial analysis in [[epidemiology]] is the 1832 "''Rapport sur la marche et les effets du choléra dans Paris et le département de la [[Seine]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k842918/f353.image|title=Rapport sur la marche et les effets du choléra dans Paris et le département de la Seine. Année 1832|publisher=Gallica|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French geographer Charles Picquet represented the 48&amp;nbsp;districts of the city of [[Paris]] by halftone color gradient according to the number of deaths by [[cholera]] per&amp;nbsp;1,000&amp;nbsp;inhabitants. In 1854 [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] determined the source of a [[cholera]] outbreak in [[London]] by marking points on a map depicting where the cholera victims lived, and connecting the cluster that he found with a nearby water source. This was one of the earliest successful uses of a geographic methodology in epidemiology. While the basic elements of [[topography]] and theme existed previously in [[cartography]], the John Snow map was unique, using cartographic methods not only to depict but also to analyze clusters of geographically dependent phenomena.

The early&amp;nbsp;20th&amp;nbsp;century saw the development of [[photozincography]], which allowed maps to be split into layers, for example one layer for vegetation and another for water. This was particularly used for printing contours&amp;nbsp;– drawing these was a labour-intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on without the other layers to confuse the [[draughtsman]]. This work was originally drawn on glass plates but later [[plastic film]] was introduced, with the advantages of being lighter, using less storage space and being less brittle, among others. When all the layers were finished, they were combined into one image using a large process camera. Once color printing came in, the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates for each color. While the use of layers much later became one of the main typical features of a contemporary GIS, the photographic process just described is not considered to be a GIS in itself&amp;nbsp;– as the maps were just images with no database to link them to.

[[Computer hardware]] development spurred by [[nuclear weapon]] research led to general-purpose computer "mapping" applications by the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="map_printing_methods"&gt;{{cite web

The year 1960 saw the development of the world's first true operational GIS in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, by the federal Department of Forestry and Rural Development. Developed by Dr. [[Roger Tomlinson]], it was called the [[Canada Geographic Information System]]&amp;nbsp;(CGIS) and was used to store, analyze, and manipulate data collected for the [[Canada Land Inventory]]&amp;nbsp;– an effort to determine the land capability for rural Canada by mapping information about [[soil]]s, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, [[waterfowl]], [[forestry]] and land use at a scale of 1:50,000. A rating classification factor was also added to permit analysis.

CGIS was an improvement over "computer mapping" applications as it provided capabilities for overlay, measurement, and [[digitizing]]/scanning. It supported a national coordinate system that spanned the continent, coded lines as [[Directed edge|arcs]] having a true embedded [[topology]] and it stored the attribute and locational information in separate files. As a result of this, Tomlinson has become known as the "father of GIS", particularly for his use of overlays in promoting the spatial analysis of convergent geographic data.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CGIS lasted into the 1990s and built a large digital land resource database in Canada. It was developed as a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]-based system in support of federal and provincial resource planning and management. Its strength was continent-wide analysis of complex [[data set|dataset]]s. The CGIS was never available commercially.

In&amp;nbsp;1964 Howard T. Fisher formed the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (LCGSA 1965–1991), where a number of important theoretical concepts in spatial data handling were developed, and which by the 1970s had distributed seminal software code and systems, such as SYMAP, GRID, and ODYSSEY&amp;nbsp;– that served as sources for subsequent commercial development—to universities, research centers and corporations worldwide.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite web

By the late 1970s two public domain GIS systems ([[Map Overlay and Statistical System|MOSS]] and [[GRASS GIS]]) were in development, and by the early 1980s, M&amp;S Computing (later [[Intergraph]]) along with Bentley Systems Incorporated for the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]&amp;nbsp;platform, Environmental Systems Research Institute ([[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]), [[Teledyne CARIS|CARIS]]&amp;nbsp;(Computer Aided Resource Information System), [[MapInfo Corporation]] and ERDAS&amp;nbsp;(Earth Resource Data Analysis System) emerged as commercial vendors of GIS&amp;nbsp;software, successfully incorporating many of the CGIS&amp;nbsp;features, combining the first generation approach to separation of spatial and attribute information with a second generation approach to organizing attribute data into database structures.&lt;ref name="wiki.osgeo.org"&gt;{{cite web

In 1986, Mapping Display and Analysis System (MIDAS), the first desktop GIS product{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} was released for the [[DOS]] operating system. This was renamed in 1990 to MapInfo for Windows when it was ported to the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform. This began the process of moving GIS from the research department into the business environment.

By the end of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the rapid growth in various systems had been consolidated and standardized on relatively few platforms and users were beginning to explore viewing GIS&amp;nbsp;data over the [[Internet]], requiring data format and transfer standards. More recently, a growing number of [[List of GIS software#Open source software|free, open-source GIS packages]] run on a range of operating systems and can be customized to perform specific tasks. Increasingly [[List of GIS data sources|geospatial data]] and [[Web mapping|mapping applications]] are being made available via the [[World Wide Web]] (see {{section link|List of GIS software|GIS as a service}}).&lt;ref&gt;Fu, P., and J. Sun. 2010. ''Web GIS: Principles and Applications''. ESRI Press. Redlands, CA. {{ISBN|1-58948-245-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several articles on the history of GIS have been published.&lt;ref name=Foresman&gt;Tim Foresman 1997 The History of GIS (Geographic Information Systems): Perspectives from the Pioneers.

==Techniques and technology==
Modern GIS technologies use digital information, for which various digitized data creation methods are used. The most common method of data creation is [[Digitizing|digitization]], where a [[hard copy]] map or survey plan is transferred into a digital medium through the use of a CAD program, and geo-referencing capabilities. With the wide availability of [[Orthophoto|ortho-rectified imagery]] (from satellites, aircraft, Helikites and UAVs), heads-up digitizing is becoming the main avenue through which geographic data is extracted. Heads-up digitizing involves the tracing of geographic data directly on top of the aerial imagery instead of by the traditional method of tracing the geographic form on a separate [[Graphics tablet|digitizing tablet]] (heads-down digitizing).{{clarify|date=August 2014}}

===Relating information from different sources===
GIS uses spatio-temporal ([[space-time]]) location as the key index variable for all other information. Just as a relational database containing text or numbers can relate many different tables using common key index variables, GIS can relate otherwise unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. The key is the location and/or extent in space-time.

Any variable that can be located spatially, and increasingly also temporally, can be referenced using a GIS. Locations or extents in Earth space–time may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z [[coordinate]]s representing, [[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[elevation (geography)|elevation]], respectively. These GIS coordinates may represent other quantified systems of temporo-spatial reference (for example, film frame number, stream gage station, highway mile-marker, surveyor benchmark, building address, street intersection, entrance gate, water depth sounding, [[Point of sale|POS]] or [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawing origin/units). Units applied to recorded temporal-spatial data can vary widely (even when using exactly the same data, see [[map projection]]s), but all Earth-based spatial–temporal location and extent references should, ideally, be relatable to one another and ultimately to a "real" physical location or extent in space–time.

Related by accurate spatial information, an incredible variety of real-world and projected past or future data can be analyzed, interpreted and represented.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen 1988 "GIS VERSUS CAD VERSUS DBMS: WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES ?" ''PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING &amp; REMOTE SENSING'' Vol. 54, No.11, November 1988, pp. 1551–1555. {{cite web |url=http://funk.on.br/esantos/doutorado/GEO/igce/DBMS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424091317/http://funk.on.br/esantos/doutorado/GEO/igce/DBMS.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-24 |df= }} last retrieved 9/17/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry into behaviors and patterns of real-world information that previously had not been systematically [[correlation|correlated]].

===GIS uncertainties===
GIS accuracy depends upon source data, and how it is encoded to be data referenced. Land surveyors have been able to provide a high level of positional accuracy utilizing the [[GPS]]-derived positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/accuracy/part3/chapter3&lt;/ref&gt; High-resolution digital terrain and aerial imagery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://njgin.state.nj.us/NJ_NJGINExplorer/IW.jsp |title=NJGIN's Information Warehouse |publisher=Njgin.state.nj.us |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; powerful computers and Web technology are changing the quality, utility, and expectations of GIS to serve society on a grand scale, but nevertheless there are other source data that affect overall GIS accuracy like paper maps, though these may be of limited use in achieving the desired accuracy.

In developing a digital topographic database for a GIS, [[topographical map]]s are the main source, and [[aerial photography]] and [[satellite imagery]] are extra sources for collecting data and identifying attributes which can be mapped in layers over a location facsimile of scale. The scale of a map and geographical rendering area representation type{{clarify|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--[[Map projection]]?--&gt; are very important aspects since the information content depends mainly on the scale set and resulting locatability of the map's representations. In order to digitize a map, the map has to be checked within theoretical dimensions, then scanned into a raster format, and resulting raster data has to be given a theoretical dimension by a [[rubber]] sheeting/warping technology process.

A quantitative analysis of maps brings accuracy issues into focus. The electronic and other equipment used to make measurements for GIS is far more precise than the machines of conventional map analysis. All geographical data are inherently inaccurate, and these inaccuracies will propagate through GIS&amp;nbsp;operations in ways that are difficult to predict.

===Data representation===
{{Main|GIS file formats}}
GIS data represents real objects (such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, etc.) with digital data determining the mix. Real objects can be divided into two abstractions: discrete objects (e.g., a house) and continuous fields (such as rainfall amount, or elevations). Traditionally, there are two broad methods used to store data in a GIS for both kinds of abstractions mapping references: [[raster images]] and [[Vector graphics|vector]]. Points, lines, and polygons are the stuff of mapped location attribute references. A new hybrid method of storing data is that of identifying point clouds, which combine three-dimensional points with [[RGB]] information at each point, returning a "[[Anaglyph 3D|3D color image]]". GIS thematic maps then are becoming more and more realistically visually descriptive of what they set out to show or determine.

For a list of popular GIS file formats, such as [[shapefile]]s, see {{section link|GIS file formats|Popular GIS file formats}}.

===Data capture===
[[File:Field-Map birdie.jpg|thumb|right|Example of hardware for mapping ([[GPS]] and [[laser rangefinder]]) and data collection ([[rugged computer]]). The current trend for geographical information system (GIS) is that accurate mapping and data analysis are completed while in the field. Depicted hardware ([[field-map]] technology) is used mainly for [[forest inventory|forest inventories]], monitoring and mapping.]]
Data capture—entering information into the system—consumes much of the time of GIS&amp;nbsp;practitioners. There are a variety of methods used to enter data into a GIS where it is stored in a digital format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Xiangyu Wang|title=Trends and Opportunities of BIM-GIS Integration in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry: A Review from a Spatio-Temporal Statistical Perspective|journal=ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.|volume=6|issue=12|pages=397|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/12/397|doi=10.3390/ijgi6120397|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing data printed on paper or [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] maps can be [[digitizer|digitized]] or scanned to produce digital data. A digitizer produces [[Vector graphics|vector]] data as an operator traces points, lines, and polygon boundaries from a map. [[Image scanner|Scanning]] a map results in raster data that could be further processed to produce vector data.

[[Surveying|Survey]] data can be directly entered into a GIS from digital data collection systems on survey instruments using a technique called [[Analytic geometry|coordinate geometry (COGO)]]. Positions from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like [[Global Positioning System]] can also be collected and then imported into a GIS. A current trend in data collection gives users the ability to utilize [[Rugged computer|field computers]] with the ability to edit live data using wireless connections or disconnected editing sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Hiscock|first2=Peter|last3=Sullivan|first3=Marjorie|last4=Hughes|first4=Philip|title=Landform boundary effects on Holocene forager landscape use in arid South Australia|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume=19|pages=864–874|date=July 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been enhanced by the availability of low-cost mapping-grade GPS units with decimeter accuracy in real time. This eliminates the need to post process, import, and update the data in the office after fieldwork has been collected. This includes the ability to incorporate positions collected using a [[laser rangefinder]]. New technologies also allow users to create maps as well as analysis directly in the field, making projects more efficient and mapping more accurate.

[[Remote sensing|Remotely sensed]] data also plays an important role in data collection and consist of sensors attached to a platform. Sensors include cameras, digital scanners and [[lidar]], while platforms usually consist of aircraft and [[satellite]]s. In England in the mid 1990s, hybrid kite/balloons called [[Allsopp Helikite|helikites]] first pioneered the use of compact airborne digital cameras as airborne geo-information systems. Aircraft measurement software, accurate to 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm was used to link the photographs and measure the ground. Helikites are inexpensive and gather more accurate data than aircraft. Helikites can be used over roads, railways and towns where [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) are banned.

Recently aerial data collection is becoming possible with [[miniature UAV]]s. For example, the [[Aeryon Scout]] was used to map a 50-acre&amp;nbsp;area with a [[ground sample distance]] of {{convert|1|in|cm|2}} in only 12&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/pressreleases/248-softwareversion5.html|title=Aeryon Announces Version 5 of the Aeryon Scout System &amp;#124; Aeryon Labs Inc |publisher=Aeryon.com |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of digital data currently comes from [[photo interpretation]] of aerial photographs. Soft-copy workstations are used to digitize features directly from [[Stereoscopy|stereo pairs]] of digital photographs. These systems allow data to be captured in two and three dimensions, with elevations measured directly from a stereo pair using principles of [[photogrammetry]]. Analog aerial photos must be scanned before being entered into a soft-copy system, for high-quality digital cameras this step is skipped.

Satellite [[remote sensing]] provides another important source of spatial data. Here satellites use different sensor packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] or radio waves that were sent out from an active sensor such as radar. Remote sensing collects raster data that can be further processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest, such as land cover.

When data is captured, the user should consider if the data should be captured with either a relative accuracy or absolute accuracy, since this could not only influence how information will be interpreted but also the cost of data capture.

After entering data into a GIS, the data usually requires editing, to remove errors, or further processing. For vector data it must be made "topologically correct" before it can be used for some advanced analysis. For example, in a road network, lines must connect with nodes at an intersection. Errors such as undershoots and overshoots must also be removed. For scanned maps, blemishes on the source map may need to be removed from the resulting [[Raster graphics|raster]]. For example, a fleck of dirt might connect two lines that should not be connected.

===Raster-to-vector translation===
Data restructuring can be performed by a GIS to convert data into different formats. For example, a GIS may be used to convert a satellite image map to a vector structure by generating lines around all cells with the same classification, while determining the cell spatial relationships, such as adjacency or inclusion.

More advanced data processing can occur with [[image processing]], a technique developed in the late&amp;nbsp;1960s by [[NASA]] and the private sector to provide contrast enhancement, false color rendering and a variety of other techniques including use of two dimensional [[Fourier transforms]]. Since digital data is collected and stored in various ways, the two data sources may not be entirely compatible. So a GIS must be able to convert [[geographic data]] from one structure to another. In so doing, the implicit assumptions behind different ontologies and classifications require analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus G. (2014) "Mapping Kinds in GIS and Cartography" in ''Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice'', edited by C. Kendig http://philpapers.org/archive/WINMKI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Object ontologies have gained increasing prominence as a consequence of [[object-oriented programming]] and sustained work by [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and co-workers.

===Projections, coordinate systems, and registration===
{{Main|Map projection}}
The earth can be represented by various models, each of which may provide a different set of coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, elevation) for any given point on the Earth's surface. The simplest model is to assume the earth is a perfect sphere. As more measurements of the earth have accumulated, the models of the earth have become more sophisticated and more accurate. In fact, there are models called [[datum (geodesy)|datums]] that apply to different areas of the earth to provide increased accuracy, like [[NAD83]] for U.S. measurements, and the [[World Geodetic System]] for worldwide measurements.

==Spatial analysis with geographical information system (GIS){{anchor|Spatial analysis}}==
{{further|Spatial analysis}}

GIS spatial analysis is a rapidly changing field, and GIS packages are increasingly including analytical tools as standard built-in facilities, as optional toolsets, as add-ins or 'analysts'. In many instances these are provided by the original software suppliers (commercial vendors or collaborative non commercial development teams), while in other cases facilities have been developed and are provided by third parties. Furthermore, many products offer software development kits (SDKs), programming languages and language support, scripting facilities and/or special interfaces for developing one's own analytical tools or variants. The increased availability has created a new dimension to [[business intelligence]] termed "[[Spatial intelligence (business method)|spatial intelligence]]" which, when openly delivered via intranet, democratizes access to geographic and social network data. [[Geospatial intelligence]], based on GIS spatial analysis, has also become a key element for security. GIS as a whole can be described as conversion to a vectorial representation or to any other digitisation process.

===Slope and aspect===
[[Grade (slope)|Slope]] can be defined as the steepness or gradient of a unit of terrain, usually measured as an angle in degrees or as a percentage. [[Aspect (geography)|Aspect]] can be defined as the direction in which a unit of terrain faces. Aspect is usually expressed in degrees from north. Slope, aspect, and surface curvature in terrain analysis are all derived from neighborhood operations using elevation values of a cell's adjacent neighbours.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book

The following method can be used to derive slope and aspect:
&lt;br /&gt;
The elevation at a point or unit of terrain will have perpendicular tangents (slope) passing through the point, in an east-west and north-south direction. These two tangents give two components, ∂z/∂x and ∂z/∂y, which then be used to determine the overall direction of slope, and the aspect of the slope. The gradient is defined as a vector quantity with components equal to the partial derivatives of the surface in the x and y directions.&lt;ref name=Hunter1997&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1538-4632.1997.tb00944.x |author1 = Hunter G.

The calculation of the overall 3x3 grid slope ''S'' and aspect ''A'' for methods that determine east-west and north-south component use the following formulas respectively:

&lt;math&gt;\tan S = \sqrt{\left (\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right )^2 + \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right )^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tan A = \left ({\frac{\left ({\frac{-\partial z}{\partial y}}\right )}{\left ({\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}}\right )}}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

Zhou and Liu&lt;ref name="zhou2003"/&gt; describe another formula for calculating aspect, as follows:

&lt;math&gt;A = 270^\circ + \arctan \left ({\frac{\left ({\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}}\right )}{\left ({\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}}\right )}}\right ) - 90^\circ \left ({\frac {\left ({\frac {\partial z}{\partial y}}\right )}{\left |{\frac {\partial z}{\partial y}}\right |}}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

===Data analysis===
It is difficult to relate [[wetlands]] maps to [[rainfall]] amounts recorded at different points such as airports, television stations, and schools. A GIS, however, can be used to depict two- and three-dimensional characteristics of the Earth's surface, subsurface, and atmosphere from information points. For example, a GIS can quickly generate a map with [[isopleth]] or [[contour line]]s that indicate differing amounts of rainfall. Such a map can be thought of as a rainfall contour map. Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements. A two-dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a GIS covering the same area. This GIS derived map can then provide additional information - such as the viability of [[water power]] potential as a [[renewable energy]] source. Similarly, GIS can be used to compare other [[renewable energy]] resources to find the best geographic potential for a region.&lt;ref&gt;K. Calvert, J. M. Pearce, W.E. Mabee, "Toward renewable energy geo-information infrastructures: Applications of GIScience and remote sensing that can build institutional capacity" ''Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews'' '''18''', pp. 416–429 (2013). [https://www.academia.edu/2180165/Toward_renewable_energy_geo-information_infrastructures_Applications_of_GIScience_and_remote_sensing_that_build_institutional_capacity open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, from a series of three-dimensional points, or [[digital elevation model]], isopleth lines representing elevation contours can be generated, along with slope analysis, [[shaded relief]], and other elevation products. Watersheds can be easily defined for any given reach, by computing all of the areas contiguous and uphill from any given point of interest. Similarly, an expected [[thalweg]] of where surface water would want to travel in intermittent and permanent streams can be computed from elevation data in the GIS.

===Topological modeling===
A GIS can recognize and analyze the spatial relationships that exist within digitally stored spatial data. These [[topological]] relationships allow complex spatial modelling and analysis to be performed. Topological relationships between geometric entities traditionally include adjacency (what adjoins what), containment (what encloses what), and proximity (how close something is to something else).

===Geometric networks===
[[Geometric networks]] are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features, and to perform special spatial analysis on them. A geometric network is composed of edges, which are connected at junction points, similar to [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] in mathematics and computer science. Just like graphs, networks can have weight and flow assigned to its edges, which can be used to represent various interconnected features more accurately. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and [[public utility]] networks, such as electric, gas, and water networks. Network modeling is also commonly employed in [[transportation planning]], [[hydrology]] modeling, and [[infrastructure]] modeling.

===Hydrological modeling===
GIS hydrological models can provide a spatial element that other hydrological models lack, with the analysis of variables such as slope, aspect and watershed or [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]].&lt;ref name="Heywood"&gt;{{cite book
  |vauthors=Heywood I, Cornelius S, Carver S

  |edition = 3rd
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology, since water always flows down a slope.&lt;ref name="Heywood" /&gt; As basic terrain analysis of a [[digital elevation model|digital elevation model (DEM)]] involves calculation of slope and aspect, DEMs are very useful for hydrological analysis. Slope and aspect can then be used to determine direction of surface runoff, and hence flow accumulation for the formation of streams, rivers and lakes. Areas of divergent flow can also give a clear indication of the boundaries of a catchment. Once a flow direction and accumulation matrix has been created, queries can be performed that show contributing or dispersal areas at a certain point.&lt;ref name="Heywood" /&gt; More detail can be added to the model, such as terrain roughness, vegetation types and soil types, which can influence infiltration and evapotranspiration rates, and hence influencing surface flow. One of the main uses of hydrological modeling is in [[GIS in Environmental Contamination|environmental contamination research]]. Other applications of hydrological modeling include [[GIS and hydrology|groundwater and surface water mapping]], as well as flood risk maps.

===Cartographic modeling===
[[File:gislayers.jpg|300px|right|thumb| An example of use of layers in a GIS application. In this example, the forest-cover layer (light green) forms the bottom layer, with the topographic layer (contour lines) over it. Next up is a standing water layer (pond, lake) and then a flowing water layer (stream, river), followed by the boundary layer and finally the road layer on top. The order is very important in order to properly display the final result. Note that the ponds are layered under the streams, so that a stream line can be seen overlying one of the ponds.]]

[[Dana Tomlin]] probably coined the term "cartographic modeling" in his PhD dissertation (1983); he later used it in the title of his book, ''Geographic Information Systems and Cartographic Modeling'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Cartographic modeling refers to a process where several thematic [[layer (disambiguation)|layers]] of the same area are produced, processed, and analyzed. Tomlin used raster layers, but the overlay method (see below) can be used more generally. Operations on map layers can be combined into algorithms, and eventually into simulation or optimization models.

===Map overlay===
The combination of several spatial datasets (points, lines, or [[polygons]]) creates a new output vector dataset, visually similar to stacking several maps of the same region. These overlays are similar to mathematical [[Venn diagram]] overlays. A [[union (set theory)|union]] overlay combines the geographic features and attribute tables of both inputs into a single new output. An [[intersection (set theory)|intersect]] overlay defines the area where both inputs overlap and retains a set of attribute fields for each. A [[symmetric difference]] overlay defines an output area that includes the total area of both inputs except for the overlapping area.

Data extraction is a GIS process similar to vector overlay, though it can be used in either vector or raster data analysis. Rather than combining the properties and features of both datasets, data extraction involves using a "clip" or "mask" to extract the features of one data set that fall within the spatial extent of another dataset.

In raster data analysis, the overlay of datasets is accomplished through a process known as "local operation on multiple rasters" or "[[map algebra]]", through a function that combines the values of each raster's [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. This function may weigh some inputs more than others through use of an "index model" that reflects the influence of various factors upon a geographic phenomenon.

===Geostatistics===
{{Main|Geostatistics}}

[[Geostatistics]] is a branch of statistics that deals with field data, spatial data with a continuous index. It provides methods to model spatial correlation, and predict values at arbitrary locations (interpolation).

When phenomena are measured, the observation methods dictate the accuracy of any subsequent analysis. Due to the nature of the data (e.g. traffic patterns in an urban environment; weather patterns over the [[Pacific Ocean]]), a constant or dynamic degree of precision is always lost in the measurement. This loss of precision is determined from the scale and distribution of the data collection.

To determine the statistical relevance of the analysis, an average is determined so that points (gradients) outside of any immediate measurement can be included to determine their predicted behavior. This is due to the limitations of the applied statistic and data collection methods, and interpolation is required to predict the behavior of particles, points, and locations that are not directly measurable.

[[File:Dem.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hillshade model derived from a [[Digital Elevation Model]] of the Valestra area in the northern Apennines (Italy)]][[Interpolation]] is the process by which a surface is created, usually a raster dataset, through the input of data collected at a number of sample points. There are several forms of interpolation, each which treats the data differently, depending on the properties of the data set. In comparing interpolation methods, the first consideration should be whether or not the source data will change (exact or approximate). Next is whether the method is subjective, a human interpretation, or objective. Then there is the nature of transitions between points: are they abrupt or gradual. Finally, there is whether a method is global (it uses the entire data set to form the model), or local where an algorithm is repeated for a small section of terrain.

Interpolation is a justified measurement because of a spatial autocorrelation principle that recognizes that data collected at any position will have a great similarity to, or influence of those locations within its immediate vicinity.

[[Digital elevation model]]s, [[triangulated irregular network]]s, edge-finding algorithms, [[Thiessen polygons]], [[Fourier analysis]], [[Weighted moving average|(weighted) moving averages]], [[inverse distance weighting]], [[kriging]], [[Spline (mathematics)|spline]], and [[Trend estimation|trend surface analysis]] are all mathematical methods to produce interpolative data.

===Address geocoding===
{{Main|Geocoding}}
Geocoding is interpolating spatial locations (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or any other spatially referenced data such as [[ZIP&amp;nbsp;Code]]s, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to [[Geocoding|geocode]] individual addresses, such as a road centerline file with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided in the form of a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address&amp;nbsp;1 and ends with address&amp;nbsp;1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.

===Reverse geocoding===
Reverse geocoding is the process of returning an estimated [[street address]] number as it relates to a given coordinate. For example, a user can click on a road centerline theme (thus providing a coordinate) and have information returned that reflects the estimated house number. This house number is interpolated from a range assigned to that road segment. If the user clicks at the [[midpoint]] of a segment that starts with address&amp;nbsp;1 and ends with&amp;nbsp;100, the returned value will be somewhere near 50. Note that reverse geocoding does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range.

===Multi-criteria decision analysis===
Coupled with GIS, [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] methods support decision-makers in analysing a set of alternative spatial solutions, such as the most likely ecological habitat for restoration, against multiple criteria, such as vegetation cover or roads. MCDA uses decision rules to aggregate the criteria, which allows the alternative solutions to be ranked or prioritised.&lt;ref name='Greene'&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greene | first1 = R. | last2 = Devillers | first2 = R. | last3 = Luther | first3 = J.E. | last4 = Eddy | first4 = B.G. | title = GIS-based multi-criteria analysis | journal = Geography Compass | year = 2011 | volume = 5/6 | pages = 412–432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS MCDA may reduce costs and time involved in identifying potential restoration sites.

===Data output and cartography===
[[Cartography]] is the design and production of maps, or visual representations of spatial data. The vast majority of modern cartography is done with the help of computers, usually using GIS but production of quality cartography is also achieved by importing layers into a design program to refine it. Most GIS&amp;nbsp;software gives the user substantial control over the appearance of the data.

Cartographic work serves two major functions:

First, it produces graphics on the screen or on paper that convey the results of analysis to the people who make decisions about resources. Wall maps and other graphics can be generated, allowing the viewer to visualize and thereby understand the results of analyses or simulations of potential events. [[Web Map Server]]s facilitate distribution of generated maps through web browsers using various implementations of web-based application programming interfaces ([[AJAX]], [[Java programming|Java]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], etc.).

Second, other database information can be generated for further analysis or use. An example would be a list of all addresses within one&amp;nbsp;mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) of a toxic spill.

===Graphic display techniques===
Traditional maps are abstractions of the real world, a sampling of important elements portrayed on a sheet of paper with symbols to represent physical objects. People who use maps must interpret these symbols. [[Topographic map]]s show the shape of land surface with [[contour line]]s or with [[Cartographic relief depiction|shaded relief]].

Today, graphic display techniques such as [[shading]] based on [[altitude]] in a GIS can make relationships among map elements visible, heightening one's ability to extract and analyze information. For example, two types of data were combined in a GIS to produce a perspective view of a portion of [[San&amp;nbsp;Mateo County]], [[California]].
*The [[digital elevation model]], consisting of surface elevations recorded on a 30-meter horizontal grid, shows high elevations as white and low elevation as black.
*The accompanying [[Landsat]] Thematic Mapper image shows a false-color infrared image looking down at the same area in 30-meter&amp;nbsp;pixels, or picture elements, for the same coordinate points, pixel&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;pixel, as the elevation information.

A GIS was used to register and combine the two images to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the three-dimensional [[perspective view]] looking down the [[San Andreas Fault]], using the Thematic Mapper image pixels, but shaded using the elevation of the [[landform]]s. The GIS&amp;nbsp;display depends on the viewing point of the [[observation|observer]] and time of day of the display, to properly render the shadows created by the sun's rays at that latitude, longitude, and time of day.

An archeochrome is a new way of displaying spatial data. It is a thematic on a 3D&amp;nbsp;map that is applied to a specific building or a part of a building. It is suited to the visual display of heat-loss data.

===Spatial ETL===
[[Spatial ETL]] tools provide the data processing functionality of traditional [[extract, transform, load]]&amp;nbsp;(ETL) software, but with a primary focus on the ability to manage spatial data. They provide GIS&amp;nbsp;users with the ability to translate data between different standards and proprietary formats, whilst geometrically transforming the data en route. These tools can come in the form of add-ins to existing wider-purpose software such as [[spreadsheet]]s.

===GIS data mining===
GIS or spatial [[data mining]] is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. Data mining, which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases, offers great potential benefits for applied GIS-based&amp;nbsp;decision&amp;nbsp;making. Typical applications include environmental monitoring. A characteristic of such applications is that spatial correlation between data measurements require the use of specialized algorithms for more efficient data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Guo | first2 = Y. | last3 = Tian | first3 = X. | last4 = Ghanem | first4 = M. | title = Distributed Clustering-Based Aggregation Algorithm for Spatial Correlated Sensor Networks | doi = 10.1109/JSEN.2010.2056916 | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | page = 641 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://www.inf.ufpr.br/carmem/oficinaBD/artigos1s2014/dist-clustering.pdf | bibcode = 2011ISenJ..11..641M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The implementation of a GIS is often driven by jurisdictional (such as a city), purpose, or application requirements. Generally, a GIS implementation may be custom-designed for an organization. Hence, a GIS deployment developed for an application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose may not be necessarily [[Interoperability|interoperable]] or compatible with a GIS that has been developed for some other application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) is an international industry consortium of 384&amp;nbsp;companies, government agencies, universities, and individuals participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geoprocessing specifications. Open interfaces and protocols defined by OpenGIS&amp;nbsp;Specifications support interoperable solutions that "geo-enable" the Web, wireless and location-based services, and mainstream&amp;nbsp;IT, and empower technology developers to make complex spatial information and services accessible and useful with all kinds of applications. Open Geospatial Consortium protocols include [[Web Map Service]], and [[Web Feature Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/members |title=OGC Members &amp;#124; OGC(R) |publisher=Opengeospatial.org |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GIS&amp;nbsp;products are broken down by the&amp;nbsp;OGC into two categories, based on how completely and accurately the software follows the OGC&amp;nbsp;specifications.
[[File:Geoservices server with apps.png|thumb|347px|OGC standards help GIS tools communicate.]]

''Compliant Products'' are software products that comply to OGC's&amp;nbsp;OpenGIS&amp;nbsp;Specifications. When a product has been tested and certified as compliant through the OGC&amp;nbsp;Testing Program, the product is automatically registered as "compliant" on this site.

''Implementing Products'' are software products that implement OpenGIS&amp;nbsp;Specifications but have not yet passed a compliance test. Compliance tests are not available for all specifications. Developers can register their products as implementing draft or approved specifications, though OGC&amp;nbsp;reserves the right to review and verify each entry.

===Web mapping===
{{Main|Web mapping}}

In recent years there has been a proliferation of free-to-use and easily accessible mapping software such as the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] web applications [[Google&amp;nbsp;Maps]] and [[Bing&amp;nbsp;Maps]], as well as the [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] alternative [[OpenStreetMap]]. These services give the public access to huge amounts of geographic data; perceived by many users to be as trustworthy and usable as professional information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=May|first2=Andrew J.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Val|title=The role of VGI and PGI in supporting outdoor activities|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=2013|volume=44|issue=6|pages=886–94|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2012.04.013|pmid=22795180|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/10350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of them, like Google Maps and [[OpenLayers]], expose an [[application programming interface]] (API) that enable users to create custom applications. These toolkits commonly offer street maps, aerial/satellite imagery, geocoding, searches, and routing functionality. Web mapping has also uncovered the potential of [[crowdsourcing]] geodata in projects like [[OpenStreetMap]], which is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. These [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]] projects have been proven to provide a high level of value and benefit to end users outside that possible through traditional geographic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=May|first2=Andrew J.|last3=Mitchel|first3=Val|title=User Centred Design of Neogeography: The Impact of Volunteered Geographic Information on Trust of Online Map 'Mashups|journal=Ergonomics|date=2014|volume=57|issue=7|pages=987–997|doi=10.1080/00140139.2014.909950|pmid=24827070|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/23845/3/Parker%2c%20May%2c%20Mitchell%20-%202014%20-%20User-centred%20design%20of%20neogeography%20the%20impact%20of%20volunteered%20geographic%20information%20on%20users%27%20perception.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=Andrew|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Taylor|first3=Neil|last4=Ross|first4=Tracy|title=Evaluating a concept design of a crowd-sourced 'mashup' providing ease-of-access information for people with limited mobility|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=2014|volume=49|pages=103–113|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2014.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adding the dimension of time===
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Historical geographic information system]] and [[Time geography]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
{{See also|Historical geographic information system|Time geography}}
The condition of the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and subsurface can be examined by feeding satellite data into a GIS. GIS&amp;nbsp;technology gives researchers the ability to examine the variations in Earth processes over days, months, and years. As an example, the changes in vegetation vigor through a growing season can be animated to determine when drought was most extensive in a particular region. The resulting graphic represents a rough measure of plant health. Working with two variables over time would then allow researchers to detect regional differences in the lag between a decline in rainfall and its effect on vegetation.

GIS&amp;nbsp;technology and the availability of digital data on regional and global scales enable such analyses. The satellite sensor output used to generate a vegetation graphic is produced for example by the [[advanced very-high-resolution radiometer]] (AVHRR). This sensor system detects the amounts of energy reflected from the Earth's surface across various bands of the spectrum for surface areas of about 1 square kilometer. The satellite sensor produces images of a particular location on the Earth twice a day. AVHRR and more recently the [[moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer]] (MODIS) are only two of many sensor systems used for Earth surface analysis.

In addition to the integration of time in environmental studies, GIS is also being explored for its ability to track and model the progress of humans throughout their daily routines. A concrete example of progress in this area is the recent release of time-specific population data by the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Census]]. In this data set, the populations of cities are shown for daytime and evening hours highlighting the pattern of concentration and dispersion generated by North American commuting patterns. The manipulation and generation of data required to produce this data would not have been possible without&amp;nbsp;GIS.

Using models to project the data held by a GIS&amp;nbsp;forward in time have enabled planners to test policy decisions using [[spatial decision support system]]s.

==Semantics==
Tools and technologies emerging from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]]'s [[Semantic Web]] are proving useful for [[data integration]] problems in information systems. Correspondingly, such technologies have been proposed as a means to facilitate [[interoperability]] and data reuse among GIS&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontology (computer science)|Ontologies]] are a key component of this semantic approach as they allow a formal, machine-readable specification of the concepts and relationships in a given domain. This in turn allows a GIS to focus on the intended meaning of data rather than its syntax or structure. For example, [[reasoning]] that a land cover type classified as ''deciduous needleleaf trees'' in one dataset is a [[specialization (logic)|specialization]] or subset of land cover type ''forest'' in another more roughly classified dataset can help a GIS automatically merge the two datasets under the more general land cover classification. Tentative ontologies have been developed in areas related to GIS&amp;nbsp;applications, for example the hydrology ontology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/ontology/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521025424/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/ontology/|date=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[Ordnance Survey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the SWEET ontologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/ontology/ |title=Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529200940/http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/ontology/ |archivedate=2007-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. Also, simpler ontologies and semantic metadata standards are being proposed by the W3C Geo Incubator Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/geo/|title= W3C Geospatial Incubator Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; to represent geospatial data on the web. [[GeoSPARQL]] is a standard developed by the Ordnance Survey, [[United States Geological Survey]], [[Natural Resources Canada]], Australia's [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] and others to support ontology creation and reasoning using well-understood OGC literals (GML, WKT), topological relationships (Simple Features, RCC8, DE-9IM), RDF and the [[SPARQL]] database query protocols.

Recent research results in this area can be seen in the International Conference on Geospatial Semantics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.geosco.org/|title= International Conferences on Geospatial Semantics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Terra Cognita – Directions to the Geospatial Semantic Web&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/partnerships/research/research/terracognita.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518054232/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/partnerships/research/research/terracognita.html|date=May 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; workshop at the International Semantic Web Conference.

==Implications of GIS in society==
{{Main|Neogeography|Public participation GIS}}
With the popularization of GIS in decision making, scholars have begun to scrutinize the social and political implications of GIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haque|first=Akhlaque|date=2001-05-01|title=GIS, Public Service, and the Issue of Democratic Governance|journal=Public Administration Review|language=en|volume=61|issue=3|pages=259–265|doi=10.1111/0033-3352.00028|issn=1540-6210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haque|first=Akhlaque|date=2003|title=Information technology, GIS and democraticvalues: Ethical implications for IT professionals in public service|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|doi=10.1023/A:1024986003350|pmid=|volume=5|pages=39–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = C.J. | last2 = May | first2 = A. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = V. | year = 2013 | title = The role of VGI and PGI in supporting outdoor activities | url = https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/10350| journal = Applied Ergonomics | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 886–94 | doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2012.04.013| pmid = 22795180 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS can also be misused to distort reality for individual and political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monmonier|first=Mark|date=2005|title=Lying with Maps|jstor=20061176|journal=Statistical Science|doi=10.1214/088342305000000241|pmid=|volume=20|issue=3|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Lie with Maps|last=Monmonier|first=Mark|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0226534213|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the production, distribution, utilization, and representation of geographic information are largely related with the social context and has the potential to increase citizen trust in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surveillance, Transparency and Democracy: Public Administration in the Information Age|last=Haque|first=Akhlaque|publisher=University of Alabama Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0817318772|location=Tuscaloosa, AL|pages=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related topics include discussion on [[copyright]], [[privacy]], and [[censorship]]. A more optimistic social approach to GIS&amp;nbsp;adoption is to use it as a tool for public participation.

===GIS in education===
{{see also|Esri Education User Conference}}
At the end of the 20th century, GIS began to be recognized as tools that could be used in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see:

GIS seem to provide many advantages in teaching [[geography]] because they allow for analyses based on real geographic data and also help raise many research questions from teachers and students in classrooms, as well as they contribute to improvement in learning by developing spatial and geographical thinking and, in many cases, student motivation.&lt;ref name="Nieto"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

===GIS in local government===
GIS is proven as an organization-wide, enterprise and enduring technology that continues to change how local government operates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Strategic-GIS-Planning-and-Management-in-Local-Government/Holdstock/p/book/9781466556508|title=Strategic GIS Planning and Management in Local Government|website=CRC Press|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Government agencies have adopted GIS technology as a method to better manage the following areas of government organization:
* Economic Development departments use interactive GIS mapping tools, aggregated with other data (demographics, labor force, business, industry, talent) along with a database of available commercial sites and buildings in order to attract investment and support existing business. Businesses making location decisions can use the tools to choose communities and sites that best match their criteria for success. [http://www.gisplanning.com/ GIS Planning]'s [http://www.gisplanning.com/Products/zoomprospector-enterprise.html ZoomProspector Enterprise] an Intelligence Components software is the industry leader, servicing more than 60% of the US population, more than 30% of Canadians, and locations in the UK and Switzerland. You can see an example of these tools here on the state of Pennsylvania's Department of Community and Economic Development website, [http://pasitesearch.com/ PASiteSearch.com].
* Public Safety&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://safecitygis.com/|title=Home - SafeCity|website=SafeCity|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; operations such as Emergency Operations Centers, Fire Prevention, Police and Sheriff mobile technology and dispatch, and mapping weather risks.
* Parks and Recreation departments and their functions in asset inventory, land conservation, land management, and cemetery management.
* Public Works and Utilities, tracking water and stormwater drainage, electrical assets, engineering projects, and public transportation assets and trends.
* Fiber Network Management for interdepartmental network assets
* School analytical and demographic data, asset management, and improvement/expansion planning
* Public Administration for election data, property records, and zoning/management.
The Open Data initiative is pushing local government to take advantage of technology such as GIS technology, as it encompasses the requirements to fit the Open Data/Open Government model of transparency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  With Open Data, local government organizations can implement Citizen Engagement applications and online portals, allowing citizens to see land information, report potholes and signage issues, view and sort parks by assets, view real-time crime rates and utility repairs, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/industries/localgov/open-government|title=GIS for Local Government{{!}} Open Government|website=www.esri.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = C.J. | last2 = May | first2 = A. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = V. | last4 = Burrows | first4 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Capturing Volunteered Information for Inclusive Service Design: Potential Benefits and Challenges | url = https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/11589| journal = The Design Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 197–218 | doi=10.2752/175630613x13584367984947| type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The push for open data within government organizations is driving the growth in local government GIS technology spending, and database management.

The '''geology of Germany''' is heavily influenced by several phases of [[orogeny]] in the [[Paleozoic]] and the [[Cenozoic]], by [[sedimentation]] in shelf seas and [[Inland sea|epicontinental sea]]s and on [[plain]]s in the [[Permian]] and [[Mesozoic]] as well as by the [[Quaternary glaciation]]s.

[[File:Tectonic Map of Europe noleg.jpg|thumb|Map of tectonic provinces in Europe showing the Baltic Shield and East European Platform (&amp;nbsp;{{color box|#dec0dc}}&amp;nbsp;) and the Caledonian (&amp;nbsp;{{color box|#aab6f2}}&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;{{color box|#accdd2}}&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;{{color box|#b0e2ad}}&amp;nbsp;), Variscan (&amp;nbsp;{{color box|#e9e8a7}}&amp;nbsp;) and Alpine (&amp;nbsp;{{color box|#eacea6}}&amp;nbsp;) orogenic belts. Red lines represent [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s. Germany is located approximately in the centre of the map]]

[[Germany]] is located between the geologically very old ([[Precambrian]]) [[East European Craton]] ([[Baltica]]) to the north and north-east that further north is exposed as the [[Baltic Shield]], and the geologically young (Cenozoic) [[Alps|Alpine]]-[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] [[Orogeny|Orogen]] to the south. The corresponding [[Continental crust|crustal]] provinces of Germany are thus geologically "middle-aged" and were [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] onto the East European Craton during the Paleozoic through [[plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] processes. These areas form the geological [[Basement (geology)|basement]] of Germany. The basement is the oldest of the four geological crustal levels (''German: {{lang|de|Stockwerke}}'') that overlap in Central Europe, north of the [[Alps]]. The levels mainly reflect the age relationships of rocks and the great [[Tectonics|tectonic]] trends that the Earth's crust was subjected to in the course of its geological history: crustal extension and widespread, mostly marine, sedimentation alternating with crustal compression/orogeny and extensive [[erosion]]. The surface geology of Germany has evolved to its current configuration due to regional differences in the action and appearance of external and internal forces over the past {{circa}} 20 million years. Germany can be divided into three [[Physiographic province|physiographic regions]]: the Central European Depression, the Central European Blocks and the Alps.

== Physiographic regions ==
[[File:Geomap Germany.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Simplified map of the surface geology of Germany. The Central European Depression (Mitteleuropäische Senke) (light yellow) is almost completely covered by Quaternary deposits (Quartär). The Central European Blocks area appears mainly in [[Violet (color)|violet]] (Mesozoic + [[Zechstein]] + [[Ruhr]] Carboniferous (Silesian)) and brown (before late Carboniferous). In the far south are the Alps.]]

=== Central European Depression ===
The northern third of Germany is part of the Central European Depression (''German: Mitteleuropäische Senke''), corresponding roughly to the [[North German Plain]]. It is a long-term subsiding area containing a [[sedimentary rock]] sequence, several thousand metres thick, of Late Palaeozoic to Cenozoic age and is characterised by a strong [[Glacier|glacial]] overprint as well as [[salt tectonics]] of Permian salt diapirs together with minor long-range effects of the Alpine Orogeny.

=== Central European Blocks ===

South of the Central European Depression is the Central European Blocks area (''German: Mitteleuropäisches Schollengebiet''), which geographically includes the [[Central Uplands]], the [[South German Scarplands]], the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] and foothills of the Alps. The long-range effects of the Alpine Orogeny were relatively strong in this area and the effects of the [[Pleistocene]] glaciations were small. The region is divided into several structurally uplifted blocks, where extensively [[Fold (geology)|folded]] Paleozoic basement [[outcrop]]s, and some subsided/non-uplifted blocks capped almost exclusively by Mesozoic or Cenozoic rocks. The uplifted blocks are the [[Rhenish Massif]] (excluding the [[Ardennes]]), the Saxon and Thuringian blocks (not to be confused with the [[Saxothuringian Zone]]) including the [[Harz]], the [[Thuringian Basin]], the [[Thuringian Forest]], the Thuringian-Franconian-Vogtland Slate Mountains and the [[Fichtel Mountains]]-[[Ore Mountains]]. The latter three geological units form the north-western edge of the [[Bohemian Massif]], which is the largest contiguous outcrop of basement in Central Europe. The north-east edge of the Bohemian Massif is the [[Sudeten mountains|Sudeten]] Block. The western edge of the central part of the Bohemian Massif, the Bohemian Block, extends into Germany with the mountain ranges of the [[Upper Palatinate Forest]] and the [[Bavarian Forest]]. The subsided/non-uplifted blocks are the [[European Cenozoic Rift System#Lower Rhine Graben|Lower Rhine Graben]] ([[Cologne Lowland]]) with the [[Münster (region)|Münsterland]] Cretaceous Basin ([[Westphalian Lowland]]), the Solling Block (Hessian Depression), the South German Block (the South German Scarplands together with the [[Odenwald]], the [[Spessart]], the [[Black Forest]] and the [[Molasse basin|Molasse Basin]]) and the [[Upper Rhine Graben]].

=== Alpine-Carpathian Arc ===

South of the South German Block and the Bohemian Massif is the Alpine-Carpathian Arc (''German: Alpen-Karpaten-Bogen''). Although its extent in Germany is limited to the extreme south of [[Bavaria]], this narrow strip has relatively high geological diversity. In this region, three of the four major tectonic "domains" of the Alps are found: the [[Helvetic nappes]], the [[Penninic nappes]] (as the Rhenodanubian [[Flysch]] Zone) and the [[Eastern Alps]] (as the [[Northern Limestone Alps]]).

== Geological levels ==

By age and structural characteristics of the rocks that are located underground and at the surface in Germany, four crustal "levels" are traditionally distinguished in the area north of the Alps: the basement, the transition level, the Mesozoic [[Platform (geology)|platform]] and the Cenozoic platform. The latter three are also summarised under the generic term platform, in contrast to the basement.

=== Basement ===

Right: Quarry in the [[Brocken]] [[granite]] [[pluton]] on [[Wurmberg (Harz)|Wurmberg]] in the [[Upper Harz]] Mountains, parts of which are of early Permian ([[Asselian]]) age, one of the youngest rock bodies of the Variscan basement.
}}

The basement consists of folded rocks, some of which are [[metamorphic rock]]s, mostly of marine-sedimentary and [[Submarine volcano|submarine-volcanic]] origin, [[Intrusive rock|intruded]] by [[granitoid]] [[pluton]]s. Most of these rocks are of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|late Carboniferous]] age or older. Folding and [[metamorphism]] of these sedimentary and volcanic rocks, and the emplacement of the granitoids, occurred mainly in two Paleozoic orogenies: the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian Orogeny]] in the Late [[Ordovician]] and the [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan Orogeny]] in the [[Mississippian (geology)|early Carboniferous]]. In the oldest folded Variscan rocks, evidence exists of an older orogeny, the [[Cadomian orogeny|Cadomian Orogeny]], which occurred before the accretion of the crustal blocks of Proto-Europe (Baltica) (''German: {{lang|de|Ur-Europa}}''). The folded basement rocks originated in the [[Proterozoic]], but even older relics of [[continental crust]] are found in a [[Gneiss|paragneiss]] of the Bavarian Forest, the [[protolith]] of which was probably deposited subsequent to the Cadomian Orogeny. A sample of this paragneiss contains a [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] [[zircon]] grain, whose core crystallised from a [[magma]] during the [[Archean]] [[Geologic time scale|eon]], before about 3.48 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Gebauer89"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195189903429 | title=The development of the Central European continental crust since the Early Archaean based on conventional and ion-microprobe dating of up to 3.84 b.y. old detrital zircons | last1=Gebauer | first1= Dieter | last2=Williams | first2=Ian S. | last3=Compston | first3 =William | last4=Grünenfelder | first4=Marc | journal=Tectonophysics | year=1989 | volume=157 | pages=81–96 | doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90342-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the Caledonian folded basement lies a few thousand metres below the surface of the Central European Depression, the Variscan basement or Variscides (''German: {{lang|de|Varistikum}}'') outcrops in the Central European Blocks area, occurring extensively in several large highland areas and also sparsely in some lowland areas in the form of basement uplifts. A distinction is made here between rock complexes, commonly referred to as "slate belts" (''German: {{lang|de|Schiefergebirge}}'') made of unmetamorphosed or weakly metamorphosed rocks ([[slate]], [[chert]], [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], altered [[basalt]], [[phyllite]] and  [[quartzite]]) which are intruded only to a small extent by granitoids, and rock complexes commonly referred to as [[crystalline]], comprising weakly to highly metamorphosed rocks (phyllite, quartzite, [[marble]], [[amphibolite]], [[serpentinite]], [[schist]], [[gneiss]], [[granulite]] and [[eclogite]]) which are extensively intruded by granitoids. The slate belt rock units were folded at a shallow depth at relatively low temperatures, whereas the metamorphic crystalline areas sank much deeper during the Variscan Orogeny, and were subjected to high pressures and, in some places, very high temperatures which caused [[partial melting]] of the rocks. The [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] signature of the Variscan granitoids suggests that their magma was produced by the partial melting of deeply-buried sedimentary rocks. Outcropping slate belts are found mainly in the Rhenish Massif, the Harz and the Thuringian-Franconian-Vogtland Slate Mountains. Outcropping crystalline areas are found mainly in the Black Forest, the western Odenwald, [[Spessart|Vorspessart]], the Ore Mountains, the Fichtel Mountains, the Palatinate Forest and the Bavarian Forest.

=== Transition ===

{{multiple image

 | image2 = Rhyolith.jpg
 | footer = Left: Typical Permian [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], below [[Wartburg|Wartburg castle]] (Thuringian Forest). Right: Permian [[rhyolite]] of the Saar-Nahe Basin, near [[Wöllstein]]. 
}}

The transition level includes all unfolded sedimentary and [[volcanic rock]]s of late Carboniferous (Stephanian) to mid-Permian (Guadalupian) age. "Transition level" refers, in part, to the stratigraphic position of these rocks: they are younger than the folded Variscides but older than the layers of the Mesozoic platform. In addition, they stem from a geological transition phase, which is characterised by the flattening of the Variscan mountains and by post-Variscan [[volcanism]], which was accompanied by crustal extension in the Variscan Orogen. The rocks of the transition level differ from the younger platform sediments in that they are often relatively coarse-grained ([[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomeratic]]) Molasse sedimentary rocks and [[acidic rock|acidic]] to [[Intermediate composition|intermediate]] volcanic rocks (especially [[rhyolite]]), whereas the Mesozoic platform has few conglomerates and no volcanic rocks. The transition level is divided [[Lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphically]] into Stephanian and Permian ([[Rotliegend]]) sequences. Rocks of the transition level are found today mainly in the [[Saar-Nahe Basin]], the Halle-Leipzig area (e.g. Halle [[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]] Complex), the [[Ore Mountain Basin]] and the Thuringian Forest.

=== Mesozoic platform ===

{{multiple image
 | width = 250
 | image1 = Moessingen-Rutschung-Detail.jpg
 | image2 = Schrammsteine.jpg
 | footer = Left: Outcropping [[Bed (geology)|bed]]s of [[White Jurassic]] limestone at the edge of the [[landslide]] at Hirschkopf near [[Mössingen]] ([[Swabian Jura]]). Right: The [[Schrammsteine]], Late Cretaceous sandstones in the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] near [[Bad Schandau]].
}}

The Mesozoic platform includes all virtually unfolded sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic ([[Triassic]], [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]]), but also includes some Paleozoic deposits of the Lopingian [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the late Permian. In northern Germany, in principle, even the relatively unfolded or weakly folded post-Caledonian/pre-Permian sediments (including the [[Ruhr]] Carboniferous and its western continuation in the Aachen area) are included with the Mesozoic platform.

The outcropping Mesozoic platform at the surface comprises [[Zechstein]] (Middle/Late Permian) marine [[gypsum]] rocks and limestones,  [[Buntsandstein]] (Early Triassic) [[siliciclastic]] rocks, [[Muschelkalk]] (Middle Triassic) marine limestones, [[Keuper]] (Middle and Late Triassic) mixed [[evaporite]]-[[Carbonate rock|carbonate]]-siliciclastic deposits, [[Early Jurassic]] (Lias/[[Black Jurassic|Schwarzjura]]) marine black shales, Dogger/[[Brown Jurassic|Braunjura]] ([[Middle Jurassic]]) marine, often iron-bearing, siliciclastic rocks, [[White Jurassic]]/[[Malm (geology)|Malm]] ([[Late Jurassic]]) marine limestones, [[Early Cretaceous]] (Wealden) continental siliciclastic rocks and [[Late Cretaceous]] marine limestones, sandstones and gaizes. Outcropping Zechstein rocks are limited to the edges of basement uplifts. Triassic rocks cover the largest area. In the South German Block, extensively outcropping Mesozoic rocks dip towards the south-east. Due to the alternating layering of weathering/erosion-prone shales and more resistant sandstones and limestones, a [[cuesta]] landscape has formed there in the past several million years. The most conspicuous of these cuestas is the White Jura of [[Franconia]] and the [[Swabian Jura]]. Uplands formed by relatively weathering/erosion-resistant sandstones of the early/middle Buntsandstein are the Palatinate Forest, the Odenwald, the Spessart, the Südrhön and the [[Burgwald]]. Ridges of Muschelkalk limestone are found mainly in the Thuringian Basin. Probably the most well-known occurrence of Cretaceous sandstones is the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]].

In northern Germany, individual blocks have been forced up by [[salt dome]]s, and have been eroded down to the older layers of the Mesozoic platform. Erosion-resistant bedrock on these blocks forms small isolated ridges, especially in the northern Harz [[Foreland basin|foreland]] region. These include the [[Elm (hills)|Elm hills]] (Muschelkalk), the [[Asse (hills)|Asse hills]] (Buntsandstein and Muschelkalk) and the [[Großer Fallstein|Grosser Fallstein]] (Muschelkalk) as well as the island of [[Heligoland]] (Buntsandstein). Cretaceous [[chalk]] can be found, partly covered by thin Quaternary deposits, only in northern Germany, including in Münsterland Cretaceous Basin, where the Cretaceous deposits directly rest on the [[Ruhr]] Carboniferous and continue westward into the [[Aachen Formation]], as well as in the Hanover and Salzgitter area. Probably the most well-known Cretaceous limestones of Germany are those on the island of [[Rügen]], on Germany's north coast.

=== Cenozoic platform ===

}}

The Cenozoic platform (which is also known as the "unconsolidated rock" level because the Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, due to their young age, have often not experienced intensive [[diagenesis]] and are therefore often not [[cementation (geology)|cemented]]), includes the rocks of the [[Tertiary]] and Quaternary. Because the youngest deposits in an uplifted area are removed first, the Cenozoic platform deposits occur extensively only in young Cenozoic subsidence areas in the Central European Blocks region. The largest continuous outcrops are the Upper Rhine Graben with the [[Mainz Basin]] and the Molasse Basin (Alpine foreland trough). Special "subsidence areas" are the [[Nördlinger Ries]] and the [[Steinheim crater]], both originating through a [[meteorite]] [[impact event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Böhme | first1 = Madelaine | last2 = Gregor | first2 = Hans-Joachim | last3 = Heissig | first3 = Kurt | editor-last  = Buffertaut | editor-first = E., et al.

The Cenozoic in Germany is also represented by volcanic rocks. In contrast to the mostly acidic ([[silica|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-rich) volcanic rocks of the transition level, the Cenozoic formations are mostly intermediate to very SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-poor ([[trachyte]], basalt, [[phonolite]], [[tephrite]], [[nephelinite]] and [[basanite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Plant | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Whittaker  | first2 = A. | last3 = Demetriades | first3 = A. | last4 = De Vivo | first4 = B. | last5 = Lexa | first5 = J. | editor-last  = Salminen | editor-first = R.

In northern Germany, almost the entire surface geology is made of Cenozoic sediments, mainly of Pleistocene and [[Holocene]] glacial or fluvioglacial deposits. [[Moraine]]s and [[urstromtal]]s determine the [[Terrain#Relief|relief]] (''see: [[Glacial series]]''). Thus the Southern Ridge (''German: {{lang|de|Südliche Landrücken}}'') is a moraine of the [[Saale glaciation]] and the Northern Ridge (''German: {{lang|de|Nördliche Landrücken}}'') is a moraine of the [[Weichselian glaciation]].&lt;ref name="GeomorphDeut"&gt;{{cite book | title=Geomorphologie der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (volume 5) | publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag | author=Semmel, Arno | year=1996 | location=Stuttgart | pages=35 | language = German | isbn=978-3-515-06897-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material of these sediments was picked up by the [[ice sheet]] on its way from Scandinavia to Central Europe and was deposited during the melting there. The route that the ice took can be reconstructed with the aid of rocks, the [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]s in the moraine sediments, because these can be matched with certain regions in Scandinavia (''see: [[Glacial erratic]]''). In southern Germany, with the exception of the Alpine foreland and the Upper Rhine Graben, there are rather thin Quaternary deposits and formations, geographically confined mostly to lower slopes and valleys where they occur as [[scree]] and [[stone runs]] or as fluvial [[gravel]]s and [[sand]]s. In the foothills of the Alps, there are also Pleistocene moraines. There, however, the cobbles originate from the Alps and a different nomenclature than in Northern Germany is used for the [[glacial period]]s in which the ice from the mountains in the south pushed into the foothills: The Saale glaciation corresponds there to the [[Riss glaciation]] and the Weichselian glaciation corresponds to the [[Würm glaciation]].

== German Alps ==

[[File:Röthenbach Flysch.JPG|thumb|Rhenodanubian [[flysch]]: Rhythmic limestone-[[marl]]-[[mudrock]] alternation of the Piesenkopf Formation (Late Cretaceous) in Röthenbachtal, [[Ostallgäu]]]]

The Alps are a young orogen, in which the relatively simple geological relationship between basement and platform that exists in the area north of the Alps has been overprinted and complicated by orogenic processes. The formation of the Alps happened in tectonic "domains", but within which basement and platform can be distinguished, which either jointly or separately, are built of separate [[nappe]]s. Those nappes outcropping in the German Alps invariably contain platform units. The units in question are folded, unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks, mainly of Mesozoic age, that were deposited almost exclusively in a marine environment. They can be associated with three of the four domains of the Alps.

=== Helvetic domain ===

The [[Helvetic (geology)|Helvetic]] Domain (also known as the Helvetic Nappes) (''German: {{lang|de|Helvetikum}}'') [[Strike and dip|strikes]] approximately east-west in a strip, mostly only a few hundred metres wide, right at the northern edge of the Alps with siliciclastic and carbonate rocks of the Cretaceous and the early Tertiary that are [[Thrust fault|overthrust]] towards the north onto the southern edge of the Molasse Basin. There are mainly shallow marine formations that are, for example, rich in [[nummulites]]. They represent the inner [[continental shelf]] on the southern edge of pre-Alpine Europe and they were not affected by the folding and overthrusting processes of the Alpine Orogeny until relatively late.

=== Flysch zone ===

The Penninic Domain (also known as the Penninic Nappes) (''German: {{lang|de|Penninikum}}'') strikes south of the Helvetic Domain in a strip, a few kilometres wide, in the form of the Rhenodanubian Flysch Zone. It comprises Cretaceous - Early Tertiary siliciclastic-carbonate [[Turbidite|turbiditic]] deepwater sediments (''see: [[Flysch]]''), which represent a portion of the erosion debris forming the Alpine sedimentary [[Clastic wedge|wedge]] that in the further course of formation of the Alps was itself incorporated into the orogen and overthrust over a distance of about 100&amp;nbsp;km to the north onto the Helvetic units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Hess | first1 = Reinhard | editor-last  = Carena  | editor-first = Sara, et al. (editors) | contribution = Rhenodanubian Flyschzone, Bavarian Alps | year = 2011 | title = Geological Field Trips in Central Western Europe |pages = 62 | publisher = Geological Society of America | isbn = 978-0813700229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limestone Alps ===

}}

The [[Eastern Alps]] strike south of the Flysch Zone and occupy the largest area in the German Alps. In Germany, the Eastern Alps are, for the most part, Mesozoic mostly Triassic carbonate rocks. This carbonate rock association, whose outcrop runs in a 35 to 50-kilometre-wide strip from [[Vorarlberg]] as far as the [[Vienna Basin]], is called the [[Northern Limestone Alps]]. In contrast to the Helvetic Domain and the Flysch Zone that still mostly have a low mountain character (''German: {{lang|de|Mittelgebirge}}'') although they are morphologically clearly set apart from the Alpine foreland, the Northern Limestone Alps form high mountains (''German: {{lang|de|Hochgebirge}}'') of well over 2,000 metres above sea level. Of the [[List of highest mountains of Germany|high mountains of Germany]], the highest is [[Zugspitze]], with a height of 2,962 metres, more than a thousand metres higher than [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] in the Black Forest, Germany's highest mountain outside the Alps.

The Northern Limestone Alps represent a depositional environment that was probably located several hundred kilometres to the south, relative to the current position of the rocks. This is reflected in [[facies]] as well as in the [[fossil]] record: While in the Eastern Alps platform carbonates with tropical faunas were established during the late [[Middle Triassic]], the contemporary, epicontinental, partly terrestrial sequences in Central Europe north of the Alps (''see: [[Geology of Germany#Mesozoic platform|Mesozoic platform]]'') are rather dominated by siliciclastics and had rather warm temperate faunas. Therefore, especially with regard to the formation of Triassic rocks, a distinction is made between "[[Germanic Trias|Germanic facies]]" (Central Europe north of the Alps) and "Alpine facies" (Northern Limestone Alps). Starting from the Late Cretaceous, the Eastern Alps were affected by the Alpine Orogeny and the rocks of the Northern Limestone Alps were stacked and transported to the north, to their present position, overriding the Helvetic and Penninic domains.

'''Hall Basin''' is an [[Arctic]] waterway between [[Hall Land]] in [[Greenland]] to the west and [[Canada]]'s northernmost island to the east, [[Ellesmere Island]]. 

Hall Basin is named after American polar explorer [[Charles Francis Hall]].
==Geography==
Hall Basin is located in [[Nares Strait]] with its entrance between [[Cape Baird]] on the eastern coast of Ellesmere Island and [[Cape Morton]] on the northwestern coast of Greenland. [[Robeson Channel]] is to the north of the basin, and [[Kennedy Channel]] to the south. The basin is irregularly shaped, the entrance to [[Lady Franklin Bay]] lies on its western shores, being deeply indented by an extensive fjord system. Although the eastern shore is more regular, it includes the [[Petermann Fjord]] of the [[Petermann Glacier]] at its southern end.&lt;ref&gt;''Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hamilton Canal''' (also commonly known as the '''Dutch Canal''') is a {{convert|14.5|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} canal connecting [[Puttalam]] to [[Colombo]], passing through [[Negombo]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. The canal was constructed by the [[British Ceylon|British]] in 1802 and completed in 1804. It was designed to drain salt water out of the [[Muthurajawela wetlands]]. The canal was named after Gavin Hamilton, the Government Agent of Revenue and Commerce.

==History==
===Early history===
The first mention of the canals along the western seaboard of Sri Lanka was in the [[8th century]], when the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geographer]], [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]] reported a voyage lasting weeks along the 'Gobbs of Serendib', the Arabian term for the linked lagoons along the coast.&lt;ref name="Brohier"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brohier, Richard Leslie | title=Links between Sri Lanka and the Netherlands : a book of Dutch Ceylon | date=1978 | publisher=Netherlands Alumni Association of Sri Lanka | isbn=978-8-7874-5367-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ceylon; an Account of the Island Physical, Historical, and Topographical with Notices of Its Natural History, Antiquities and Productions|author=Tennent, James Emerson|place=London|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|date=1860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six centuries later the [[Kingdom of Kotte|King of Kotte]], [[Parakramabahu VIII of Kotte|Veera Parakramabahu VIII]] (1477–1496), had a network of canals constructed connecting outlying villages with Colombo and Negombo Lagoon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.island.lk/2007/03/24/satmag5.html|title=Kings of Ancient and Medieval Sri Lanka|newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)|The Island]]|last=Pieris|first=Kamalika|date=24 March 2007|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that produce such as [[Areca catechu|arecanuts]], [[clove]]s, [[cardamom]], pepper and [[cinnamon]], could be more easily transported to the kingdom’s main seaport at Negombo.&lt;ref name="Sampath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/dutch/dutch4.htm|title=Dutch Waterways in Sri Lanka|last=Sampath|first=Suresh|date=26 February 2011|publisher=Explore Sri Lanka|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1613 a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[missionary]], Father Manoel Barradas, describes how "Near Columbo the Fathers embarked on a canal by which they entered into the [[Kelani River|River Calane [Kelani Ganga]]], and going down the river they proceeded into another canal as narrow as shady, so that the oars, although they were very short, could scarcely fulfil their office". "By this they went as far as Negumbo, which is six Chingala leagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Asiatic Society|date=1906|volume=XIX No. 57|publisher=Government Printer Ceylon|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofceylonb19roya/journalofceylonb19roya_djvu.txt|page=62|isn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century the Portuguese constructed a canal from [[Hendala]] to [[Pamunugama]].

The [[Dutch Ceylon|Dutch]] established the centre of their colony at Colombo. They then attempted to grow [[Paddy field|paddy rice]] in the surrounding marshes in [[Muthurajawela wetlands|Muthurajawela]], but found that—as the previous Sinhalese kings had before them—the coastal tides inundated the fields with sea water. Around the 18th century, the Dutch commenced the construction of a series of structures, dams and canals using and enhancing the original system of waterways in an attempt to drain the salt water from the rice fields and to transport cinnamon in barges through to the seaport at Negombo.&lt;ref name="Sampath"/&gt; This system, known as the 'Dutch Canal', formed a "continuous line of waterways between ports and the remote sections of territory under the Dutch".&lt;ref name="Brohier"/&gt;

===Later history===
In 1796 the British took control of the island and in 1802 a new Colombo-Negombo canal was built, conceived by [[George Atkinson (Surveyor General)|George Atkinson]], the [[Surveyor General of Sri Lanka|Colonial Surveyor General]] and supported by Gavin Hamilton (1494–1803), the Government Agent of Revenue and Commerce.&lt;ref name="DBU"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://thedutchburgherunion.org/journals/vol_41_50/JDBU%20Vol%2043%20No%203%20-%201953(1).pdf|title=Journal of the Dutch Burgher Union|publisher=Dutch Burgher Union|volume=XLIII|date=July 1953|pages=132–134|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamilton Canal, as it became known, ran parallel and west of the old Dutch Canal, closer to the sea, from the mouth of the [[Kelani River|Kelani Ganga]] at Hekitta to the southern edge of the [[Negombo Lagoon]] at Pamunugama, a distance of 14.5 km. Hamilton had accompanied [[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford|Frederick North]] (first British [[Governor of Ceylon]] 1798–1805) to Ceylon in 1798, where he became the private secretary to [[Hugh Cleghorn (colonial administrator)|Hugh Cleghorn]], Colonial Secretary of Ceylon.&lt;ref name=Mocavo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/List-of-Inscriptions-on-Tombstones-and-Monuments-in-Ceylon-of-Historical-or-Local-Interest-With-an-Obituary-of-Persons-Uncommemorated/974644/399|title=List of Inscriptions on Tombstones and Monuments in Ceylon of Historical or Local Interest|publisher=[[Mocavo.com|Mocavo]]|page=381|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became the private secretary to Governor North.  In April 1799 Hamilton was appointed Acting Civil Paymaster and in 1802 the Deputy [[Paymaster General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Asiatic Register|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=zJ0IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=%22gavin+hamilton%22+ceylon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A4pLyPUVPX&amp;sig=U-p7IYvQYCvhkp4oz5BKfJvl2Tw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwiXu4W3vIzJAhWh56YKHUC6BgE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gavin%20hamilton%22%20&amp;f=false|publisher=J.

The canal was designed to connect the original Dutch canal by a series of parallel waterways in order to drain the already damaged Muthurajawela but created the opposite effect, as the coastal tides brought increasing salinity not only from [[Negombo Lagoon]] but also the [[Kelani River|Kelani Ganga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dl.nsf.ac.lk/ohs/cea/news/Sunday-Observer/E-1994-Oct-09-Sunday-Observer.pdf | title=Muthurajawela: Man Made Devastation | newspaper=[[Sunday Observer]] | author=Jayatilake, Linus | date=9 October 1994 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2003/07/18/fea01.html|title=Wanton rape of the Muthurajawela Wetland Sanctuary : Biodiversity Conservation vs Political Vote Bank|first=Florence|last=Wickramage|newspaper=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|The Daily News]]|date=18 July 2003|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">The '''Harper Hall''' at Fort Hold is a central location in [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s Chronicles of [[Pern]].

== Role within Pern Chronicles ==
Anne McCaffrey combines the roles of teachers, historians, lawyers, diplomats and musicians into the guild of Harpers on the planet Pern. Under the leadership of the MasterHarper, such as MasterHarper [[Robinton]] of the Ninth Pass, the harpers utilise music as a teaching tool and are sent out to all Holds and Crafthalls to train youngsters in vocabulary, numeracy and rights and responsibilities of all. Being spread throughout the various settlements, harpers see and hear much, and report back to the Harper Hall.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, Anne. ''Dragonsinger'', ''Dragondrums'' 1979, ''Masterharper of Pern''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding of the Harper Hall ==
McCaffrey explores the theme of history and legend in her Pern prequels, which include discussions about the loss of technology and skills in the colony. The Harper Hall is located at Fort Hold, the first Hold established in the northern hemisphere after the Second Crossing. It was initially known as the College, and was the central training point for medical and teaching personnel. As the level of technology dropped, the community struggled to justify training personnel to use techniques that could no longer be utilised, including genetics and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, Todd. ''Dragonsblood''.&lt;/ref&gt; The battle for survival under the onslaught of Thread demanded a reorganisation of priorities. The decision was then made to utilise music as an easy medium to teach and communicate within the low-tech society.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, Anne. ''Red Star Rising'', published in the US as ''Dragoneye'' 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of tradition, which runs throughout McCaffrey's writing, is based on Teaching Ballads and Sagas taught by the Harper Hall to all Pernese.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, Anne. ''Dragonflight''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously a deeply branched arm of the sea leading west from the [[Isefjord]], most of it is now [[Land reclamation|reclaimed]] as agricultural land. The eastern third, outside the dyke at Avdebo, is still sea, but the name ''Lammefjorden'' now usually refers only to the dry part west of the dyke.

The sandy former sea bed is excellent agricultural land, especially for crops such as [[carrot]]s and [[potato]]es.

The draining project began in 1873, but it took until 1943 before the lowest elevations were pumped dry. Large parts of the fjord were shallow enough to be dry early on. In 1899 the [[Odsherredsbanen|Odsherred Railway]] opened across the western end of the fjord. The town of [[Fårevejle Stationsby]] grew up where the railway intersects that main road across the seabed; it serves as the administrative and mercantile center for much of the Lammefjord.

The Lammefjord contains Denmark's lowest dry elevation, at {{Convert|7.0|m|ft|1}} below [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2020.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is also in running for the lowest in western [[Europe]] (shared with [[Zuidplaspolder]] in [[Netherlands]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2020.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10122">This is the map and '''list of American countries by monthly net average wage'''. The chart below reflects the average (mean) wage as reported by various data providers. The salary distribution is [[skewness|right-skewed]], therefore most people earn less than the average net salary. In less developed markets, actual incomes may exceed those listed in the table due to the existence of [[grey economy]].

The countries in purple on the map have net average salary in excess of {{font color|black|#f0f|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;2,000}} and in blue –in the range of {{font color|black|#00BFFF|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;1,000}} to {{font color|black|#00BFFF|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;1,999}}, in green - in the range of {{font color|black|#9ACD32|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;600}} to {{font color|black|#9ACD32|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;999}}, in yellow - in the range of {{font color|black|#FFD700|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;300}} to {{font color|black|#FFD700|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;599}}, and in red below {{font color|black|#FC6D57|[[USD|$]]&amp;thinsp;300}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65828">This is a list of [[NHS trust]]s established in [[England]]. It includes Acute Hospital Trusts, [[NHS ambulance services prior to 2006|Ambulance Trusts]], Mental Health Trusts, and the unique [[Isle of Wight NHS Trust]]. Many trusts have dissolved or have changed their name, and each is listed separately, under each significant name.  If the same trust has continued with only a slight name change, it is only listed once, with the latest name.

[[Community Health NHS Trust]]s present particular difficulties. Like all the trusts they were originally established under the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]]. They have been frequently merged, split and reorganised, sometimes combined with hospital trusts or mental health trusts. After 2001 most of them were  subsumed into [[Primary Care Trust]]s and under the [[Transforming Community Services]] programme they were then re-established in various organisational forms, not always within the NHS. A further wave of community trusts were established between 2010 and 2013 when PCTs were abolished, sometimes reusing a previous name.

There is a separate [[List of Primary Care Trusts in England]] which did not have the same legal status.

Dates of mergers and dissolutions are generally the date of legislation.  The operational date may be different.

* For the distinct system of [[NHS Health Board]]s in Scotland, see [[NHS Scotland]]
* For the system in Northern Ireland, see [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]
* For the system in Wales, see [[NHS Wales]]

[[NHS Foundation Trusts]] were regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]].  Trusts that had not attained Foundation Trust status were supervised by the [[NHS Trust Development Authority]].  From 1 April 2016 they are all supervised by [[NHS Improvement]].

[[Abkhazia]] is a [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|partially recognised state]] on the eastern coast of the [[Black Sea]] and the south-western flank of the [[Caucasus]], south of [[Russia]] and northwest of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] proper.  Its capital is [[Sukhumi]].

While Georgia lacks control over Abkhazia, the [[Government of Georgia (country)|Georgian government]], the [[United Nations]] and the majority of the world's governments consider Abkhazia part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], whose constitution designates the area the '''[[Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia|Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia]]'''.

The economy of Abkhazia is heavily integrated with Russia and uses the [[Russian ruble]] as its currency. Abkhazia has experienced a modest economic upswing since the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] and Russia's subsequent recognition of Abkhazia's independence. About half of Abkhazia's state budget is financed with aid money from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/no-clear-frontrunner-as-abkhazia-goes-to-poll/442702.html |title=No Clear Frontrunner as Abkhazia Goes to Poll |author=Nikolaus von Twickel |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=26 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism is a key industry and, according to Abkhazia's authorities, almost a million tourists (mainly from Russia) came to Abkhazia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kommersant]]-Dengi, [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1020594 Тяжелая экономическая независимость] (''Hard Economical Independence''), 08.09.2008 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abkhazia also enjoys fertile lands and an abundance of agricultural products, including tea, tobacco, wine and fruits (especially [[tangerine]]s and [[hazelnut]]s). Electricity is largely supplied by the [[Inguri Dam|Inguri hydroelectric power station]] located on the Inguri River between Abkhazia and Georgia (proper) and operated jointly by both parties.

This is a '''list of countries by age at first marriage'''.  Definition of marriage is the legally or formally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship (historically and in some jurisdictions specifically a union between a man and a woman)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://google.com/|title=Google|website=google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Marriage is a legally recognized union between two partners in a relationship. The average age to first get married varies from one country to another and is affected by several factors such as financial stability, career, academic pursuit, and family background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-nations-of-europe-by-the-average-age-at-first-marriage.html|title=The Nations Of Europe By The Average Age At First Marriage|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is current from the most recent surveys and does not treat the topic in history.

Because the [[Age Distribution|age distribution]] of people at first marriage is [[skewness|skewed]] with a longer tail towards older ages,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics [http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/a8d1bea8a2ff1b33ca2570ec001b0dc3!OpenDocument Family "Formation: Age at first marriage"]. 21 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of people marry before the [[average]] age of first [[marriage]]. The [[median]] age is a more precise representation of when the majority of people marry,  however, for most reporting sources, only the average age at marriage is reported.

Some countries have most recent and updated [[census]] while other countries haven't been updated since the 1990s.

==States with limited recognition==
*[[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]. While there is an [[Stepanakert Airport|airport in Stepanakert]], this has seen no air traffic movements since 1992.
*[[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]

Of the world's 17 [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing territories]], two have no airport within their boundaries: [[Tokelau]] and the [[Pitcairn Islands]]. Both are islands without land connection, so fairly long boat trips are the only transportation.

[[File:Illustrated Index of British Shells Plate 23.jpg|thumb|260px|A plate from [[George Brettingham Sowerby II|G. B. Sowerby's]] 1859 book ''Illustrated Index of British Shells'' shows shells of British land snails]]
This list comprises 220&lt;!-- counted 20 November by Snek01 one added by Invertzoo in January '09--&gt; species of non-marine [[mollusc]]s that have been recorded in the scientific literature as part of the [[fauna of Great Britain|fauna of the island of Great Britain]]. These are [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] and aquatic [[gastropods]], and aquatic [[bivalves]]; the list does not include species of molluscs which are considered to  be fully [[marine (ocean)|marine]], except for two marine [[pulmonate]] gastropods.

In other words: this list includes [[land snail]]s and [[slug]]s, and [[freshwater]] and [[brackish water]] snails. It also includes [[freshwater mussel]]s and clams, including some that can tolerate [[brackish water]]. Molluscs that are fully adapted to live in the sea are not included here, except for two species that are air-breathing and thus are more closely related to most land and freshwater snails than they are to the majority of sea snails.

Great Britain is a [[Europe]]an island in the northeastern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], comprising the contiguous countries of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. ([[Great Britain]] is not the same entity as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], for more information on the complex nomenclature of this area, please see [[terminology of the British Isles]].)

The mollusc fauna of the island of [[Ireland]], which includes both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], is listed in another article: [[List of non-marine molluscs of Ireland]].

A number of species of snails listed here are semi-terrestrial and so are sometimes also found on lists of marine species. Two listed here, in the genera ''[[Onchidella]]'' and ''[[Otina]]'', are fully marine in habitat, but are pulmonate snails which breathe air at low tide rather than having gills like most marine species. Other species listed here live in habitats that are intermediate between land and saltwater, or in brackish water habitats intermediate between freshwater and full-salinity saltwater.

Additional species are still being added to the list of the non-marine malacofauna of Great Britain. Three of the more recent discoveries are ''[[Papillifera bidens]]'' first found in 1993, ''[[Selenochlamys ysbryda]]'' a species which appeared to be new to science and which was first found in 2005, and ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'' first found in 2006 and possibly not really established at that point. A major revision of the slug fauna published in 2014, partly based on genetic sequencing, established that there were 20% more species than had previously been recognised.&lt;ref name="Rowson2014a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rowson. B., Anderson, R., Turner, J.A., Symondson, W.O.C.|year=2014|title=The slugs of Britain and Ireland: undetected and undescribed species increase a well-studied, economically important fauna by more than 20% |journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|pages=e91907|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0091907|pmid=24740519|pmc=3989179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowson2014b"&gt;{{cite book|author= Rowson, B., Turner, J., Anderson, R., Symondson, W.|year=2014|title=Slugs of Britain and Ireland: identification, understanding and control|publisher=Field Studies Council|place=Telford|ISBN=978-1-908819-13-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all these species have been definitely identified and some are formally undescribed.

In addition to the species that survive outdoors in Great Britain, there are also another 14 [[exotic species|exotic]] gastropod species (some terrestrial and some aquatic) which live as "uninvited guests" in [[greenhouse]]s and their enclosed [[aquarium|aquaria]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
Those species that are recognized as endangered are shown with an '''E''' after their name, see [[List of endangered species in the British Isles]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Some species are protected in the United Kingdom under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturenet.net/law/sched5.html ''Protection for wild animals on Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981'']. website accessed 7 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Catinella arenaria]]'' and ''[[Myxas glutinosa]]'' are fully protected since 1981
* ''[[Margaritifera margaritifera]]'' is partly protected since 1991 and fully protected since 1998
* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' is partly protected since 2008
* ''[[Monacha cartusiana]]'' was fully protected from 1981 to 1988.

Two of the land snails on the list (''[[Fruticicola fruticum]]'' and ''[[Cernuella neglecta]]'') are now locally extinct (in Great Britain, sometimes abbreviated here as G.B.), but they still occur in other parts of Europe.

==Systematic list==
The list is arranged by presumed biological affinity, rather than being alphabetical by family.

A number of species are listed with subspecies, in cases where there are well-recognized subspecies in different parts of Europe. For some species a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] is given, where the species may perhaps be better known under another name.

An attempt has been made to label the families as aquatic, terrestrial or intermediate, and an indication is given where it is thought that the species is introduced. Some introductions to Great Britain are quite ancient, dating from [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times or even earlier, for example, [[Paleolithic]]. Those species that do not have a shell usually do not leave an archeological or fossil record, and therefore it is not always possible to determine whether they are native or introduced. Species are considered to be native, unless otherwise indicated on the list; this information is taken from Kerney, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Kerney, Michael, 1999, ''Atlas of the land and freshwater molluscs of Britain and Ireland'', Harley Books, Colchester, England, {{ISBN|0-946589-48-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; updated in the case of slugs with the opinions of Rowson et al. 2014.&lt;ref name="Rowson2014b"/&gt;

Note: the images used to illustrate the list are mostly of specimens that were found in other countries.

==List of "hothouse alien" species==
This group of exotic land and freshwater species are not truly part of the fauna because they do not live in the wild. Many are tropical and thus are incapable of surviving in the wild in Great Britain; instead they have established themselves as uninvited inhabitants of [[greenhouse]]s, [[aquarium|aquaria]] within greenhouses, and similar artificially-heated  habitats.

==Directional approach==
One common approach categorizes Africa directionally, e.g., by [[cardinal direction]] (compass direction):
*[[North Africa]] lies north of the [[Sahara]] and runs along the [[Mediterranean]] coast.
*[[West Africa]] is the portion roughly west of 10° east [[longitude]], excluding Northern Africa and the [[Maghreb]]. West Africa contains large portions of the Sahara Desert and the Adamawa Mountains.
*[[East Africa]] stretches from the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Horn of Africa]] to [[Mozambique]], including [[Madagascar]]	
*[[Central Africa]] is the large mass at the center of Africa which either does not fall squarely into any other region or only partially does so.
*[[Southern Africa]] consists of the portion generally south of -10° latitude and the great rainforests of [[Congo Basin|Congo]].

This approach is taken, for example, in the [[United Nations geoscheme for Africa]] and the [[regions of the African Union]].

==Physiographic approach==
[[File:Africa satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Satellite image of Africa, showing the ecological break that defines the sub-Saharan area]]
Another common approach divides Africa by using features such as landforms, climatic regions, or vegetation types:
*[[Nile Valley]]
*[[Nile Delta]]
*[[Atlas Mountains]]
*[[Nubia]] ([[Lower Nubia]])
*The [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]] is the massive but largely empty region in North Africa that contains the world's largest hot deserts 
*The [[Maghreb]] is a region of northwest Africa encompassing the coastlands and [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Tunisia]].
*The [[Sahel]] region covers a belt of grasslands south of the Sahara stretching from [[Senegal]] to [[Sudan]].
*The [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] region lies just below the Sahel but is slightly more humid and arable.
*[[Sudanian Savanna]]
*The [[Horn of Africa]] is a [[peninsula]] in East Africa that juts for hundreds of kilometers into the [[Arabian Sea]], and lies along the southern side of the [[Gulf of Aden]]. It encompasses [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]].
*[[Ethiopian Highlands]] (Roof of Africa)
*[[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is the area of the African continent which lies south of the [[Sahara]].
*The [[Guinea (region)|Guinea region]] is distinguished from the neighboring Sudan region by its rainforests and runs along the [[Atlantic]] coast from [[Guinea]] to [[Nigeria]].
* [[Sudan (region)]]
* [[Negroland]]
* [[Rhodesia (region)]] ([[Northern Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia]])
* [[Mayombe]]
*The [[Congo Basin]] is the rainforest region
* The [[Chad Basin]] The Chad Basin is the largest endorheic drainage basin in Africa, centered on Lake Chad.
*[[East African Rift]]. The region contains [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]].
*[[Eastern Rift mountains]]
*[[Rift Valley Lakes]]
*[[African Great Lakes]]
*[[Swahili Coast]]
*[[Pepper Coast]]
*[[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]
*[[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]
*[[Ivory Coast]]
*[[Barbary Coast]]
*[[Mittelafrika]]
* [[Igboland]] ([[Mbaise]])
* [[Maputaland]]

==Linguistic approach==

*[[English language|Anglophone]] Africa includes five countries in West Africa ([[The Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Ghana]], and the most populous African country [[Nigeria]], as well as a part of [[Cameroon]]) that are separated by Francophone countries, [[South Sudan]], and a large continuous area in [[Southern Africa]] and the [[African Great Lakes]].
*[[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|Arabophone Africa]] includes the four most populous Arabic-speaking countries ([[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]]) as well as [[Tunisia]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Chad]], and includes a majority of both the population and the area of the Arabic-speaking countries. French has also kept a strong role in the [[Maghreb]] countries, though this has receded somewhat with official [[Arabization]].
*[[Francophone Africa]] is a  continuous area in [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]], plus [[Madagascar]] and [[Djibouti]].
*[[Lusophone Africa]] consists of the widely separated countries of [[Cabo Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Sao Tome and Principe]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]].
*[[Equatorial Guinea]] is the only African country where the [[Spanish language]] is official, though French and more recently Portuguese have also been added as official languages.
*[[Swahili language|Swahili]] is widely used as an inter language in East Africa; its use for official and educational functions is greatest in [[Tanzania]].
*[[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]] use the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Amharic language|Amharic]] and [[Somali language|Somali]] languages, respectively, as their official languages, although [[Arabic language|Arabic]] also serves as a secondary language in Somalia. [[Eritrea]] and parts of Ethiopia use the [[Tigrinya language]] and [[Arabic language]] as working languages.

===By indigenous language family===
*[[Niger–Congo languages]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] are spoken in most of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Nilo-Saharan occupies a smaller area but is highly diverse, and may be related as a parent or sibling of Niger–Congo.
*[[Afro-Asiatic languages]] are spoken in [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], as well as parts of the [[Sahel]].
*[[Khoisan languages]] are spoken in desert areas of Southern Africa, but were formerly spoken over a larger area, and are thought to include two small languages ([[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]) in the [[African Great Lakes]].
*[[Austronesian languages]] originating from [[Southeast Asia]] are spoken in [[Madagascar]].

==Investment approach==
[[File:African economic division investments.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Investment divisions of Africa. Source: [http://www.riscura.com/ RisCura]]]
A slightly less common, but equally important method of division of the continent is by investment factors. For the purposes of investing, Africa is not a single destination with a single set of standardized risk factors and homogeneous potential for reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Compelling investment markets in Africa – Inside Riscura's Bright Africa 2015 Report: Debbie O’Hanlon, Senior Analyst, RisCura (Infographics) {{!}} African Business News {{!}} African Financial &amp; Economic News|url = http://www.africanbusinesscentral.com/2015/10/12/compelling-investment-markets-in-africa-inside-riscuras-bright-africa-2015-report-debbie-ohanlon-senior-analyst-riscura-infographics/|website = African Business Central|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some high-level similarities are evident, digging into the specifics of certain regions and countries shows that Africa comprises a range of distinct investment destinations, each with its own attractions, flaws, cultural differences and business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Segmenting Africa into meaningful markets {{!}} Bright Africa|url = http://www.riscura.com/brightafrica/segmenting-africa-into-meaningful-markets/|website = www.riscura.com|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meaningful African markets for investment|url = http://www.capitalmarketsinafrica.com/meaningful-african-markets-for-investment/|website = Capital Markets in Africa|accessdate = 2015-11-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investment approach was first developed by global, independent financial analytics provider and investment consultant, [http://www.riscura.com/ RisCura].
* [[Greater Maghreb|Maghreb]] region
*: Otherwise known as the western portion of Northern Africa, these countries form the [[Arab Maghreb Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UMA|url = http://www.maghrebarabe.org/en/uma.cfm|website = www.maghrebarabe.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1989. The region was established with the goal of functioning as a unified political and economic grouping. [[Arab Spring|Political unrest]] in the region&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Arab Spring?|url = http://middleeast.about.com/od/humanrightsdemocracy/a/Definition-Of-The-Arab-Spring.htm|website = About.com News &amp; Issues|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; has stunted progress since its inception but hope still remains that the Union will fulfill its purpose in years to come. [[Algeria]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] are included in this region.
* [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]
*: [[History of Egypt under the British|Previously united under British rule]], these countries still share strong ties,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sudan - Egypt Relations|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/sudan/forrel-eg.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one significant commonality – the trade facilitation through transport on the [[Nile]] River. As Egypt does not fall within the Arab Maghreb Union, it is separated from the rest of [[North Africa]]. However, Egypt's strong economic and cultural ties with the [[Middle East]] bring natural trading partners, and it is often seen grouped with the Middle East for investment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trading Peace in Egypt and Israel|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2015-08-23/trading-peace-egypt-and-israel|website = Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Francophone [[West Africa]] 
*: This is a commonly recognized region on the continent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://performance.ey.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/06/130219-SGF-TL-FSSA-email-version.pdf|title = What it takes to succeed in Francophone Africa|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically includes [[Mauritania]]. However, Mauritania is sometimes allocated to the Maghreb region as it is found to have closer ties to the North African countries. These [[French language|French]]-speaking countries share more than just a language. Due to their common history as [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], they also share similar legal and socio-political systems. The countries in this group are [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]].
* [[Nigeria]]
*: On its own, Nigeria is the size of the entire Maghreb region on an aggregated-[[Gross domestic product|GDP]] basis. While Nigeria is traditionally grouped with the rest of [[West Africa]], its reliance on the rest of the region is less pronounced, likely as a result of its massive standalone GDP, its access to international markets via its six large ports, and its population of over 170 million people.
* [[East Africa]]
*: This is a combination of the [[East African Community]] ([[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]), the [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor|LAPSSET]] corridor (Kenya, [[South Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]]) as well as [[Djibouti]], a crucial link to the [[Indian Ocean]] for Ethiopia and South Sudan. Kenya has traditionally headlined this region through consistently generating the largest GDP and acts as the primary route to international trade through the [[Mombasa]] [[Kilindini Harbour|port]]. 
* [[Central Africa]] 
*: This market is the same as that defined by the [[African Development Bank]] with the exception of [[Madagascar]], which here is classified as Southern Africa (ex-SA). On a GDP basis ([[United States dollar|USD]]) and by population, the Central Africa region is on par with the Francophone West African region. Countries included here are [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]], as well as [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]].
* Southern Africa excluding [[South Africa]] (ex-SA)
*: This incorporates countries south of central and eastern Africa, and north of the South African border. The region has support from the most developed economy on the continent from the south, and access to capital coming out of South Africa as large companies look to expand into the rest of the continent. The group comprises [[Angola]] (which offers substantial [[oil]] resources), [[Botswana]], [[Comoros]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Réunion|Reunion]], [[Zambia]] (substantial supply of [[copper]]) and [[Zimbabwe]].
* [[South Africa]]
*: Like Nigeria, South Africa is a large African economy on a standalone basis. Due to the developed nature of South Africa relative to the rest of the continent, it has not been included in the Southern African region. South Africa boasts the largest [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]] of all the regions (double that of Nigeria) and is the most advanced investment destination on the continent. The South African market includes [[Lesotho]] and [[Eswatini]] due to their reliance and proximity to SA. The Swazi [[Swazi lilangeni|lilangeni]] is pegged to the South African rand, which is also accepted as currency within the country.
* Other [[West Africa]]
*: This region includes [[Ghana]], [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[The Gambia]].

[[File:Mt. Elbert.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Elbert]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[summit]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Colorado|State of Colorado]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''184 [[Summit|peaks]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]] with at least {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[elevation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Rocky Mountains, [[List of the major 4000-meter summits of the Rocky Mountains|62 major summits exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation]], 137 exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and the following 184 exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

'''Middletown Friends Meetinghouse''' is a Historic [[Quaker]] meeting house at 435 Middletown Road in [[Lima, Pennsylvania|Lima]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  It is one of the oldest Friends meetinghouses in what was originally [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavoie|first1=Catherine|title=Historic American Buildings Survey|url=https://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/pa/pa3800/pa3803/data/pa3803data.pdf|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Interior|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first mention of an organized Friends meeting in Middletown Township was in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=John W|title=A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania and Its People|date=1912|publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company|location=New York|page=396|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofdelawar02jord#page/396/mode/2up|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  location and construction of a meetinghouse was noted in 1699 and the Middletown Friends Meetinghouse was completed in 1702.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashmeade|first1=Henry Graham|title=History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania|date=1884|publisher=L.H.

During the 1790s, the building was doubled in size through the addition of a separate apartment.  In the 1880s, the meetinghouse was reconfigured creating a more church-like appearance and orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavoie|first1=Catherine|title=Historic American Buildings Survey|url=https://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/pa/pa3800/pa3803/data/pa3803data.pdf|website=www.cdn.loc.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Interior|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Middletown Friends meetinghouse is an active worship center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middletown Quakers website|url=http://www.middletownquakers.org/|website=middletownquakers.org|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Potted History: The Story of Plants in the Home ''''' is a 2007 book on social history and horticulture and gardening in the historical domestic setting by author and journalist [[Catherine Horwood]]. It was first published in hardback by the British publisher [[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VcUkvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Catherine+Horwood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE39nH3-XeAhXEkywKHfRjBJcQ6AEIOjAD Google Books: Potted History]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Editions==
''Potted History: The Story of Plants in the Home'' was published in an illustrated, hardback edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VcUkvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Catherine+Horwood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE39nH3-XeAhXEkywKHfRjBJcQ6AEIOjAD Google Books: Potted History: Editions: details]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Rather than focusing on the more usual subject matter of how to look after and rear houseplants, Horwood instead traces the historical and sociological reasons why houseplants but Catherine Horwood came to be found in our homes. She writes how potted plants and domestic horticulture are as subject to fashion as pieces of furniture, from the Victorian's use of the aspidistra in their front parlour to the contemporary of the orchid in the designer loft. The book also covers the influence of indoor horticulture on period design, finding that [[Wedgwood]] created a market for special bulb pots and that some of [[Terence Conran]]'s early designs were for houseplant containers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2251425.Potted_History Good read: Potted History: Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qilian Mountains''' also known as Richthofen Range, ('''Tsilien Mountains'''; {{zh|s={{linktext|祁连山}}|w=Ch'i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-lien&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Shan&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|p=Qílián Shān}}; Mongghul: Chileb), together with the [[Altyn-Tagh]] (Altun Shan) also known as Nan Shan ({{zh|c=南山}}, literally "Southern Mountains"), as it is to the south of [[Hexi Corridor]], is a northern outlier of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], forming the border between [[Qinghai]] and the [[Gansu]] provinces of northern [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=r5DlTbOzK8X10gH6-czLBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=IKVGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=the+troops+of+Ma+Bufang+in+the+Qilian+Mountains+on+the+border+of+Gansu+and+Qinghai%2C+only+to+escape+and+return+to+an&amp;q=bufang|title=The Journal of Asian studies, Volume 62, Issue 1|author=Association for Asian Studies, Far Eastern Association (U.S.)|editor=|year=2003|publisher=Association for Asian Studies|edition=|location=|page=262|isbn=0-691-09676-7|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The range stretches from the south of [[Dunhuang]] some 800&amp;nbsp;km to the southeast, forming the northeastern escarpment of the [[Tibetan Plateau|Qinghai-Tibet Plateau]] and the southwestern border of the [[Hexi Corridor]].

The eponymous Qilian Shan peak, situated some 60&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Jiuquan]], at {{coord|39|12|N|98|32|E|}}, rises to 5,547 m. It is the highest peak of the main range, but there are two higher peaks further south, Kangze'gyai at {{coord|38|30|N|97|43|E|}} with [http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=14100 5,808 m] and
Qaidam Shan peak at  {{coord|38|2|N|95|19|E|}} with [http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=14203 5,759 m].  Other major peaks include [[Gangshiqia Peak]] in the east.

The Nan Shan range continues to the west as Yema Shan (5,250 m) and [[Altun Shan|Altun Shan (Altyn Tagh)]] (5,798 m). To the east, it passes north of [[Qinghai Lake]], terminating as Daban Shan and Xinglong Shan near [[Lanzhou]], with Maoma Shan peak (4,070 m) an eastern outlier. Sections of the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s [[Great Wall]] pass along its northern slopes, and south of northern outlier [[Longshou Shan]] (3,616 m).

The Qilian mountains are the source of numerous, mostly small, rivers and creeks that flow northeast, enabling irrigated agriculture in the  [[Hexi Corridor]] (Gansu Corridor) communities, and eventually disappearing in the [[Gobi Desert#Alashan Plateau semi-desert|Alashan Desert]]. The best known of these streams is the [[Ejin River|Ejin (Heihe) River]].  The region has many [[glacier]]s, the largest of which is the [[Touming Mengke]].&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily2012-07-15/&gt;  These glaciers have undergone acceleration in their melting in recent decades.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-12-08/&gt;

The [[List of terrestrial ecoregions (WWF)|characteristic ecosystem]] of the Qilian Mountains  has been described by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the Qilian Mountains conifer forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0517|name=Qilian Mountains conifer forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biandukou]] (扁都口), with an altitude of over 3500 m, is a pass in the Qilian Mountains. It links [[Minle County]] of Gansu in the north and Qilian County of Qinghai in the south.&lt;ref name=Xinhua2005-12-20/&gt;

==History==
The ''[[Shiji]]'' mentions the "Qilian mountains" together with [[Dunhuang]] in relation to the homeland of the [[Yuezhi]]. This ''Qilian'' however has been suggested to be the mountains now known as [[Tian Shan]], 1,500&amp;nbsp;km to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mallory, J. P.  |author2=Mair, Victor H.  |lastauthoramp=yes |page= 58|year=2000 |title=The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson. London |isbn= 0-500-05101-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dunhuang'' has also been argued to b the [[Dunhong]] mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xinru Liu|Liu, Xinru]], ''Migration and Settlement of the Yuezhi-Kushan: Interaction and Interdependence of Nomadic and Sedentary Societies'' (2001) [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_world_history/v012/12.2liu.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qilian'' ({{lang|und-Hant|祁连}}) is said to be as a Xiongnu word meaning "sky" ({{zh|天|tiān}}) according to [[Yan Shigu]], a [[Tang Dynasty]] commentator on the ''[[Hanshu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qo9kCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT985&amp;lpg=PT985#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=漢書: 顏師古註|quote=祁連山即天山也,匈奴呼天為祁連 (translation: Qilian Mountain is the Tian Shan, the Xiongnu called the sky qilian) |author=班固 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tuyuhun]] were based around the Qilian mountains.

The mountain range was formerly known in European languages as Richthofen Range after [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]], who was [[Manfred von Richthofen|the Red Baron]]'s explorer-geologist uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Winchester, Simon. (2008). ''The Man Who Loved China: the Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom,'' p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain range gives its name to Qinghai's [[Qilian County]].

[[File:Loxodrome.png|thumb|right|220px|Image of a loxodrome, or rhumb line, spiraling towards the [[North Pole]]]]

In [[navigation]], a '''rhumb line''', '''rhumb''', or '''loxodrome''' is an arc crossing all [[meridian (geography)|meridians]] of [[longitude]] at the same angle, that is, a path with constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] as measured relative to [[true north|true]] or [[magnetic north]].

==Introduction==
The effect of following a rhumb line course on the surface of a globe was first discussed by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[mathematician]] [[Pedro Nunes]] in 1537, in his ''Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart'', with further mathematical development by [[Thomas Harriot]] in the 1590s.

A rhumb line can be contrasted with a [[great circle]], which is the path of shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. On a great circle, the bearing to the destination point does not remain constant. If one were to drive a car along a great circle one would hold the steering wheel fixed, but to follow a rhumb line one would have to turn the wheel, turning it more sharply as the poles are approached. In other words, a great circle is locally "straight" with zero [[geodesic curvature]], whereas a rhumb line has non-zero geodesic curvature.

Meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude provide special cases of the rhumb line, where their angles of intersection are respectively 0° and 90°. On a north–south passage the rhumb line course coincides with a great circle, as it does on an east–west passage along the [[equator]].

On a [[Mercator projection]] map, any rhumb line is a straight line; a rhumb line can be drawn on such a map between any two points on Earth without going off the edge of the map. But theoretically a loxodrome can extend beyond the right edge of the map, where it then continues at the left edge with the same slope (assuming that the map covers exactly 360 degrees of longitude).

Rhumb lines which cut meridians at oblique angles are loxodromic curves which spiral towards the poles.&lt;ref name="EOS" /&gt; On a Mercator projection the [[north pole|north]] and [[south pole]]s occur at infinity and are therefore never shown. However the full loxodrome on an infinitely high map would consist of infinitely many line segments between the two edges. On a [[stereographic projection]] map, a loxodrome is an [[equiangular spiral]] whose center is the north or south pole.

All loxodromes spiral from one [[Geographical pole|pole]] to the other. Near the poles, they are close to being [[logarithmic spiral]]s (which they are exactly on a [[stereographic projection]], see below), so they wind around each pole an infinite number of times but reach the pole in a finite distance. The pole-to-pole length of a loxodrome is (assuming a perfect [[sphere]]) the length of the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] divided by the [[cosine]] of the bearing away from true north. Loxodromes are not defined at the poles.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Etymology and historical description==
The word ''loxodrome'' comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] λοξός ''loxós'': "oblique" + δρόμος ''drómos'': "running" (from δραμεῖν ''drameîn'': "to run"). The word ''rhumb'' may come from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''rumbo/rumo'' ("course" or "direction") and Greek [[rhombus|ῥόμβος]] ''rhómbos'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rhumb Rhumb]'' at TheFreeDictionary&lt;/ref&gt; from ''rhémbein''.

The 1878 edition of ''The Globe Encyclopaedia of Universal Information'' describes a ''loxodrome line'' as:&lt;ref name="Globe"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Loxodrom′ic''' Line is a curve which cuts every member of a system of lines of curvature of a given surface at the same angle. A ship sailing towards the same point of the compass describes such a line which cuts all the meridians at the same angle. In Mercator's Projection (q.v.) the Loxodromic lines are evidently straight.&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;Ross, J.M. (editor) (1878). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qkCwPOyRWTgC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA134,M1 The Globe Encyclopaedia of Universal Information]'', Vol. IV, Edinburgh-Scotland, Thomas C. Jack, Grange Publishing Works, retrieved from [[Google Books]] 2009-03-18;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A misunderstanding could arise because the term “rhumb” had no precise meaning when it came into use. It applied equally well to the [[windrose line]]s as it did to loxodromes because the term only applied “locally” and only meant whatever a sailor did in order to sail with constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]], with all the imprecision that that implies. Therefore, “rhumb” was applicable to the straight lines on [[portolan]]s when portolans were in use, as well as always applicable to straight lines on Mercator charts. For short distances portolan “rhumbs” do not meaningfully differ from Mercator rhumbs, but these days “rhumb” is synonymous with the mathematically precise “loxodrome” because it has been made synonymous retrospectively.

As Leo Bagrow states:&lt;ref name="Bagrow2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Bagrow|title=History of Cartography|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=OBeB4tDmJv8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=portolans+only+when+the+chart+is+drawn+on+a+suitable+projection+projection&amp;hl=ca#v=onepage&amp;q=portolans%20only%20when%20the%20chart%20is%20drawn%20on%20a%20suitable%20projection%20projection&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2518-4|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "..the word ('Rhumbline') is wrongly applied to the sea-charts of this period, since a loxodrome gives an accurate course only when the chart is drawn on a suitable projection. Cartometric investigation has revealed that no projection was used in the early charts, for which we therefore retain the name 'portolan'."

==Mathematical description==
For a sphere of radius 1, the azimuthal and polar angles {{mvar|λ}} and {{math|−{{sfrac|π|2}} ≤ ''φ'' ≤ {{sfrac|π|2}}}} (defined here to correspond to latitude) and [[Cartesian coordinate system#Representing a vector in the standard basis|Cartesian unit vectors]] {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, and {{math|'''k'''}} can be used to write the radius vector {{math|'''r'''}} as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(\lambda,\varphi) = (\cos{\lambda} \cdot \cos{\varphi})  \mathbf{i} + (\sin{\lambda} \cdot \cos{\varphi})  \mathbf{j} + (\sin{\varphi}) \mathbf{k} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Orthogonality#Euclidean vector spaces|Orthogonal unit vectors]] in the azimuthal and polar directions of the sphere can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\hat\lambda}(\lambda,\varphi) &amp;= \sec{\varphi} \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial\lambda} = (-\sin{\lambda}) \mathbf{i} + (\cos{\lambda}) \mathbf{j} \, , \\[8pt]
\boldsymbol{\hat\varphi}(\lambda,\varphi) &amp;= \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial\varphi} = (-\cos{\lambda} \cdot \sin{\varphi}) \mathbf{i} + (-\sin{\lambda} \cdot \sin{\varphi}) \mathbf{j} + (\cos{\varphi}) \mathbf{k} \, ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which have the [[Dot product#Geometric definition|scalar products]]

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat\lambda} \cdot \boldsymbol{\hat\varphi} = \boldsymbol{\hat\lambda} \cdot \mathbf{r} = \boldsymbol{\hat\varphi} \cdot \mathbf{r} = 0 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

{{math|'''λ̂'''}} for constant {{mvar|φ}} traces out a parallel of latitude, while {{math|'''φ̂'''}} for constant {{mvar|λ}} traces out a meridian of longitude.

The unit vector
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\hat\beta}}(\lambda,\varphi) = (\sin{\beta}) \boldsymbol{\hat\lambda} + (\cos{\beta}) \boldsymbol{\hat\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
has a constant angle {{mvar|β}} with the unit vector {{math|'''φ̂'''}} for any {{mvar|λ}} and {{mvar|φ}}, since their scalar product is

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat\beta} \cdot \boldsymbol{\hat\varphi} = \cos{\beta} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

A loxodrome is defined as a curve on the sphere that has a constant angle {{mvar|β}} with all meridians of longitude, and therefore must be parallel to the unit vector {{math|'''β̂'''}}. As a result, a differential length {{mvar|ds}} along the loxodrome will produce a differential displacement

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{r} &amp;= \boldsymbol{\hat\beta} \, ds \\[8px]
\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial\lambda} \, d\lambda + \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial\varphi} \, d\varphi &amp;= ((\sin{\beta}) \, \boldsymbol{\hat\lambda} + (\cos{\beta}) \, \boldsymbol{\hat\varphi}) ds \\[8px]
(\cos{\varphi}) \, d\lambda \, \boldsymbol{\hat\lambda} + d\varphi \, \boldsymbol{\hat\varphi} &amp;= (\sin{\beta}) \, ds \, \boldsymbol{\hat\lambda} + (\cos{\beta}) \, ds \, \boldsymbol{\hat\varphi} \\[8px]
ds &amp;= \frac{\cos{\varphi} }{\sin{\beta}} \, d\lambda = \frac{d\varphi}{\cos{\beta}} \\[8px]
\frac{d\lambda}{d\varphi} &amp;= \tan{\beta} \cdot \sec{\varphi} \\[8px]
\lambda(\varphi\,|\,\beta,\lambda_0,\varphi_0) &amp;= \tan\beta \cdot \big( \operatorname{artanh}(\sin\varphi) - \operatorname{artanh}(\sin\varphi_0)\big) + \lambda_0 \\[8px]
\varphi(\lambda\,|\,\beta,\lambda_0,\varphi_0) &amp;= \arcsin \Big(\tanh\big((\lambda - \lambda_0) \cot\beta + \operatorname{artanh}(\sin\varphi_0)\big)\Big)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With this relationship between {{mvar|λ}} and {{mvar|φ}}, the radius vector becomes a parametric function of one variable, tracing out the loxodrome on the sphere:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(\lambda\,|\,\beta,\lambda_0,\varphi_0) = \Big(\cos{\lambda} \cdot \operatorname{sech} \psi \Big) \mathbf{i} +
\Big(\sin{\lambda} \cdot \operatorname{sech}\psi\Big) \mathbf{j} + \Big(\tanh\psi\Big) \mathbf{k} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\psi \equiv (\lambda - \lambda_0) \cot\beta + \operatorname{artanh}(\sin\varphi_0) = \operatorname{artanh}(\sin \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Latitude#Isometric latitude|isometric latitude]].&lt;ref&gt;James Alexander, Loxodromes: A Rhumb Way to Go, "Mathematics Magazine", Vol. 77. No. 5, Dec. 2004. [http://hans.fugal.net/src/lindbergh/mathmag349-356.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latitude#Geocentric latitude|Geocentric]] and isometric latitudes are related to each other through the [[Gudermannian function]],
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\operatorname{gd}(\psi)\, .&lt;/math&gt;

In the Rhumb line, as the geocentric latitude tends to the poles, {{math|''φ'' → ±{{sfrac|π|2}}}}, {{math|sin ''φ'' → ±1}}, the isometric latitude {{math|artanh(sin ''φ'') → ± ∞}}, and longitude {{mvar|λ}} increases without bound, circling the sphere ever so fast in a spiral towards the pole, while tending to a finite total arc length Δ{{math|s}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta s = \big|(\pm\pi/2 - \varphi_0) \cdot \sec \beta\big|&lt;/math&gt;

==Connection to the Mercator projection==
Let {{mvar|λ}} be the longitude of a point on the sphere, and {{mvar|φ}} its latitude. Then, if we define the map coordinates of the [[Mercator projection]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp;= \lambda - \lambda_0 \, , \\
y &amp;= \operatorname{arctanh}(\sin\varphi)\, ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
a loxodrome with constant [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] {{mvar|β}} from true north will be a straight line, since (using the expression in the previous section)
:&lt;math&gt;y = m x&lt;/math&gt;
with a slope
:&lt;math&gt;m=\cot\beta\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the loxodromes between two given points can be done graphically on a Mercator map, or by solving a nonlinear system of two equations in the two unknowns {{math|''m'' {{=}} cot ''β''}} and {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. There are infinitely many solutions; the shortest one is that which covers the actual longitude difference, i.e. does not make extra revolutions, and does not go "the wrong way around".

The distance between two points Δ{{mvar|s}}, measured along a loxodrome, is simply the absolute value of the [[secant (trigonometry)|secant]] of the bearing (azimuth) times the north–south distance (except for [[circles of latitude]] for which the distance becomes infinite):

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta s = R \, \big|(\varphi - \varphi_0)\cdot \sec \beta \big|&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|R}} is one of the [[Earth_radius#Global_average_radii|earth average radii]].
 
==Application==
Its use in navigation is directly linked to the style, or ''[[map projection|projection]]'' of certain navigational maps. A rhumb line appears as a straight line on a [[Mercator projection]] map.&lt;ref name="EOS"&gt;Oxford University Press [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O225-rhumbline.html Rhumb Line]. The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, Oxford University Press, 2006. Retrieved from Encyclopedia.com 18 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is derived from Old French or Spanish respectively: ''"rumb"'' or "rumbo", a line on the chart which intersects all meridians at the same angle.&lt;ref name="EOS" /&gt; On a plane surface this would be the shortest distance between two points. Over the Earth's surface at low latitudes or over short distances it can be used for plotting the course of a vehicle, aircraft or ship.&lt;ref name="EOS" /&gt; Over longer distances and/or at higher latitudes the [[great circle]] route is significantly shorter than the rhumb line between the same two points. However the inconvenience of having to continuously change bearings while travelling a great circle route makes ''rhumb line navigation'' appealing in certain instances.&lt;ref name="EOS" /&gt;

The point can be illustrated with an East-West passage over [[90 degrees]] of longitude along the [[equator]], for which the great circle and rhumb line distances are the same at {{convert|5400|nmi|km}}. At 20 degrees north the great circle distance is {{convert|4997|mi|km}} while the rhumb line distance is {{convert|5074|mi|km}}, about {{frac|1|1|2}} percent further. But at 60 degrees north the great circle distance is {{convert|2485|mi|km}} while the rhumb line is {{convert|2700|mi|km}}, a difference of {{frac|8|1|2}} percent. A more extreme case is the air route between [[New York City]] and [[Hong Kong]], for which the rhumb line path is {{convert|9700|nmi|km}}. The great circle route over the North Pole is {{convert|7000|nmi|km}}, or {{frac|5|1|2}} hours less flying time at a typical [[Cruise (flight)|cruising speed]].

Some old maps in the Mercator projection have grids composed of lines of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] but also show rhumb lines which are oriented directly towards north, at a right angle from the north, or at some angle from the north which is some simple rational fraction of a right angle. These rhumb lines would be drawn so that they would converge at certain points of the map: lines going in every direction would converge at each of these points. See [[compass rose]]. Such maps would necessarily have been in the Mercator projection therefore not all old maps would have been capable of showing rhumb line markings.

The radial lines on a compass rose are also called ''rhumbs''. The expression ''"sailing on a rhumb"'' was used in the 16th–19th centuries to indicate a particular compass heading.&lt;ref name="EOS" /&gt;

Early navigators in the time before the invention of the [[marine chronometer]] used rhumb line courses on long ocean passages, because the ship's latitude could be established accurately by sightings of the Sun or stars but there was no accurate way to determine the longitude. The ship would sail north or south until the latitude of the destination was reached, and the ship would then sail east or west along the rhumb line (actually a [[Circle of latitude|parallel]], which is a special case of the rhumb line), maintaining a constant latitude and recording regular estimates of the distance sailed until evidence of land was sighted.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of British Seapower, David Howarth, pub. Constable &amp; Robinson, London, 2003, chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===On the Riemann sphere===
{{main|Möbius transformation}}
The surface of the Earth can be understood mathematically as a [[Riemann sphere]], that is, as a projection of the sphere to the [[complex plane]]. In this case, loxodromes can be understood as certain classes of [[Möbius transformation]]s.

===Spheroid===
The formulation above can be easily extended to a [[spheroid]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The course of the rhumb line is found merely by using the ellipsoidal [[Latitude#Isometric latitude|isometric latitude]]. Similarly distances are found by multiplying the ellipsoidal [[meridian arc]] length by the secant of the azimuth.

'''St. George's Harbour''' is a natural harbour in the north of [[Bermuda]]. It serves as the port for the town of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], located on [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]], to its north. To its south is [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's Island]]. The harbour and both islands lie within [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St. George's Parish]]. It was for two centuries the primary harbour of the [[British Overseas Territory]].

==Topography==
The harbour separates [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] in the north and west from [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's Island]] in the south and east. Several other islands lie to the south and east, closing the harbour from the open sea to the east, and separating it from Smith's Sound, to the South. It is open to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Gunner Bay, Bermuda|Gunner Bay]] in the northeast, where its mouth is guarded by numerous islands, notably [[Smith's Island, Bermuda|Smith's]] and [[Paget Island, Bermuda|Paget Island]]s. The waters of Bermuda are also protected by [[coral reef]], which can be perilous to sailors. Several other islands lie within the harbour, notably the historically important [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]]. In the south, a long channel, [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]], links the harbour with another opening to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the picturesque [[Castle Harbor, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]].

==History==
[[File:Somers Isles Map by John Speed 1676 - Parish of St George.jpg|right|thumb|190px|The Parish of St. George's, in 1676. The enclosed harbour to the North-East is St. George's Harbour, that to the South-West is [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (originally ''Southampton Harbour'').]]
The original channel used by shipping to access the harbour lies to the south of Paget Island. This was replaced a century ago by dredging out the passage to the north of Paget Island. At the time, the dredging of that passage had been necessary for St. George's to remain a viable port as steam replaced sail (permission for the dredging had to be granted by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] as it would have enabled easier landing of an invading force. approval for this project, and for American investment into the [[Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]], was withheld 'til the [[Parliament of Bermuda]] agreed to raise a [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895–1965|part-time reserve for the British army units in Bermuda]]). Most freight, today, is offloaded at [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], but St. George's is still used for offloading of gravel and other consignments, by cruise ships visiting the Old Town, and it is the only port of entry for yachts, which must clear H.M. Customs and Bermuda Immigration at Ordnance Island before visiting other parts of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;Bermuda Tourism.[http://www.bermudatourism.com/pdf/YACHTS_SAILING.pdf ''Yachts (Private) Sailing to Bermuda''], Page Eight&lt;/ref&gt;

To enter St. George's Harbour, sailors must fly a yellow [[quarantine]] flag, and navigate the ship towards the Customs dock. Boaters who don't bring their vessel through customs will be fined. Before passing through Bermuda customs, visitors must declare all medicines, and cannot bring fruits or vegetables into the country. Animals are only allowed to be brought to Bermuda if they have proof of health and a permit from the [[Bermuda Department of Environmental Protection]].

[[File:St. George's Harbour circa 1864.jpg|thumb|left|180 px|St. George's Harbour, ca. 1864. [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] blockade runners are visible.]]
The shore of St. George's Harbour was the site of the first settlements in Bermuda, which occurred in the early 17th century. The crew and passengers of the [[Sea Venture]], driven onto the reefs off St. Catherine's Point in 1609, stayed on St. George's Island for nearly a year. When most departed, two men remained behind on [[Smith's Island, Bermuda|Smith's Island]], where a third rejoined them, later. When the first intentional settlers arrived from England in 1609, they settled very briefly on St. David's Island, before moving across the Harbour to create [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], the oldest continuously-inhabited English settlement in the [[New World]]. The harbour was well fortified during this time, as can still be seen in the several period forts located nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/lhbcbbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(lhbcb+0262a)): Complete text of ''The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles'', first printed by I.D and I. H. for Michael Sparkes in 1624. Other editions followed in 1625, 1626, 1627, 1631, and 1632]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th Century saw the establishment of a Royal Naval base in Bermuda. Initially this was in St. George's Harbour, with the [[Royal Navy]] operating from facilities in Convict Bay (so called due to the prison [[Prison ship|hulk]]s moored there) and within St. George's town. This build up began in 1795, but a decade later, the Royal Navy was actively developing the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|dockyard]] on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]], and it soon withdrew from St. George's completely.&lt;ref&gt;''The Andrew And The Onions: The Story Of The Royal Navy In Bermuda, 1795–1975'', Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum, P.O. Box MA 133, Mangrove Bay, Bermuda MA BX. {{ISBN|0-921560-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildup of the dockyard at the West End of the archipelago still resulted in considerable defence infrastructure around St. George's, at the East End, however, as this was the gateway through the surrounding reefs to all of Bermuda. In addition to the 17th and 18th century forts built by the [[Bermuda Militias 1612–1815|militia]], there are many 19th and 20th Century forts and batteries built by the regular [[British Army]] on the islands surrounding the harbour, for which [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] was the primary ammunition depot. The various surviving East End forts, batteries and other military structures, together with the old capital, have been declared by the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] as a [[World Heritage Site]], the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site: Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications, Bermuda|Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications, Bermuda]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bermuda Forts 1612–1957'', Dr. Edward C.

[[File:Tianmu plaza.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tianmu Plaza]]
'''Tianmu''' ({{zh|c=天母|p=Tiānmǔ}}) is a neighborhood located in [[Shilin District|Shilin]], [[Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]].  Located on the northern border of Shilin District, Tianmu borders the neighboring district of [[Beitou]] and [[Yangmingshan]] National Park.

Tianmu is best known as an [[enclave]] for Taiwan's US [[expatriate]] community. From the mid 1950s to 1979, before the US broke formal ties with Taiwan, large portions of the US Armed Forces serving under [[MAAG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeiairstation.com/index_files/Page427.htm|title=MAAG Taiwan|website=www.taipeiairstation.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their families stationed in Taiwan lived&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ustdc.blogspot.tw/2010/03/more-tien-mou-housing-photos.html|title=More Tien Mou Housing Photos|website=ustdc.blogspot.tw|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ustdc.blogspot.tw/2008/08/tien-mou-housing.html|title=Tien Mou Housing|website=ustdc.blogspot.tw|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tianmu. Middle- to lower-ranking US servicemen resided within present-day Tianmu, while higher-ranking officers [[Yangmingshan American Military Housing|resided]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sixstar.moc.gov.tw/eng-2011/caseStudyAction.do?method=doDetail&amp;&amp;engId=919|title=Taiwan Community Platform ::: MINISTRY OF CULTURE 文化部 台灣社區通|website=sixstar.moc.gov.tw|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://taipeisignalarmy.blogspot.tw/2012/03/h-housing-grass-mountain-yangmingshan.html|title=H Housing, Grass Mountain, (Yangmingshan), Then And Now|website=taipeisignalarmy.blogspot.tw|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in neighboring [[Yangmingshan]]. Other than military housing and recreation, significant portions of modern-day Tianmu were designated for housing developments created for [[USAID]] workers and foreign civilians. As of the 1980s relatively few of these Western style developments and buildings remain as they have been replaced by multi-storey apartment blocks. The road layout in Tianmu still aligns to the former Western style neighborhoods.

With the withdrawal of the US military in 1979, the [[Bank of Taiwan]] re-purposed the former sites by leasing them to [[Taipei American School]] and [[Taipei Japanese School]]. With the further creation of [[Taipei European School]], Tianmu has continued to attract foreign residents. In addition, several of the countries which retain diplomatic relationships with Taiwan have their foreign embassies and consulates located in Tianmu.

Tianmu is home to Taiwan's first branch of [[Mister Donut]], a [[Mitsukoshi|Shin Kong Mitsukoshi]] department store, a [[Sogo]] department store, and a [[Takashimaya|Dayeh Takashimaya]] department store. It also hosts a number of Western restaurants, as well as specialty stores which cater to the expat community.

[[Tianmu Baseball Stadium]], which replaces the old [[Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium]], is located in Tianmu. Right next to the baseball stadium is Tianmu Sports Park. The public facility has six tennis courts, a skating rink, a few children's playgrounds, an open-air theater, four basketball courts, a jogging track, a biking path, and a multi-purpose lawn.

The '''Trinity Hill''' is the oldest surviving district of [[Minsk]], although it's not part of the downtown, rather a [[suburb]], hence another name, '''Trinity Suburb''' (''Trajeckaje pradmiescie''). The historic neighbourhood sprawls along the left bank of the [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach River]] in the southeastern part of the modern city. The [[Belarusian rouble|Belarusian 5-ruble bill]] featured an image of Trayetskaye Pradmestsye.

There are several hypotheses about the name. The most common relates it to the first [[Roman Catholic]] church in  Minsk, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Trinity and Assumption of Mary Church|be|3=Касцёл Найсвяцейшай Тройцы і Унебаўзяцця Найсвяцейшай Дзевы Марыі, Мінск}}, which was, according to a legend, founded by [[Władysław II Jagiełło]]. Another suggestion is Trinity Convent, of which little remains. 

The Trinity and Assumption church, Trinity Convent, the Ascension Monastery, the church of Sts. [[Boris and Gleb]], and a [[synagogue]] whiche existed there, have disappeared. Today it is an area of 19th-century housing, mostly restored after the ravages of [[World War II]]. Modern buildings include the [[Opera and Ballet Theatre (Minsk)|national opera and ballet theatre]] and the [[Island of Tears]] memorial.

'''''Vater telefoniert mit den Fliegen''''' (''Father's on the Phone with the Flies'') is a collection of [[collage]] poems by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning writer [[Herta Müller]] first published in 2012.&lt;ref name=Focus&gt;{{cite web |title=Herta Müllers „Vater telefoniert mit den Fliegen“ |url=https://www.focus.de/kultur/buecher/literatur-herta-muellers-vater-telefoniert-mit-den-fliegen_aid_810374.html |website=Focus |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=de |date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 191 collages are divided between five sections.&lt;ref name="SZ"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ottschofski |first1=Edith |title=Vom „Herzkran“ und der „Heimat zum Quadrat“ |url=https://www.siebenbuerger.de/zeitung/artikel/kultur/12624-vom-herzkran-und-der-heimat-zum.html |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=Siebenbürgischer Zeitung |date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most of Müller's work, one of the collection's underlying themes is political, stemming from her experience living under the dictatorship of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]].&lt;ref name="FNP"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ein Telefonat mit den Fliegen |url=http://www.fnp.de/nachrichten/kultur/Ein-Telefonat-mit-den-Fliegen;art679,252957 |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=Frankfurter Neue Presse |date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
