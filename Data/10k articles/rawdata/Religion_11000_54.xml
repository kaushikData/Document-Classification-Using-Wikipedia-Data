The '''Archaeological Museum of Dion''' ({{lang-el|Αρχαιολογικό Μουσείο Δίου}}) is a [[museum]] in [[Dion, Greece|Dion]] in the [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria regional unit]] of [[Central Macedonia]], [[Greece]].

The museum was established in 1983 to display excavations unearthed in the area from a 
[[Archaeological Park of Dion | fortified city]] that once stood in its place from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Museums/Archaeological_and_Byzantine/Arx_Diou.html|title=The Museums of Macedonia:Archaeological Museum of Dion|publisher=Macedonian Heritage|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artifacts of the museum were also discovered in [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], the archaeological site of ancient [[Leivithra]] and the wider Pieria regional unit. 

The shown finds are whitnesses of the [[History of Pieria (regional unit)|history of Pieria]].

The rector of the [[University of Thessaloniki]], [[Georgios Sotiriadis]], began with the first excavations from 1928 to 1931. The work was resumed by Georgios Bakalakis 30 years later. From 1973, under the direction of Professor [[Dimitrios Pandermalis]], larger areas of the city were excavated. The works are still continuing under the direction of the [[University of Thessaloniki]]. The museum contains many items from when the Romans lived in the area, including statues, architectural members, votive and grave monuments, coins, and many other objects found in the necropolis and the sanctuaries and baths of the ancient city on site. The water organ, the Statue of [[Dionysos]], [[Isis]] and Aphrodite Hypolympia and the Asklepios Daughters are displays of particular note.&lt;ref name="Mlahanas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/PR/DionMuseum.html|title=Archaeological Museum of Dion|first=Michael |last=Lahanas|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
[[File:Cult statue of Isis Tyche and marble votives offerings, 2nd c. AD, Archaeological Museum, Dion (6930576500).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Isis–Tyche and marble votives offerings from the 2nd century CE.]]

On the ground floor of the museum are a number of important statues, including the Statue of Dionysos, the Asklepios Daughters and many others found in the ancient baths. The votive statues of [[Isis]] and [[Aphrodite]] Hypolympia, were unearthed from the Sanctuary of Isis.&lt;ref name="Heritage"/&gt; The heads of [[Demeter]] were also found in the sanctuary. The museum also contains notable exhibits from the necropolis, including further votive offerings found in Macedonian tombs and a wide collection of wooden figurines. 

The ground floor also displays the remains and objects found on the sites of early Christian basilicas, and a notable collection of coins.&lt;ref name="Heritage"/&gt; Notable coins include a gold [[stater]] of Philip II, depicting the head of Apollo and a racing chariot with two horses, and a silver [[tetradrachm]] of [[Alexander the Great]] and a head of [[Heracles]] and the Zeus Olympios.&lt;ref name="Mlahanas"/&gt; A small cinema shows a multilingual video about the history of the excavations at Dion. Professor Pantermalis informs about the past, present and the future of the ancient site. 

The basement of the museum is devoted to objects excavated which relate a significant amount of information about the daily life of the people of ancient Dion, with objects used by them in daily life, and also includes more statues and items of worship from the surrounding regional unit.&lt;ref name="Heritage"/&gt; The museum has a wide selection of vases and jugs, ancient keys and locks and stone processing tools such as hammers and chisels.&lt;ref name="Mlahanas"/&gt; A number of notable mosaics were also discovered in a complex known as the Dionysos House.&lt;ref name="Mlahanas"/&gt; Of particular note is the item known as the Mosaic of Dionysus. However the special feature, given its own room on the upper floor, is the ''[[hydraulis]]'' or water organ, which is the first organ of its kind found in Greece and the oldest found to date anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="Heritage"/&gt; The organ was described by [[Hero of Alexandria]] and [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref name="Heritage"/&gt;

On a stone slab there are also the remains of an alliance agreement between the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and the citizens of [[Lysimacheia]] in [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name="Mlahanas"/&gt;

==Statues and other finds of the sanctuaries, churches and houses==

===Large thermal baths - Asklepios sanctuary===

Among the remains of the great thermal baths were several statues representing [[Asklepios]], the healer and protector of the body, and parts of his family. Next to his wife [[Epione]] were statues of his sons Podaleirios and Machaon. From his daughters, statues of Hygieia, Panakeia, Akeso and Iaso were found.

===The Isis sanctuary===

From the second century BC, The Isis cult began to replace the [[Artemis]] cult. There were statues of Isis Tyche, Isis Lochia, the goddess of birth, and Aphrodite Hypolympiada. A statue of Julia Phrougiane Alexandra stood upright on the base of the excavations. Furthermore, statuettes of [[Harpokrates]], the companion of the Isis, and stone tables showing footprints of different sizes (possibly of men and women) are exhibited. In addition to the representations of persons, one found the upper part of a well frame as well as cult objects such as a millstone, a fruit press and a small altar.

===The Demeter sanctuary===

It is the oldest sanctuary in Dion to date, and dates back to the 6th century BC. On the site, cult objects, clay figures, lamps, vases and coins were found. Exhibited in the museum are parts of statues from different eras. Thus a head of the Demeter from the 4th century BC, And a head of Aphrodite from the 1st century. AD. The Roman copy of a statue of Artemis (original from the 4th century BC) was found in the spring of the river Baphyras and is exhibited under the designation "Artemis Baphyria".

===Sanctuary of Zeus Olympios===

A statue of [[Perseus]], the last king of Macedonia (reign from 179 to 168 BC), and stone writing plaques are exhibited in the museum. 

* A letter of King [[Antigonus Gonatas]] to Agasikles. The 16 lines of the letter from the 3rd century BC, the treatment of a dispute between Noumenios and his children. It was about the use and possession of a large plot.
* A letter King Philips V to the magistrate of Dion from the year 180 BC, Eurylochos, was urged to recognize the religious status of the city of [[Cyzicus]] in [[Asia Minor]] as a religious place. At that time a religious place was not subject to any secular rule.
* Fragments of a writing tablet (around 200 BC) confirming an alliance between King Philip V and the citizens of Lysimacheia. On the fragments is written the oath which was given by the ambassadors of the citizenship of Lysimacheia. Another fragment refers to a condition of the alliance, namely, the prohibition of alliances with one of the two pacting parties hostile camps.
* A letter of king Philip V (206-205 BC) to the citizens of the Thessalian cities [[Pherrai]] and [[Demetrias]]. It defines the border between the two cities on the basis of specific local conditions.
* Confirmation of an alliance between King Perseus and the [[Boetians]] (172 BC). From this connection Perseus promised support against the Romans. The Roman historian [[Livy]] noted that there are three stone steles on which this pact was written down. One of them stood in Theben, the center of Boeotia. a second stele stood in [[Delphi]] and a third in a famous place whose name was not handed down. The discovery of the missing, third stele in Dion testifies to the importance of the city at that time. [1]
* 
===The sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistus===

Exhibited objects of this sanctuary are cultic statues of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] as well as two stone statuettes of sitting eagles.

===Other exhibits===

From early Christian times, stone reliefs, crucifixes and objects of the liturgy can be seen. From the Leda House, a fully preserved marble table, supported by a lion statue, is exhibited. In addition to numerous other statues and statuettes, a mosaic from the Villa of Dionysus is depicted, which represents a Medusa head in a circular frame.

==Coins==
[[File:Dion654a_ancient_organ.jpg|thumb|The hydraulis]]

The most varied coins found in Dion during the excavation are displayed. Among them was the γold stater, which was the most important currency of the Balkans and of Europe and had a value of two γολδ drachms. The silver four drachma coin (τετράδραχημον), which Alexander the Great minted, was common throughout the East of his empire. A chart on the lower floor of the museum shows on a time axis the respectively marked coins in connection with the ruling kings of Macedonia.

The predominant material for coin production was silver. It was mainly heavy, precious, silver coins, of which pieces were found in Mesopotamia, Egypt or the Levant, and also smaller coins, thought to for the payments of daily life, were minted.

In addition to the usual means of payment, coins showing gods such as Zeus, Athene or Artemis were found.

===Macedonian Coinage===

In northern Greece, coins were introduced as an exchange medium quite early. Due to precious metal mines on the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula and the [[Pangaion Mountain]]s, enough raw materials were available for the coinage. In the first half of the 5th century BC, Alexander I established the coinage in the Macedonian kingdom. The main reason for this step was to pay taxes to the Persians. By expanding his kingdom to the east, Alexander I brought more mines, in the vicinity of [[Philippi]], under his control. The yield from these mines alone was estimated as a talent silver (about 26 kg) per day. Depending on the availability of the raw material silver, the coins were produced either from pure silver, or from a silver alloy with admixture of other metals. From the 5th century BC onwards, Two currencies existed in parallel. Heavy and valuable coins for foreign trade and smaller, lesser value, for payments within Macedonia. By the end of the fifth century, the smaller silver coins were gradually replaced by bronze coins. [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]] continued to expand the Macedonian state, gaining control over other mines. Next to the minting-house in [[Pella]], another, probably in [[Amphipolis]], was built. From this time gold coins were also manufactured according to the Attic standard (see Attic talent) introduced by Philip II.

A special coin category is the so-called ghost coins (Greek δανακέ, danake). They consist of gold leaf and were put into the mouths of the dead to pay the ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]. This, according to Greek mythology, brought the dead across a river into the realm of Hades.&lt;ref&gt;Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation USA: ''Gods and Mortals at Olympus.'' Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, page 46, {{ISBN|978-0-9906142-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pieces found in Dion and its surroundings date back to the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, Chr.

=== The Roman Coinage ===

After the emergence of the Roman Empire (31 BC) Rome secured the sole right to the coinage of gold coins. The Aureus was the only gold coin in circulation. It was used for payments in foreign trade and for the payment of high officials of the Roman state. As an internal currency, the denarius was in circulation. The production of silver coins in Macedonia was discontinued, possibly bronze coins for local trade were still produced. Also in Dion was a local minting area; during the excavations many of these coins were found.

A further innovation of the Roman coin was that for the first time all coins had a uniform appearance.

==The Hydraulis==
{{Main article|Hydraulis of Dion}}
In the summer of 1992, the hydraulic organ (ὓδραυλις, ''[[hydraulis]]'') was found in excavations within the remains of a building, which is situated opposite the villa of Dionysos. It is one of the most important exhibits of the museum and dates from the 2nd century AD. It corresponds to the instruments mentioned by [[Heron of Alexandria]] and [[Vitruvius]]. The organ pipes are arranged in two rows and consist of 24 additional and 16 narrower pipes. They were decorated with silver rings. The body of the organ was decorated with silver stripes and multi-colored, rectangular glass ornaments. The instrument found in Dion is the only find of its kind in Greece; It is the oldest, so far discovered specimen of the world.

==Tools and items of daily use==

Construction materials such as floor tiles, roof tiles, bricks, clay and lead pipes are exhibited. Pottery household vessels, containing oil or wine, were produced with the help of pottery wheels and burnt in kilns. The processing traces of various tools are illustrated on marble pieces. A variety of different chisels are displayed, in addition to which one can directly see the effects of processing the material on the marble. A small loom illustrates how fabrics were made. Mortars and pestles are exposed on stone tools.

A plow from the third century AD, which was found south of the Hellenistic theater, should be mentioned separately. From the 1st century BC, A hand scale was found which was very finely adjustable. Also from the 1st century BC, is a speculum, an instrument used for gynecological examinations.

A model of the [[hypocaust]] shows how the thermal baths of the city were heated.

==Exhibits from the surrounding area==

===Excavation Pigi Athinas===

This excavation lies at the eastern foot of the lower Olympus. The presence of people was proofed from the first half of the 7th millennium BC. First settlements date from the time of the Middle and Late [[Neolithic Period]] (5600 - 4500 BC). Some thousand years later (2100 - 1050 BC) hill graves (tumuli) were excavated. The central tomb was considerably larger and deeper than the surrounding tombs, indicating a special status of the deceased.

A Roman cemetery from the 4th century AD consists of 16 graves for 12 adults and 4 children. The numerous grave attachments (Kterismata) were completely preserved.

===Excavations of Tribina===

Named after the river Tribina (or Derbina), the remains of a settlement dating from the time around 2500 BC. were unearthed. From the [[Mycenaean era]] there are 24 tombs, in which either individual persons or up to three persons were buried. The tombs do not have a uniform shape, but they have grave attachments such as vessels, weapons and jewelery.

===Excavation Pigi Artemidos===
[[File:Schlafendes Mädchen.jpg|thumb|The sleeping girl]]
Located at the foot of Mount Olympus; The first traces of the presence of people dating around the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. A [[tumuli]] from the late [[Bronze Age]] was surrounded by a stone ring (10 m diameter). Within the hill grave nine separate graves were found. The tumuli was marked by the collection and arrangement of stones in a certain form (Sema).

===The tombs of Katerini===

Two graves (named grave "A" and grave "B") were discovered two kilometers north of [[Katerini]]. Grave "A" consists of two rectangular chambers with a marble door between the burial chamber and the antechamber. This type of Macedonian grave is the forerunner of the great Macedonian tombs because it lacks the artistic façade which is usually found in Macedonian tombs. It was covered by a flat roof. Grave "B" is smaller and has only one burial chamber. Though the graves were stripped long ago, impressive grave remains, exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.

===The excavations of Pydna===

Near Makrygialos a skull of a girl was found during excavation from 1994 to 1996, in tomb 108. It had died quite young, because it had not yet a fully developed dentition. For her funeral, she was decorated with a bronze diadem. Next she wore a bronze bracelet, three finger rings, a necklace, and metal fittings on her belt. Archaeologists gave her the name "sleeping girl". There were three Mycenaean clay vessels among the burial objects. Diademes of the kind the girl wore them were very rare as burial gifts for girls or young women. They underline the rank of the deceased.

==Outbuildings==

===The Archaiothiki===

The [[Dionysus mosaic, Dion|Dionysus mosaic]] is exhibited in this building, which is located west of the museum and was completed in 2007. From a gallery the mosaic can be viewed from all sides. In showcases the visitor is presented the latest finds from excavations from Dion and surrounding ancient sites. A video informs about the dismantling of the mosaic at its site, the transport to the Archaiothiki and the subsequent restoration. The building was built especially for the exhibition of the Dionysus mosaic.

===The laboratory===

South of Archaeothiki is the scientific laboratory. It is operated by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

===Storage building===

Southeast of the museum, archaeological finds from Dion, Leivithra and the surrounding area are stored in a long-stretched building. In a workshop, professional staff deal with the cataloging and cleaning of the finds. Repairs of broken pottery are performed on an all-round table.

An '''archdeacon''' is a senior clergy position in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]], [[St Thomas Christians]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]] and some other [[Christian denomination]]s, above that of most [[clergy]] and below a [[bishop]]. In the [[High Middle Ages]] it was the most senior diocesan position below a bishop in the [[Catholic Church]]. An archdeacon is often responsible for administration within an archdeaconry, which is the principal subdivision of the [[diocese]]. The ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' has defined an archdeacon as "A cleric having a defined administrative authority delegated to him by the bishop in the whole or part of the diocese."&lt;ref name = "autogenerated79"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church | editor-first = FL | editor-last = Cross | place = London | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1957 | page = 79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The office has often been described metaphorically as that of ''oculus episcopi'', the "bishop's eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Medieval History |url=http://www.third-millennium-library.com/MedievalHistory/Cambridge/I/VI-Church.html |volume=I |chapter=VI.

{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
{{see also|Catholic Church hierarchy}}
In the Latin [[Catholic Church]], the post of archdeacon, originally an ordained deacon (rather than a priest), was once one of great importance as a senior official of a diocese. The duties are now performed by officials such as auxiliary or coadjutor bishops, the [[vicar general]], and the [[episcopal vicar]]s. The title remains.

The term "archdeacon" appears for the first time in [[Optatus of Mileve]]'s history of [[Donatism]] of about 370, in which he applies it to someone who lived at the beginning of that century. From the office of the ''diaconus episcopi'', a deacon whom the bishop selected to administer the church's finances under the bishop's personal direction, the office of archdeacon gradually developed, as certain functions were reserved to him by law. These functions included not only financial administration but also the discipline of the clergy, and examination of candidates for priesthood. From the 8th century, there was in the West a further development of the authority of the archdeacon, who now enjoyed a jurisdiction independent of the bishop. 

Large dioceses had several archdeaconries, in each of which the archdeacon, had an authority comparable to that of the bishop. Frequently they were appointed not by the bishop but by the [[cathedral chapter]] or the king. However, from the 13th century, efforts were made to limit their authority. This was effected in part by the institution of the new office of vicar general, who would be a priest rather than a deacon. In 1553, the [[Council of Trent]] removed entirely the independent powers of archdeacons. Those who had been in charge of different parts of the diocese gradually ceased to be appointed. Only the archdeacon associated with the cathedral chapter continued to exist as an empty title, with duties almost entirely limited to liturgical functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01693a.htm Johann Peter Kirsch, "Archdeacon" in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (New York 1907)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/a2/archdeacon.html "Archdeacon" in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of archdeacon is still conferred on a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of various cathedral chapters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limerickdioceseheritage.org/Diocese/Chapter.htm Diocese of Limerick: Chapter of Limerick]&lt;/ref&gt; and the word "archdeacon" has been defined in relation to the Latin Catholic Church as "a title of honour conferred only on a member of a cathedral chapter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/archdeacon Dictionary.com, based on Random House Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Archdeacon#Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches|Eastern Catholic Churches still utilize archdeacons]].

==Anglican Communion==
{{See also|List of archdeacons in the Church of England|List of archdeacons in the Church in Wales}}
Archdeacons serve the church within a diocese by taking particular responsibility for buildings, including church buildings, the welfare of clergy and their families and the implementation of diocesan policy for the sake of the Gospel within an archdeaconry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gloucestercathedral.org.uk/index.php?page=the-chapter |title= The chapter |publisher= Gloucester cathedral | accessdate= 2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An archdeaconry is a territorial division of a diocese; these vary in number according to the size of the diocese and in a few cases an assistant bishop in a diocese will also fulfil the duties of an archdeacon in part of it, as in the [[Archdeaconry of Bodmin]] 1953–62 (the Archdeaconry of Bodmin is one of two archdeaconries in the [[Diocese of Truro]]). Recently, this type of dual role has only existed in the [[Bishop of Ludlow|Bishop suffragan]](-[[Archdeacon of Ludlow|Archdeacon]]) of Ludlow.

An archdeacon is usually styled ''[[Venerable#Anglicanism|The Venerable]]'' instead of the usual clerical style of ''[[The Reverend]]''. In the [[Church of England]] the position of an archdeacon can only be held by a priest who has been ordained for at least six years. (This rule was introduced in 1840; the requirement that an archdeacon be in priest's orders was enacted in 1662.)&lt;ref name = "autogenerated79" /&gt; In the Church of England, the legal act by which a priest becomes an archdeacon is called a ''[[Collation (Christianity)|collation]]''. If that archdeaconry is annexed to a canonry of the cathedral, the archdeacon will also be ''[[Installation (Christianity)|installed]]'' (placed in a stall) at that cathedral.

In some other Anglican churches archdeacons can be deacons instead of priests; such archdeacons often work with the bishop to help with deacons' assignments to congregations and assist the bishop at ordinations and other diocesan liturgies. The Anglican ordinal presupposes that the functions of archdeacons include those of examining candidates for ordination and then presenting them to the ordaining bishop.&lt;ref name="autogenerated79" /&gt; In some parts of the Anglican Communion where women cannot be consecrated as [[bishop]]s, the position of archdeacon is effectively the most senior office a female cleric can hold: this being the current situation, for example, in the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney#Women's ordination|Anglican Diocese of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | format = profile | title = Archdeacon Narelle Jarrett|url = http://sydneyanglicans.net/seniorclergy/archdeacon_jarrett/profile | publisher =Anglican Diocese of Sydney|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very rarely, "lay archdeacons" have been appointed, most notably in the case of the former Anglican Communion Observer to the [[United Nations]], Archdeacon Taimalelagi Fagamalama Tuatagoloa-Leota, who retained her title after having served as Archdeacon of [[Samoa]].

==Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches==
[[File:Archdeacon by Repin.jpg|thumb|250px|Archdeacon. Painting by [[Ilya Repin]] (1877)]]
In the Eastern Christian churches ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]), an archdeacon is the senior deacon within a diocese and has responsibility for serving at hierarchical services (those at which the bishop is present and presiding). He has responsibility for ensuring the smooth running of the service by directing the clergy and servers as appropriate. As such, he usually travels with the ruling bishop to various parts of the diocese, and will sometimes act as his secretary and cell attendant, ensuring that he is able to balance his monastic life with his hierarchical duties. The archdeacon wears the double [[orarion]], which is twice the length of the usual orarion, and wraps under the right arm as well as hanging from the left shoulder. An archdeacon may come from either the monastic or married clergy.

A protodeacon also wears the double orarion, although he is distinguished from the archdeacon in that he is the senior deacon at a cathedral or other principal church within a diocese and serves as the principal deacon when a number of deacons serve together.

==Saint Thomas Christians==
According to the canons of the Eastern churches, an archdeacon is of the highest priestly rank: he is the head of all the clerics belonging to a bishopric; he is responsible for the whole worship of the cathedral church and represents the will of the bishop in his absence. However, from the local point of view, the rank of an archdeacon was more important than this; not only was he the most important priest of the community, but he also fulfilled the role of an [[ethnarch]]. An archdeacon was the "prince and head of the Christians of Saint Thomas" and had such titles as "Archdeacon and Gate of All India, Governor of India". The origin and the meaning of the term "gate" is mysterious. One might suppose that it is a Christological title: "I am the Gate of the sheep" ([[Gospel of John]] 10:7). While the Catholicos Patriarch of Seleucia-Ctesiphon reserved for himself the right to send his own prelates originating from Iraq to the Indian diocese, the continuous governance of his Indian flock was secured by the indigenous Archdeacon serving as the head of all the priests in Malabar and representing the bishop's will.

According to the traditional structure, the Indian Church of the East was governed by a metropolitan sent by the Catholicos Patriarch. At the same time, at the local level, in India, church affairs were governed by the Malabar Assembly or ''Malankara Yogam''. There was also an indigenous head of the Church of Malabar, the "head of the caste", that is the head of the St Thomas Christians called ''Jathikku Karthavyan'' or ''Malankara Mooppen''. Patriarch Timothy (780–826) of Persia called him the head of the faithful in India.

While originally an archdeacon in the Church of the East was elected by the bishop according to merit, the office of the Archdeacon of India seems to have been dynastic. It was the privilege of the Pakalomattam family, at least from the sixteenth century onwards. Indeed, we know about a number of Pakalomattam archdeacons, beginning with 1502, when Metropolitan John of India appointed George Pakalomattam. The name of the family varies, and the family seems to be identical with the Parambil family, translated into Portuguese as 'de Campo'.

An archdeacon had all the attributes of a secular leader and was normally escorted by a number, sometimes several thousands, of soldiers. It is important to note that while there could be several bishops appointed for the Malabar Church, there was always only one archdeacon, a custom contrary to the canons of the Church of the East. This situation is best explained by the fact that from the point of view of the [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] Church structure the archdeacon had an ecclesiastical function, but from that of the St Thomas Christian community he had also a socio-political, princely function, representing the unity of the Christian nation, or caste(s), of Hindoo (India). Portuguese colonists stopped this practice among the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic]] and Pulikkottil Mar Dionysious stopped this amongst the [[Malankara Syrian Church]] later in 1816.

==Coptic Christians==

In the [[Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Coptic Catholic]] Churches, the Archdeacon is the highest rank in the order of deacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ranks of the Deaconate|url=http://www.smass.co.uk/ranks-of-the-deaconate|publisher=St. Mary &amp; St. Shenouda's Coptic Orthodox Church, South London|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower ranks of the diaconate are [[Deacon]], [[Subdeacon]], [[Lector]] and [[Cantor (Christianity)|Cantor]], the holders of all of which ranks the Coptic people generically refer to as ''deacons''. However, the rank of archdeacon is lower than the rank of a [[Priest#Christianity|priest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SACRAMENT OF PRIESTHOOD|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/7_priesthood.html|publisher=St. Mark Coptic Church, Jersey City, NJ|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is possible for a [[deaconess]] to be ordained to the rank of an archdeaconess within the Coptic tradition.

In some [[Occult]] and similar writings, an '''archdemon''' (also spelled '''archdaemon''') is a spiritual entity, prominent in the [[Hell|infernal]] hierarchy as a leader of demons.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Bane, Encyclopedia of Demons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the archdemons are the evil counterparts of the [[archangel]]s.

==Christian traditions==
Archdemons are described as the leaders of [[demon]]ic hosts, just as archangels lead [[Hierarchy of angels|choirs of angels]]. Based upon the writings of [[Saint Paul]] (Col. 1:16; Eph. 1:21) the angelic court had been constructed by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and comprised nine orders of angels with three orders each to three hierarchies.

The First Hierarchy consists of: [[Seraphim]], [[Cherubim]] and [[Thrones]]. The Second Hierarchy consists of: Dominions, Virtues and Powers.  The Third Hierarchy consists of: Principalities, [[Archangels]] and [[Angels]].  This system of classifying angels has been accepted by the majority of Christian scholars.  However, no similar consensus has been reached on the 
[[classification of demons]].  This is largely due to the fact that, historically, the definition of what an archdemon is and the names of those demons has varied greatly over time.

One common medieval classification associate the [[seven deadly sins]] with archdemons:&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica: Macropædia'' 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-852-29529-8}} page 411&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lucifer]]: pride
* [[Mammon]]: greed
* [[Asmodeus]]: lust
* [[Leviathan]]: envy
* [[Beelzebub]]: gluttony
* [[Satan]]: wrath 
* [[Belphegor]]: sloth&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology, By Rosemary Guiley, p. 28-29, Facts on File, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Occult]] tradition, there is controversy regarding which demons should be classed as archdemons. During different ages, some demons were historically "promoted" to archdemons, others were completely forgotten, and new ones were created. In ancient [[Judaism|Jewish]] lore, many of the [[Paganism|pagan]] gods of neighboring cultures were identified as extremely pernicious demons in order to prevent Jews from worshiping them.

Therefore, the pagan deity [[Baal|Ba'al]] was reinterpreted as the archdemon [[Baal (demon)|Bael]] or [[Beelzebub]], and the pagan deity [[Astarte]] was reinterpreted as the archdemon [[Astaroth]].  These two in particular were seen as some of the worst enemies of [[God]].  By the Middle Ages, these pagan deities were no longer worshiped, so their characterizations as archdemons were no longer important, but they still persisted anyway. New archdemons were invented over time, most of them revolving around [[Satan]] and the [[Antichrist]].

==Arabic and Middle Eastern occultism==
[[File:Book of Wonders folio 32a.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Maymūn, the demon king of Saturday]]
[[Ahmad al-Buni]] qualified four kings of [[Ifrit|infernal demons]]  named ''Mudhib'', ''Maimun'', ''Barqan'' and ''al-Ahmar'', as archdemons paralleling the hierarchy of [[Archangel#In Islam|archangels]] in [[Islam]]. Each of them has their own [[Shaitan|demons]] under command. These kings are identified with different days of the week. Their names are sometimes inscribed in [[Talisman]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling ''Robert Lebling'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroastrism==
According to [[Zoroastrian]] [[Dualism (philosophy)|dualistism]], the world is created by two opposing forces. The ''good'' deity [[Ahura Mazda]] created  everything good, but for everything good created [[Ahriman]] created an evil coutnerpart. These results in the existence of seven Archdemons, who in return command a countless numbers of [[Daeva|demons]]. These archdemons stay in exact oppostion to the [[Amesha Spenta]].&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Nigosian, Solomon Alexander Nigosian

==Demon Kings of the Ars Goetia==
[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]], an anonymous 17th century grimoire, lists 72 of the most powerful and prominent demons of Hell in its first part, the ''Ars Goetia''. Satan himself is not mentioned among them considering his overall dominion of Hell as the ''Prince of Darkness''. Below him, The Ars Goetia suggests, are the four kings of the cardinal directions who have power over the seventy-two, next the kings, and onward with other demons with lower monarchic titles. The four kings of the cardinal directions are the primary point of contention between different editions and translations, and occultist writers. The common composition of the kings is:
* King of the East: Amaymon
* King of the West: Corson
* King of the North: Ziminiar
* King of the South: Gaap
* King [[Baal (demon)|Bael]]
* King [[Paimon]]
* King Beleth
* King Purson
* King [[Asmodeus|Asmodey]]
* King Viné
* King Balam
* King Zagan
* King [[Belial]]

An '''Asherah pole''' is a sacred [[tree]] or pole that stood near [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] religious locations to honor the [[Ugaritic]] mother-goddess [[Asherah]], consort of [[El (deity)|El]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ed. ''Religions of the Ancient World'', (Belnap Press, Harvard) 2004, p. 418; a book-length scholarly treatment is W.L. Reed, ''The Asherah in the Old Testament'' (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press) 1949; the connection of the pillar figurines with Asherah was made by [[Raphael Patai]] in ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of the literary references to an ''asherah'' and archaeological finds of Judaean pillar-figurines has engendered a literature of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized and sharply criticized in Raz Kletter's ''The Judean Pillar-Figurines and the Archaeology of Asherah'' (Oxford: Tempus Reparatum), 1996; Kletter gives a catalogue of material remains.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''asherim''' were also [[cult object]]s related to the worship of the [[fertility god]]dess Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud|Kuntillet ‘Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom attest, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]],&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Dever, "Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet ʿAjrûd" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'',1984; D.N. Freedman, "Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1987; [[Morton Smith]], "God Male and Female in the Old Testament: Yahweh and his Asherah" ''Theological Studies'', 1987; J.M. Hadley "The Khirbet el-Qom Inscription", ''Vetus Testamentum'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and thus objects of contention among competing cults. In translations that render the Hebrew ''asherim'' into English as "Asherah poles," the insertion of "''pole''" [[begs the question]] by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: "we are never told exactly what it was", observes John Day.{{sfn|Day|1986|pp=401–04}} Though there was certainly a movement against goddess-worship at the Jerusalem Temple in the time of [[Josiah|King Josiah]] (2 Chronicles 34:3), it did not long survive his reign, as the following four kings "did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh" (2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19){{cn|date=September 2017}}. Further exhortations came from [[Jeremiah]]. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite [[folk religion]] was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic, and it was the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles who were the innovators;&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, ''Did God have a wife?: Archaeology and folk religion in ancient Israel'', 2005, esp. pp&lt;/ref&gt; such theories inspire ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Ahituv (2006), ''Did God have a wife?'', ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Book Review&lt;/ref&gt;

==References from the Hebrew Bible==
Asherim are mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], the [[Books of Kings]], the second [[Book of Chronicles]], and the books of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], and [[Book of Micah|Micah]]. The term often appears as merely ''אשרה'', (''Asherah'') referred to as "groves" in the [[King James Version]], which follows the [[Septuagint]] rendering as ἄλσος, pl. ἄλση, and the [[Vulgate]] ''lucus'',{{sfn|Day|1986|p=401}} and "poles" in the [[New Revised Standard Version]]; no word that may be translated as "poles" appears in the text. Scholars have indicated, however, that the plural use of the term (English "Asherahs", translating Hebrew ''Asherim'' or ''Asherot'') provides ample evidence that reference is being made to objects of worship rather than a transcendent figure.&lt;ref&gt;van der Toorn, Becking, van der Horst (1999), ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in The Bible'', Second Extensively Revised Edition, pp. 99-105, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-8028-2491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] suggests that the poles were made of wood. In the sixth chapter of the [[Book of Judges]], God is recorded as instructing the [[Israelite]] judge [[Gideon]] to cut down an Asherah pole that was next to an altar to [[Baal]]. The wood was to be used for a burnt offering.

Deuteronomy 16:21 states that [[YHWH]] (rendered as "the {{Sc|L|ord}}") hated ''Asherim'' whether rendered as poles: "Do not set up any [''wooden''] Asherah [''pole'']&lt;ref&gt;''Wooden'' and ''pole'' are translators' interpolations in the text, which makes no such characterisation of ''Asherah''.&lt;/ref&gt; beside the altar you build to the {{Sc|L|ord}} your God" or as living trees: "You shall not plant any tree as an Asherah beside the altar of the Lord your God which you shall make".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/16-21.htm Various translations of Deuteronomy 16.21 compared].&lt;/ref&gt; That Asherahs were not always living trees is shown in 1 Kings 14:23: "their asherim, beside every luxuriant tree".{{sfn|Day|1986|p=402|ps=&amp;nbsp;– "Which would be odd if the Asherim were themselves trees", noting that there is general agreement that the ''asherim'' were man-made objects}} However, the record indicates that the Jewish people often departed from this ideal. For example, King [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] placed an Asherah pole in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]] (2 Kings 21:7). King [[Josiah|Josiah's]] reforms in the late 7th century BC included the destruction of many Asherah poles (2 Kings 23:14).

[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:13 states: "Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherim [Asherah poles]."

==Asherah poles in biblical archaeology==
Some biblical archaeologists have suggested that until the 6th century BC the Israelite peoples had household shrines, or at least figurines, of Asherah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neill|first=James|title=The origins and role of same-sex relations in human societies|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3513-5 |page=96 |quote=In fact, the worship of Baal and Asherah persisted among the Israelites for over seven centuries, from the period after the conquest and settlement of Canaan — which most biblical scholars place at around 1400 B.C., to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the exile of the Israelites in Babylon in the 6th century B.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are strikingly common in the archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Israel]], and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Silberman, Neil Asher]], ''The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'', {{ISBN|0-684-86912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asuri metre is used in the Zend Aveta. They have been mentioned in the [[Yajurveda]]. Dr. Haug states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Among the metres used in the [[Yajurveda]], we find several which are marked by the epithet Asuri, e.g., Gayatri Asuri, Ushni Asuri, and Pankti Asuri. These Asur metres are actually to be found in the [[Gatha]] literature of the [[Zend Avesta]]".&lt;ref&gt;Iran Culture House, Indo Iran Cultural Society, K.R. Cama Oriental Institute (1974). يادنامۀ كوروش بمبئي: Essays on Indology and Indo-Iran Relations in Memory of Cyrus Celebration Held in the City of Bombay on the 2500th Anniversary of the Foundation of the Persian Empire, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Shukla Yajurveda mentions seven Asuri metres. The Asuri metres are embodied by the Gathas; such as the ''Gayatri asuri'' of 15 syllables in Ahunavaiti (Yas. XXXI,6; XXXI, 4), the ''Usnih asuri'' of 14 syllables in the Gatha Vohukhsathra (Yas. II); the ''Pankti asuri'' of 11 syllables in the Gathas Ustavaiti and Spenta-Mainyu.&lt;ref name="BRS"&gt;Bihar Research Society (1926). The Journal of the Bihar Research Society, Volume 12, p.129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Haug's research into the vedic and avestan metres found comparable similarities. For example the metre of Gatha Spentamainyu is Trishtubh while that of Ushtaviti Gatha is similar to vedic Trishtubh. The Ushtaviti Gatha exceeds the Trishtubh by only one pada of 11 syllables. The Yasna xxxi, verse 8 is nearest to Gayatri metre and Fargard xix to the Anushtubh. The metre of Homayasht is also near to Anushtubh.&lt;ref&gt;Ganga Prasad (2000).

'''Azriel of Gerona,''' also known as '''Azriel ben Menahem''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] '''עזריאל בן מנחם''') (c. 1160 – c. 1238), was one of the most important [[kabbalah|kabbalists]] in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] town of [[Girona]] (north of [[Barcelona]]) during the thirteenth century when it was an important center of [[Kabbalah]]. He is the teacher of the most important figure from the kabbalist community of Girona, [[Nahmanides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AZRIEL (EZRA) BEN MENAHEM (BEN SOLOMON) | author= [[Kaufmann Kohler]] &amp; [[Isaac Broydé]]| work=Jewish Encyclopedia | url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2224&amp;letter=A | accessdate=2006-10-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061016185635/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2224&amp;letter=A| archivedate= 16 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azriel was the most important student of the mystic [[Isaac the Blind]]. His writings covered subjects pertaining to the [[sefirot]] and included his mystical interpretation of Jewish liturgy and of the [[aggadah]]. He took on [[Solomon ibn Gabirol|Gabirol]]'s philosophical work to integrate it into the ten sefirot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shelomo Ben Yehuda Ibn Gabirol |work=Sephardic Sages |url=http://www.sephardiccouncil.org/sages/gabirol.html |accessdate=2006-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213003930/http://www.sephardiccouncil.org/sages/gabirol.html |archivedate=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his teacher Isaac the Blind considered Divine Thought to be the first supernatural quality to emanate from the [[Ayn Sof]] (or Eternal Being), Azriel argued that Divine Will was the first emanation. Therefore, it was the act of the will rather than the act of the intellect that was the first manifestation of God’s Eternal Being.

'''Robert Bruce Adams''' (born August 15, 1946) is a former professional [[American football]] [[tight end]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and a spokesperson for the [[Church of Scientology International]].&lt;ref name="latimes25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/25/entertainment/et-blake25|title=Why'd they do it?|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=2008-06-02|date=July 25, 2007|last=Lee|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[El Camino High School (Ventura)|El Camino High School]] during the 1960s, and was encouraged by a coach at the [[College of San Mateo]] to play football. He played for a single season at the college, during 1966, while participating in other sports at the school including [[track-and-field]] and [[basketball]]. A former coach of the College of San Mateo, [[Doug Scovil]], recruited Adams to the [[College of the Pacific]], where he received a full [[scholarship]] to play football there. By 1968, he was captain of the team's offense at the school.

He was not drafted by the National Football League, and was signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], where he played under coach [[Chuck Noll]]. In 1973 while a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Adams became a Scientologist. He said applying Scientology methodology helped his performance playing football. After seven years with the National Football League, Adams finished his pro-career as a member of the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. He subsequently took up other professions, including owning a fitness center in [[Redwood City, California]], being a [[consultant]] for [[high tech]] companies, and working as a [[teacher]].

In 2004, Adams served within the Scientology organization as senior vice president of its [[Association for Better Living and Education]] (ABLE), a [[nonprofit]] founded by Scientology members in 1988 to supervise the secular programs [[Narconon]], [[Criminon]], [[The Way to Happiness]], and [[Applied Scholastics]]. By 2006 he had become a media executive and vice president of the Church of Scientology, and worked out of the organization's facilities in [[Hollywood, California]].  He represented the Church of Scientology at the 2006 conference of the [[Religion Newswriters Association]] in [[Utah]]. Adams held the position of vice president of public affairs for the [[Church of Scientology International]] in 2009, and was a [[Reverend]] within the organization. He traveled to [[Melbourne, Australia]] in December 2009 for the [[World Religions Conference]]. He continued to serve as vice president of the Church of Scientology International in 2010, and was one of four officials listed as spokespersons for the church.

The principal part is auditing, but the physical activity is very extrovertive for the individual and is found to be very therapeutic in itself."&lt;ref name="goodyear" /&gt; Adams was interviewed on the [[National Public Radio]] program ''[[Morning Edition]]'' in 2008 about the activism against Scientology by the [[Internet]]-based protest group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]; he referred to the group as "cyber criminals", and commented: "It's very reminiscent of days gone by and current days with the KKK, wearing masks, hiding, having secret meetings on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Kim|author2=[[Renee Montagne]] |work=[[Morning Edition]]|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|title='Anonymous' Wages Attack on Scientologists|date=February 7, 2008|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18764756&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1001|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bubasteum''' was a [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman Egypt|Roman]] temple complex dedicated to [[Bastet]] in the cliff face of the desert boundary of [[Saqqara]]. In [[Arabic]] the place is called '''Abwab el-Qotat''' (''"The Gates of the Cats"'').&lt;ref name="ankhtaouy"/&gt;

The temple complex is surrounded by a 275 meter wide and 325 metre long [[enclosure wall]] and is located southeast of the [[Pyramid of Teti]] and south of the [[Anubieum]]. It had a large entrance way in the south wall, a feline necropolis and settlements.  In the [[New Kingdom]], the location  was already the site of a temple of Bastet, who was honoured as the ''Lady of Ankhtawy''.

Proper investigation of the site was begun in 1976 by  [[Alain-Pierre Zivie]] and the first excavations began in 1980. In 1986, the Mission Archéologique Française du Bubasteion (MAFB), was founded, which has overseen all investigations of the site since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypogees.org/pages/francais/mission.htm|title=Hypogées - Mission Archéologique Française du Bubasteion à Saqqara|website=www.hypogees.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feline necropolis ==
[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|thumb|Mummified cat]]
In the second half of the [[18th Dynasty]], high dignitaries created [[rock-cut tomb]]s for themselves in this area, which were later reused as cat-[[catacombs]]. To date, more than a hundred cat [[mummy|mummies]] and thousands of cat bones have been found. The cat cemetery developed in the second half of the first millennium BC became as important as the cat cemetery at [[Bubastis]]. [[Radiographic]] investigations showed that the majority of cats were killed at a young age by either strangulation or by violent blows on their skulls. Several examined packets contained only a few cat bones, and others even no bones at all, but only clay and pebbles. The cats were [[mummified]] in two different manners. In the one, the legs and tail were bound and wrapped close to the body; in the other, head, body, legs and tail were separately wrapped in cloth, some with eyes and ears added. Some mummies were found in wooden or stone [[sarcophagi]]. Some were even buried with kittens, sculptures, jewellery and [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name=Zivie2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Zivie, A. and Lichtenberg, R. |year=2005 |title=Divine Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo | pages=106-119 |editor=Ikram, S. |chapter=The Cats of the Goddess Bastet |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=zz5oNwmdaTcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA106&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummification procedure was quite basic: the animal was simply dried out without removing the innards. The priests perhaps sold pilgrims mummies of different qualities.&lt;ref name="bub"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypogees.org/pages/francais/bubasteion.htm|title=Hypogées - Mission Archéologique Française du Bubasteion à Saqqara|website=www.hypogees.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]'s wet-nurse [[Maia (nurse)|Maia]] found on the site in 1996, a lion skeleton was excavated in 2001.&lt;ref name=Zivie2005/&gt; The lion was considered a manifestation of the god [[Maahes]], son of Bastet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vistaverde.de/news/Wissenschaft/0401/14_leomumie.htm|title=Unter Katzen: Löwenmumie in Ägypten entdeckt - vista verde|website=www.vistaverde.de|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tombs ==
[[File:Aperel.png|thumb|Wall painting from the tomb of Aperel]]
On the south side of the Bubasteum, near the excavation headquarters of the French mission, is a [[Steilhang]], which contains two levels of tombs. These were created by high officials in the 18th and [[19th Dynasty|19th Dynasties]] and were plundered in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]]. After this they were remodelled and reused for the cat mummies from the nearby sanctuary of Bastet. Two of these tombs were discovered in the early 1980s and the rest have been uncovered more recently. The majority of the graves are carved from the rock face, but some are built of high-value [[Tura, Egypt|Tura]] limestone. The decoration is very diverse, often differing significantly within individual tombs. It consists mainly of reliefs, as well as paintings which vary from good to exceptional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypogees.org/pages/francais/tombes.htm|title=Hypogées - Mission Archéologique Française du Bubasteion à Saqqara|website=www.hypogees.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the items discovered in the tombs, especially those from the tomb of [[Aperel]], are now found in the [[Imhotep Museum]] at Saqqara.

=== List of the tombs in the Bubasteum ===
The numbering of the tombs is that of the MAFB, in which the tombs of the upper level are numbered with a [[Roman numeral]] I and those of the lower level with a II. There is possibly a third level, buried under debris. After the roman numeral, the individual tombs are numbered from east to west with [[Arabic numeral]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypogees.org/pages/francais/tombes.htm|title=Hypogées - Mission Archéologique Française du Bubasteion à Saqqara|website=www.hypogees.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|oʊ|r|ᵻ|s}}; Δωρίς "bounty"), an [[Oceanid]], was a sea [[nymph]] in [[Greek mythology]], whose name represented the bounty of the sea. She was the daughter of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and the wife of [[Nereus]]. She was also aunt to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who was made to carry the sky upon his shoulders, whose mother [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]] was a sister of Doris. Doris was mother to [[Nerites (mythology)|Nerites]] and the fifty [[Nereids]], including [[Thetis]], who was the mother of [[Achilles]], and [[Amphitrite]], [[Poseidon]]'s wife, and mother of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]].

Doris when not associated with a god, was considered the fertility of the ocean, goddess of the rich fishing-grounds found at the mouths of rivers where fresh water mingled with the brine. Being an Okeanide meant she was a sister of the Rivers. Her name is connected with two words: Dôron meaning  "gift" or "abundance," and Zôros meaning the "pure" and "unmixed." Zôros was often used to describe fresh water or in terms of the teachings of the day, the pure soul of a woman, and from this derived words such as zôrua "the transference of running water" and zôrux "water conduit."{{cn|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9920">'''Farooqi''' ({{lang-ar|فاروقي}}); also [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Farooqui''', '''Faruki''' or '''Al Farooqi'''), is a distinct name or surname or last name of [[Arabic]] origin.

== Origin ==

The name purportedly signifies ancestry from Umar ibn al-Khattāb, commonly known as [[Umar]] ({{lang-ar|عمر ابن الخطاب}}), the second [[Caliph]] of [[Islam]].  Umar was also titled 'al-Farooq' (the Redeemer).' Today Farooqies are a multilingual Muslim community spread across [[Turkey]]', Romania, [[Middle East]]' and parts of [[Europe]].



== Genealogy ==
{{Main|Family tree of Umar}}

Farooqis are descendants of 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, the second Sunni Caliph (c. 581 – 644), sometimes referred by Muslims as 'Umar al-Farooq ("the one who distinguishes between right and wrong").They are descendants from the Banu Adi clan of the Quraysh tribe. Many of the relatives of the same generation were also Sahaba and his daughter [[Hafsa bint Umar]] and his grandsons were [[Salaf]].


== History of Descendants ==

Farooqis after playing a part in the Rashidun and following Caliphates, joined the Ottoman Empire and branched out to various parts of the world as generals, military or powerful spiritual leaders in various Muslim Empires and Dynasties and their further outreaches and smaller empires to spread across Middle East, Turkey and parts of Europe and South Asia. See also [[List of Muslim empires and dynasties]].

[[Muhammed Sharif al-Faruqi]], an Arab Ottoman staff officer, played a pivotal role in the events leading up to the [[Arab Revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1916.

== Spread to Levant and Turkey ==
{{Main|Farooq}}
Farooq (also transliterated as Farouk, Farook, Faruk, Faroeq, Faruq, Farouq, Farooqui or Farooqi; Arabic: فاروق, Fārūq ) is a common Arabic given and family name found in [[Levant]] and [[Turkey]]. See also [[Farooq]].

Disambiguation of Farooq and their transliterated variants were also adopted by Sunni Islam converts from Arab-Mongol empires as a name to pay respect to Umar Bin Khattab and took up the name as an honorific title.

== Farooqies in Saudi Arabia ==
In Saudi Arabia, the children of Umar ibn al-Khattāb are known as El-Umari or Al-Omery. However the Farooquis of South Asia, who went back to Saudi Arabia retained the family name Al-Farooqui or Al-Farouki.

== Farooqis in UK, USA and Canada ==
Quite a few generations of Farooqis and their variants live in USA,UK and Canada due to either migration of heavy STEM related professions. See also [http://search.ancestry.com.au/cgi-bin/sse.dll?uidh=000&amp;rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsln=Farooqui&amp;MSAV=1&amp;cp=0&amp;cpxt=0&amp;catBucket=rstp&amp;sbo=t&amp;gsbco=Sweden&amp;noredir=true&amp;gss=angs-c&amp;gl=34&amp;gst=&amp;ghc=20&amp;fh=220&amp;fsk=BEFq368IgAAH6gAP1ew-61-&amp;pgoff=11 ancestry in UK,USA and Canada.].

== Mentions in Literature ==

A 1939 book titled ''[[Al-Farooq (book)|Al-Farooq]]'' is a major publication of the Sunni literature which partly listed Umar bin Khattab's genealogy. By extensive study of the subject, the author Nomani collected and collated facts which were lying buried in unpublished manuscripts in great libraries of Istanbul, Beirut, Alexandria, Paris, Berlin and London. The popularity of the book resulted in several editions in a very short period. The book was translated in English by Maulana Zafar Ali Khan and was titled, ''Al Farooq: The Life of Omar The Great (Second Caliph of Islam).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/al-farooq-life-of-omar-the-great-the-second-caliph-of-islam/oclc/452916700 Al Farooq: The Life of Omar The Great at [[WorldCat]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hyderabad Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb]]

== Spread to South Asia ==
Adham, the father of [[Ibrahim Bin Adham]] and the great grandson of [[Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], was a great travel as narrated in the papers read in the conference on "Balad As-Shaam".  He travelled all the way up to Balkh where he married the only daughter of the King, and his son Ibrahim became the King of Balkh. His descendants got uprooted after the attack by Mongols, and most moved to the area which is now the modern day Punjab as a part of the Moghul Empire. Significant descendants of these Farooqis can be found in Afghanitsan, Pakistan and India.


=== Decline of the Moghul Empire ===
In the later days of the Moghul Empire, it had crippled and a general named Asif Jah decided to move South with his friends and form his own kingdom named State of Hyderabad. Among his friends and soldiers included Farooqies and their transliterated variants who became preachers and judges. Some took their family title "Qazi" as their family name.

The name "Farooqi" or "Farooqui" reappeared from time to time as the Nizam family grew too large, as Farooqui was more or less of a title of reference (to Umar ibn al-Khattāb) rather than a Family name until the mid 19th century. They're official residence was [[Chowmahalla Palace]]. It later grew to [[Falaknuma Palace]], [[Bashir Bagh Palace]], etc., under the Jah title.


==== The Farooqi Dynasty ====
[[Farooqi dynasty|Farooqi Dynasty]] was formed by Abdul Malik Ahmad, the son of minister Khan-i-Jahan Farooqi of [[Delhi Sultanate]]. He became a general under Feroz Shah Tugluq and then founded [[Khandesh]] (Land of Khan) to become an independent ruler. Khandesh later became a province of [[Moghul Empire]] under [[Akbar]].

==== Spread to Deccan ====
After the establishment of State of Hyderabad, many Farooquis took up the job of judges, ombudsmen, and other law professions. As per the caste systems which recognized families by profession instead of ancestry, their family name became Qazi, along with [[Sayyids]] and [[Siddiquis]] etc. However these families continued to identify themselves are Farooqis.


== Converts from Hinduism and their variants in Indian Subcontinent ==

Farooq is used in South East Asia as an honorific title to in Sunni Islam religious converts from Hinduism and other religions in regions of the Indian Subcontinent and are not related to the ancestry of Umar Bin Khattab.

Due to the 1000 years of Islamic empires such as the Moghul empire rule and other Islamic empires over Indian subcontinent, a large population of Hindus converted and adopted the title of Farooqis and their variants in South East Asia notably India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

They are also honorific titles and also known as 'Shaikhs of South Asia' that are converts from Hinduism and are not related to the ancestry of the Quraysh tribe.

== Farooqis of other affiliated variants in the Indian Subcontinent ==
These are Farooqis and their variants that are not part of Sunni Islam.

=== Farooqis in Parsee community ===
Zoroastrians of Iranian origin found in Indian regions of Maharashtra,Gujarat and Pune. A significant amount of Farooqis also exist in the state of Maharashtra,Gujarat,Pune which are part of the Parsee community, and are Zorastrians that fled from the Shah rule to avoid persecution from Muslim rule.These are Indo-Persians and are a tiny and significant but well respected minority in India. See also [[Parsi]].

=== Farooqis in Bohra community ===
Shia Muslims found in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan, and Indian regions. Quite a few Bohras live in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan and Indian regions of Maharashtra,Gujarat and Pune that identify with Farooqis as respect to Umar Bin Khattab and his name Farooq.  They are also part of the Ismaili community. See also [[Suleimani Bohra]].

== Notable Farooqis ==
* [[Umar]], Second Caliph of Islam, companion and father-in-law of Muhammad.
* [[Hafsa bint Umar]], Wife of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
* [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] brother-in-law of Muhammad through his sister Hafsa.
* [[Shaikh Salim Chisti]], Sufi Saint

Crick was an important theoretical [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]] and played a crucial role in research related to revealing the helical structure of DNA. He is widely known for the use of the term "[[central dogma of molecular biology|central dogma]]" to summarize the idea that once information is transferred from nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) to proteins, it cannot flow back to nucleic acids. In other words, the final step in the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins is irreversible.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crick FH |title=On protein synthesis |journal=Symp.

During the remainder of his career, he held the post of J.W. Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla, California]]. His later research centered on theoretical [[neurobiology]] and attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness. He remained in this post until his death; "he was editing a manuscript on his death bed, a scientist until the bitter end" according to [[Christof Koch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Shermer | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Shermer | title=Astonishing Mind: Francis Crick 1916–2004 | publisher=Skeptics Society |date=30 July 2004 | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/04-07-30.html | accessdate=25 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Crick was the first son of Harry Crick (1887–1948) and Annie Elizabeth Crick ([[née]] Wilkins; 1879–1955). He was born and raised in [[Weston Favell]], then a small village near the English town of [[Northampton]], in which Crick's father and uncle ran the family's boot and shoe factory. His grandfather, [[Walter Drawbridge Crick]] (1857–1903), an amateur [[naturalist]], wrote a survey of local [[foraminifera]] (single-celled [[protist]]s with shells), corresponded with [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Charles |last=Darwin |date=1882 |title=On the Dispersal of Freshwater Bivalves |journal=Nature |volume=25 |pages=529–30 |doi=10.1038/025529f0|bibcode = 1882Natur..25R.529D |issue=649}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had two [[gastropod]]s (snails or slugs) named after him.

At an early age, Francis was attracted to science and what he could learn about it from books. As a child, he was taken to church by his parents. But by about age 12, he said he did not want to go anymore, as he preferred a scientific search for answers over religious belief.&lt;ref name="CrickWMP"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 10: "I remember telling my mother that I no longer wished to go to church".&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Crick, his uncle, lived in a small house on the south side of Abington Avenue; he had a shed at the bottom of his little garden where he taught Crick to blow glass, do chemical experiments and to make photographic prints. When he was eight or nine he transferred to the most junior form of the [[Northampton Grammar School]], on the Billing Road. This was about {{convert|1.25|mi|0|abbr=on}} from his home so he could walk there and back, by Park Avenue South and Abington Park Crescent, but he more often went by bus or, later, by bicycle. The teacher – a Miss Holding – was an inspired teacher and made everything interesting. The teaching in the higher forms was satisfactory, but not as stimulating. After the age of 14, he was educated at [[Mill Hill School]] in London (on scholarship), where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] with his best friend John Shilston. He shared the Walter Knox Prize for Chemistry on Mill Hill School's Foundation Day, Friday, 7 July 1933. He declared that his success was inspired by the quality of teaching he received whilst a pupil at Mill Hill.

At the age of 21, Crick earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in physics from [[University College, London]].&lt;ref name="CrickWMPc1-2"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] Chapters 1 and 2 provide Crick's description of his early life and education&lt;/ref&gt; Crick had failed to gain a place at a Cambridge college, probably through failing their requirement for Latin. Crick began his PhD at [[University College London|UCL]] but was interrupted by World War II. He later became a PhD student&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Francis Harry Compton|last=Crick |title=Polypeptides and proteins : X-ray studies |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1954 |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/250994 |website=repository.cam.ac.uk |oclc=879394484 |doi= |hdl=|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.598146}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Honorary Fellow of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] and mainly worked at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] and the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in Cambridge. He was also an Honorary Fellow of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] and of University College, London.

Crick began a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] research project on measuring the [[viscosity]] of water at high temperatures (which he later described as "the dullest problem imaginable"&lt;ref name="CrickWMP13"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;) in the laboratory of physicist [[Edward Andrade|Edward Neville da Costa Andrade]] at University College London, but with the outbreak of [[World War II]] (in particular, an incident during the [[Battle of Britain]] when a bomb fell through the roof of the laboratory and destroyed his experimental apparatus),&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt; Crick was deflected from a possible career in physics. During his second year as a PhD student, however, he was awarded the Carey Foster Research Prize, a great honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olby, Robert |volume=99|issue=4|title= The Making of Modern Science: Biographical Studies |date=1970|page= 941|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did postdoctoral work at the [[Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="science20.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Michael|title=Francis Crick as Late Bloomer|url=http://www.science20.com/adaptive_complexity/blog/francis_crick_late_bloomer|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Science 2.0|publisher=ION Publications LLC|date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, he worked for the [[Admiralty Research Laboratory]], from which emerged a group of many notable scientists, including [[David Bates (physicist)|David Bates]], [[Robert Boyd (physicist)|Robert Boyd]], [[George Deacon]], [[John Currie Gunn|John Gunn]], [[Harrie Massey]], and [[Nevill Mott]]; he worked on the design of [[Electromagnetism|magnetic]] and acoustic [[Naval mine|mines]], and was instrumental in designing a new mine that was effective against German [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd021051.html |title=Bio at Wellcome Trust |publisher=Genome.wellcome.ac.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426215937/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD021051.html |archivedate=26 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-World War II life and work==
In 1947, aged 31, Crick began studying biology and became part of an important migration of physical scientists into biology research. This migration was made possible by the newly won influence of physicists such as [[John Randall (physicist)|Sir John Randall]], who had helped win the war with inventions such as [[radar]]. Crick had to adjust from the "elegance and deep simplicity" of physics to the "elaborate chemical mechanisms that natural selection had evolved over billions of years." He described this transition as, "almost as if one had to be born again." According to Crick, the experience of learning physics had taught him something important—hubris—and the conviction that since physics was already a success, great advances should also be possible in other sciences such as biology. Crick felt that this attitude encouraged him to be more daring than typical biologists who tended to concern themselves with the daunting problems of biology and not the past successes of physics{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

For the better part of two years, Crick worked on the physical properties of [[cytoplasm]] at Cambridge's [[Strangeways Research Laboratory]], headed by [[Honor Bridget Fell]], with a [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] studentship, until he joined [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. The Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge was under the general direction of [[William Lawrence Bragg|Sir Lawrence Bragg]], who had won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg was influential in the effort to beat a leading American chemist, [[Linus Pauling]], to the discovery of [[DNA]]'s structure (after having been pipped at the post by Pauling's success in determining the alpha helix structure of proteins). At the same time Bragg's Cavendish Laboratory was also effectively competing with [[King's College London]], whose Biophysics department was under the direction of Randall. (Randall had refused Crick's application to work at King's College.) Francis Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] of King's College were personal friends, which influenced subsequent scientific events as much as the close friendship between Crick and [[James Watson]]. Crick and Wilkins first met at King's College{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and not, as erroneously recorded by two authors, at the [[Admiralty]] during World War II.

==Personal life==
Crick married twice, fathered three children and was the grandfather of six grandchildren; his brother Anthony (born in 1918) predeceased him in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Olby|Olby]], p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Crick died of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] on the morning of 28 July 2004&lt;ref name=rsbm/&gt; at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD) Thornton Hospital in La Jolla; he was [[cremated]] and his ashes were scattered into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A public memorial was held on 27 September 2004 at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]], La Jolla, near San Diego, California; guest speakers included James Watson, [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Alexander Rich|Alex Rich]], [[Seymour Benzer]], [[Aaron Klug]], [[Christof Koch]], [[Pat Churchland]], [[Vilayanur Ramachandran]], [[Tomaso Poggio]], [[Leslie Orgel]], [[Terry Sejnowski]], his son Michael Crick, and his youngest daughter Jacqueline Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Francis Crick, Co-Discoverer of DNA, Dies at 88 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9E06E7D7113DF933A05754C0A9629C8B63 |quote=Francis H.

==Research==
{{Double helix|Name=&lt;big&gt;'''Francis Crick'''&lt;/big&gt;|Photo=Crick.jpg|Caption=Francis Crick, lecturing ca. 1979}}
Crick was interested in two fundamental unsolved problems of biology: how molecules make the transition from the non-living to the living, and how the brain makes a conscious mind.&lt;ref name="CrickWMP17"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He realized that his background made him more qualified for research on the first topic and the field of [[biophysics]]. It was at this time of Crick's transition from physics to biology that he was influenced by both Linus Pauling and [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref name=CrickWMP18&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear in theory that [[covalent bond]]s in biological molecules could provide the structural stability needed to hold [[genetics|genetic]] information in cells. It only remained as an exercise of experimental biology to discover exactly which molecule was the genetic molecule.&lt;ref name="CrickWMPTalking"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judson30"&gt;Page 30 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' by [[Horace Freeland Judson]] published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Crick's view, Charles Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], [[Gregor Mendel]]'s genetics and knowledge of the molecular basis of genetics, when combined, revealed the secret of life.&lt;ref name="CrickWMP25"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Crick had the very optimistic view that life would very soon be created in a test tube. However, some people (such as fellow researcher and colleague [[Esther Lederberg]]) thought that Crick was unduly optimistic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estherlederberg.com/Anecdotes.html#INTERVIEW |title=Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg: Anecdotes |publisher=Estherlederberg.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was clear that some [[macromolecule]] such as a [[protein]] was likely to be the genetic molecule.&lt;ref name="CrickWMP32"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was well known that proteins are structural and functional macromolecules, some of which carry out [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions of cells.&lt;ref name="CrickWMP32"/&gt; In the 1940s, some evidence had been found pointing to another macromolecule, DNA, the other major component of [[chromosome]]s, as a candidate genetic molecule. In the 1944 [[Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment]], [[Oswald Avery]] and his collaborators showed that a heritable [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference could be caused in [[bacteria]] by providing them with a particular DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Judson30"/&gt;

However, other evidence was interpreted as suggesting that DNA was structurally uninteresting and possibly just a molecular scaffold for the apparently more interesting protein molecules.&lt;ref name="CrickWMP33"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Crick was in the right place, in the right frame of mind, at the right time (1949), to join Max Perutz's project at the [[University of Cambridge]], and he began to work on the [[X-ray crystallography]] of proteins.&lt;ref name="CrickWMPCH4"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; X-ray crystallography theoretically offered the opportunity to reveal the molecular structure of large molecules like proteins and DNA, but there were serious technical problems then preventing X-ray crystallography from being applicable to such large molecules.&lt;ref name="CrickWMPCH4"/&gt;

===1949–1950===
Crick taught himself the mathematical theory of X-ray crystallography.&lt;ref name=CrickWMP46&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 46: "..there was no alternative but to teach X-ray diffraction to myself."&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of Crick's study of [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]], researchers in the Cambridge lab were attempting to determine the most stable helical conformation of [[amino acid]] chains in proteins (the [[alpha helix]]). Linus Pauling was the first to identify&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pauling L, Corey RB |title=Atomic Coordinates and Structure Factors for Two Helical Configurations of Polypeptide Chains |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=235–40 |date=May 1951 |pmid=14834145 |pmc=1063348 |doi=10.1073/pnas.37.5.235|bibcode = 1951PNAS...37..235P |url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/10215/1/PAUpnas51g.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 3.6&amp;nbsp;amino acids per helix turn ratio of the alpha helix. Crick was witness to the kinds of errors that his co-workers made in their failed attempts to make a correct molecular model of the alpha helix; these turned out to be important lessons that could be applied, in the future, to the helical structure of DNA. For example, he learned&lt;ref name="CrickWMP58"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of the structural rigidity that [[Cis-trans isomerism|double bonds]] confer on molecular structures which is relevant both to [[peptide bond]]s in proteins and the structure of [[nucleotide]]s in DNA.

===1951–1953: DNA structure===
In 1951 and 1952, together with [[William Cochran (physicist)|William Cochran]] and Vladimir Vand, Crick assisted in the development of a mathematical theory of X-ray diffraction by a helical molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0365110X52001635 |title=The structure of synthetic polypeptides.

H. |last3=Vand |first3=V. |journal=Acta Crystallographica |volume=5 |pages=581–6|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theoretical result matched well with X-ray data for [[protein]]s that contain sequences of amino acids in the alpha helix conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/169234a0 |url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/D/M/ |title=Evidence for the Pauling–Corey α-Helix in Synthetic Polypeptides |date=1952 |last1=Cochran |first1=W. |last2=Crick |first2=F.

Late in 1951, Crick started working with James Watson at [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], England. Using "[[Photo 51]]" (the X-ray diffraction results of [[Rosalind Franklin]] and her graduate student [[Raymond Gosling]] of King's College London, given to them by Gosling and Franklin's colleague Wilkins), Watson and Crick together developed a model for a helical structure of DNA, which they published in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson JD, Crick FH |title=[[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid]] |journal=Nature |volume=171 |issue=4356 |pages=737–8 |date=1953 |pmid=13054692 |doi=10.1038/171737a0|bibcode = 1953Natur.171..737W }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this and subsequent work they were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1962 with Wilkins.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Crick's 1962 [http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1962/crick-bio.html Biography from the Nobel foundation].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/james-watson-francis-crick-maurice-wilkins-and-rosalind-franklin |work=Science History Institute |accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Watson came to Cambridge, Crick was a 35-year-old graduate student (due to his work during WWII) and Watson was only 23, but he already had a Ph.D. They shared an interest in the fundamental problem of learning how genetic information might be stored in molecular form.&lt;ref name="CrickWMPgene"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 22: Crick traced his interest in the physical nature of the gene back to the start of his work in biology, when he was in the Strangeways laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JudsonOnWatson"&gt;In ''The Eighth Day of Creation'', [[Horace Freeland Judson|Horace Judson]] describes the development of Watson's thinking about the physical nature of genes. On page 89, Judson explains that by the time Watson came to Cambridge, he believed genes were made of DNA and he hoped that he could use X-ray diffraction data to determine the structure.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and Crick talked endlessly about DNA and the idea that it might be possible to guess a good molecular model of its structure.&lt;ref name="CrickWMPTalking"/&gt; A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by Wilkins, Franklin, and Gosling. In November 1951, Wilkins came to Cambridge and shared his data with Watson and Crick. [[Alex Stokes|Alexander Stokes]] (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's College) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure—but Franklin vehemently disputed this conclusion. Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part by the knowledge that they were competing against Linus Pauling. Given Pauling's recent success in discovering the Alpha helix, they feared that Pauling might also be the first to determine the structure of DNA.&lt;ref name="WatsonOnPauling"&gt;Page 90, In ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' by Horace Judson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have speculated about what might have happened had Pauling been able to travel to Britain as planned in May 1952.&lt;ref name="OSUraceforDNA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Linus Pauling and the Race for DNA: A Documentary History|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/narrative/page13.html |publisher=Special Collections, The Valley Library, Oregon State University.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was, his political activities caused his travel to be restricted by the [[United States government]] and he did not visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England. At any rate he was preoccupied with proteins at the time, not DNA.&lt;ref name="OSUraceforDNA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JudsonOnPauling"&gt;Chapter 3 in ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' by Horace Judson.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA. Crick was writing his Ph.D. thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of [[myoglobin]] for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on [[tobacco mosaic virus]] and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.

[[File:DNA Structure.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram that emphasizes the phosphate backbone of DNA. Watson and Crick first made helical models with the phosphates at the centre of the helices.]]
Of great importance to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the [[hydrophilic]] [[phosphate]]-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with [[water (molecule)|water molecules]] on the outside of the molecule while the [[hydrophobic]] bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.

Crick described what he saw as the failure of Wilkins and Franklin to cooperate and work towards finding a molecular model of DNA as a major reason why he and Watson eventually made a second attempt to do so. They asked for, and received, permission to do so from both William Lawrence Bragg and Wilkins. In order to construct their model of DNA, Watson and Crick made use of information from unpublished X-ray diffraction images of Franklin's (shown at meetings and freely shared by Wilkins), including preliminary accounts of Franklin's results/photographs of the X-ray images that were included in a written progress report for the King's College laboratory of Sir John Randall from late 1952.

It is a matter of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to [[academic publishing|formally publish]] the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data which were included in the progress report. However, Watson and Crick found fault in her steadfast assertion that, according to her data, a helical structure was not the only possible shape for DNA—so they had a dilemma. In an effort to clarify this issue, Max Ferdinand Perutz later published what had been in the progress report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Perutz MF, Randall JT, Thomson L, Wilkins MH, Watson JD |title=DNA helix |journal=Science |volume=164 |issue=3887 |pages=1537–9 |date=June 1969 |pmid=5796048 |doi=10.1126/science.164.3887.1537|bibcode = 1969Sci...164.1537W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that nothing was in the report that Franklin herself had not said in her talk (attended by Watson) in late 1951. Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a Medical Research Council (MRC) committee that had been created in order to "establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council". Randall's and Perutz's laboratories were both funded by the MRC.

It is also not clear how important Franklin's unpublished results from the progress report actually were for the model-building done by Watson and Crick. After the first crude X-ray diffraction images of DNA were collected in the 1930s, [[William Astbury]] had talked about stacks of nucleotides spaced at 3.4 angström (0.34 nanometre) intervals in DNA. A citation to Astbury's earlier X-ray diffraction work was one of only eight references in Franklin's first paper on DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's citation to the earlier work of W. T. Astbury is in:&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Franklin RE, Gosling RG |title=Molecular configuration in sodium thymonucleate |journal=Nature |volume=171 |issue=4356 |pages=740–1 |date=1953 |pmid=13054694 |doi= 10.1038/171740a0|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf |format=PDF reprint|bibcode = 1953Natur.171..740F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of Astbury's published DNA results and the better X-ray diffraction images collected by Wilkins and Franklin revealed the helical nature of DNA. It was possible to predict the number of bases stacked within a single turn of the DNA helix (10 per turn; a full turn of the helix is 27 angströms [2.7&amp;nbsp;nm] in the compact A form, 34 angströms [3.4&amp;nbsp;nm] in the wetter B form). Wilkins shared this information about the B form of DNA with Crick and Watson. Crick did not see Franklin's B form X-ray images ([[Photo 51]]) until after the DNA double helix model was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crick F |title=The double helix: a personal view |journal=Nature |volume=248 |issue=5451 |pages=766–9 |date=1974|pmid=4599081 |doi=10.1038/248766a0|bibcode = 1974Natur.248..766C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few references cited by Watson and Crick when they published their model of DNA was to a published article that included Sven Furberg's DNA model that had the bases on the inside. Thus, the Watson and Crick model was not the first "bases in" model to be proposed. Furberg's results had also provided the correct orientation of the DNA sugars with respect to the bases. During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the [[base pair]]s in the centre of a double helix. Crick's access to Franklin's progress report of late 1952 is what made Crick confident that DNA was a double helix with antiparallel chains, but there were other chains of reasoning and sources of information that also led to these conclusions.&lt;ref name="JudsonCh3modeling"&gt;In chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation'', [[Horace Freeland Judson|Horace Judson]] describes the development of [[James Watson|Watson]]'s and Crick's thinking about the structure of DNA and how it evolved during their model building. Watson and Crick were open to the idea of tentatively ignoring all individual experimental results, in case they might be wrong or misleading. Judson describes how Watson spent a large amount of time ''ignoring'' Crick's belief (based on Franklin's determination of the space group) that the two backbone strands were antiparallel. On page 176, Judson quotes a letter written by Watson, "The model has been derived almost entirely from stereochemical considerations with the only X-ray consideration being the spacing between the pair of bases 3.4 A which was originally found by Astbury."&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of leaving King's College for [[Birkbeck College]], Franklin was asked by John Randall to give up her work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the supervisors of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.

[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|right|Diagrammatic representation of some key structural features of DNA. The similar structures of [[guanine]]:[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]:[[thymine]] base pairs is illustrated. The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s. The phosphate backbones are [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]].]]
Another key to finding the correct structure of DNA was the so-called [[Chargaff's rules|Chargaff ratios]], experimentally determined ratios of the nucleotide subunits of DNA: the amount of [[guanine]] is equal to [[cytosine]] and the amount of [[adenine]] is equal to [[thymine]]. A visit by [[Erwin Chargaff]] to England, in 1952, reinforced the salience of this important fact for Watson and Crick.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The significance of these ratios for the structure of DNA were not recognized until Watson, persisting in building structural models, realized that A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar. In particular, the length of each base pair is the same. Chargaff had also pointed out to Watson that, in the aqueous, saline environment of the cell, the predominant tautomers of the pyrimidine (C and T) bases would be the amine and keto configurations of cytosine and thymine, rather than the imino and enol forms that Crick and Watson had assumed. They consulted [[Jerry Donohue]] who confirmed the most likely structures of the nucleotide bases.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' by Horace Freeland Judson published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}. Judson also lists the publications of W. T. Astbury that described his early X-ray diffraction results for DNA.&lt;/ref&gt; The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s, the same non-covalent interaction that stabilize the protein α-helix.  The correct structures were essential for the positioning of the hydrogen bonds.  These insights led Watson to deduce the true biological relationships of the A:T and C:G pairs. After the discovery of the hydrogen bonded A:T and C:G pairs, Watson and Crick soon had their anti-parallel, double helical model of DNA, with the hydrogen bonds at the core of the helix providing a way to "unzip" the two complementary strands for easy [[DNA replication|replication]]: the last key requirement for a likely model of the genetic molecule. As important as Crick's contributions to the discovery of the double helical DNA model were, he stated that without the chance to collaborate with Watson, he would not have found the structure by himself.&lt;ref name="WMP75"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 75: "If Jim had been killed by a tennis ball, I am reasonably sure I would not have solved the structure alone".&lt;/ref&gt;

Crick did tentatively attempt to perform some experiments on nucleotide base pairing, but he was more of a theoretical biologist than an experimental biologist. There was another near-discovery of the base pairing rules in early 1952. Crick had started to think about interactions between the bases. He asked John Griffith to try to calculate attractive interactions between the DNA bases from chemical principles and [[quantum mechanics]]. Griffith's best guess was that A:T and G:C were attractive pairs. At that time, Crick was not aware of Chargaff's rules and he made little of Griffith's calculations, although it did start him thinking about complementary replication. Identification of the correct base-pairing rules (A-T, G-C) was achieved by Watson "playing" with cardboard cut-out models of the nucleotide bases, much in the manner that Linus Pauling had discovered the protein alpha helix a few years earlier. The Watson and Crick discovery of the DNA double helix structure was made possible by their willingness to combine theory, modelling and experimental results (albeit mostly done by others) to achieve their goal.

The DNA double helix structure proposed by Watson and Crick was based upon "Watson-Crick" bonds between the four bases most frequently found in DNA (A, C, T, G) and RNA (A, C, U, G). However, later research showed that triple-stranded, quadruple-stranded and other more complex DNA molecular structures required [[Hoogsteen base pair]]ing. The entire field of [[synthetic biology]] began with work by researchers such as [[Erik T. Kool]], in which bases other than A, C, T and G are used in a synthetic DNA. In addition to synthetic DNA there are also attempts to construct synthetic [[codons]], synthetic [[endonucleases]], synthetic proteins and synthetic [[zinc fingers]]. Using synthetic DNA, instead of there being 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; codons, if there are n new bases there could be as many as n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; codons. Research is currently being done to see if codons can be expanded to more than 3 bases. These new codons can code for new amino acids. These synthetic molecules can be used not only in medicine, but in creation of new materials.&lt;ref name="Simon, Matthew 2005"&gt;Simon, Matthew (2005) ''Emergent Computation: emphasizing bioinformatics''.

The discovery was made on 28 February 1953; the first Watson/Crick paper appeared in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 25 April 1953. Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at [[Guy's Hospital]] Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953 which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' of London, on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled "Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life." The news reached readers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography, "Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution", found a clipping of a six-paragraph New York Times article written from London and dated 16 May 1953 with the headline "Form of 'Life Unit' in Cell Is Scanned." The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. (''The New York Times'' subsequently ran a longer article on 12 June 1953). The university's undergraduate newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday 30 May 1953. Bragg's original announcement of the discovery at a [[Solvay conference]] on [[proteins]] in [[Belgium]] on 8 April 1953 went unreported by the British press.

[[Sydney Brenner]], [[Jack D. Dunitz|Jack Dunitz]], [[Dorothy Hodgkin]], [[Leslie Orgel]], and [[Beryl M. Oughton]], were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of [[DNA]], constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time they were working at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]'s Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner who subsequently worked with Crick at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]]. According to the late Dr. Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Olby|Olby]], Ch. 10, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Orgel also later worked with Crick at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]].

Soon after Crick's death, there have been allegations about him having used LSD when he came to the idea of the helix structure of the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/science/11book.html|title=A Peek Into the Remarkable Mind Behind the Genetic Code|first=Nicholas|last=Wade|date=11 July 2006|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayanmajix.com/art1699.html|title=Nobel Prize genius Crick was high on LSD|website=www.mayanmajix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he almost certainly did use LSD, it is unlikely that he was doing that as early as 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitysandwich.com/314873/francis-crick-dna-lsd/|title=Francis Crick, DNA &amp; LSD - Reality Sandwich|website=realitysandwich.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular biology===
In 1954, at the age of 37, Crick completed his Ph.D. thesis: "''X-Ray Diffraction: Polypeptides and Proteins''" and received his degree. Crick then worked in the laboratory of [[David Harker]] at [[Polytechnic University of New York|Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]], where he continued to develop his skills in the analysis of [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]] data for proteins, working primarily on [[ribonuclease]] and the mechanisms of [[protein synthesis]]. David Harker, the American X-ray crystallographer, was described as "the John Wayne of crystallography" by Vittorio Luzzati, a crystallographer at the Centre for Molecular Genetics in Gif-sur-Yvette near Paris, who had worked with Rosalind Franklin.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

After the discovery of the double helix model of DNA, Crick's interests quickly turned to the biological implications of the structure. In 1953, Watson and Crick published another article in ''Nature'' which stated: "it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of the bases is the code that carries the genetical information".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson JD, Crick FH |title=Genetical implications of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid |journal=Nature |volume=171 |issue=4361 |pages=964–7 |date=May 1953 |pmid=13063483 |doi= 10.1038/171964b0|url= https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Y/X/_/scbbyx.pdf  |format=PDF reprint|bibcode = 1953Natur.171..964W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Collagentriplehelix.png|thumb|left|99px|Collagen triple helix.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}]]

In 1956, Crick and Watson speculated on the structure of small [[virus]]es. They suggested that spherical viruses such as [[Tomato bushy stunt virus]] had icosahedral symmetry and were made from 60 identical subunits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morgan GJ |title=Historical review: viruses, crystals and geodesic domes |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=86–90 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12575996 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(02)00007-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his short time in New York, Crick returned to Cambridge where he worked until 1976, at which time he moved to [[California]]. Crick engaged in several X-ray diffraction collaborations such as one with [[Alexander Rich]] on the structure of [[collagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rich A, Crick FH |title=The structure of collagen |journal=Nature |volume=176 |issue=4489 |pages=915–6 |date=November 1955 |pmid=13272717 |doi= 10.1038/176915a0|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Z/L/_/scbbzl.pdf |format=PDF reprint|bibcode = 1955Natur.176..915R }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Crick was quickly drifting away from continued work related to his expertise in the interpretation of X-ray diffraction patterns of proteins.

[[George Gamow]] established a group of scientists interested in the role of [[RNA]] as an intermediary between DNA as the genetic storage molecule in the [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]] of cells and the synthesis of proteins in the [[cytoplasm]] (the [[RNA Tie Club]]). It was clear to Crick that there had to be a code by which a short sequence of nucleotides would specify a particular [[amino acid]] in a newly synthesized protein. In 1956, Crick wrote an informal paper about the [[genetic code|genetic coding]] problem for the small group of scientists in Gamow's RNA group.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/G/F/_/scbbgf.pdf On Degenerate Templates and the Adaptor Hypothesis: A Note for the RNA Tie Club]" by Francis Crick (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small "adaptor molecules" that would [[hydrogen bond]] to short sequences of a nucleic acid, and also link to one of the amino acids. He also explored the many theoretical possibilities by which short nucleic acid sequences might code for the 20 amino acids.

[[File:3d tRNA.png|thumb|right|Molecular model of a [[tRNA]] molecule.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Crick predicted that such adaptor molecules might exist as the links between [[codon]]s and [[amino acid]]s.]]
During the mid-to-late 1950s Crick was very much intellectually engaged in sorting out the mystery of how proteins are synthesized. By 1958, Crick's thinking had matured and he could list in an orderly way all of the key features of the protein synthesis process:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*genetic information stored in the sequence of DNA molecules
*a "messenger" RNA molecule to carry the instructions for making one protein to the cytoplasm
*adaptor molecules ("they might contain nucleotides") to match short sequences of nucleotides in the RNA messenger molecules to specific amino acids
*ribonucleic-protein complexes that catalyse the assembly of amino acids into proteins according to the messenger RNA

The adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be [[tRNA]]s and the catalytic "ribonucleic-protein complexes" became known as [[ribosome]]s. An important step was later realization (in 1960) that the [[messenger RNA]] was not the same as the [[ribosomal RNA]]. None of this, however, answered the fundamental theoretical question of the exact nature of the genetic code. In his 1958 article, Crick speculated, as had others, that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid. Such a code might be "degenerate", with 4×4×4=64 possible triplets of the four nucleotide subunits while there were only 20 amino acids. Some amino acids might have multiple triplet codes. Crick also explored other codes in which, for various reasons, only some of the triplets were used, "magically" producing just the 20 needed combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|journal=American Scientist|date=1998|accessdate=11 January 2017|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/the-invention-of-the-genetic-code|title=The Invention of the Genetic Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental results were needed; theory alone could not decide the nature of the code. Crick also used the term "[[central dogma of molecular biology|central dogma]]" to summarize an idea that implies that genetic information flow between macromolecules would be essentially one-way:

:'''DNA → RNA → Protein'''

Some critics thought that by using the word "dogma", Crick was implying that this was a rule that could not be questioned, but all he really meant was that it was a compelling idea without much solid evidence to support it. In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology. Crick had by this time become a highly influential theoretical molecular biologist.

Proof that the genetic code is a degenerate triplet code finally came from genetics experiments, some of which were performed by Crick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Crick FH, Barnett L, Brenner S, Watts-Tobin RJ |title=General nature of the genetic code for proteins |journal=Nature |volume=192 |issue= 4809|pages=1227–32 |date=December 1961 |pmid=13882203 |doi= 10.1038/1921227a0|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/B/J/_/scbcbj.pdf |format=PDF reprint|bibcode = 1961Natur.192.1227C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the code came mostly from work by [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg|Marshall Nirenberg]] and others who synthesized synthetic RNA molecules and used them as templates for ''[[in vitro]]'' protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crick FH |title=The Croonian lecture, 1966.

==Controversy==

An enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of [[Photo 51|DNA X-ray diffraction data]] collected by Franklin and Wilkins. The controversy arose from the fact that some of Franklin's unpublished data were used without her knowledge or consent by Watson and Crick in their construction of the double helix model of DNA.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;Judson, H.F. 1996. ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology''. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, chapter 3. {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the four DNA researchers, only Franklin had a degree in chemistry;&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; Wilkins and Crick had backgrounds in physics, Watson in biology.

Prior to publication of the double helix structure, Watson and Crick had little direct interaction with Franklin herself. They were, however, aware of her work, more aware than she herself realized. Watson was present at a lecture, given in November 1951, where Franklin presented the two forms of the molecule, type A and type B, and discussed the position of the phosphate units on the external part of the molecule. She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. She was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule.  Before this, both Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had generated erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Schwartz, James (2008) [http://www.evolbiol.ru/large_files/darwin_dna.pdf  ''In Pursuit of the Gene. From Darwin to DNA'']. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674034910}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her identification of the [[space group]] for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]].

In January 1953, Watson was shown an X-ray photograph of B-DNA (called [[Photo 51|photograph 51]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maddox|Maddox]], pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; by Wilkins.&lt;ref name="Maddox"&gt;[[#Maddox|Maddox]], p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins had been given photograph 51 by Rosalind Franklin's Ph.D. student Raymond Gosling.&lt;ref name="Maddox" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilkins|Wilkins]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilkins and Gosling had worked together in the Medical Research Council's (MRC) Biophysics Unit before director John Randall appointed Franklin to take over both DNA diffraction work and guidance of Gosling's thesis. It appears that Randall did not communicate effectively with them about Franklin's appointment, contributing to confusion and friction between Wilkins and Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, Olby, Maddox, Elkin, Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, Max Perutz, gave Crick [[King's College London DNA Controversy|a copy of a report]] written for a Medical Research Council biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing data from the King's group, including some of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Hubbard, Ruth| title = The Politics of Women's Biology| date = 1990| publisher = Rutgers State University| isbn = 0-8135-1490-8| page = 60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JudsonCh3"&gt;Chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' by Horace Freeland Judson published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, L.O. (2003)p 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maddox|Maddox]], pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was unaware that photograph 51 and other information had been shared with Crick and Watson. She wrote a series of three draft manuscripts, two of which included a double helical DNA backbone. Her two A form manuscripts reached Acta Crystallographica in Copenhagen on 6 March 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, R.E. and Gosling, R.G. authors of papers received 6 March 1953 Acta Crystallogr. (1953). 6, 673 The Structure of Sodium Thymonucleate Fibres I. The Influence of Water Content Acta Crystallogr. (1953). 6, 678 The Structure of Sodium Thymonucleate Fibres II. The Cylindrically Symmetrical Patterson Function&lt;/ref&gt; one day before Crick and Watson had completed their model.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maddox|Maddox]], p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Franklin's experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery. Her experimental results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals, and these results were most consistent with the three sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilkins|Wilkins]] provides a detailed account of the fact that Franklin's results were interpreted as most likely indicated three, and possibly four, polynucleotide strands in the DNA molecule.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's X-Ray photograph showed that the backbones had to be on the outside. Although she at first insisted vehemently that her data did not force one to conclude that DNA has a helical structure, in the drafts she submitted in 1953 she argues for a double helical DNA backbone.  Her identification of the [[space group]] for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the DNA strands were [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], which helped Watson and Crick decide to look for DNA models with two antiparallel polynucleotide strands.

In summary, Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data: 1) her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cullen |first=Katherine E.|title=Biology: the people behind the science |date=2006 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Chelsea House]] |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5461-4 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) discussions with Wilkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cullen |first=Katherine E. |title=Biology: the people behind the science |date=2006 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Chelsea House]] |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5461-4 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked in the same laboratory with Franklin, 3) a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Stocklmayer |first1=Susan M. |author-link1=Susan Stocklmayer |last2=Gore |first2=Michael M. |last3=Brtyant |first3=Chris |title=Science Communication in Theory and Practice |date=2001 |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer|Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |isbn=1-4020-0131-2 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin all worked in MRC laboratories.

Crick and Watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer, a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgement of experimental work done at King's College in the eventual published paper. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper. [[Brenda Maddox]] suggests that because of the importance of her experimental results in Watson and Crick's model building and theoretical analysis, Franklin should have had her name on the original Watson and Crick paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name="MaddoxDLD"&gt;[[#Maddox|Maddox]]&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin and Gosling submitted their own joint 'second' paper to ''Nature'' at the same time as Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson submitted theirs (i.e. the 'third' paper on DNA).

Watson's portrayal of Franklin in ''[[The Double Helix]]'' (written after Franklin's death when libel laws did not apply anymore) was negative and gave the appearance that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Elkin | first1 = L. O. | title = Rosalind Franklin and the Double Helix | doi = 10.1063/1.1570771 | journal = Physics Today | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 42–48 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2003PhT....56c..42E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The X-ray diffraction images collected by Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. While Franklin's experimental work proved important to Crick and Watson's development of a correct model, she herself could not realize it at the time. When she left King's College, Director Sir John Randall insisted that all DNA work belonged exclusively to King's and ordered Franklin to not even think about it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maddox|Maddox]], p. 312,&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin subsequently did superb work in J. D. Bernal's Lab at Birkbeck College with the tobacco mosaic virus extending ideas on helical construction.&lt;ref name="Profile" /&gt;

Crick was often described as very talkative, with Watson – in ''The Double Helix'' – implying lack of modesty.&lt;ref&gt;Watson's book ''The Double Helix'' painted a vivid image of Crick, starting with the famous line, "I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood." The first chapter of [[Horace Freeland Judson|Horace Judson]]'s book ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' describes the importance of Crick's talking and his boldness in his scientific style.&lt;/ref&gt; His personality combined with his scientific accomplishments produced many opportunities for Crick to stimulate reactions from others, both inside and outside the scientific world, which was the centre of his intellectual and professional life.&lt;ref&gt;Describing Crick's influence on his scientific colleagues, Francis Crick Papers archivist Chris Beckett wrote of the importance of "...&amp;nbsp;Crick's presence and eloquence&amp;nbsp;—direct and beguiling, by all accounts in the archive— at conference after conference, through formal lectures, extempore summaries, informal meetings and individual conversations. Indeed, one has the impression that it was through these frequent persuasive moments of personal delivery and purposive conversations that Crick was most influential."&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Beckett C |title=For the Record: The Francis Crick Archive at the Wellcome Library |journal=Med Hist |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=245–60 |date=2004|pmid=15151106 |pmc=546341|doi=10.1017/S0025727300007419}} Also described as an example of Crick's wide recognition and public profile are some of the times Crick was addressed as "Sir Francis Crick" with the assumption that someone so famous must have been knighted.&lt;/ref&gt; Crick spoke rapidly, and rather loudly, and had an infectious and reverberating laugh, and a lively sense of humour. One colleague from the Salk Institute described him as "a brainstorming intellectual powerhouse with a mischievous smile.... Francis was never mean-spirited, just incisive. He detected microscopic flaws in logic. In a room full of smart scientists, Francis continually reearned his position as the heavyweight champ."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Eagleman|Eagleman, D.M.]] (2005).

===Eugenics===
Crick occasionally expressed his views on [[eugenics]], usually in private letters. For example, Crick advocated a form of [[Liberal eugenics|positive eugenics]] in which wealthy parents would be encouraged to have more children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ridley|Ridley]]&lt;/ref&gt; He once remarked, "In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin to worry about the character of the next generation... It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and until we have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics... I would be astonished if, in the next 100 or 200&amp;nbsp;years, society did not come round to the view that they would have to try to improve the next generation in some extent or one way or another."

===Creationism===
Crick was a firm critic of [[Young Earth creationism]]. In the 1987 [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'', Crick joined a group of other [[Nobel laureate]]s who advised, "'Creation-science' simply has no place in the public-school science classroom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html Amicus Curiae Brief of 72 Nobel Laureates, 17 State Academies of Science, and 7 Other Scientific Organization in Support of Appellees] filed in the case ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' before the U.S. Supreme Court (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Crick was also an advocate for the establishment of [[Darwin Day]] as a British national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Press release from the British Humanist Association: [http://www.humanism.org.uk/site/cms/contentViewArticle.asp?article=1348 Darwin Day a natural holiday?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026085046/http://www.humanism.org.uk/site/cms/contentViewArticle.asp?article=1348 |date=26 October 2005 }} (12 February 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on religion==

Crick referred to himself as a humanist, which he defined as the belief "that human problems can and must be faced in terms of human moral and intellectual resources without invoking supernatural authority."  He publicly called for humanism to replace religion as a guiding force for humanity, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The human dilemma is hardly new.  We find ourselves through no wish of our own on this slowly revolving planet in an obscure corner of a vast universe.  Our questioning intelligence will not let us live in cow-like content with our lot.  We have a deep need to know why we are here.  What is the world made of?  More important, what are we made of?  In the past religion answered these questions, often in considerable detail.  Now we know that almost all these answers are highly likely to be nonsense, having sprung from man's ignorance and his enormous capacity for self-deception... The simple fables of the religions of the world have come to seem like tales told to children.  Even understood symbolically they are often perverse, if not rather unpleasant... Humanists, then, live in a mysterious, exciting and intellectually expanding world, which, once glimpsed, makes the old worlds of the religions seem fake-cosy and stale... &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crick|first=Francis|title="Why I Am a Humanist." (1966) ''Varsity'', the University of Cambridge newspaper.|url=http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1817155|publisher=The Wellcome Library|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crick was especially critical of [[Christianity]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not respect Christian beliefs.  I think they are ridiculous.  If we could get rid of them we could more easily get down to the serious problem of trying to find out what the world is all about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crick|first=Francis|title=Letter to the Editor, ''Varsity'', the University of Cambridge newspaper.  (1966).|url=http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1817155|publisher=The Wellcome Library|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crick once joked, "Christianity may be OK between consenting adults in private but should not be taught to young children."&lt;ref name="guardianbooks"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Genius was in his DNA | author=McKie, Robin | date=17 September 2006 | url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,,1874072,00.html | work=The Guardian | accessdate=4 August 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Of Molecules and Men'', Crick expressed his views on the [[relationship between science and religion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Of Molecules and Men'' (Prometheus Books, 2004; original edition 1967) {{ISBN|1-59102-185-5}}. A portion of the book was published as "[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/F/F/_/scbcff.pdf The Computer, the Eye, the Soul]" in ''Saturday Review'' (1966): 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; After suggesting that it would become possible for a [[computer]] to be programmed so as to have a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], he wondered: at what point during biological evolution did the first organism have a soul? At what moment does a baby get a soul? Crick stated his view that the idea of a non-material soul that could enter a body and then persist after death is just that, an imagined idea. For Crick, the mind is a product of physical brain activity and the brain had evolved by natural means over millions of years. He felt that it was important that evolution by [[natural selection]] be taught in schools and that it was regrettable that English schools had compulsory religious instruction. He also considered that a new scientific world view was rapidly being established, and predicted that once the detailed workings of the brain were eventually revealed, erroneous [[Christianity|Christian]] concepts about the nature of humans and the world would no longer be tenable; traditional conceptions of the "soul" would be replaced by a new understanding of the physical basis of mind. He was sceptical of [[organized religion]], referring to himself as a sceptic and an agnostic with "a strong inclination towards atheism".&lt;ref name="CrickWMP10"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 10: Crick described himself as agnostic, with a "strong inclination towards atheism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Crick accepted an honorary fellowship at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], one factor being that the new college did not have a chapel. Some time later a large donation was made to establish a chapel and the College Council decided to accept it. Crick resigned his fellowship in protest.&lt;ref name="pmid15151106"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Beckett C |title=For the Record: The Francis Crick Archive at the Wellcome Library |journal=Med Hist |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=245–60 |date=2004 |pmid=15151106 |pmc=546341|doi=10.1017/S0025727300007419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080604203926/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fconnected%2F2003%2F03%2F19%2Fecfgod19.xml Do our genes reveal the hand of God?] ww.telegraph.co.uk. 20 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1969 Crick participated in a celebration of the 100th year of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in which he attempted to make some predictions about what the next 30&amp;nbsp;years would hold for molecular biology. His speculations were later published in ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="Nature_1970"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crick F |title=Molecular biology in the year 2000 |journal=Nature |volume=228 |issue=5272 |pages=613–5 |date=November 1970 |pmid=4920018 |doi= 10.1038/228613a0|url= https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/C/J/_/scbccj.pdf  |format=PDF reprint|bibcode = 1970Natur.228..613C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the article, Crick briefly mentioned the search for life on other planets, but he held little hope that [[extraterrestrial life]] would be found by the year 2000. He also discussed what he described as a possible new direction for research, what he called "biochemical theology". Crick wrote "so many people pray that one finds it hard to believe that they do not get some satisfaction from it".&lt;ref name="Nature_1970" /&gt;

Crick suggested that it might be possible to find chemical changes in the brain that were molecular correlates of the act of [[prayer]]. He speculated that there might be a detectable change in the level of some [[neurotransmitter]] or [[neurohormone]] when people pray. He might have been imagining substances such as [[Dopamine#Motivation and pleasure|dopamine]] that are released by the brain under certain conditions and produce rewarding sensations. Crick's suggestion that there might someday be a new science of "biochemical theology" seems to have been realized under an alternative name: there is now the new field of [[neurotheology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Borg J, Andrée B, Soderstrom H, Farde L |title=The serotonin system and spiritual experiences |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=11 |pages=1965–9 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14594742 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.1965|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14594742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick's view of the relationship between science and religion continued to play a role in his work as he made the transition from [[molecular biology]] research into theoretical neuroscience.

Crick asked in 1998 "and if some of the Bible is manifestly wrong, why should any of the rest of it be accepted automatically? ... And what would be more important than to find our true place in the universe by removing one by one these unfortunate vestiges of earlier beliefs?"&lt;ref name="CrickWMP11"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|''Humanist Manifesto'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |accessdate=28 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archivedate=5 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directed panspermia==
During the 1960s, Crick became concerned with the origins of the genetic code. In 1966, Crick took the place of [[Leslie Orgel]] at a meeting where Orgel was to talk about the [[origin of life]]. Crick speculated about possible stages by which an initially simple code with a few amino acid types might have evolved into the more complex code used by existing [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crick FH |title=The origin of the genetic code |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=367–79 |date=December 1968 |pmid=4887876 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(68)90392-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, everyone thought of [[protein]]s as the only kind of [[enzyme]]s, and [[ribozyme]]s had not yet been found. Many molecular biologists were puzzled by the problem of the origin of a protein replicating system that is as complex as that which exists in organisms currently inhabiting [[Earth]]. In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from [[molecule]]s may have been a very rare event in the [[universe]], but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using [[Spaceflight|space travel]] technology, a process they called "[[directed panspermia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/C/P/_/scbccp.pdf |title=Directed Panspermia|author1=Crick, Francis  |author2=Orgel, Leslie E |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]|date=1973|volume =19 |pages =341–346|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90110-3|issue=3|bibcode = 1973Icar...19..341C }} Crick later wrote a book about directed panspermia: {{Cite book|author=Crick, Francis |title=Life itself: its origin and nature |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |date=1981|isbn=0-671-25562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retrospective article,&lt;ref name="CrickRetro"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Orgel LE, Crick FH |title=Anticipating an RNA world. Some past speculations on the origin of life: where are they today? |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=238–9 |date=1993 |pmid=7678564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick and Orgel noted that they had been overly pessimistic about the chances of [[abiogenesis]] on Earth when they had assumed that some kind of self-replicating protein system was the molecular origin of life.

In 1976 Crick addressed the origin of protein synthesis in a paper with [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Aaron Klug]], and [[George Pieczenik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Crick FH, Brenner S, Klug A, Pieczenik G |title=A speculation on the origin of protein synthesis |journal=Origins of Life |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=389–97 |date=December 1976 |pmid=1023138 |doi=10.1007/BF00927934|bibcode = 1976OrLi....7..389C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, they speculate that code constraints on nucleotide sequences allow protein synthesis without the need for a [[ribosome]]. It, however, requires a five base binding between the mRNA and tRNA with a flip of the anti-codon creating a triplet coding, even though it is a five-base physical interaction. [[Thomas H. Jukes]] pointed out that the code constraints on the mRNA sequence required for this translation mechanism is still preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Neuroscience and other interests==

The small region of the brain coloured orange shows patterns of activity that correlate with the decision making process.

Crick's period at Cambridge was the pinnacle of his long scientific career, but he left Cambridge in 1977 after 30&amp;nbsp;years, having been offered (and having refused) the Mastership of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]]. James Watson claimed at a Cambridge conference marking the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA in 2003:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now perhaps it's a pretty well kept secret that one of the most uninspiring acts of the University of Cambridge over this past century was to turn down Francis Crick when he applied to be the [[Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics|Professor of Genetics]], in 1958. Now there may have been a series of arguments, which led them to reject Francis. It was really saying, don't push us to the frontier.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The apparently "pretty well kept secret" had already been recorded in Soraya De Chadarevian's ''Designs For Life: Molecular Biology After World War II'', published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2002. His major contribution to molecular biology in Cambridge is well documented in ''The History of the University of Cambridge: Volume 4 (1870 to 1990)'', which was published by CUP in 1992.

According to the [[University of Cambridge]]'s genetics department official website, the electors of the professorship could not reach consensus, prompting the intervention of then University [[Vice-Chancellor]] [[Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Lord Adrian]]. Lord Adrian first offered the professorship to a compromise candidate, [[Guido Pontecorvo]], who refused, and is said to have offered it then to Crick, who also refused.

In 1976, Crick took a [[sabbatical|sabbatical year]] at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in [[La Jolla, California]]. Crick had been a nonresident fellow of the Institute since 1960. Crick wrote, "I felt at home in Southern California."&lt;ref name="CrickWMP145"&gt;[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; After the sabbatical, Crick left Cambridge in order to continue working at the Salk Institute. He was also an adjunct professor at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-crick-obit-story.html#|title=Co-discoverer of DNA's double helix dies|last=Mestel|first=Rosie|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nobel Laureates |url=http://nobel.universityofcalifornia.edu/list.html |publisher=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/overview/1960timeline.html|title=University of California History Digital Archives|website=www.lib.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught himself [[neuroanatomy]] and studied many other areas of [[neuroscience]] research. It took him several years to disengage from molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued to be made, including the discovery of [[alternative splicing]] and the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, which helped make possible [[genetic engineering]]. Eventually, in the 1980s, Crick was able to devote his full attention to his other interest, [[consciousness]]. His [[autobiography|autobiographical]] book, ''[[What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery]]'', includes a description of why he left molecular biology and switched to neuroscience.

Upon taking up work in theoretical neuroscience, Crick was struck by several things:
*there were many isolated subdisciplines within neuroscience with little contact between them
*many people who were interested in behaviour treated the brain as a [[black box (systems)|black box]]
*consciousness was viewed as a [[taboo]] subject by many [[neurobiologist]]s

Crick hoped he might aid progress in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists from the many different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He even collaborated with [[neurophilosophy|neurophilosophers]] such as [[Patricia Churchland]]. In 1983, as a result of their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of [[REM sleep]] is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process '[[reverse learning]]' or 'unlearning'. In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with [[Christof Koch]] that lead to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990&lt;ref&gt;"[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/F/D/_/scbcfd.pdf Towards a Neurobiological Theory of Consciousness]" by Francis Crick and Christof Koch in ''Seminars in the Neurosciences'' (1990): Volume 2 pages 263–275.&lt;/ref&gt; to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates visual [[awareness]] within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term [[memory]] processes that are as yet poorly understood. Crick also published a book describing how [[neurobiology]] had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick's book ''[[The Astonishing Hypothesis]]'' made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how [[Human brain|brain]]s produce conscious experiences. Crick was sceptical about the value of [[Connectionism|computational models]] of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function.

In addition to his third share of the 1962 Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine, he received many awards and honours, including the Royal and Copley medals of the Royal Society (1972 and 1975), and also the Order of Merit (on 27 November 1991); he refused an offer of a CBE in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabinet Office list of honours declined by since deceased persons, 1951–1999 |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012-01-24-075439.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120404175744/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012%2D01%2D24%2D075439.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2016 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was often referred to in error as 'Sir Francis Crick' and even on occasions as 'Lord Crick.' He was elected an [[EMBO Member]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=membo/&gt;

The award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Crick, Watson, and Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch in the BBC TV programme ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'' with the Nobel Prizes being referred to as 'The Alfred Nobel Peace Pools.'

===Other honours===
*The inscription on the helices of a [[DNA]] sculpture (which was donated by James Watson) outside [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]]'s Thirkill Court, Cambridge, England reads: '' "The structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 by Francis Crick and James Watson while Watson lived here at Clare." '' and on the base: ''"The double helix model was supported by the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins."''
*Another sculpture entitled ''Discovery'', by artist Lucy Glendinning was installed on Tuesday, 13 December 2005 in Abington Street, Northampton. According to the late Lynn Wilson, chairman of the Wilson Foundation, "The sculpture celebrates the life of a world class scientist who must surely be considered the greatest Northamptonian of all time&amp;nbsp;— by discovering DNA he unlocked the whole future of genetics and the alphabet of life."
*Westminster City Council unveiled a green plaque to Francis Crick on the front façade of 56 St George's Square, Pimlico, London SW1 on 20 June 2007; Crick lived in the first floor flat, together with [[Robert Dougall]] of BBC radio and later TV fame, a former Royal Navy associate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224353/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/councilgovernmentanddemocracy/councils/pressoffice/news/pr-3802.cfm Westminster honours Francis Crick (20/06/2007)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17892">'''Frank Fools Crow''' (circa 1890 – 1989) was an [[Oglala Lakota]] civic and religious leader.  'Grandfather', or 'Grandpa Frank' as he was often called, was a nephew of [[Black Elk]] who worked to preserve [[Lakota people|Lakota]] traditions, including the [[Sun Dance]] and [[yuwipi]] ceremonies.  He supported Lakota [[sovereignty]] and [[treaty rights]], and was a leader of the traditional faction during the [[Wounded Knee Siege|armed standoff]] at [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] in 1973.  With writer Thomas E. Mails, he produced two books about his life and work, ''Fools Crow'' in 1979, and ''Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power'' in 1990.

==Early life==
[[File:Fools Crow (book).jpg|left&lt;!-- image wants to be on the left --&gt;|frame|{{center|'''Grandfather Fools Crow'''&lt;br&gt;in traditional ceremonial attire}}]]
Fools Crow was born near Porcupine Creek on [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in [[South Dakota]] on either June 24 or 27 between 1890 and 1892.&lt;!--Mails,''Fools Crow'',p.33--&gt; His father, Fools Crow, who was  also called Eagle Bear, was the [[Porcupine, South Dakota|Porcupine]] District leader.  His mother was Spoon Hunter, who died four days after giving birth to him.  She was the daughter of Porcupine Tail, for whom the community was named.&lt;!--Mails,''Fools Crow'',p.356--&gt; His paternal grandfather, Knife Chief, fought with warriors who defeated [[Custer]] at the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]], and his great–grandfather, Holds the Eagle, was a medicine man and holy man, or ''Wičháša Wakȟáŋ''.&lt;!--Mails,''Fools Crow'',p.36--&gt; Raised in the traditional way by his father, aunt, and stepmother Emily Big Road, he did not attend "the white man's school" as his father did not approve. This is why he did not speak fluent English.&lt;!--Mails,''Fools Crow'',p.35--&gt; As a young man he traveled around the United States with the [[Buffalo Bill Cody]]'s [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show|''Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' show]].  He spent much of his life serving his people as a medicine man, healer, and teacher.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Mails, ''Fools Crow'', pages 33 to 36&lt;/ref&gt;

His first wife, Fannie Afraid of Hawk, died in 1954.  His second wife, Kate, died in October 1988.  Fools Crow died on November 27, 1989 near [[Kyle, SD]]. He is believed to have been 99 years old.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Go to Wounded Knee ... "==
On February 28, 1973, members of the [[American Indian Movement]], with their allies and supporters, including Fools Crow, seized and occupied the village of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]].  It was here, in 1890, that the followers of [[Spotted Elk]], another, earlier traditional leader, had been massacred by the [[United States Army]]'s [[7th Cavalry Regiment]].  Two weeks before that, [[Sitting Bull]] himself had been killed, by police acting at the behest of these new rulers.  Thus had begun the relentless suppression of the Lakota nation:  their institutions, the religion, and even the language.  Each decade since that "time of great melancholy"&lt;!--Matthiessen,p.23--&gt;, when hopes for sovereignty had "died in bloody snow"&lt;!--Neihardt,p.2--&gt;, brought renewed demands for more Lakota land, always in violation of [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|treaty agreements]].

{{quote|Today my people, and all native people of this continent, are changed —degraded by oppression and poverty into but a semblance of their former being;&amp;nbsp; health is undermined by disease, and the moral and spiritual life of the people deadened by the loss of the great sustaining forces of their devotional ceremonies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;''Land of the Spotted Eagle'', page 226&lt;/ref&gt;| [[Luther Standing Bear]],&amp;nbsp; 1933&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}}

[[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Dick Wilson]] had become chairman of the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] in 1972.  A heavy–drinking bootlegger known for corruption, he favored giving up more Lakota land, even the ''Pahá Sápa'' itself.  He soon used federal government funds to create [[GOONs|his own]] private vigilante "[[goon squad]]", with which to terrorize his adversaries.  Those who opposed Wilson and his regime formed the "Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization", led by [[Pedro Bissonette]], and worked to impeach him.  One petition to impeach Wilson contained more signatures than the number of people who had originally voted for him.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, ''In the Spirit...'', page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson postponed impeachment hearings which were scheduled for February 14.  Immediately thereafter, federal forces moved into the area, including a counter–insurgency "Special Operations Group", which set up and manned sand–bagged machine gun positions at the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|BIA]] building.  On February 23, thus reinforced and without a proper tribal council quorum, Wilson was "exonerated" and quickly banned "all  public meetings and demonstrations" on the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson et al., ''Voices...'', page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=We called our brothers and AIM to help us because we were being oppressed and terrorized.&amp;nbsp; They answered our call.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Roots of Repression'', page 76&lt;/ref&gt;|source= —Frank Fools Crow&lt;!--in1974--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;!--"We defeated the U.S. Army many times. Always, when we met them on equal terms, we defeated them."-'80--&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|align=center|width=87%|border=2px|fontsize=102%|bgcolor=Ivory|quoted=yes|salign=right}}

The night that the occupation took place, the leaders of [[American Indian Movement|AIM]] met with the traditional Oglala elders and leaders.

{{quote box|quote=One by one, the Oglala Sioux Chiefs stood up, and their names will come before you&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp; Names like Fools Crow and Crow Dog, names like Catches&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill &amp; Wall, ''Agents...'', page 143&lt;/ref&gt;|source= —[[Dennis Banks]]&lt;!--in1974--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|align=center|width=87%|border=2px|fontsize=102%|bgcolor=Ivory|quoted=yes|salign=right}}

As senior elder, Fools Crow spoke to the young leaders in his native [[Lakota language]] (he never spoke English in public) and said to them, "Go ahead and do it, go to [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]]. You can't get in the BIA office and the tribal office, so take your brothers from the American Indian Movement and go to Wounded Knee and [[Wounded Knee Incident|make your stand]] there."&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Warrior, ''...Hurricane'', page 200&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A few minutes later the meeting at Calico ended, and the caravan, fifty–four cars long, rolled through the winter night; old people and kids and tough guys and aunts and uncles.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp; Dennis Banks rode in the lead car with Chief Fools Crow, and on arrival at Wounded Knee, a hamlet of around one hundred residents, people from the car gathered at the mass grave for a prayer with movement spiritual leaders Pete Catches and Leonard Crow Dog.| Smith &amp; Warrior| &amp;nbsp;''Like a Hurricane''| &amp;nbsp;page 201&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}}

On the list of demands presented to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], Fools Crow was listed along with other chiefs and medicine men as supporters of the movement. After the occupiers declared themselves to be the "Independent Oglala Nation", Fools Crow traveled with Matthew King, his interpreter, and [[Russell Means]] to the [[United Nations]] to make a speech. Though no official transcript of this speech remains, there is no doubt to its significance.

The occupation lasted for 71 days, until an agreement was reached between federal officials and a Lakota delegation, which included Fools Crow.  [[Hank Adams]], the personal representative of the President, arrived with an agreement to the proposal that the chiefs had sent to the White House on May 3. Adams met Fools Crow and a hundred others near a fence around the property. Adams handed a letter through a barbed–wire fence to Fools Crow, who was wearing the traditional attire of buckskin and a headdress. The letter appealed for the occupation of the village to come to an end. Fools Crow and the other leaders accepted the proposal, which stated that the White House would send representatives to Pine Ridge to discuss a treaty in the third week of May and would "get tough" on Dick Wilson, the unscrupulous chairman of the reservation. Fools Crow and the other chiefs delivered the letter to the AIM leaders and told them that he believed that it was time to end it.

{{quote|[[Buddy Lamonte|Buddy]]'s death, which saddened everyone, convinced Grandpa Fools Crow and the other elders that there had been enough death.  Since we were too few to fight and too many to die, Fools Crow asked the Wounded Knee leaders to try to find a peaceful resolution.  On May 2, a Department of the Interior negotiator stated for the record, "I do have the authority to insure that the Government of the United States, and probably Congress, will discuss anything with your chiefs, anything and everything you want to discuss about the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|1868 Treaty]]....  I have the authority to tell you that any and all criminal violations against you by any outsiders will be prosecuted.  I do have the authority to tell you that members of the tribal government will be prosecuted."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...

Once again, we Indians had accepted the white man's promises —just as our ancestors had.  Once again, the government of the United States of America had lied.| [[Russell Means]]| &amp;nbsp;''[[Where White Men Fear to Tread]]''| &amp;nbsp;pages 292 &amp; -3&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;!--"Their prayers, they help us."--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}}

After the murder of [[Frank Clearwater]] at Wounded Knee, and because the U.S. government would not allow his body to be buried there, his wife agreed to bury him on [[Leonard Crow Dog]]’s property on the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], and had the [[wake]] at Fools Crow’s house, where the body was placed in a [[tipi]] and covered with a blanket for mourners to come to pay their respect.&lt;!--Matthiessen,pp.258-9--&gt;

In an article in the ''New York Times'' on May 8, 1973, the negotiations were said to have taken place at Fools Crow's house around the third week of May. In an interview, Dick Wilson said, "My people know that Fools Crow is a zero," plainly showing that he had no respect for the traditions that Fools Crow stood for. In Washington D.C. on May 17, The Oglalas had their promised White House meeting, and Fools Crow was present. Of the five promised White House aides, two were there. Fools Crow was told that the historic treaties were dead.

Fools Crow spoke at a congressional hearing on June 16 and 17, 1973, following the conclusion of the Wounded Knee occupation; he only spoke Lakota, as was his way, and used an interpreter, Matthew King, to translate for him. He gave his reasons for the occupation, the main reason being the removal of Dick Wilson. Senator [[George McGovern]] said that he would try to remove Wilson, but was not sure if he had the power to do so. Fools Crow asserted that McGovern had promised earlier to remove Dick Wilson, yet the violence continued.

==Prayer before the United States Senate==
In August 1975, thirty activists, including Fools Crow, traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|1868 Treaty]], [[sovereignty]], and the continuing violence and [[civil rights]] violations.  On September 5, Grandfather Fools Crow gave the opening prayer for the [[United States Senate]].&lt;!--Matthiessen,p.221--&gt;  This is believed to be&lt;ref&gt;website:&amp;nbsp; [http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1015812 Frank Fools Crow&amp;nbsp; ]&lt;/ref&gt; an accurate translation of his words:

{{cquote|In the presence of this house, Grandfather, ''[[Wakan Tanka]]'',&lt;br&gt;and from the direction where the sun sets, and from the direction of cleansing power,&lt;br&gt;and from the direction of the rising, and from the direction of the middle of the day.

Grandfather, ''Wakan Tanka'', Grandmother, the Earth who hears everything,&lt;br&gt;Grandmother, because you are woman, for this reason you are kind,&lt;br&gt;I come to you this day to tell you to love the red men,&lt;br&gt;and watch over them, and give these young men the understanding&lt;br&gt;because, Grandmother, from you comes the good things,&lt;br&gt;good things that are beyond our eyes to see have been blessed in our midst&lt;br&gt;for this reason I make my supplication known to you again.

Give us a blessing so that our words and actions be one in unity,&lt;br&gt;and that we be able to listen to each other, in so doing,&lt;br&gt;we shall with good heart walk hand in hand to face the future.

In the presence of the outside, we are thankful for many blessings.&lt;br&gt;I make my prayer for all people, the children, the women and the men.&lt;br&gt;I pray that no harm will come to them, and that on the great island,&lt;br&gt;there be no war, that there be no ill feelings among us.&lt;br&gt;From this day on may we walk hand in hand.&amp;nbsp; So be it.}}

During the same morning as this prayer, the FBI staged a massive paramilitary raid on the property of Leonard Crow Dog.&lt;!--Matthiessen,pp.227-38--&gt;

== "We shall never sell our sacred Black Hills." ==
On September 10, 1976, Fools Crow delivered a lengthy speech to the Congressional Subcommittee on Interior and Insular Affairs. The speech, entitled the ''Joint Statement of Chief Frank Fools Crow and Frank Kills Enemy on Behalf of the Traditional Lakota Treaty Council Before Honorable Lloyd Meads Sub–Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs,'' was a plea for the return of the [[Black Hills]] to his people.  Later, the speech was printed up in poster form and widely disseminated over the reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Mails, ''Fools Crow'', page 210&lt;/ref&gt;  The full speech can be read here.&lt;ref&gt;website:&amp;nbsp; {{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/lakotastudentalliance/lsa2_weshallneversell.html |title=Lakota Student Alliance |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027055747/http://www.geocities.com/lakotastudentalliance/lsa2_weshallneversell.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gazelem''' ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|z|eɪ|l|ɪ|m}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «ga-zā´lĭm»&lt;/ref&gt; "one who gazes"){{citation needed|date=September 2017}} is a person or stone mentioned in the [[Book of Mormon]].

[[Book of Alma|Alma]] 37:23 reads, "And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations."

The punctuation seems to indicate that Gazelem is the name of the stone, not the servant, but this interpretation is not universal. The manuscript of the Book of Mormon that Joseph Smith presented to E.B. Grandin for printing did not have punctuation; Grandin added punctuation with Smith's permission.&lt;ref name="Worthy of Another Look: John Gilbert's 1892 Account of the 1830 Printing of the Book of Mormon"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/21/2/S00005-510c2afb8c5ad5-Skousen.pdf | title = Worthy of Another Look: John Gilbert’s 1892 Account of the 1830 Printing of the Book of Mormon | accessdate = 2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index to the current [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] edition of the Book of Mormon defines ''Gazelem'' as "Name given to servant of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | authorlink = http://www.lds.org
  | title = Index
  | work = The Official Scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
  | publisher = Intellectual Reserve, Inc
  | year = 2006
  | url = http://scriptures.lds.org/en/in/g/18
  | accessdate = 2006-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of Gazelem is uncertain, but the most likely candidates are (the [[seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]] used by) [[King Mosiah I|Mosiah]] and [[Joseph Smith]].  The [[Jaredite]]s are the people whose secret works Gazelem is to bring to light, and both Mosiah and Joseph Smith are supposed to have used [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stones]] to translate the Jaredite record.

In early editions of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], ''Gazelam'' (sic) is one of the [[List of code names in the Doctrine and Covenants|code names]] used for Joseph Smith, suggesting that he may have identified himself with Gazelem of the Book of Mormon.

If Gazelem is a prophet, contemporary to the early Nephites, who was given a Urim and Thummim, then there must have been two sets of interpreters among them. The other set of interpreters were the ones given to the Brother of Jared. They were later buried with the plates and used to translate the Book of Mormon (See Ether 3:23; DC 17:1). Another possibility is that Gazelem is not a proper name but a title for a seer. Thirdly, the name may be a reference to Joseph Smith, who was referred to in the D&amp;C as "Gazelam" when code names were used to conceal the identity of those referred to in the revelations. The following quotes are helpful.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The word Gazelem appears to have its roots in Gaz - a stone and Aleim, a name of God as a revelator or interposer in the affairs of men. If this suggestion be correct, its roots admirably agree with its apparent meaning-a seer. (George Reynolds, A Dictionary of the Book of Mormon, p.&amp;nbsp;92)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This may well be a play on words.  Is Gazelem the seer stone or the servant?  It is difficult to tell from the passage and depends very much on the placement of a comma in the sentence.  Perhaps it could refer to both.  It is interesting to note that when Jesus called Simon Peter to the ministry he said:  'Thou art Simon the son of Jona:  thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a seer, or a stone' (JST, John 1:42).  Though this name or title of Gazelem may be used in regard to any seer who utilizes seer stones, it seems in this instance to be a direct reference to Joseph Smith the Prophet or another.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 


We must emphasize that the Prophet Joseph Smith had the tradition of writing names as in the case of the brother of Jared who reveals it in a blessing.(McConkie and Millet, Doctrinal Commentary on the Book of Mormon, vol. 3, p.&amp;nbsp;278)

[[File:Ojo de dios anaroza.jpg|thumb|360px|God's eye or Ojo de Dios on Quemado Mountain, [[San Luis Potosi]], [[Mexico]]]]
A '''God's eye''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], '''''Ojo de Dios''''') is a spiritual and votive object made by weaving a design out of yarn upon a wooden cross. Often several colors are used. They are commonly found in [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and [[Mexican Americans|Mexican American]] communities, among both Indigenous and Catholic peoples.

''Ojos de Dios'' are common in the [[Pueblos]] of [[New Mexico]]. Often they reflect a confidence in all-seeing Providence. The spiritual eye of the ''Ojos de Dios'' is thought by some believers to have the power to see and understand things unknown to the physical eye.  During Spanish colonial times in New Mexico, from the 16th to the 19th centuries, ''Ojos de Dios'' (God's Eye) were placed where people worked, or where they walked along a trail (Major, 2012).

In other parts of the Americas, artisans weave complicated or variegated versions of the traditional ''Ojos de Dios'', selling them as decorations or religious objects. There has also been a huge increase in the use of Ojos de Dios as an easy and fun craft for children.

The Ojo de Dios or God's eye is a ritual tool that was believed to protect those while they pray, magical object, and an ancient cultural symbol evoking the weaving motif and its spiritual associations for the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] and [[Tepehuan]] Indians of western [[Mexico]]. The Huichol call their God's Eyes '''Sikuli''', which means "the power to see and understand things unknown."{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} When a child is born, the central eye is woven by the father, then one eye is added for every year of the child's life until the child reaches the age of five.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Original Tepehuan Crosses are extremely rare to come by. There are many that are being made for the tourist market, but they do not carry the same traditional and spiritual significance.

==Nierika, Nieli’ka==
[[File:God's eyes.jpg|thumb|''Ojo de dios'' made from [[chopstick]]s and yarn]]

In the traditional Huichol ranchos, the ''nieli'ka'' or ''nierika'' is an important ritual artifact. Negrín states that one of the principal meanings of "''nierika''" is that of "a metaphysical vision, an aspect of a god or a collective ancestor,"&lt;ref name=n3&gt;Negrín 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and is the same term the [[Tepehuán people]] use to refer to deities. Negrín quotes Lumholtz as stating that for the Huichol and Tepehuan "a ''nierika'' means a picture, an appearance, or a sacred representation."&lt;ref name=n3/&gt; The term ''nierika'' is etymologically rooted in the verb ''nieriya'', "to see".  ''Nierika'' are found in Huichol and Tepehuans' most sacred places: house shrines (''xiriki''), springs, caves and temples. Some Natives of northwest Mexico and throughout the southwest U.S. have had visions during [[peyote]] ceremonies in which they received guidance from Gods who appeared before them in many shapes, though the eyes of the God were so intense and overwhelming that many Natives could only see the eye of the God. To show others the vision they had, they made the ''God's eye'' - woven on sticks with handspun yarn, colored with various types of berries, flowers, and other materials to capture the essence of their vision.

Negrín states that: "The [[votive]] ''nierika'' is generally a round offering, symbolizing an ancestor and prayer offerings sanctified by the blood of a sacrificed animal."&lt;ref name=n3/&gt; ''Nierika'' as a ritual object may be attached to votive arrows with bamboo and yarn, or wood-and-wax-embedded objects.  Similarly, Lumholtz states that the ''nierika'' "evokes an [[ancestor]], thanks it with blood offerings, and invokes its favors."  The ''nierika'' may take different forms and fabrication may differ greatly:  a small round or square tablet with a hole in the center covered on one or both sides with a mixture of [[beeswax]] and pine resin into which threads of yarn are pressed; when the image is not round, it may be considered a resting mat for the ancestors, or a prayer mat or itari.

Negrín states the elaborate interwoven ''nierika'' that Lumholtz called ''namma'' (which is close to the pronunciation of [[Namkha]]) from which originated the detailed and now prized yarn paintings of the commercial art world, are now rarely if ever seen.&lt;ref name="n3"/&gt;  ''Namma'' were generally rectangular or square in shape, with yarn woven onto a grid of bamboo sticks.  These God’s Eyes are also called by the Spanish term ''ojo de dios''. One understanding of the ''ojo de dios'' according to Harvey is of a: "wand" (the eye) through which the eye of god will see the supplicant. Harvey states that: "The cross of the ''ojo de dios'' is that of the legendary four directions: earth, fire, water, and air."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, 1973:  9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Population}}

The '''history of the [[Jews]] in Mexico''' can be said to have begun in 1519 with the arrival of ''[[Conversos]]'', often called ''[[Marrano]]s'' or “[[Crypto-Jews]],” referring to those Jews forcibly converted to Catholicism and that then became subject to the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. 

Over the colonial period (1521-1821), a number came to Mexico especially during the period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580-1640), when Spain and Portugal were ruled by the same monarch. That political circumstance allowed freer movement by Portuguese crypto-Jewish merchants into Spanish America. When the Portuguese won their independence from Spain in 1640, Portuguese merchants in [[New Spain]] were prosecuted by the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. When the monopoly of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]] was replaced with [[religious toleration]] during the nineteenth-century [[La Reforma|Liberal reform]], Jews could openly immigrate to Mexico. They came from Europe and later from the crumbling [[Ottoman Empire]] and what is now [[Syria]] continuing into the first half of the 20th century.

Today, most Jews in Mexico are descendants of this immigration and still divided by diasporic origin, principally [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardim]]. It is an insular community with its own religious, social and cultural institutions, mostly in [[Guadalajara]] and [[Mexico City]]. However, since the 1880s, there have been efforts to identify descendants of colonial era Conversos both in Mexico and the Southwestern United States, generally to return them to Judaism.

==History==

===Colonial period===
Jews and Conversos were part of the conquest and colonization in Mexico, and key participants in the transatlantic and transpacific trade networks, as well as development of domestic trade.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Alexandra Ushmany. "The Participation of New Christians and Crypto-Jews in the Conquest, Colonization, and Trade of Spanish America, 1521-1660," in The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1450-1800, Paolo Bernardini and Norman Fiering, eds. New York: Berghahn Books 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversos accompanied [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1519. These were members of Jewish families which had been forcibly converted to Christianity in order to avoid expulsion from Spain after the [[Reconquista|Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Moors]] .&lt;ref name="presencia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los judíos y su presencia en México desde el siglo XVI |author=) José Kaminer  |url= http://diariojudio.com/bin/forojudio.cgi?ID=2030&amp;q=28 |newspaper=El Diario Judío |location=Mexico City |date=August 25, 2010 |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Jews and their presence in Mexico since the 16th century }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1slenchek"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/677-jews-in-mexico-a-struggle-for-survival-part-one |title= Jews in Mexico, a struggle for survival: Part One |last= Lenchek |first=Shep |date=February 1, 2000 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconquest was followed by the Spanish Inquisition which made the Conversos one of their targets, with accusations of reverting to Judaic practice.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; Converso migration to the new Spanish colony began in 1530 after most of the violence from the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]] had subsided and the Spanish Inquisition continued. For several decades these families were able to live peacefully, integrating into Mexico’s elite, with some become prominent Catholic clergy and some returning to Jewish practice.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;

[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumbnail|left|Execution of Mariana de Carabajal, daughter of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal]], in 1601.]]
The persecution of Jews came to New Spain along with the [[conquistador]]s. [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] described in his writings various execution of soldiers during the conquest of Mexico because they were accused of being practicing Jews, including Hernando Alonzo, who built the boats Cortés used to assault [[Tenochtitlán]].&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt; However, the [[Mexican Inquisition]] was not fully established until 1571 to become a threat to Converso and Jewish communities with an initial purge of these peoples from 1585 to 1601.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcarroll"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Carroll |first= Michael P |date=Spring 2002 |title= The debate over a crypto-Jewish presence in New Mexico: The role of ethnographic allegory and orientalism |journal=Sociology of Religion |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.2307/3712537}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1606 Mexico received an order by the King of Spain to free Conversos in Inquisition prisons.&lt;ref name="desde1519"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tarbut.edu.mx/tarbut/home/65_anos/celebracion/judios_mexico.htm |title=Los Judios en México desde 1519 a 1996 |publisher=Colegio Hebreo Tarbut |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Jews in Mexico from 1519 to 1996 |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206013626/http://www.tarbut.edu.mx/tarbut/home/65_anos/celebracion/judios_mexico.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This relaxing of the Inquisition in Mexico, which was never as severe as in Spain, allowed more to come over in the first half of the 17th century. New Conversos settled in Mexico City, [[Acapulco]], [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]] as they provided the most opportunities for mercantile activity. Some did move to the more outlying areas such as [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] but this area still afforded more opportunities than points further north.&lt;ref name="mcarroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liebman"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://codex.colmex.mx:8991/exlibris/aleph/a18_1/apache_media/3N9C83XTL1FD831KVLCVF19XL73XTT.pdf  |author=Seymore B. Leibman |title= Fuentes desconocidas de la historia Mexicano-Judia |publisher= Colegio Nacional de México  |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Unknowns sources of the history of Mexican Judaism |accessdate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a second Inquisition persecution of Conversos/Crypto-Jews from 1642 to 1649. After that, the focus shifted to matters such as blasphemy and moral infractions.&lt;ref name="mcarroll"/&gt; However, during the entire colonial period, practicing Jews in Spain or elsewhere could not enter Spanish colonial territory.&lt;ref name="liebman"/&gt;

One notable episode during the colonial period was the establishment of the [[New Kingdom of León]]. In 1567 the Carvajal family arrived to [[New Spain]] under nobleman [[Luis de Carabajal y Cueva|Luis de Carvajal]]. With the exception of him and a cousin, this family was Crypto-Jewish.&lt;ref name="jmillman"&gt;{{cite news |title= Texas Rabbi Claims Mexico Is Playing Host to a Lost Tribe --- He Inspires Mass Conversions With His Belief That Jews Served in Cortes's Ranks |author= Joel Millman |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=June 15, 2000 |page=A1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1579 Carvajal was granted land in what is now northeastern Mexico, just north of what was then considered New Spain. This area welcomed both Conversos and practicing Jews, with about seventy five percent of the initial settlers being secretly Jewish.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; Some theories state that [[Monterrey]] developed as a commercial center despite its colonial era remoteness because of Crypto-Jewish influence.&lt;ref name="jmillman"/&gt; However, Luis de Carvajal and members of his family were persecuted in 1589 for practicing Judaism.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt; The [[Auto-da-fé]] of Mariana Carvajal has become part of Mexican art and literature.&lt;ref name="bokser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/mexico |author= Judit Bokser Liwerant  |title= Mexico |work=Jewish Women A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia |accessdate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1641 this colony had grown, and some of the settlers would later move to establish new settlements in [[Coahuila]], [[Texas]], and [[New Santander]].&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;

The largest number of prosecutions by the Mexican Inquisition occurred in the wake of the 1640 dissolution of the Iberian Union, when Spain and Portugal were ruled by the same monarch.  Portuguese merchants more easily entered Spanish America, and a complex community of crypto-Jews connected to transatlantic and transpacific trade networks emerged. Evidence from individual cases prosecuted by the Mexican Inquisition indicates that most crypto-Jews in Mexico were born or Portugal themselves or their children, primarily from the Portuguese capital of [[Lisbon]] or Castelobranco.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, "Portuguese Cryto-Judaism in New Spain, 1569-1649" in ''Diasporas within a Diaspora: Jews, Crypto-Jews and the World Maritime Empires (1540-1740)''. Leiden: Brill 2002, pp. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were a few very wealthy Portuguese merchants, who were leaders of the community, but the largest number were shopkeepers and craftsmen.  A prominent merchant was Simón Váez, whom the Inquisition accused of letting his house serve as a synagogue in the seventeenth century until the 1642 persecutions began. He had risen from humble circumstances, but he and other wealthy merchants came to socialize with crown officials and play a prominent role among elites.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, "Portuguese Crypto-Judaism" pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eva A. Uchmany, "Simón Váez Sevilla", ''Micahel, Journal of the History of the Jews in the Diaspora'', viii (1983), pp. 126-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Their wealth was based on [[asientos]] (licenses) for the black slave trade in Mexico, since Portugal controlled the African coast where they were sourced. Portuguese merchants also held contracts for tax-farming, and for supplying the Spanish fleet and forts with stores and munitions.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, "Portuguese Crypto-Judaism", pp. 101-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Independence immigration===
After Mexico gained its Independence, it abolished the Inquisition but Catholic religion was declared official. Remaining Crypto-Jews still did not openly admit to such but did begin to observe various Jewish rituals and from 1825 to 1860 and a few European Jews from Germany and Eastern Europe arrived.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt; These immigrants were not allowed to become Mexican citizens but their main challenges to living in Mexico were economic rather than social or religious.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; In 1861 a group rented a hall to celebrate [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]], the first recorded instance of public Jewish worship.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;   In 1865, then [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian I]] issued an edict of religious tolerance,  with representatives from Jewish organizations in Europe and the United States coming to Mexico to explore the possibilities for immigration.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt; From 1864 to 1867, the Mexican emperor invited some European Jews from France, Belgium and Austro-Hungary to settle in Mexico.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt; By 1867, only twenty Jewish families were living in Mexico, with about a dozen more elsewhere.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;

During the [[Reform War]], the Liberals under [[Benito Juárez]] reinforced freedom of religion, allowing those Jews who arrived after that time Mexican citizenship and full integration.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; In the 1880s, a significant wave of Jewish immigration began as the Mexican government invited a number of Jewish bankers to operate in the country and the assassination of [[Czar Alexander II]] in Russia pushed Jews to leave the country. These Jews settled both in Mexico City and various other areas in the country, including rural areas often as traveling salesmen. About half of Mexico’s Jewish population can be linked to this wave of immigration.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; Another group of Jews that came at this time were industrialists from France. However many of the French arrivals were not interested in staying permanently and eventually went back after making their fortunes in Mexico. However a few did marry and stay leaving behind in Mexico City last names such as Herzog, Scherer and Levy.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;  Jewish immigrants in Mexico City eventually built businesses such as haberdashery on [[Madero Street]] that was a center of European fashion and La Esmeralda jewelry store (now the [[Museo del Estanquillo]]) with a reputation similar to [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany’s]] on the corner of Isabel la Católica and Madero. The Jewish owner of El Salon Rojo, one of the capital’s first movie houses, help to develop the country’s first Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref name="smurphy"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Murphy-Larronde |first= Suzanne |date=Jan–Feb 2006 |title= Guiding Mexico's Jewish Legacy |journal=Americas |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=4–5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the very late 19th century into the 20th, [[Sephardic]] and [[Middle Eastern Jews]] also began arriving from what is now [[Syria]] and the crumbling [[Ottoman Empire]], forming the Maguén David and Monte Sinaí communities.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt; These with those still coming from Eastern Europe were poorer usually shoemakers, furriers, peddlers and tailors, which first lived in cities such as [[Puebla]], [[Veracruz]] and [[Chiapas]] before migrating to Mexico City.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt; For the Sephardic Jews similar language and culture made it easier for them to adapt.&lt;ref name="palate"&gt;{{cite news |title= The Jewish Palate: The Jews of Mexico |author=Dennis Wasko |url= http://www.jpost.com/FoodIndex/Article.aspx?id=219120 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |location=Jerusalem |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, the Mexican census counted 134 Jews in the country.&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt;  From then until 1950, an estimated 7,300 Jewish people immigrated to Mexico from Eastern Europe, 2,640 from Spain or the former Ottoman Empire, and 1,620 from [[Cuba]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="traslas"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tras las huellas de los judíos en México |author=Natalia Gómez |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/134411.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=January 24, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Following the footsteps of the Jews in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt; These various Jewish groups formed their own religious congregations and social institutions.  Turkish Jews began holding open religious services in 1901 and founded the first Talmud Torah in 1905, as an educational institution for boys. Ashkenazi Jews began holding open services as early as 1904. The first formal Jewish organization in Mexico, the Monte Sinaí community was founded in 1912.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;

[[File:Hoja de registro de ingreso de inmigrantes judios a Puebla - Expediente 9321.jpg|thumbnail|left|Immigrant registration form of a Jewish Lithuanian woman that emigrated to Mexico in 1934.]]
During the [[Mexican Revolution]] many foreigners, including Jews, left the country but immediately after Jews began to arrive again in substantial numbers again. Between 1917 and 1920 they began to come from [[Russia]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[the Balkans]] and the Middle East. The rate increased in 1921 when the United States imposed quotas on its immigration.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; Ten thousand arrived  from Eastern Europe to the [[Veracruz, Veracruz|port of Veracruz]] at the invitation of President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]].&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;   Jewish organizations such as the Comité de Damas and North American [[B'nai B'rith]] were formed to help the new arrivals adapt.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt; In the 1920s, the Jewish community grew and prospered in Mexico.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;  The immigration rate slowed after 1929 because of the [[Great Depression]] and new immigration policies which favored those with a more similar ethnic and religious background to that of Mexico.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;

Most of the Jewish communities’ social and religious organizations were formally founded in the first half of the 20th century. These include the Sociedad Beneficiencia Alianza Monte Sinaí (1912), the Young Men’s Hebrew Association in Mexico City. (1917), the first K’tav or Jewish religious school (1917),  the first federally recognized synagogue under the terms of the [[Constitution of 1917]] (1918), the Talmud Torá Hatihiá (1919), the Congregación Nidje Israel for Ashkenazi Jews (1922), the first [[Zionist]] organization (1922), the first Ashkenazi religious school (1922), the Asociación Cultural IL Peretz Farein, later called the Idisher Kultur Guezelshaft (1922),  the Har Sinaé synagogue for the [[Damascus]] Jewish community, (1923), the first Keren Hayeson or campaign for the National Fund for Palestine (1923),  the Centro Israelita and first [[synagogue]] in Monterrey (1923), the Colegio Israelita de México (1924), the Agudat Ajim community in [[Guadalajara]] (1923),  the Bnej Kedem Sephardic community Center (1926), the Nidje Israel Ashkenazi cemetery (1929), the Cámara Israelita de Industria y Comerico in Méxicoand the Unión de Literatos y Artistas Judíos (1931), the Federación de Sociedades Israelitas de México (1932), the Colegio Israelita Hatikva in Monterrey (1932), B'nai B'rith (1934), the Sociedad de Beneficiencia Sdadá Umarpé for the [[Aleppo]] Jewish community, today the Comunidad Maguén David (1938) and the first Zionist convention (1938) .&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt; In addition various newspapers and other periodicals were established in various languages such as Mexicanisher Idish Leben (Yiddish, 1927), Der Veg (Yiddish with Spanish section, 1929), Di shtime (Yiddish, 1935) and La Verdad (Spanish, 1936). The first printing press for the [[Hebrew alphabet]]  was brought to Mexico in 1930.&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt;

The Jewish population in Mexico was estimated at 21,000 in 1930.&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt; From then until the 1940s, the Jews that arrived were those fleeing the [[Nazis]] but this immigration was not as large as in previous decades as most of those who arrived where those who already had family and friends in the country.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;

Despite its strong Catholic identity and history of Inquisition, there has been little intolerance or resistance to Jewish immigration into Mexico. While the Catholic Church did not welcome Jewish immigration in the 19th century, it was still struggling against the government restrictions and saw [[Protestantism in Mexico|growing Protestantism]] as a greater threat than that of the Jewish community. Over the 20th century, the [[Mexican Catholic Church]] lost its opposition to the Jewish presence.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2slenchek"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/676 |title= Jews in Mexico, a struggle for survival: Part Two |last= Lenchek |first=Shep |date=March 1, 2000 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089  |accessdate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only recorded incidents of significant [[anti-Semitism]] came in the 1930s during economic depression. Mexican labor unions pressured the government to restrict [[Chinese immigration to Mexico|Chinese]] and Jewish immigration. In May 1931, 250 Jewish merchants were expelled from the [[La Lagunilla Market, Mexico City|La Lagunilla Market in Mexico City]] .&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt;   In the late 1930s, some anti-Jewish demonstrations erupted, mostly by Nazi supporters financed by Berlin. In 1937, an immigrant quota system was initiated, which restricted immigration from certain countries such as Poland to 100 people per year, shutting out many Jewish would-be-immigrants.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jews of Mexico |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/mexico |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time the Mexican government allowed for some immigration of refugees, for example looking the other way when 200 Jews from Cuba entered the country illegally under the government of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] .&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;

===Post immigration period===
[[File:Judíos polacos en la Ciudad de México, 1961.JPG|thumbnail|Mexican Jews of Polish descent in 1961]]
Jewish religious and social institutions coalesced and grew in the mid 20th century with the Centro Cultural Israelita (1941), the Comité Central Israelita legally recognized to represent the Jewish community (1942), the Unión Sefaradí receiving official recognition (1943),  the founding of the Comité Unido de Antidifamación (1943),  the formation of the Comité Unido de Tribuna Israelita by the Comité Central Israelita and the Logia Mexicana del B'nai B'rith (1944), the founding of the Unión Israelita Maguén David in Tijuana (1946), the Centro Cultural México Israel (1947), the Colegio Israelita de Guadalajara (1949),  the Centro Deportivo Israelita (1950), the Beth Israel Community Center for English speakers (1957) and the Nidje Israel Temple in Acapulco Street in Mexico City (1965).&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt;

In 1987 the Tribuna Israelita along with [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico]] (UNAM) began a series of cultural presentations about Judaism in Mexico.&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt; However, little attention was paid to the history of Jews in Mexico until the 1990s. In 1992, a study of Jewish communities in Mexico was published by UNAM in collaboration with the Tribuna Israelita and the Comite Central Israelita de Mexico, called Imágenes de un Encuentro: La Presencia Judía en México Durante La Primera Mitad del Siglo XX (Images of an Encounter: The Jewish Presence in Mexico during the First Half of the 20th Century) which received the CANIEM Prize in 1993. It depicts Mexican Jews as well integrated into Mexican society but with more observance of religion in everyday life than most other Jews of the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]]. In 1995, Tribuna Israelita co sponsored Las Jornadas Contra del Racismo along with the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]] and other organizations.&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt;

==Jewish communities in Mexico==
The current Jewish population in Mexico mostly consists of those who have descended from immigrants from the 19th and early 20th centuries with nationwide totals estimated between   40,000 and   50,000, about 75% of whom are in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt; The exact numbers are not known. One main source for figures is the Comité Central Israelita in Mexico City but its contact is limited to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] congregations with no contact with Jews that may be affiliated with the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movement or those who consider themselves secular. The Mexican government census lists religion but its categories are confusing, confusing those of some Protestant sects which practice Judaic rituals with Jewish groups. There is also controversy as to whether to count those Crypto-Jews who have converted (back) to Judaism.&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt; Sixty two percent of the population over fifteen is married, three percent divorced and four percent widowed. However, younger Jewish women are more likely to be employed outside the home (only 18% of women are housewives) and fertility rates are dropping from 3.5 children of women over 65 to 2.7 for the overall population now. There is a low level of intermarriage with the general Mexican population, with only 3.1% of marriages being mixed.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt; Although the Jewish community is less than one percent of Mexico’s total population, Mexico is one of the few countries whose Jewish population is expected to grow.&lt;ref name="palate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmedina"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Medina |first= Manuel F |date=Spring 2000 |title= Imaging a space in between: Writing the gap between Jewish and Mexican identities in Rosa Nissan's narrative |journal=Studies in the Literary Imagination |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=93–106  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sinagoga Historica.jpg|thumbnail|Interior of the [[Historic Synagogue Justo Sierra 71]] located in the [[Historic Center of Mexico City]].]]
The Mexican Jewish community has strong roots in Mexico and has few problems in its host country.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; Openly Jewish people serve prominently in government positions and are found in most spheres of Mexico’s business, intellectual and artistic communities.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt; One U.S. born Jew by the name of [[Sidney Franklin (bullfighter)|Sidney Franklin]] became a popular bullfighter in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt; There are occasional clashes between the Jewish community and others in Mexico but these are generally solved peacefully. There is an Interfaith Council to help with these issues. While the Catholic Church is dominant both religiously and culturally, it does not suppress the worship or other activities of other religious groups.&lt;ref name="wtpculture"&gt;{{cite book |author= World Trade Press.  |title= Mexico Society and Culture Complete Report. |year=2010 |publisher= World Trade Press |location= Petaluma, CA |isbn= 9781607803942 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only challenges the community faces are intermarriage and migration out of the country.&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt; However, Latin American popular culture can resent apparent Jewish economic success, with the community associated with international capital and international influence.&lt;ref name="mmedina"/&gt;

Jews in Mexico are less united than those in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="mmedina"/&gt; Among those descended from immigrants, there remain social divisions based on place of origin despite unification efforts.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tribunaeng"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tribuna.org.mx/presencia.php?id=4 |title= Jewish Community in Mexico |publisher= Tribuna Israelita |location= Mexico City |accessdate= November 28, 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110923001605/http://www.tribuna.org.mx/presencia.php?id=4 |archivedate= September 23, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those from Aleppo, Damascus and the Balkans and Eastern Europe have their own synagogues and other institutions. However, the main split is between the Ashkenazim from Russia, Poland, Germany and other parts of Europe from the Sephardim, mostly from Italy and the former Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tribunaeng"/&gt;  The Ashkenazim subdivide among political and ideological axes and tend to be more liberal and secular. They founded several newspapers and other publications such as Mexikaner Idish Lebn, Radikaler Arbeter Tzenter, Unzer Lebn and others to express these different views.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;  The Sephardim tend to be more patriarchal, less well educated and more religiously observant.&lt;ref name="mmedina"/&gt; Those from Syria are further subdivided into Halebis or Maguen David from Aleppo and the Shamis or Monte Sinai from Damascus.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;

Despite ethnic identification all identify as Mexican as well, seeing the two as complementary rather than conflicting.&lt;ref name="mmedina"/&gt; Literature written by Mexican and other Latin American Jewish writers tend to explore the question of what it means to be a Jew in the region. These authors include [[Sonia Chocron]], [[Alicia Freilich de Segal]], [[Jacqueline Goldberg]], [[Martha Kornblith]], [[Elisa Lerner]] and [[Blanca Strepponi]]. Author [[Rosa Nissan]] has written a number of books related to growing up Jewish in Mexico include Novia que te vea and its sequel Hisho que te Nazca.&lt;ref name="mmedina"/&gt;

During the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants started a large number of religious and social organizations to help the community adapt to life in Mexico and conserve their heritage. On Tacuba Street in the [[historic center of Mexico City]] there is a building called the Palacio de Mármol (Marble Palace). The site was originally part of a convent, but later it was subdivided and a French style mansion built in the late 19th century.  After World War I, it became an important Jewish community center, active for nearly two decades. At first it worked to help newly arrived Jews settle in Mexico but it was also a social and educational center.&lt;ref name="smurphy"/&gt; Today, there are ten main organizations to which most of Mexican Jewry is affiliated. The Beth Israel Community Center is an organization which caters to the English speaking community that practices Conservative Judaism. The Jewish Sport Center is a neutral meeting place open to all sectors of the Jewish community as sports, culture and social institution with a membership of about 19,000.  The Monterrey Community Center is the main organization for this northern city. The North Baja California Community Center served the Tijuana Jewish community.  The Ashkenazai Community served the descendants of those who immigrated from Eastern Europe.  The Bet El Community is a Conservative organization. The Guadalajara Community Center is for those who live in that city.  The Maguen David Community was formed by descendants of immigrants from Aleppo, Syria. The Alianza Monte Sinaí was formed by descendants from Damascus, Syria and the Sephardic Community was formed by descendants of immigrants from the Balkans.&lt;ref name="mmedina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tribunaeng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bharris"/&gt; There are a number of women’s organizations, which mostly focus on humanitarian issues both inside and outside the Jewish community. Women also run most of the educational institutions.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;

The Jewish Central Committee of Mexico was formed in 1938 as a response to the situation for European Jews at that time. At first, its function was to help Jews escape from the Nazis but later became an umbrella organization for the various Jewish communities in Mexico. It also acts as a representative body for all Jews in Mexico with the Mexican government and other Jewish communities outside of Mexico such as the World Jewish Congress. The Tribuna Israelita is a part of this organization, whose purpose is to work with other agencies to promote understanding of Jewry in Mexico including publications and also works to influence public opinion about anti-Semitism. Another sub organization is the Mexican Council of Jewish Women, which mostly works on projects related to education and health.&lt;ref name="tribunaeng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quienes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuna.org.mx/calendario/quienes_somos.php |title=Quiénes Somos |publisher=Tribuna Israel |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Who we are |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102215440/http://www.tribuna.org.mx/calendario/quienes_somos.php |archivedate=November 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican Jewish immigrant community has been described as closed and separate from the rest of Mexican society.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt; About ninety percent of Mexican Jews attend Jewish schools and marry within the faith.&lt;ref name="tribunaeng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bharris"/&gt; There are Scouting and Zionist organizations for Jewish youth. Most who attend Mexican universities belong to the Mexican Federation of Jewish Students (FEMUJ) .&lt;ref name="tribunaeng"/&gt; However, there have been outreach efforts.  In 2009, Alan Grabinsky and Paul Feldmen established a [[Moishe House]] in the Condesa neighborhood, one of only two in Latin America. The idea is to create a social center for young Jews outside of the western suburbs of Mexico City to make the Jewish community less isolated from the rest of Mexican society. The Mexico International Jewish Film Festival attracts a mostly non-Jewish audience and has expanded from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Monterrey and Cancún. A radio show on Jewish topics called El Aleph has a mostly non Jewish following. Tribuna Israelita organizes programs at private universities to increase public understanding of Israel and Judaism.&lt;ref name="bharris"/&gt; Other Jewish social organizations include the Mexican Association of Friends for academic projects, ORT which works to implement technologies in Mexican high schools, Retorno to combat alcohol and drug abuse and Kadima with works on issued related to the disabled.&lt;ref name="tribunaeng"/&gt;

===Jewish settlements of Mexico City===
[[File:Sinagoga en México DF.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Synagogue in Polanco]] 
In Greater Mexico City, notable communities exist in [[Colonia Hipódromo Condesa]], [[Polanco, Mexico City|Polanco]], [[Lomas de Chapultepec]], [[Santa Fe, Mexico City|Santa Fe]] and [[Huixquilucan de Degollado|Huixquilucan]], [[State of Mexico]] .&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;  Of the sixteen Jewish schools about a dozen of those are in Mexico City which also has over two dozen synagogues.&lt;ref name="bokser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bharris"&gt;{{cite news |title= In Mexico City, insular community begins to reach out |author=Ben Harris |url= http://www.jta.org/news/article/2009/10/05/1008304/in-mexico-city-insular-community-begins-to-reach-out |newspaper=JTA News Service  |location=Jerusalem |date=October 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the Jewish community in Mexico City still centered in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|Historic Downtown]] northeast of the [[Zócalo]] around Jesús María street, "the equivalent of Delancey Street" in New York, according to author Ilan Stavans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ilan Stavans|title=Return to Centro Histórico: A Mexican Jew Looks for His Roots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7jdzOmpbicC&amp;pg=PA108|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 40s many Jewish residents moved to the leafy [[streetcar suburb]]s of [[Colonia Roma|Roma]] and [[Condesa]], where Yiddish was the unofficial language of [[Parque México]], the local park. Today, in the area, there is a Jewish museum, archives, synagogue, and kosher deli at Acapulco Street #70, several more small orthodox synagogues hidden inside houses on [[:es:Avenida Amsterdam|Amsterdam Avenue]], and another synagogue at the corner of Montes de Oca and Parral streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://insidemex.com/people/lifestyle/out-of-sight?page=0%2C1|title=Out of sight: The many faces of Jewish Mexico|author=Vivienne Stanton|date=April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001253/http://insidemex.com/people/lifestyle/out-of-sight?page=0%2C1|archivedate=2013-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, Jews moved further west to Polanco, Lomas de Chapultepec, [[Interlomas]], [[Bosques de las Lomas]], and [[Tecamachalco, State of Mexico|Tecamachalco]], where the majority are now based.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://diariojudio.com/opinion/the-many-faces-of-jewish-mexico/6217/|title=The many faces of Jewish Mexico|date=September 13, 2010|author=Vivienne Stanton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crypto-Jewish resurgence==
{{See also|Neo-Western Sephardim}}
The [[Mexican Inquisition]] succeeded in eliminating all vestiges of open Judaism in Mexico but there are an estimated 20,000 Mexicans with Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt; While the Crypto-Jews were assimilated into the general populace, there are families in Mexico and the southwest United States that practice what appear to be Jewish rituals and customs, knowing or not knowing where these come from.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1slenchek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palate"/&gt; For those claiming Crypto-Jewish heritage one or more of three lines of evidence are usually presented: the existence of Jewish rituals in the family, the existence of Inquisition records with Jewish family names and the oral history of the family. It also generally includes strong secrecy about family history and rituals.&lt;ref name="jjacobs"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jacobs |first= Janet L |date=October 31, 1999 |title= Conversa Heritage, Crypto-Jewish Practice and Women's Rituals |journal=Shofar |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=101 |doi=10.1353/sho.1999.0089}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some descendants, the discovery of Crypto-Jewish heritage leads them to reclaiming all or some of the Sephardic Jewish faith, often by adopting a number of rituals and customs.&lt;ref name="jjacobs"/&gt;

In 1880, Bonifacio Laureano Moyar worked to find and organize the descendants of Conversos or Crypto-Jews with the aim of restoring full Jewish worship among them. These efforts led to the establishment of the Kahal Kadosh Bnej Elohim in Venta Prieta, Hidalgo in 1920.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desde1519"/&gt; There is also a small community of Conversos practicing Judaism in the Vallejo neighborhood of Mexico City, but the main immigrant Jewish organizations do not recognize them.&lt;ref name="presencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt;

Efforts to find Jewish descendants have continued. Texas [[Rabino Samuel S. Lerer|Rabbi Samuel S. Lerer]], influenced by the Venta Prieta experience, began working with those of Jewish heritage starting in 1968, mostly working in [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]]. A number of these converts have migrated to Israel.&lt;ref name="jmillman"/&gt; Starting in the 1990s, a group called Kulanu, a Hebrew word meaning “all of us” began exploring other aspects of Judaism, such as Jewish ancestry in Mexico, especially that of the Conversos. They have sought out descendants of Conversos, without permission of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Rabbinate]], and converted them to Judaism. They have not only worked with those who know of their Jewish ancestry, but also have reached out to families who observe certain Jewish rituals, such as separating meat and dairy, without knowing why.  Although Kulanu is based in the United States, it has worked in Mexico to have these converts recognized by other Jewish communities in Mexico.&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt;

However, there has been resistance to these efforts for various reasons. First is that many of those descended from Jewish ancestry do not want to abandon the Catholic faith. The goal of finding and converting Crypto-Jews is controversial.  Established immigrant Jewish communities are resistant because they do not want problems from the Catholic majority and because Orthodox Jews, the dominant group in Mexico, do not proselytize. They insist only those of a Jewish mother are Jewish. The Jewish committee’s numbers do not include converts of Crypto-Jews as the two groups do not have contact.&lt;ref name="jmillman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2slenchek"/&gt;

In addition to Crypto-Jews in modern Mexico, the history of colonial Mexico extends to the claims of families in the [[Southwest United States]] to be descended from Sephardic Jews escaping the Mexican Inquisition with some making a connection to the Crypto-Jewish settlers of the New Kingdom of León. There claims are controversial with academics both supporting and debunking these claims.&lt;ref name="mcarroll"/&gt;

'''Kwok Pui-lan''' ({{Zh|t=郭佩蘭}}; born 1952) is a [[Hong Kong]]-born [[Feminist theology|feminist theologian]] known for her work on [[Asian feminist theology]] and [[postcolonial theology]].

== Biography ==
Kwok was born in Hong Kong to Chinese parents who practiced [[Chinese folk religion]] at home. She converted to [[Anglicanism|Anglican Christianity]], when she was a teenager.

She started her BA at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], before moving on to do her BD and MTh at [[Southeast Asia Graduate School of Theology]]. She gained her [[ThD]] from [[Harvard Divinity School]],&lt;ref name="EDS"/&gt; finishing her doctoral dissertation on "Chinese Women and Christianity" in 1989, later published through [[Scholars Press]].&lt;ref name="Kwok1992"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w__YAAAAMAAJ|title=Chinese Women and Christianity, 1860-1927|author=Kwok Pui-lan|publisher=Scholars Press|year=1992|isbn=978-1-55540-669-1|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the author of twenty books, including ''Postcolonial Imagination and Feminist Theology (2005)''. She has published in the disciplines of [[feminist theology]], [[postcolonial theology]] and [[biblical hermeneutics]] from her personal perspective of an Asian woman.

From 1992-2017, she was teaching at the [[Episcopal Divinity School]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was appointed the William F. Cole Professor of Christian Theology and Spirituality.&lt;ref name="EDS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.edu/faculty/kwokpuilan|title=Dr. Kwok Pui Lan|last=|first=|date=|website=Episcopal Divinity School|archive-url=https://perma.cc/M29M-LH8Y|archive-date=September 15, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Fall 2017, she has been a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Theology at [[Candler School of Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://candler.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/kwok-pui-lan.html|title=Distinguished Visiting Professor of Theology|last=|first=|date=|website=Candler School of Theology, Emory University|language=en|archive-url=https://perma.cc/4AY7-FKQK|archive-date=September 15, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 she was elected President of the [[American Academy of Religion]], a position she ran for on account of her desire to make more visible the presence of Asian women in theology and academia. She writes, "as leaders, we have to bring the tribe along. Those of us who are pioneers have the responsibility of opening the door a little wider for others to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kwokpuilan.blogspot.com/2011/11/running-for-president-of-american.html|title=Running for the President of the American Academy of Religion|last=Kwok Pui-lan|first=|date=November 28, 2011|website=kwokpuilan.blogspot.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
Kwok's work has used as a locus her position and identity as an Asian woman. Writing in [[feminist theology]], [[postcolonialism|postcolonial criticism]] and [[biblical hermeneutics]], she has maintained as her identity as an Asian woman, incorporating it into her work. She explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;As Asian Christian women, we have our own story, which is both Asian and Christian. We can only tell this story by developing a new hermeneutics: a hermeneutics of double suspicion and reclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwok Pui-lan|first=|date=1987|title=Claiming a Boundary Existence: A Parable from Hong Kong|jstor=25000053|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|volume=3|issue=2|pages=121–124|doi=10.2307/25000053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Her focus and aim is to explore the lives and experiences of marginalised women and as such she is considered part of the movement of Third World theologians.

She has engaged with [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theory in her work, most prominently in ''Postcolonial Imagination and Feminist Theology'', where she argues against the inadequacies of traditional feminist theology. She states that traditional [[feminist theory]] has not sufficiently considered the experiences of non-white women, and the effects of colonialism, neocolonialism and slavery. Her aim is to marry postcolonial theory to feminist theology and she writes for the need to overcome the binary concept of gender, arguing for a more fluid interpretation of gender and the inclusion of queer sexuality. She argues that "the most important contribution of postcolonial feminist theology will be to recapitulate the relation of theology and empire through the multiple lenses of gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and so forth."&lt;ref name="Kwok2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSLjaaWrd4sC|title=Postcolonial Imagination and Feminist Theology|author=Kwok Pui-lan|first=|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-664-22883-5|location=Louisville, KY|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of her work is to create a theology that more accurately reflects the multiple levels of oppression that women in postcolonial contexts face.

Kwok views God as organic, and places it in context of the growing ecological crisis in Asia. She also examines the concept of constructing a [[Christology]] using an organic model, referring to the multiple nature references Jesus uses to describe himself and his relationship with believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwok Pui-lan|first=|date=May 1997|title=Ecology and Christology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/096673509700001508|journal=Feminist Theology|language=en|volume=5|issue=15|pages=113–125|doi=10.1177/096673509700001508|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwok advocates for the incorporation of oral methods within theology, writing "we must allow the possibility of doing theology in poems, songs, stories, dances, rituals, and even lullabies."&lt;ref name="FabellaPark2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwok Pui-lan|chapter=The Emergence of Asian Feminist Consciousness of Culture and Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lWnBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|title=We Dare to Dream: Doing Theology as Asian Women|editor-last1=Fabella|editor-first1=Virginia|editor-last2=Park|editor-first2=Sun Ai Lee|publisher=Orbis Books|year=1989|isbn=978-1-4982-1914-3|location=Maryknoll, NY|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Kwok, the storytelling tradition within many Asian societies offers a rich resource for innovative ways of doing theology as women engage with biblical stories through drama and the sharing of life experiences.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-71043-0003, Wladimir Iljitsch Lenin.jpg|thumb|200px|Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolsheviks]]]]
'''Leninism''' is the [[political theory]] for the organisation of a [[revolution]]ary [[vanguard party]] and the achievement of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] as political prelude to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999) pp. 476–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by and named for the Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories, developed from [[Marxism]] and Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theories, for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the [[Russian Empire]] of the early 20th century. Functionally, the Leninist vanguard party was to provide the working class with the [[political consciousness]] (education and organisation) and revolutionary leadership necessary to depose capitalism in Imperial Russia.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"/&gt; After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Leninism was the dominant version of Marxism in Russia and in establishing [[soviet democracy]] the Bolshevik régime suppressed socialists who opposed the revolution, such as the [[Mensheviks]] and factions of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref name="TheColumbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1,558.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1922) thus included [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] (1918–1924) that were suppressed in the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] (RSFSR) before incorporation to the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) in 1922.

Leninism was composed as and for revolutionary [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] and originally was neither a rigorously proper philosophy nor a discrete political theory. After the Russian Revolution and in ''[[History and Class Consciousness|History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics]]'' (1923), [[György Lukács]] developed and organised Lenin's pragmatic revolutionary practices and ideology into the formal philosophy of vanguard-party revolution (Leninism). As a political-science term, "Leninism" entered common usage in 1922 after infirmity ended Lenin's participation in governing the Russian Communist Party. At the Fifth Congress of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] in July 1924, [[Grigory Zinoviev]] popularized the term "Leninism" to denote "vanguard-party revolution". From 1917 to 1922, Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the [[Bolsheviks]], the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the [[working class]].  In the 1925–1929 period, [[Joseph Stalin]] established Leninism as the official and only legitimate form of Marxism in Russia by amalgamating the political philosophies as [[Marxism–Leninism]], which then became the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state ideology of the Soviet Union]].

== Historical background ==
[[File:Lukács György.jpg|thumb|200px|Hungarian philosopher [[György Lukács]] (c. 1952) codified the theory and practice of Leninism in ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923)]]
In the 19th century, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848), by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], called for the international political unification of the European [[working class]]es in order to achieve a [[communist revolution]] and proposed that because the socio-economic organization of [[communism]] was of a higher form than that of [[capitalism]], a workers' [[revolution]] would first occur in the economically advanced, industrialized countries. Marxist [[social democracy]] was strongest in Germany throughout the 19th century and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] inspired Lenin and other Russian Marxists.&lt;ref name=lih1&gt;{{cite book|last=Lih|first=Lars|title=Lenin Rediscovered: What is to be Done? in Context|year=2005|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-13120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the socio-economic backwardness of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (1721–1917)—uneven and combined economic development—facilitated rapid and intensive industrialization, which produced a united, working-class [[proletariat]] in a predominantly rural, agrarian, peasant society. Moreover, because the industrialization was financed mostly with foreign capital, Imperial Russia did not possess a revolutionary [[bourgeoisie]] with political and economic influence upon the workers and the peasants (as occurred in the [[French Revolution]], 1789). Although Russia's [[political economy]] principally was agrarian and [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]], the task of democratic revolution therefore fell to the urban, industrial working class as the only [[social class]] capable of effecting land reform and democratization, in view that the Russian propertied classes would attempt to suppress any revolution, in town and country.

In April 1917, Lenin published the [[April Theses]], the political strategy of the [[October Revolution]] (7–8 November 1917), which proposed that the Russian revolution was not an isolated national event, but a fundamentally international event—the first world socialist revolution. Thus Lenin's practical application of Marxism and working-class urban revolution to the social, political and economic conditions of the agrarian peasant society that was [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] Russia sparked the "revolutionary nationalism of the poor" to [[Deposition (politics)|depose]] the [[absolute monarchy]] of the three-hundred-year [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] dynasty (1613–1917).&lt;ref&gt;''Faces of Janus'' p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperialism ===
In the course of developing the Russian application of [[Marxism]], the pamphlet ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916) presented Lenin's analysis of an economic development predicted by Karl Marx, namely that capitalism would become a [[global financial system]], wherein advanced industrial countries export [[financial capital]] to their [[Colonialism|colonial]] countries, to finance the exploitation of their natural resources and the labour of the native populations. Such [[Superprofit|superexploitation]] of the poor (undeveloped) countries allows the wealthy (developed) countries to maintain some homeland workers politically content with a slightly higher standard of living and so ensure peaceful labour–capital relations in the capitalist homeland (see [[labour aristocracy]] and [[globalization]]). Hence, a [[proletarian revolution]] of workers and peasants could not occur in the developed capitalist countries while the imperialist global-finance system remained intact; thus an underdeveloped country would feature the first proletarian revolution; and in the early 20th century, [[Imperial Russia]] was the politically weakest country in the capitalist global-finance system.&lt;ref name=tomasic&gt;Tomasic, D. "The Impact of Russian Culture on Soviet Communism" (1953), ''The Western Political Quarterly'', vol. 6, No. 4 December, pp. 808–809.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''United States of Europe Slogan'' (1915), Lenin said: {{quotation|[[Workers of the world, unite!]]—Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible, first in several, or even in one capitalist country taken separately. The victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and organised its own socialist production, would stand up against the rest of the world, the capitalist world.|''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V. I., ''United States of Europe Slogan'', ''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

In ''[[Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920), Lenin said: {{quotation|The more powerful enemy can be vanquished only by exerting the utmost effort, and by the most thorough, careful, attentive, skillful and obligatory use of any, even the smallest, rift between the enemies, any conflict of interests among the bourgeoisie of the various countries and among the various groups or types of bourgeoisie within the various countries, and also by taking advantage of any, even the smallest, opportunity of winning a mass ally, even though this ally is temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional. Those who do not understand this reveal a failure to understand even the smallest grain of Marxism, of modern [[scientific socialism]] in general. Those who have not proved in practice, over a fairly considerable period of time and in fairly varied political situations, their ability to apply this truth in practice have not yet learned to help the revolutionary class in its struggle to emancipate all toiling humanity from the exploiters. And this applies equally to the period before and after the proletariat has won political power.|''Collected Works'', vol. 31, p. 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder|chapter=No Compromises?|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|author-link=Vladimir Lenin|publisher=Progress Publishers|year=1920|place=[[Soviet Union]]|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/index.htm|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch08.htm|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

== Leninist praxis ==
{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=all}}

=== The vanguard party ===
In Chapter II: "Proletarians and Communists" of ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), Marx and Engels presented the idea of the vanguard party as solely qualified to politically lead the proletariat in revolution: {{quotation|The Communists, therefore, are, on the one hand, practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.}}

Hence, the purpose of the Leninist [[vanguard party]] is to establish a democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]; supported by the [[working class]], the vanguard party would lead the revolution to depose the incumbent [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] government; and then transfer power of government to the working class, which change of ruling class—from [[bourgeoisie]] to [[proletariat]]—makes possible the full development of [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Townson, D. ''The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern History: 1789–1945''. London:1994. pp. 462–464.&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' (1902), Lenin proposed that a revolutionary vanguard party, mostly recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign because it was the only way that the [[proletariat]] could successfully achieve a revolution; unlike the economist campaign of trade-union-struggle advocated by other socialist political parties; and later by the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]]. Like Marx, Lenin distinguished between the aspects of a revolution, the "economic campaign" (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions), which featured diffused plural leadership; and the "political campaign" (socialist changes to society), which required the decisive revolutionary leadership of the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik vanguard party]].

; Democratic centralism
As epitomised in the slogan "Freedom in Discussion, Unity in Action", Lenin followed the example of the [[First International]] (IWA, International Workingmen's Association, 1864–1876) and organised the Bolsheviks as a [[Democratic centralism|democratically centralised]] vanguard party, wherein free political-speech was recognised legitimate until policy consensus. Afterwards, every member of the party would be expected to uphold the official policy established in consensus. In the pamphlet ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'' (1905), Lenin said: {{quotation|Of course, the application of this principle in practice will sometimes give rise to disputes and misunderstandings; but only on the basis of this principle can all disputes and all misunderstandings be settled honourably for the Party. [...] The principle of democratic centralism and autonomy for local Party organisations implies universal and full freedom to criticise, so long as this does not disturb the unity of a definite action; it rules out all criticism which disrupts or makes difficult the unity of an action decided on by the Party.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. (1905) ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'', from ''Lenin Collected Works'', Progress Publishers, 1965, Moscow, Volume 10, pages 442-443. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/may/20c.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Full, inner-party democratic debate was Bolshevik Party practice under Lenin, even after the banning of party factions in 1921. Although a guiding influence in policy, Lenin did not exercise absolute power and continually debated and discussed to have his point of view accepted. Under Stalin, the inner-party practice of democratic free debate did not continue after the death of Lenin in 1924.

; Revolution
Before the Revolution, despite supporting political reform (including Bolsheviks elected to the [[Duma]], when opportune), Lenin proposed that [[capitalism]] could ultimately only be overthrown with revolution, not with gradual reforms—from within ([[Fabian Society|Fabianism]]) and from without ([[social democracy]])—which would fail because the ruling [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist social class]], who hold economic power (the [[means of production]]), determine the nature of political power in a bourgeois society.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. (1917) ''[[The State and Revolution]]'', from ''Lenin Collected Works'', Volume 25, pp. 381-492. Available online at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/index.htm "The State and Revolution"]. ''Marxists.org''. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As epitomised in the slogan "For a Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Peasantry", a revolution in the underdeveloped [[Russian Empire]] required an allied proletariat of town and country (urban workers and peasants) because the urban workers would be too few to successfully assume power in the cities on their own. Moreover, owing to the [[Middle class|middle-class]] aspirations of much of the peasantry, [[Leon Trotsky]] proposed that the proletariat should lead the revolution as the only way for it to be truly socialist and democratic. Although Lenin initially disagreed with Trotsky's formulation, he adopted it before the [[Russian Revolution]] in October 1917.

=== Dictatorship of the proletariat ===
{{Soviet Union sidebar|history}}
{{main|Dictatorship of the proletariat}}
In the Russian socialist society, government by [[direct democracy]] was effected by elected [[soviet (council)|soviets]] (workers' councils), which "soviet government" form Lenin described as the manifestation of the Marxist "democratic dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher 1954"&gt;Isaac Deutscher, 1954. The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As political organisations, the soviets would comprise representatives of factory workers' and trade union committees, but would exclude capitalists as a social class in order to ensure the establishment of a proletarian government, by and for the working class and the peasants. About the political disenfranchisement of the Russian capitalist social classes, Lenin said that "depriving the exploiters of the franchise is a purely Russian question, and not a question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in general. [...] In which countries [...] democracy for the exploiters will be, in one or another form, restricted [...] is a question of the specific national features of this or that capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky", from ''Lenin's Collected Works'', Progress Publishers, Moscow, Volume 28, 1974, pages 227–325.

Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter five of ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' (1917), Lenin describes the dictatorship of the proletariat as such: {{quotation|[...] the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of crushing the oppressors. [...] An immense expansion of democracy, which for the first time becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the rich [...] and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, for the exploiters and oppressors of the people—this is the change which democracy undergoes during the 'transition' from capitalism to communism.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Christopher. ''Lenin and the Russian Revolution'' (1971). Penguin Books. London p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

About democracy, Lenin further stated the following in ''The State and Revolution'': {{quotation|Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, of the [[Exploitation of labour|exploiters]] and oppressors of the people—this is the change democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism.|''Collected Works'', vol. 25, pp. 461–462&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marx Engels Lenin on Scientific Socialism|publisher=Novosti Press Ajency Publishing House|place=Moscow|year=1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmeHGAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soviet constitutionalism was the collective government form of the Russian dictatorship of the proletariat, the opposite of the government form of the dictatorship of capital (privately owned means of production) practised in bourgeois democracies. In the soviet political system, the (Leninist) vanguard party would be one of many political parties competing for elected power.&lt;ref name="Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaac Deutscher 1954"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1929"&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution From Lenin to Stalin: 1917-1929.'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the circumstances of the Red vs. White [[Russian Civil War]] and terrorism by the opposing political parties and in aid of the [[White Army|White Armies']] counter-revolution led to the Bolshevik government banning other parties, thus the vanguard party became the sole, legal political party in Russia. Lenin did not regard such political suppression as philosophically inherent to the dictatorship of the proletariat, yet the Stalinists retrospectively claimed that such factional suppression was original to Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. Lenin's Last Struggle. (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution, from Lenin to Stalin: 1917–1929.'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
The Soviet Union nationalised industry and established a foreign-trade monopoly to allow the productive co-ordination of the national economy and so prevent Russian national industries from competing against each other. To feed the populaces of town and country, Lenin instituted [[War Communism]] (1918–1921) as a necessary condition—adequate supplies of food and weapons—for fighting the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1923).&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1929"/&gt; Later in March 1921, he established the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP, 1921–1929), which allowed measures of private commerce, internal free trade and replaced grain requisitions with an agricultural tax under the management of state banks. The purpose of the NEP was to resolve food-shortage riots among the peasantry and allowed measures of private enterprise, wherein the [[profit motive]] encouraged the peasants to harvest the crops required to feed the people of town and country; and to economically re-establish the urban working class, who had lost many men (workers) to the counter-revolutionary Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Historical Terms'' Chris Cook, editor (1983) Peter Bedrick Books:New York p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. ''The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Departments'', Report to the Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education Departments, 17 October 1921, from ''Lenin's Collected Works'', 2nd English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965, Volume 33, pp. 60–79. Available at [http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/oct/17.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With the NEP, the socialist nationalisation of the economy could then be developed to industrialise Russia, strengthen the working class and raise standards of living, thus the NEP would advance socialism against capitalism. Lenin regarded the appearance of new socialist states in the developed countries as necessary to the strengthening Russia's economy and the eventual development of socialism. In that, he was encouraged by the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], the Italian insurrection and general strikes of 1920 and industrial unrest in Britain, France and the United States.

=== National self-determination ===
Lenin recognized and accepted the existence of [[nationalism]] among oppressed peoples, advocated their national rights to [[self-determination]] and opposed the ethnic chauvinism of "[[Eurasianism|Greater Russia]]" because such [[ethnocentrism]] was a [[Cultural hegemony|cultural]] obstacle to establishing the proletarian dictatorship in the territories of the deposed [[Russian Empire]] (1721–1917).&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

[...] The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support. At the same time, we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness. [...] Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

The internationalist philosophies of [[Bolshevism]] and of [[Marxism]] are based upon [[class struggle]] transcending nationalism, [[ethnocentrism]] and [[religion]], which are [[intellectualism|intellectual]] obstacles to class consciousness because the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ruling classes manipulated said cultural ''status quo'' to politically divide the [[Proletariat|proletarian]] working classes. To overcome the political barrier of nationalism, Lenin said it was necessary to acknowledge the existence of nationalism among oppressed peoples and to guarantee their national independence as the right of secession; and that based upon national self-determination, it was natural for socialist states to transcend nationalism and form a federation.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. ''Lenin's Last Struggle'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Question of Nationalities, or "Autonomisation"'' (1923), Lenin said the following: {{quotation|[...] nothing holds up the development and strengthening of proletarian class solidarity so much as national injustice; "offended" nationals are not sensitive to anything, so much as to the feeling of equality, and the violation of this equality, if only through negligence or jest—to the violation of that equality by their proletarian comrades.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I.

=== Socialist culture ===
The role of the Marxist vanguard party was to politically educate the workers and peasants to dispel the societal [[false consciousness]] of religion and nationalism that constitute the cultural ''status quo'' taught by the bourgeoisie to the proletariat to facilitate their economic [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of peasant and worker. Influenced by Lenin, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party]] stated that the development of the socialist workers' culture should not be "hamstrung from above" and opposed the ''[[Proletkult]]'' (1917–1925) organisational control of the national culture.&lt;ref&gt;Central Committee, ''On Proletcult Organisations'', ''Pravda'' No. 270, 1 December 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leninism after 1924 ==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|related}}
In post-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] Russia, [[Stalinism]] ([[socialism in one country]]) and [[Trotskyism]] ([[Permanent revolution|permanent world revolution]]) were the principal philosophies of [[communism]] that claimed legitimate ideological descent from Leninism, thus within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], each ideological faction denied the [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] of the opposing faction.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'' (2000) p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Lenin vs. Stalin
Until shortly before his death, Lenin worked to counter the disproportionate political influence of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Communist Party and in the bureaucracy of the Soviet government, partly because of abuses he had committed against the populace of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and partly because the autocratic Stalin had accumulated administrative power disproportionate to his office of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Moshe. ''Lenin's Last Struggle''. (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1979"&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Russian Revolution From Lenin to Stalin: 1917-1929''. (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-action against Stalin aligned with Lenin's advocacy of the right of [[self-determination]] for the national and ethnic groups of the former Tsarist Empire, which was a key theoretic concept of Leninism.&lt;ref name="Carr, Edward Hallett 1979"/&gt; Lenin warned that Stalin has "unlimited authority concentrated in his hands, and I am not sure whether he will always be capable of using that authority with sufficient caution" and formed a factional bloc with [[Leon Trotsky]] to remove Stalin as the General Secretary of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"&gt;Deutscher, Isaac 1959. ''The Prophet Unarmed: Trotsky 1921-1929'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, V.I. 1923-24 ''"Last Testament" Letters to the Congress'', in ''Lenin Collected Works'', Volume 36 pp. 593–611. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/dec/testamnt/congress.htm Marxists.org]. Retrieved 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

To that end followed proposals reducing the administrative powers of party posts in order to reduce bureaucratic influence upon the policies of the Communist Party. Lenin advised Trotsky to emphasize Stalin's recent bureaucratic alignment in such matters (e.g. undermining the anti-bureaucratic workers' and peasants' Inspection) and argued to depose Stalin as General Secretary. Despite advice to refuse "any rotten compromise", Trotsky did not heed Lenin's advice and General Secretary Stalin retained power over the Communist Party and the bureaucracy of the soviet government.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;

; Trotskyism vs. Stalinism
After Lenin's death (21 January 1924), Trotsky ideologically battled the influence of Stalin, who formed ruling blocs within the Russian Communist Party (with [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], then with [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and then by himself) and so determined soviet government policy from 1924 onwards. The ruling blocs continually denied Stalin's opponents the right to organise as an opposition faction within the party—thus the re-instatement of democratic centralism and free speech within the Communist Party were key arguments of Trotsky's [[Left Opposition]] and the later Joint Opposition.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, Leon 1927. ''Platform of the Joint Opposition''. Available online at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1927/opposition/index.htm Marxists.rog]. Retrieved 28 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leon Trotsky]] was exiled from Russia after losing to [[Joseph Stalin]] in the factional politics of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]]]
In the course of instituting government policy, Stalin promoted the doctrine of [[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]] (adopted 1925), wherein the Soviet Union would establish [[socialism]] upon Russia's economic foundations (and support socialist revolutions elsewhere). Conversely, Trotsky held that socialism in one country would economically constrain the industrial development of the Soviet Union and thus required assistance from the new socialist countries that had arisen in the developed world—which was essential for maintaining Soviet democracy—in 1924 much undermined by [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and [[White Army|counter-revolution]]. Furthermore, Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]] proposed that socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would go further towards dismantling [[Feudalism|feudal]] régimes and establish socialist democracies that would not pass through a capitalist stage of development and government. Hence, revolutionary workers should politically ally with peasant political organisations, but not with capitalist political parties. In contrast, Stalin and allies proposed that alliances with capitalist political parties were essential to realising a revolution where communists were too few. However, said Stalinist practice failed, especially in the [[Northern Expedition]] portion of the Chinese Revolution (1925–1927), wherein it resulted in the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Kuomintang]]'s massacre of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. Despite the failure, Stalin's policy of mixed-ideology political alliances nonetheless became [[Communist International|Comintern]] policy.

; The Oppositionists
[[File:Stalin-Lenin-Kalinin-1919.jpg|thumb|The "[[Old Bolshevik]]s" (Stalin, Lenin and [[Mikhail Kalinin]], pictured in 1919) were members of the Bolshevik Party before the [[Russian Revolution]]]]
Until exiled from Russia in 1929, Trotsky helped develop and led the Left Opposition (and the later Joint Opposition) with members of the Workers' Opposition, the Decembrists and (later) the Zinovievists.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt; Trotskyism ideologically predominated the political platform of the Left Opposition, which demanded the restoration of soviet democracy, the expansion of democratic centralism in the Communist Party, national industrialisation, international permanent revolution and socialist internationalism. The Trotskyist demands countered Stalin's political dominance of the Russian Communist Party, which was officially characterised by the "[[Cult of personality|cult of Lenin]]", the rejection of permanent revolution and the doctrine of socialism in one country. The Stalinist economic policy vacillated between appeasing capitalist [[kulak]] interests in the countryside and destroying them. Initially, the Stalinists also rejected the national industrialisation of Russia, but then pursued it in full, sometimes brutally. In both cases, the Left Opposition denounced the regressive nature of the policy towards the kulak social class of wealthy peasants and the brutality of forced industrialisation. Trotsky described the vacillating Stalinist policy as a symptom of the undemocratic nature of a ruling bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, L.D. (1938) ''The Revolution Betrayed''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and the 1930s, Stalin fought and defeated the political influence of Trotsky and of the Trotskyists in Russia, by means of slander, [[antisemitism]], programmed [[censorship]], expulsions, exile (internal and external) and imprisonment. The anti–Trotsky campaign culminated in the executions (official and unofficial) of the [[Moscow Trials]] (1936–1938), which were part of the [[Great Purge]] of [[Old Bolshevik]]s (who had led the Revolution).&lt;ref name="Deutscher 1959"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogovin, Vadim Z. ''Stalin's Terror of 1937-1938: Political Genocide in the USSR''. (2009) translated to English by Frederick S. Choate, from the Russian-language ''Party of the Executed'' by Vadim Z. Rogovin.&lt;/ref&gt; Once established as ruler of the Soviet Union, General Secretary Stalin re-titled the official socialism in one country doctrine as [[Marxism–Leninism]] to establish ideologic continuity with Leninism whilst opponents continued calling it Stalinism.

== Philosophic successors ==
In political practice, Leninism ([[Vanguard party|vanguard-party]] revolution), despite its origin as communist revolutionary praxis, was adopted throughout the political spectrum.
* In China, the [[Communist Party of China]] is organised as a Leninist vanguard party, based upon [[Maoism]] (Mao Zedong Thought), the Chinese practical application of [[Marxism–Leninism]], that is [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]].&lt;ref&gt;Zheng Yongnian, ''The Chinese Communist Party as Organizational Emperor'' (2009) p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Singapore, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) was organised as a Leninist political party featuring internal democracy. The PAP initiated single-party dominance in the government and popular politics of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wilson, ''Economic growth and development in Singapore'' (2002) p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, the practical application of Maoism to the socio-economic conditions of  [[Third World]] countries produced revolutionary vanguard parties, such as the [[Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Roberts, ''Deepening Democracy?: The Modern Left and Social Movements  in Chile and Peru'' (1988) pp 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In ''The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution'' (1918), Marxist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] criticized the Bolsheviks and their policies for: the suppression of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|All Russian Constituent Assembly]] (January 1918); the [[Partition (politics)|partitioning]] of the [[Feudalism|feudal estates]] to the peasant communes; and the right of self-determination of every national people of the Russias. Luxemburg said that the strategic (geopolitical) mistakes of the Bolsheviks would create great dangers for the Russian Revolution, such as the [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratisation]] that would arise to administrate the oversized country that was Bolshevik Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/nationalities-question-in-the-russian-revolution-luxemburg|title=The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution (Rosa Luxemburg, 1918)|publisher=Libcom.org|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defence of expedient revolutionary practise, Lenin criticised  in ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920) the political and ideological complaints of the anti-Bolshevik critics who claimed ideologically correct stances that were to the political-left of Lenin.

In Marxist philosophy, the term "[[left communism]]" identifies a range of communist political perspectives that are left-wing among communists. Left communism criticizes the ideology that the [[Bolshevik Party]] practiced as a revolutionary vanguard at certain periods of their history. Ideologically, left communists present their perspective and approach as more authentically [[Marxism|Marxist]] and more oriented to the [[proletariat]] than it is the Leninism of the [[Communist International]] at their first (1919) and second (1920) congresses. Proponents of left communism include [[Amadeo Bordiga]], [[Herman Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek]], [[Otto Rühle]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Advance Without Authority': Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism and Intellectuals'' by Chamsy Ojeili, Democracy &amp; Nature, vol. 7, no. 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[Left communism#Dutch–German left communism until 1933|Dutch–German communist left]] has been most critical of Lenin and Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/gorter/1920/open-letter/index.htm "Herman Gorter, Open Letter to Comrade Lenin, 1920"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1938/lenin/ "Anton Pannekoek: Lenin As Philosopher (1938)"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1939/ruhle01.htm "Rühle: Struggle Against Bolshevism (Intro)"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Left communism#Italian left communism 1926–1939|Italian communist left]] instead still identified as Leninists; Bordiga said: "All this work of demolishing opportunism and "deviationism" (Lenin: ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'') is today the basis of party activity. The party follows revolutionary tradition and experiences in this work during these periods of revolutionary reflux and the proliferation of opportunist theories which had as their violent and inflexible opponents Marx, Engels, Lenin and the Italian Left.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1951/fundamental-theses.htm "Fundamental Theses of the Party by Amadeo Bordiga 1951"].&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Mattick continues in the [[Council communism|council communist]] tradition which begun by the Dutch–German left and so is also critical of Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1935/lenin-legend.htm "The Leninn Legend by Paul Mattick"].&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary left-communist organisations, such as the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]] and the [[International Communist Current]], view Lenin as an important and influential theorist, but remain critical of Leninism as political praxis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2017-10-06/the-significance-of-the-russian-revolution-for-today "The Significance of the Russian Revolution for Today"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2015-01-21/lenin-s-legacy "Lenin's Legacy"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.internationalism.org/ir/96/leninists "Have we become "Leninists"? - part 1"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bordigism|Bordigist]] ideology of the [[International Communist Party]] follow Bordiga's strict adherence to Leninism. The recent [[communisation]] current has been influenced by left communism and is critical of Lenin and Leninism, being more ideologically aligned with the Dutch–German left than the Italian left, wherein the theorist of communisation [[Gilles Dauvé]] criticised Leninism as a "by-product of [[Kautskyism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/files/Gilles%20Dauv%C3%A9-%20The%20Renegade%20Kautsky%20and%20his%20Disciple%20Lenin.pdf "Gilles Dauvé - The Renegade Kautsky and his Disciple Lenin"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Soviet Union Versus Socialism'' (1986), [[Noam Chomsky]] argued that [[Stalinism]] was a logical extension of Leninism, and not an ideological deviation from Lenin's policies. It resulted in [[collectivization]] and enforced the law with a [[police state]], functions of the state continually supported with a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/books/the-other-killing-machine.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=The Other Killing Machine|author=Steven Merritt Miner|date=11 May 2003|publisher=''The New York Times''|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1986----.htm|author=Noam Chomsky|title=The Soviet Union Versus Socialism|publisher=Our Generation|date=Spring–Summer 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leyla Şahin v. Turkey''''' was a 2004 [[European Court of Human Rights]] case brought against [[Turkey]] by a medical student challenging a Turkish law which bans wearing the Islamic [[hijab|headscarf]] at universities and other educational and state institutions. The Court upheld the Turkish law by 16 votes to 1.

Şahin (born in Istanbul in 1973) came from a traditional family of practising Muslims and considered it her religious duty to wear the Islamic headscarf. After studying in Vienna, in 1998 she was a fifth-year student at the faculty of medicine of the University of Istanbul. On 23 February of that year the Vice-Chancellor of the University issued a circular directing that students with beards and students wearing the Islamic headscarf would be refused admission to lectures, courses and tutorials. In March Şahin was denied access to a written examination on one of the subjects she was studying because was wearing the Islamic headscarf. Subsequently the university authorities refused, on the same grounds, to allow her to enrol her in a course, or to admit her to various lectures and a written examination. The university also issued her with a warning for contravening the university's rules on dress and suspended her from the university for a term for taking part in an unauthorised assembly that had gathered to protest against them. All the disciplinary penalties imposed on the applicant were revoked under an amnesty law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum to the Turkish Government on Human Rights Watch's Concerns with Regard to Academic Freedom in Higher Education, and Access to Higher Education for Women who Wear the Headscarf |work=Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper |date=29 June 2004 |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/eca/turkey/2004/ |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] Şahin claimed that the measures taken against her by the University of Istanbul violated Articles 9 and 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] — respectively the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the prohibition of discrimination — stating that the prohibition on wearing the headscarf forced students to choose between education and religion and discriminated between believers and non-believers. She also relied on [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Articles 8 (the right to privacy)]] and [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|10 (freedom of expression)]].

Talvikki Hoopes argues that the ECHR's decision to uphold the law shows how freedom of religion has been limited by the ECHR's interpretation of [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoopes, 719.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Leyla Şahin became a member of Parliament in Turkey for the conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] party.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |title=AK Parti Milletvekili Usta: Aleyhimde karar veren AİHM’e yıllar sonra hakim seçtim |work=Habertürk |date=25 January 2017 |url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1367688-ak-parti-milletvekili-usta-aleyhimde-karar-veren-aihme-yillar-sonra-hakim-sectim/ |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Pantalus under a Renaissance Portico, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''St Pantalus under a Renaissance Portico'' (1519–21), a design for a stained glass window by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] later incorporated into the organ shutters at [[Basel Minster|Basel Cathedral]]: the legendary first bishop of Basel is depicted holding a [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branch]] symbolizing his martyrdom&lt;ref&gt;Christian Müller and Stephan Kemperdick, Maryan Ainsworth; et al., ''Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515–1532'' (Munich: Prestel, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The beginning of the '''succession of  bishops of Basel''' is shrouded in legend. The first, St. Pantalus, eludes historical documentation. He is supposed to have been [[Christian martyr|martyred]] at [[Cologne]] with [[Saint Ursula]], who is herself difficult to locate historically.&lt;ref&gt;Scott B. Montgomery, ''St. Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne: Relics, Reliquaries and the Visual Culture of Group Sanctity in Late Medieval Europe'' (Peter Lang, 2010) ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Name list of '''Maya gods and supernatural beings''' playing a role in the Classic (200–1000 CE), Post-Classic (1000–1539 CE) and Contact Period (1511–1697) [[Maya religion]]. The names are mainly taken from the [[Chilam Balam|Books of Chilam Balam]], [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]] ethnography, the [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]], the work of [[Diego de Landa]], and the [[Popol Vuh]].  Depending on the source, most names are either [[Yucatec language|Yucatec]] or [[K'iche' language|K'iche']].  The [[Classic Period]] names (belonging to the [[Classic Maya language]]) are only rarely known with certainty.

"Von der östlichen zur westlichen Windmühle", ''Archiv für Kulturgeschichte'' '''77''' (1), p. 1-30 (8).&lt;/ref&gt; Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grains and draw up water, and used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries.&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;Donald Routledge Hill, "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, pp. 64-9 (cf.

;13th century
*'''[[Fritware]]''': It refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, beginning in the late 1st millennium, for which [[frit]] was a significant ingredient. A recipe for "fritware" dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to "frit-glass" to white clay is 10:1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bernsted | first1 = A.K. | year = 2003 | title = Early Islamic Pottery: Materials and Techniques'', London: Archetype Publications Ltd., 25; R.B.

===Emirate of Granada===
;14th century
*'''[[Hispano-Moresque ware]]''': This was a style of [[Islamic pottery]] created in Arab Spain, after the [[Moors]] had introduced two ceramic techniques to Europe: [[ceramic glaze|glazing]] with an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] white tin-glaze, and painting in metallic lusters. Hispano-Moresque ware was distinguished from the pottery of Christendom by the Islamic character of its decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1973, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
;15th century
*'''[[Coffee]]''': Stories exist of coffee originating in Ethiopia, but the earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in the [[Sufi]] monasteries of the [[Yemen]] in southern Arabia.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{Citation |author2=Bonnie K.

From the [[Muslim world]], coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the [[East Indies]]  and to the Americas.&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyers |first=Hannah |title="Suave Molecules of Mocha" -- Coffee, Chemistry, and Civilization |work= |publisher= |date=2005-03-07 |url=http://www.newpartisan.com/home/suave-molecules-of-mocha-coffee-chemistry-and-civilization.html |accessdate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309110855/http://www.newpartisan.com/home/suave-molecules-of-mocha-coffee-chemistry-and-civilization.html |archivedate=9 March 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44200">In 1844, [[Joseph Smith]], [[President of the Church|president]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], established the [[Council of Fifty]], a [[Latter Day Saint]] [[quorum (Latter Day Saints)|organization]], in order to symbolize and represent a future [[theocracy|theocratic]] or [[theodemocracy|theodemocratic]] "Kingdom of God" on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Quinn|1980|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Smith's death, his successor, [[Brigham Young]], as President of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), hoped to continue the Council of Fifty in order to create this Kingdom in preparation for the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] and the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus. The political Kingdom of God, organized around the Council of Fifty, was meant to be a force of peace and order in the midst of this chaos.

Following the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|death of Smith]], some members of the council continued on as members of the Council of Fifty, under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], while some members left to join or form various other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects in the Latter Day Saint movement]].

==Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==

This table includes individuals who joined the Council of Fifty prior to the June 27, 1844, under the leadership of Joseph Smith, [[President of the Church|president]] of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (as named in 1844).  However, all the included individuals are regarded as early leaders of the church by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (now the Community of Christ) and other [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] sects.

[[File:Codex Borgia page 14.jpg|500px|thumb|Lords of the Night in [[Codex Borgia]] (1a) Tlaloc, (1b) Tepeyollotl, (1c) Tlazolteotl, (2a) Centeotl, (2b) Mictlantecuhtli, (2c) Chalchiuhtlicue, (3a) Piltzintecuhtli, (3b) Tezcatlipoca, (3c) Xiuhtecuhtli. The actual reading order of the panels is [[boustrophedon]] and begins in the bottom right: 3c, 3b, 3a, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1c, 1b, 1a.]]
In [[Mesoamerican mythology]] the '''Lords of the Night''' ({{lang-nci|Yoalteuctin}}{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}) are a set of nine [[deity|gods]] who each ruled over every ninth night forming a calendrical cycle. Each lord was associated with a particular fortune, bad or good, that was an omen for the night that they ruled over.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony F. Aveni. 2001. Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico. University of Texas Press. pp. 156-57&lt;/ref&gt;

The lords of the night are known in both the [[Aztec calendar|Aztec]] and [[Maya calendar]], although the specific names of the Maya Night Lords are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Vail, Christine L. Hernández. 2010. Astronomers, Scribes, and Priests: Intellectual Interchange Between the Northern Maya Lowlands and Highland Mexico in the Late Postclassic Period. Harvard University Press p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mayan script|glyphs]] corresponding to the night gods are known and mayanists identify them with labels G1 to G9, the G series. Generally, these glyphs are frequently used with a fixed glyph coined F. The only Mayan light lord that has been identified is the God G9,[[Pauahtun]] the Aged Quadripartite God.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn V. Foster. 2005.  Handbook to Life in the Ancient Maya World. Oxford University Press. p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pauahtun.org/Calendar/gglyph.html Night Gods discussion in Pauahtun&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a 9 nights cycle in Mesoamerican calendrics was first discovered in 1904 by [[Eduard Seler]]. The Aztec names of the Deities are known because their names are glossed in the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]] and [[Codex Tudela]]. Seler argued that the 9 lords each corresponded to one of the nine levels of the under world and ruled the corresponding hour of the night time, this argument has not generally been accepted, since the evidence suggests that the lord of a given night ruled over that entire night.&lt;ref name="boone"/&gt; [[Zelia Nuttall]] argued that the Nine Lords of the Night represented the nine moons of the [[Lunar year]].&lt;ref&gt;Zelia Nuttall. 1904. The Periodical Adjustments of the Ancient Mexican Calendar. American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 6, No. 4  pp. 486-500&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of the Nine Lords of the Night held special relation to the [[Mesoamerican calendars#Ritual 260-day calenda|Mesoamerican ritual calendar]] of 260-days and nights or -night which includes exactly 29 groups of 9 nights each,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and also, approximately, 9 vague lunations of 29 days each.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The Nine Lords of the Night in Aztec mythology are:&lt;ref name="boone"&gt;Elizabeth Hill Boone. 2007.

==Archaeology==
'''Majdel Anjar I''' is a very large site, {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} northwest of the village where [[Jesuit]] archaeologist, [[Auguste Bergy]] found numerous [[flint]] [[tool]]s that dated to various periods. He identified a [[Heavy Neolithic]] assemblage of the [[Qaraoun culture]] that consisted of [[chisel]]s, [[axe]]s cores and other debris.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=A.M.T.|title=The Neolithic of the Levant|publisher=Oxford University, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis|year=1978|pages=444–446|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/185.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Majdal Anjar II''' or '''Tell Majdal Anjar''' is {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the village near the road. [[Lorraine Copeland]] commented that ''"sackfulls"'' of neolithic flints could be recovered from the area when she visited, including large cutting tools.&lt;ref name="(BeirutLebanon)1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Université Saint-Joseph (Beirut|author2=Lebanon)|title=Mélanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SQOAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=1 May 2011|year=1966|publisher=Impr. catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dDskHAAACAAJ&amp;dq=neolithic+village+sites+copeland&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=e515TarREsSwhAeSlaTjBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA Copeland, Lorraine, "Neolithic Village Sites in the South Beqaa Lebanon", ''Melanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph'' (Beirut Lebanon) Volume 45, (Pages 83-114), 1969.]&lt;/ref&gt; The tell shows considerable deposits with finds consisting of [[pottery]] [[sherd]]s, [[flint]]s and part of a [[stoneware]] bowl.

'''Mary Help of Christians Academy''' was a small, [[Traditionalist Catholic]] K-12 school located in [[Warren, Michigan]]. It was founded by [[Donald Sanborn]] in 1986 with the purchase of a former [[Montessori]] school campus.  From a few families it expanded to around 200 students at its peak of enrollment.

Internal disagreement between parents and school management (then including [[Robert Neville (educator)|Robert Neville]]) in 1999 caused a number of families to leave.  The school's teachers were dismissed from their positions and replaced with nuns from [[Robert McKenna]]'s ''Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.''  Enrollment continued to decline and the school was closed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/abbott/040701 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113203342/http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/abbott/040701 |archivedate=2006-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campus was sold to a local [[Eastern Orthodox]] church.

A '''''meshulach''''' ({{lang-he-n|משולח}}) (plural: ''meshulachim'') or '''SHaDaR''' ({{Hebrew|שד"ר}}, acronym for '''SH'''''elichei '''D'''e'''R'''abonan'' - an emissary of the rabbis; according to others, the acronym is '''SH'''''elichah '''D'''e'''R'''achmanah'' - an emissary from God) is a rabbinical  emissary sent to collect charity funds (''[[Halukka]]''). In the original meaning it was for the rescue of the [[Yishuv haYashan|Yishuv haYashan]] of [[Eretz Yisrael]], the funds were distributed by the ''[[Kollel]]im'' in form of ''Halukka''.

In recent times, the term has come to mean any charity collector for a Jewish organization.  Often an individual meshulach may operate as an independent contractor for several different organizations, taking a portion of the proceeds as profit.  The percentage retained by the meshulach is sometimes as high as 49%.

In response to the public perception of fraudulent meshulachim, some communities (for example, [[Baltimore]]) have appointed rabbis or panels to investigate meshulachim and issue them certificates to attest for the validity of their cause.

Originally only trustworthy ''meshulachim'' were employed. A list of the best-known ''meshulachim'', with their dates and spheres of activity, is provided here:

{{Messianic Judaism|sortby=Theology}}
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
'''Messianic Jewish theology''' is the study of [[God]] and [[Scripture]] from the perspective of [[Messianic Judaism]], a religious movement that fuses elements of Judaism and Christianity and claims to be a legitimate form of Judaism.

== Core doctrines ==
* '''Creation''': Messianic Jews accept a variety of views on creation theology.
* '''God''': Messianics believe in the [[God of the Bible]], and that he is all-powerful, omni-present, eternal, exists outside of creation, and infinitely significant and benevolent. The vast majority of Messianics adhere to [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]] views of God,&lt;ref&gt;"2. We believe that there is one G-d, eternally existent in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit." ([http://www.umjc.net/faith-and-values/statement-of-faith Statement of Faith. Standards for Messianic Jewish congregations and chavurot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604125636/http://www.umjc.net/faith-and-values/statement-of-faith |date=2011-06-04 }}, @ umjc.net)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Messiah''': [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]] (Jesus) is believed to be the promised [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messiah]]. The mainstream movement accepts Yeshua as [[God]] in the flesh, and as the Torah made flesh. 
* '''Written Torah''': Messianics with a few exceptions, consider the written Torah (Pentateuch), the five books of [[Moses]], to remain fully in force and a continuing covenant, to be observed both morally and ritually, by those who profess faith in God. They believe that Yeshua taught and re-affirmed the Torah, rather than doing away with it.  This means that most Messianic Jews do not eat non-[[Kosher]] foods such as: shellfish or pork.  They also will not work on Friday nights or Saturday days (the traditional Jewish Sabbath).  This adherence to the biblical Law is where Messianic Judaism differs from most Christian denominations.
* '''Israel''': It is believed that the [[Children of Israel]] were, remain, and will continue to be the [[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people]] of the God of Jacob and are central to his plans. Virtually all Messianics (whether Jewish nor non-Jewish) oppose [[Replacement theology]].
* '''The Bible''': The Tanakh and New Testament (sometimes called the ''B’rit Chadasha'') are  considered the established inerrant, and divinely inspired Biblical scripture by Messianic Judaism. 
* '''Eschatology''':  Messianics hold all of the following [[Eschatology|eschatological]] beliefs: the [[End of Days (eschatology)|End of Days]], the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus as the conquering Messiah, the re-gathering of Israel, a rebuilt [[Third Temple]], a Resurrection of the Dead (and that Jesus was resurrected after his death). In addition most believe in the millennial sabbath,although some are Amillinialist.
* '''Oral Torah''': Messianic Jewish opinions concerning the "Oral Torah" (the [[Talmud]]) are varied and sometimes conflicting between individual congregations. Some congregations are very selective in their applications of Talmudic law, or do so for the sake of continuity with tradition, while others encourage a serious observance of the Jewish ''[[halakha]]''. Virtually all Messianic congregations and synagogues believe that the oral traditions are subservient to the written Torah.

== Additional doctrines ==
* '''Sin and atonement''': Some Messianics  define sin as transgression of the Torah (Law/Instruction) of God. In agreement with Protestantism, some Messianics, that adhere to the doctrine of the Trinity, believe in the concept of [[original sin]]. Some adherents atone for their sins through prayer and [[repentance]]&amp;mdash;that is, acknowledgment of the wrongdoing and seeking forgiveness for their sins (especially on [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement). Other Messianics disagree with these rites and practices, believing that all sin (whether committed yet or not) is already atoned for through Jesus's death and resurrection. (Hebrews 9:26)
* '''Faith and works''': Some Messianics draw on Jewish rather than Christian tradition. In Hebrew, both "faith" and "faithfulness" are one word "אמונה" ("emunah"). Many adherents believe in a showing of their faith through righteous works (Jacob/"James" 2:17-26), defined by both the [[Tanakh]] and the [[New Testament]]. Some Messianics believe that faith and works are mutually exclusive or polarized; others believe that faith in God and righteous works are entirely complementary to each other (James 2:20), and that the one (faith) naturally leads to the other (works) - much like some Christian thinking. Some say that righteousness with God is solely by grace through faith and then acknowledge that works are still very important.
* '''Salvation''': In agreement with historical [[Protestantism]],  Messianics, that adhere to the doctrine of the Trinity, believe that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone {Lutherianism}. In agreement with Christianity, along with Messianics, to adhere to strict  belief that salvation is by grace through faith {Ephesians 2:8-9}; a person is justified by righteous  acts and with faith alone  {James 2:24}.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Canon==
Messianic believers commonly hold the תנ"ך ([[Tanakh]]; [[Hebrew Bible]]), to be divinely inspired. The הברית החדשה ("''Brit Chadasha''"; [[New Testament]]) is also considered to also be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]].
* תורה ([[Torah]]; "Teaching" or "Instruction") is also called the חומש ([[Chumash (Judaism)|''Chumash'']]; "The five"). "The Law" is called "The Five Books of Moses" or the "[[Pentateuch]]" especially by Christians.
* נביאים ([[Nevi'im]]; "Prophets")
* כתובים ([[Ketuvim]]; "Writings") is sometimes called "Αγιόγραφα" ("Hagiographa"; "Holy Writ")
* [[Gospels]]
  ‣ [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospel of מתתיהו ("Mattityahu"; "Gift of God")/מתי ("Mattay")/"Matthew"]],
  ‣ [[Gospel of Mark|Gospel of Marcus/Μαρκοϲ ("Markos")/"Mark"]],
  ‣ [[Gospel of Luke|Gospel of Lucas/Λουκᾶς ("Loukas")/"Luke"]], and
  ‣ [[Gospel of John|Gospel of יהוחנן ("Yehochanan"; "God has been gracious")/יוחנן ("Yochanan")/"John"]].
* [[Acts of the Apostles]]
* [[Epistles]] of Jude, John, James, Peter, Paul [Romans, 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians, 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 &amp; 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon), and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]].

[[David H. Stern]] has produced a Messianic Jewish version of the Bible called the [[Complete Jewish Bible]].

===Torah===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Melech Ark.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ark in Messianic congregation Melech Yisrael, where the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] are kept.]] --&gt;

"Torah" refers to the first five books of the Bible. Torah reading in Hebrew is one qualifier for a congregation to be considered authentically Messianic.  Individuals are encouraged to engage in private and corporate study of Torah for instruction in doctrine and righteousness.

The Torah contains the [[613 commandments]] of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between God and Israel. Some Messianic congregations and synagoges hold that for Jews, whether they are Messianic or not, Torah observance is covenantally obligatory, for [[Gentiles]] it is not.

===Scriptural commentary===
Many messianic believers also look to Jewish texts and [[Halakha|laws]], such as the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and other rabbinic commentary, for historical insight into an understanding of the biblical texts. However, much like [[Karaite Judaism]], some Messianics do not accept rabbinic commentary and traditional laws as authoritative where it seems to contradict the Scriptures of the Messianic canon.&lt;!-- Karaites reject all rabbinic commentary and traditional laws as authoritative--&gt; This, however, is debated and varies from congregation to congregation, or ministry to ministry, and perhaps even issue-to-issue.

Although there is much debate with regard to acceptance of the Babylonian Talmud, there does exist a small minority who adhere to the teachings of the Sages and oral teachings held in the Talmud and consider them authoritative. The main difference between them and mainstream Judaism remains the belief that Yeshua is the Messiah. These groups consider Yeshua's command, "The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses, all of which they command you to do, do, but do not do as they do." (Matt 23:2-3) to be a proclamation of Torah authority to the Pharisaic Jewish community. One of the great differences between them and most Messianics is their belief of non-separation from the Jewish community and the authority of the Rabbis. Although they hold the [[New Testament]] teachings as authoritative, there remain many details in Biblical Law which violate oral tradition, as well as the written Torah. Because of this, there remains for them another line of division between them and mainstream Judaism.

Many Messianic congregations use traditional Jewish rabbinic commentaries such as the [[Mishnah]] and [[Gemara]] to gain historical insight into biblical teachings and passages and to better comprehend the environment that the first-century New Testament writers would have been familiar with.

Messianic commentaries on various books of the [[Bible]], with the exception of a handful of commentaries written on the [[Torah]] and New Testament texts, such as [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Epistle to the Romans]], [[Epistle to the Galatians]] and [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], can be few and far between.

David H. Stern has released a one-volume ''Jewish New Testament Commentary'', but it overlooks many of the issues of composition, history, date and setting, and only provides select explanatory notes from a Messianic Jewish point of view.

Other noted New Testament commentary authors include [[Joseph Shulam]], who has written commentaries on Acts, Romans, and Galatians, [[Tim Hegg]] of  TorahResource, who has written commentary on Romans, Galatians, Hebrews, and is presently examining Matthew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torahresource.org|title=TorahResource - BIBLICALLY BASED • HONORING YESHUA • UPHOLDING THE TORAH|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Thomas Lancaster, who has written extensively for the First Fruits of Zion Torah Club series, and Stuart Sacks, author of ''Hebrews Through a Hebrews' Eyes.''

===Further scriptural commentary===
"Many Messianic Jewish believers consider rabbinic commentaries such as the Mishnah and the Talmud dangerous," says [[Joshua Isaac Walters]] "When we begin to study and observe Torah to become like Messiah, there are pitfalls we must avoid. One such pitfall is the study of Mishnah and Talmud - Rabbinic traditional Law. There are many people and congregations that place a great emphasis on rabbinic legal works, such as the Mishnah and the Talmud in search of their Hebrew roots. People are looking to the rabbis for answers on how to keep God’s commands, but if one looks into the Mishnah and does what it says, he or she is not a follower of the Messiah. Or, if one looks into the Talmud and does what it says, he or she is not a follower of the Messiah – he or she is a follower of the rabbis because Rabbi Yeshua, the Messiah, is not quoted there. Rabbinic Judaism is not Messianic Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism is not founded in Messiah. Rabbinic Judaism, for the most part, is founded in the yeast – the teachings of the Pharisees. Yeshua’s teachings and the discipleship that He brought His students through was not Rabbinic Judaism. There is a real danger in Rabbinics. There is a real danger in Mishnah and Talmud. No one involved in Rabbinics has ever come out on the other side more righteous than when he or she entered. He or she may look “holier than thou” – but they do not have the life changing experience clearly represented in the lives of the believers of the Messianic communities of the first century."

===Halakhic commentary===
While many in the Messianic movement, especially those who have come out of Protestant churches, have a ''[[sola scriptura]]'' approach to Torah, Tanakh and the ''B'rit Chadashah'', it is incorrect to assume that all Messianics share this rejection of oral Torah. There are those who look to the Talmud and rabbinical interpretations of Israel for guidance in a fuller expression of obedience to Torah. If Messianic Judaism is indeed a Judaism, it stands to reason that it shares community with all Jews in its acceptance of standards and interpretations. Messianics who honor halakhah point out that Deuteronomy 17 instructs not only obedience to Torah, but also to the Judges we go to for Torah interpretation, to "do everything they direct you to do. Act according to the law they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right or to the left." Yeshua backs up the Torah teachers among the Pharisees in this authority in Matthew 23, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. So you must obey them and do everything they tell you." &lt;ref name="JC1"&gt;{{cite web

==People of God==
Messianic Judaism has as a core teaching that Israel remains Israel and the Nations remain the Nations, Jews remain Jews and Gentiles remain Gentiles. Jews are those who are born of a Jewish mother or have undergone halakhic conversion to Judaism. An exception is also made for those born of Jewish fathers if and only if the individual claims Jewish identity, similar to the Reform position.&lt;ref&gt;The statement of the Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council on Jewish identity may be found HERE: [http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/15/29/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem Council, a Messianic halakhic body, maintains that Israel is defined as a people group of members of the covenant God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; chosen by God from the nations, and includes their descendants."&lt;ref name = "JC3"&gt;{{cite web

| quote = The people of Israel are members of the covenant HaShem made with Avraham, Yitzhak, and Ya'akov. Covenant membership is extended to converts to Judaism from the nations, as well as to the descendants of covenant members. Israel is a nation of nations and their descendants, or more specifically a people group called out from other people groups to be a people separated unto HaShem for his purposes. HaShem's promise of covenantal blessings and curses as described in the Torah are unique to Am Yisrael (People of Israel), and to no other nation or people group. The bible describes an Israelite as one descended from Ya'akov ben Yitzhak ben Avraham, or one who has been converted or adopted into that group by either human or spiritual means (Ex 1:1-7, Ex 12:38, Ex 12:48).

The "People of God" is a larger set which includes Israel, but also includes Gentiles in the Christian Churches as well as Messianic Gentiles. Thus, a rabbinical Jew is part of "Israel", a Baptist is part of ''[[Christian Church|Ἐκκλησία]]'' ("Ekklesia") and a Messianic Jew is both "Israel" and ''Ekklesia''. Further, rabbinical Jew, Baptist, and Messianic Jew, both Israel and Ekklesia, are "People of God." Messianic Judaism sees itself as the "link," the point of the graft between Israel and ''Ekklesia''.

The issue of the relationship of Israel to ''Ekklesia'', especially in terms of Covenant, is highly important to Messianics. While Jews are considered within an irrevocable Covenant given at Mt. Sinai, gentiles are not. A Messianic Jew must keep Covenant, but a Methodist need not.  Those Gentiles who have joined Messianic congregations take up Torah observance, some more than others, but do so voluntarily, either out of love for God or simply as part of being in the community. Jews and Gentiles are seen as completely equal before God, as "one new man" in their belief in Yeshua, but this union is not a homogenization but more analogous to the union of husband and wife in marriage, where differentiation is preserved even within unity.

Thus, Messianic Judaism does not require Gentile conversion to Judaism, and in fact discourages it. However, the UMJC makes exceptions for those rare individuals who identify in a stronger way than simply to be "grafted on." The reasoning for this variance is as follows: While Titus may have been the norm in the epistles, a Gentile not converted to Judaism, Paul nevertheless made an exception for Timothy, whom he circumcised and brought under the Covenant. (The statement of the Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council regarding Conversion [http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/18/32/]) These converts to Judaism do not in any way have a higher status within Messianic Judaism than the gentiles attached to the communities.

A statement on circumcision is provided by the Jerusalem Council: "...although circumcision is not a requirement for positional right standing with HaShem, it is a requirement for those who are Abraham's seed, and who desire to "walk blameless."&lt;ref name="JC4"&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=Not addressed by the first Jerusalem Council, is the necessity of believers from the nations to fulfill the scriptural commandment of circumcision from a behavioral righteousness standpoint. The commandment is clear: "This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised." (Gen 17:10). Believers are reckoned as Abraham's seed: "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." (Gal 3:29). So then, although circumcision is not a requirement for positional right standing with HaShem, it is a requirement for those who are Abraham's seed, and who desire to "walk blameless." (Gen 17:1).

===Jewish law===
The more mainstream Messianic congregations adhere to a strongly halakhic definition for God's people. In these groups, Gentiles are colleagues and are strongly encouraged, but not required, to keep the Torah.

==Eschatology==
Issues of creation and [[eschatology]] are not central to Messianic Judaism with the following exception: the idea that one age is ending, as the fullness of the Gentiles has been reached, and the next age beginning, where we shall see the fullness of Israel. The wording is a reference to {{Bibleref2|Romans|11}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Again I ask: Did [the Jews] stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! ... For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? ... I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will be saved."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "fullness of the Gentiles" might be said to refer to the [[Great Commission]], which is complete. The rebirth of the nation of Israel, the re-establishment of Jerusalem as its capital, the return of Jews from Russia, "the nation to the north," and the return of Jews worldwide to greater observance are all seen as signs of the beginning of the age of Israel. Messianics believe that when the fullness of Israel is reached, the Messiah will return and the world will see the resurrection of the dead prior to a final judgement.&lt;ref&gt;(Rabbenu -- A New Paradigm For Messianic Jewish Outreach: Catching Up With the Future [http://rabbenu.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_archive.html] May 28, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of issues==
Traditional Christianity affirms that the Torah is the word of God, though most Christians deny that all of the laws of the [[Pentateuch]] directly apply to themselves as Christians. The New Testament suggests that Yeshua established a [[New Covenant (theology)|new covenant]] relationship between God and his people ({{Bibleref2|Hebrews|8}}; {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|31:31-34}}) and this new covenant speaks of the Torah being written upon the heart. Various passages such as {{Bibleref2|Matthew|5:17-19}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:19-20}}, {{Bibleref2|1John|3:4}} and {{Bibleref2|Romans|3:3}}, as well as various examples of Torah observance in the New Testament, are cited by Messianics in suggesting that the Torah was not and could not have been abolished.

Many Messianics believe that it is absurd to assume that any of the [[613 Mitzvot]] would be abolished simply because certain commandments are or are not repeated or reaffirmed individually in the New Testament, proclaiming the belief that such was never the job of the Apostles in the first place, and that the Torah has always been immutable. Messianics sometimes challenge Christians by arguing that if they believe Jesus is the Messiah, then according to the Torah itself Yeshua could not have changed the Torah (Deuteronomy 13).

As with [[Orthodox Judaism]], capital punishment and animal sacrifice are not practiced because there are strict Biblical conditions on how these are to be practiced, requiring a functioning Temple in [[Jerusalem]] with its [[Levite]] priesthood.  When the power of capital punishment is available, often its exercise is only after exhausting loopholes in Torah which are used to set a suspect free. According to the Talmud, capital punishment in Jewish law always had to lean on merciful alternatives to execution and make every effort not to give the strictest punishment within the confines of the Torah: "A Sanhedrin which kills once in seven years is considered murderous. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon said: if we had been in the Sanhedrin, no one would have ever been killed."&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Makot 1:10&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Messianics believe that observance of the [[Torah]] brings about sanctification, not salvation, which was to be produced only by the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster and Berkowitz (see below)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mikagura-uta''' (みかぐらうた, ''The Songs for the Service'') is one of the three [[Tenrikyo]] scriptures, along with the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' and the ''[[Osashizu]]''. It was composed by the foundress of Tenrikyo, [[Miki Nakayama]], from 1866 to 1875, and revised to its current version in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Department, trans. 2010. ''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms'', p. 209. Note: This work presents an abridged translation of the ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten'', compiled by the Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion and published in 1997 by Tenrikyo Doyusha Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mikagura-uta is the text of the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]] (''otsutome''), a religious [[ritual]] that has a central place in Tenrikyo.&lt;ref&gt;The importance of the Service to Tenrikyo followers can be appreciated if one understands that the main theme of the [[Ofudesaki]], the most important of the three Tenrikyo scriptures, has been described as "a development toward the perfection of ''Tsutome'', the Service, through which, alone, human salvation can be realized." See Inoue and Enyon, ''A Study of the Ofudesaki'', xix.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Service, the text to the ''Mikagura-uta'' is sung together with dance movements and musical accompaniment.

==Etymology and meaning==
"Mikagura-uta" can be subdivided into three sections. ''Mi'' is an [[Honorific speech in Japanese#Honorific prefixes|honorific prefix]]. The word ''kagura'' is a generic term for any performance for a deity or deities in Japan. Although ''kagura'' are usually associated with [[Shinto]] shrines, there is also historical evidence of their association with [[Shugendō]]&lt;ref&gt;Averbuch, Irit. 2003. "Dancing the doctrine: ''honji suijaku'' thought in ''kagura''." In ''Buddhas and kami in Japan: honji suijaku as a combinatory paradigm'', pp. 313–332.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhist]] schools such as [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]].&lt;ref&gt;Ambros, Barbara. 2008. ''Emplacing a pilgrimage: the Ōyama cult and regional religion in early modern Japan'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
The word ''uta'' simply means "song" or "songs."

It is unknown when “Mikagura-uta” became the standardized title.&lt;ref name="MNST"&gt;天理教道友社編 Tenrikyo Doyusha, ed. 『みかぐらうたの世界をたずねて』 ''Mikagura-uta no sekai o tazunete'' (''MNST''), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; During the years from 1867 and 1887, a variety of titles were used, with the most common being “''Juni-kudari o-tsutome (no) uta''” (the Twelve Songs of the Service).&lt;ref&gt;''MNST'', pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence of the current title dates to October 1888, when the songs was first formally published by Tenrikyo as “御かぐら歌.”&lt;ref&gt;中山正善 Nakayama Shozen. 『続　ひとことはなし　その二』 ''Zoku Hitokotohanashi sono ni'' (''ZHSN''), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the ''[[kanji]]'' character 御 could potentially be read either as "''O''" and "''On''" in addition to "''Mi'',"&lt;ref name="MNST"/&gt; it still cannot be said with absolute certainty when “Mikagura-uta” became the standard title (in the past it was referred to sometimes as "''Okagura-uta''").

The original manuscript of the ''Mikagura-uta'' is lost; it was either confiscated by the authorities or it was connected to persecution and interference.&lt;ref&gt;Matsumura, Kazuo. "The Koki Story and the Femininity of the Foundress of Tenrikyo." from ''Mythical Thinkings: What Can We Learn from Comparative Mythology?'' Countershock Press, Frankston, Australia. 2014. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time the title of the Mikagura-uta took its current written form (only in ''[[hiragana]]'') was in 1928, when the scripture was distributed to all churches to commemorate Shozen Nakayama’s marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''MNST'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] published an [[English language|English]] translation of the ''Mikagura-uta'' in 1967.{{sfn|Mori|1995|p=80}}

==Content and style==
The Mikagura-uta is a scripture that is meant to be sung, danced with hand and feet movements, and accompanied by nine musical instruments. The scripture is sung in the style of a Japanese popular traditional song. The fifth section of the Mikagura-uta, the Twelve Songs, takes the form of a counting song, each song starting from one to ten. Nakayama Miki has been said to describe the nature of the counting song as "like children playing shuttlecock during the New Year's season, singing 'One, Two.'"&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. ''[[Anecdotes of Oyasama]].'' Tenri, 1976. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The scripture was originally written in Japanese cursive syllabary (''kana'').&lt;ref&gt;''Prayer as Interaction,'' p.269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
===Songs for the Kagura Service===
[[File:Mikagura-uta Japanese cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of the Mikagura-uta, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].]]
According to Tenrikyo followers, the Kagura Service (''kagura-zutome'' かぐらづとめ) "reenacts God's creation of humankind" around the spot humankind was conceived (called the ''Jiba''), located at [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] in [[Tenri, Nara]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Kagura Service can only be performed in one place. However, the songs are also sung during the Seated Service, which substitutes for the Kagura Service at all other church ceremonies, and which also can be performed individually or in a group.

====Section One====
In the autumn of 1866, Nakayama taught section one, which was originally worded, 
:あしきはらいたすけたまい / てんりわうのみこと ''Ashiki harai, tasuke tamae, / Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.''
::Sweep away evils and save us, / [[Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]].
In 1882, Nakayama altered the wording to the text used today: 
:あしきをはらうてたすけたまえ / てんりわうのみこと ''Ashiki o harote tasuke tamae, / Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.''
::Sweeping away evils, please save us, / Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.

====Section Two====
Four years later, in 1870, Nakayama taught section two, which begins with the line,
:ちよとはなしかみのいふこときいてくれ ''Choto hanashi Kami no yu koto kiite kure...''
::Just a word: Listen to what God says...

====Section Three====
Then in 1875, Nakayama taught section three, which was originally worded,
:あしきはらいたすけたまい / いちれつすますかんろふだい ''Ashiki harai, tasuke tamae, Ichiretsu sumasu Kanrodai.''
In 1882, she altered the wording to the text used today: 
:あしきをはらうてたすけせきこむ / いちれつすましてかんろだい ''Ashiki o harote, tasuke sekikomu / Ichiretsu sumashite Kanrodai.
::Sweeping away evils, hasten to save us. / All humankind equally purified, / The Kanrodai.

===Songs for the Dance with Hand Movements===
====Section Four====
In 1870, Nakayama taught section four, the "Eight Verses of the Yorozuyo" (よろづよ八首), in 1870. This was the last section to be composed.

====Section Five====
This section, known as the "Twelve Songs," was composed between January and August 1867. From 1867 to 1870, Nakayama taught her adherents the melodies and movements to accompany her texts.&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms'', p. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenrikyo scholar Ueda Yoshinaru (上田嘉成) has suggested themes for each song:

==History==
One of the first recorded instances of performing the Mikagura-uta in public can be found in ''Shinmei Ashizu no Michi'' ("The History of Shinmei Ashizu Fellowship"):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some 30 to 50 followers gathered to do the Service of the Twelve Songs, the ''Teodori,'' every night at the fellowship in Honden (Osaka). They danced enthusiastically by beating the ''[[taiko]],'' whose drumhead was worn out within three months. It was so lively that they sometimes had neighbors complaining. So they practiced the ''Teodori'' in vacant lots or on the Kunitsu Bridge near the fellowship. They made strenuous efforts in holding lessons until dawn...When members went to the house of a sick person to pray, they gathered with the musical instruments for the service. Before performing the service, they purified themselves with water ablutions. And they danced the Mikagura-uta softly beside the sick so as not to stir the slightest vibration on the ''tatami'' mat. They danced three times in the morning, three times in the afternoon, and three times in the evening. In this way the pouring of water and dancing were repeated."&lt;ref&gt;Horiuchi, Midori. "Prayer and Scripture: On the Mikagura-uta in Tenrikyo." From ''Prayer as Interaction.'' Tenri University Press. Tenri, 2007. p.265-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another account by Masui Rin, who attended to Nakayama Miki towards the end of her life, goes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We made a 'three-day and three-night prayer' to God to save a person. There were six followers for the ''Otefuri,'' two singers (''jikata''), eight or nine people in total visited the sick person and danced the Mikagura-uta. Saving a person through the Mikagura-uta was very popular and common." &lt;ref&gt;''Prayer as Interaction.'' p.266-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''O''-Acetylpsilocin''' (also known as '''psilacetin''', '''4-acetoxy-DMT''', or '''4-AcO-DMT''') is a synthetically produced [[psychoactive drug]] and has been suggested by [[David E. Nichols|David Nichols]] to be a potentially useful alternative to [[psilocybin]] for pharmacological studies, as they are both believed to be [[prodrug]]s of [[psilocin]].&lt;ref name="Nichols 1999 935–938"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nichols|first=David|author2=Fescas, Stewart|title=Improvements to the Synthesis of Psilocybin and a Facile Method for  Preparing the O-Acetyl Prodrug of Psilocin|journal=Synthesis|volume=1999|year=1999|issue=6|pages=935–938|url=http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/nichols/nichols-psilocin.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2012|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart · New York|format=PDF|issn=0039-7881|doi=10.1055/s-1999-3490|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217042615/http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/nichols/nichols-psilocin.pdf|archivedate=17 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some users report that ''O''-acetylpsilocin's subjective effects differ from that of psilocybin and psilocin.&lt;ref name="erowid1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_4AcODMT.shtml|title=4-AcO-DMT (also 4-acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) : Erowid Exp: Main Index|author=|date=|website=www.erowid.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728183810/http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_4AcODMT.shtml|archivedate=2010-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the [[acetyl]]ated form of the [[psilocybin mushroom]] [[alkaloid]] [[psilocin]] and is a lower [[homologous series|homolog]] of [[4-Acetoxy-MET|4-AcO-MET]], [[4-Acetoxy-DET|4-AcO-DET]], [[4-AcO-MiPT]] and [[4-Acetoxy-DIPT|4-AcO-DiPT]].

== History ==

''O''-Acetylpsilocin (psilacetin) and several other esters of psilocin were patented on January 16, 1963 by [[Sandoz]] Ltd. via [[Albert Hofmann]] &amp; Franz Troxler.&lt;ref name="Esters of Indoles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = US | number = 3075992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, psilacetin remains a psychedelic with a limited history of use. It is theorized to be a [[prodrug]] for psilocin, as is psilocybin, which is naturally occurring in various mushrooms. This is because the aromatic acetyl moiety on the 4th position is subject to deacetylation by acidic conditions such as those found in the stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, J.; Cerna, Jitka (1963). Acidic deacetylation of sugar acetates. ''Tetrahedron'', 35-7,{{ISSN|0040-4039}}. Retrieved 16 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Psilacetin is ''O''-acetylated psilocin, whereas psilocybin is ''O''-phosphorylated.

== Chemistry ==

''O''-Acetylpsilocin can be obtained by [[acetylation]] of psilocin under [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] or strongly [[acid]]ic conditions.  It is a [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] compound. However, it is believed to be a [[prodrug]] of psilocin, which is [[Organic compound#Natural compounds|natural]] and occurs in many [[psilocybin mushroom|mushrooms]] along with psilocybin. ''O''-Acetylpsilocin is more resistant than psilocin to oxidation under basic conditions due to its acetoxy group. While ''O''-acetylpsilocin is not well researched (considered by many to be a [[Designer drug|research chemical]], as opposed to psilocin and psilocybin), it is not as difficult to produce as psilocybin, and may be an appropriate substitute for psilocybin in psychedelic research because of their similar mechanism of action.&lt;ref name="Nichols 1999 935–938"/&gt;

== Pharmacology ==

: ''See [[psilocin]] for more details.''

In the body ''O''-acetylpsilocin is [[Deacetylation|deacetylated]] to psilocin by [[Histone deacetylase|deacetylases]]/[[acetyltransferase]]s during [[first pass effect|first pass metabolism]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and during subsequent passes through the liver (evident as psilacetin is also active via parenteral routes of ingestion).

Claims of subjective differences in effect between the acetylated and not acetylated forms of psilocin differ:&lt;ref name="erowid1"/&gt; some users report that ''O''-acetylpsilocin lasts slightly longer while others report that it lasts for a considerably shorter time.  Many users report less [[body load]] and nausea compared to psilocin.  Some users find that the visual distortions produced by ''O''-acetylpsilocin more closely resemble those produced by [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] than those produced by psilocin. These differences could be possible if psilacetin is active itself and not merely as a prodrug. Despite this, there have been no controlled clinical studies to distinguish the effects between psilacetin, psilocin, and psilocybin.

== Legality ==
{{refimprove|date=March 2011}}

===Australia===

''O''-Acetylpsilocin can be considered an analog of [[psilocin]] making it a schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).&lt;ref name="Poisons Standard"&gt;Poisons Standard October 2015 {{cite web |url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119074606/https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534/ |archivedate=2016-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.&lt;ref name="Poisons Standard" /&gt;

===United States===
''O''-Acetylpsilocin is ambiguously legal for use as a lab reagent or research chemical; however, it is an acetate ester of psilocin, meaning it would be considered Schedule I under the [[Federal Analogue Act]] if sold for human consumption.

===United Kingdom===

''O''-Acetylpsilocin is illegal in the UK under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].

===Italy===

''O''-Acetylpsilocin is illegal in Italy as it is an [[ester]] of a prohibited substance.

===Sweden===
[[Riksdag|The Riksdag]] added 4-AcO-DMT to [[:sv:Narkotikastrafflagen|Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act]] under ''swedish schedule I'' (''"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use"'' ) as of January 25, 2017, published by [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Medical Products Agency (MPA)]] in regulation ''HSLF-FS 2017:1'' listed as '''4-acetoxi-N,N-dimetyltryptamin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/HSLF-FS_2017_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031012708/https://lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/HSLF-FS_2017_1.pdf |archivedate=2017-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Passover Seder plate''' ({{lang-he|קערה}}, ''ke'ara'') is a special [[Plate (dishware)|plate]] containing symbolic foods eaten or displayed at the [[Passover Seder]].

==Significance==
Each of the six items arranged on the plate has special significance to the retelling of the story of [[Passover]] — [[the exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] — which is the focus of this ritual meal. A seventh symbolic item used during the meal — the three [[matzah|matzos]] — is not considered part of the seder plate proper.

==Symbolic foods==
The six traditional items on the Seder Plate are as follows:

*''[[Maror]]'' and ''[[Chazeret]]'' — Bitter herbs symbolizing the bitterness and harshness of the slavery the Hebrews endured in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. In Ashkenazi tradition, fresh romaine lettuce or endives (both representing the bitterness of the Roman invasions) or [[horseradish]] may be eaten as [[Maror]] in the fulfillment of the [[mitzvah]] of eating bitter herbs during the Seder. [[Chazeret]] is additional bitter herbs, usually romaine lettuce, used in the [[korech]] sandwich.
*''[[Charoset]]'' — A sweet, brown mixture representing the mortar and brick used by the Hebrew slaves to build the storehouses or pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. In [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jew]]ish homes, Charoset is traditionally made from chopped nuts, grated apples, [[cinnamon]], and sweet red wine
[[File:Seder Plate.jpg|300px|right|thumb]]
*''[[Karpas]]'' — A vegetable other than bitter herbs representing hope and renewal, which is dipped into salt water at the beginning of the Seder. Parsley or another green vegetable.&lt;ref&gt;A Passover Haggadah: As Commented Upon by Elie Wiesel and Illustrated by Mark Podwal (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993, {{ISBN|0671799967}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some substitute parsley to slice of green onion (representing the bitterness of slavery in Egypt) or potato (representing the bitterness of the ghetto in Germany and in other European countries), both commonly used. The dipping of a simple vegetable into salt water, and the resulting dripping of water off of said vegetables visually represents tears and is a symbolic reminder of the pain felt by the Hebrew slaves in Egypt. Usually in a [[Shabbat]] or [[Jewish holiday|holiday]] meal, the first thing to be eaten after the [[kiddush]] over wine is bread. At the Seder table, however, the first thing to be eaten after the kiddush is a vegetable. This leads immediately to the recital of the famous question, ''Ma Nishtana'' — "Why is this night different from all other nights?" It also symbolizes the spring time, because Jews celebrate Passover in the spring.
*''[[Zeroa]]h'' — Also transliterated ''Z'roa'', it is special as it is the only element of meat on the Seder Plate. Roasted chicken neck or shankbone; symbolizing the Paschal Lamb (Passover sacrifice), which was a lamb that was offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], then roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night. Since the destruction of the Temple, the ''z'roa'' serves as a visual reminder of the Pesach sacrifice; it is not eaten or handled during the Seder. Vegetarians often substitute a [[beet]], quoting ''Pesachim 114b'' as justification; other vegetarians substitute a [[sweet potato]], allowing a "Paschal yam" to represent the Paschal lamb.
*''[[Beitza]]h'' — A roasted hard-boiled egg, symbolizing the ''[[korban chagigah]]'' (festival sacrifice) that was offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and roasted and eaten as part of the meal on Seder night. Although both the Pesach sacrifice and the ''[[chagigah]]'' were meat offerings, the ''chagigah'' is commemorated by an egg, a symbol of mourning (as eggs are the first thing served to mourners after a funeral), evoking the idea of mourning over the destruction of the Temple and our inability to offer any kind of sacrifices in honor of the Pesach holiday. Since the destruction of the Temple, the ''beitzah'' serves as a visual reminder of the ''chagigah''; it is not used during the formal part of the seder, but some people eat a regular hard-boiled egg dipped in saltwater as the first course of the meal.
[[File:SederPlate.jpg|thumb|right|Sterling silver seder plate]]
Many decorative and artistic Seder plates sold in [[Judaica]] stores have pre-formed spaces for inserting the various symbolic foods.
[[File:Seder Table.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Table set for the seder with a seder plate, salt water, matza, kosher wine and a copy of the [[Haggadah]] for each guest]]

The sixth symbolic item on the Seder table is a plate of three whole [[matzo]]t, which are stacked and separated from each other by cloths or napkins. The middle matzah will be broken and half of it put aside for the ''[[afikoman]]''. The top and other half of the middle matzot will be used for the ''hamotzi'' (blessing over bread), and the bottom matzah will be used for the ''korech'' ([[Hillel the Elder#Hillel Sandwich|Hillel sandwich]]).

A bowl of salt water, which is used for the first "dipping" of the Seder, is not traditionally part of the Seder Plate, but is placed on the table beside it. However, it sometimes is used as one of the six items, omitting chazeret.

==Variants==
*[[Vinegar]] — German Jews traditionally included vinegar on the seder plate, closest to the leader next to the ''karpas''. The ''karpas'' was dipped in the vinegar rather than in salt water during the seder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/en/guide|title=Guide to Minhag Ashkenaz|last=Hamburger|first=Rav Binyomin Shlomo|date=2009|website=Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Pesach has often been used as an occasion for political or social commentary. This was often the case when the departure of Soviet Jews was compared to the departure of the Jews from Egypt.

'''Penn &amp; Teller''' ([[Penn Jillette]] and [[Teller (magician)|Teller]]) are American magicians and entertainers who have performed together since the late 1970s, noted for their ongoing act that combines elements of [[comedy]] with [[magic (illusion)|magic]].

The duo has been featured in numerous stage and television shows such as ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us]]'', and they currently perform in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] at [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino|The Rio]], the longest running headlining act in Las Vegas history&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|title=Penn &amp; Teller Give a Lesson in Misdirection Using a Vanishing Chicken|date=2018-06-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo5BRAKvJoA|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Penn Jillette serves as the act's [[orator]] and [[raconteur]]. Teller generally does not speak while performing, and instead communicates through [[mime]] and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbals]], though his voice can occasionally be heard during their live shows and television appearances. Besides magic, the pair has become associated with the advocacy of [[scientific skepticism]], and [[libertarianism]], particularly through their television show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''.

==Career==
Penn Jillette and Teller were introduced to each other by Weir Chrisemer, and performed their first show together at the [[Minnesota Renaissance Festival]] on August 19, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=104745893533716480|user=pennjillette|title=36 years ago today,Teller and I did our first show together at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival.

[[File:Penn and Teller (1988).jpg|thumb|left|Penn &amp; Teller in 1988, at the 40th Emmy Awards]]
By 1985, Penn &amp; Teller were receiving positive reviews for their [[Off Broadway]] show and [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[PBS]] special, ''Penn &amp; Teller Go Public''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookingentertainment.com/artists/comedy/booking-penn-and-teller.php|title=Penn &amp; Teller Booking Agent – Book Penn &amp; Teller Comedian For Corporate and Private Events Worldwide|publisher=Entertainment Booking Agency|work=Artists &gt; Comedy|accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, they began the first of three  [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/legit/news/penn-teller-broadway-2015-1201456133/|title=Penn and Teller Conjure a Broadway Run This Summer|last=Cox|first=Gordon|date=March 19, 2015|work=Variety|access-date=August 6, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, they appeared as [[three-card Monte]] [[Confidence trick|scam artists]] in the [[music video]] for "[[It's Tricky]]" by [[Run-DMC]]. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, the duo made numerous television appearances on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', as well as ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', and others.

Penn &amp; Teller had national tours throughout the 1990s, gaining critical praise. They have also made television guest appearances on ''[[Babylon 5]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/096.html|title=Penn &amp; Teller on ''Babylon 5''|date=13 July 2004|accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as the comedy team [[Day of the Dead (Babylon 5)|Rebo and Zooty]]), ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', a few episodes of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' from 1998 until 2004, ABC's ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', FOX's ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'', an episode of the game show ''[[Fear Factor]]'' on NBC, NBC's ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', in a two-part episode of the final season of ABC's ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' in 1998, four episodes during season 1 of ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' in 1996, NBC's ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', and Fox's ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episodes "[[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]" and "[[The Great Simpsina]]" and the ''[[Futurama]]'' film ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' in 2009. They appeared in the music video for [[Katy Perry]]'s 2009 single "[[Waking Up in Vegas]]", in which they are thrown out of a hotel room by Perry.

From 2003 to 2010, their [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' took a [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]] look at [[psychic]]s, [[religion]], the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], conspiracy theories, and the paranormal. It has featured critical segments on [[gun control]], [[astrology]], [[Feng Shui]], [[environmental issues]], [[PETA]], [[weight loss]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], and the [[war on drugs]].

The pair have written several books about magic, including ''Penn &amp; Teller's Cruel Tricks For Dear Friends'', ''Penn &amp; Teller's How to Play with Your Food'', and ''Penn &amp; Teller's How to Play in Traffic''. Since 2001, Penn &amp; Teller have performed in Las Vegas at the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2013/jan/28/penn-teller-two-decades-real-vegas-magic/|title=Penn &amp; Teller: Two decades of real Las Vegas magic|last=Katsilometes|first=John|date=January 28, 2013|work=LasVegasSun.com|access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn Jillette hosted a weekday [[Penn Radio|one-hour talk show]] on [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity Broadcasting's]] [[Free FM]] radio network from January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, with cohost [[Michael Goudeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.infinitybroadcasting.com/releases/view_release.php?date=%2F051025 |title=Infinity Broadcasting article on Penn |access-date=2006-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321190915/http://www.infinitybroadcasting.com/releases/view_release.php?date=%2F051025 |archive-date=2006-03-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pennandteller.com/03/news.html |title=Penn &amp; Teller website |access-date=2006-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317153634/http://www.pennandteller.com/03/news.html |archive-date=2006-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also hosted the game show ''[[Identity (game show)|Identity]]'', which debuted on December 18, 2006, on NBC.

Their television series ''[[Penn &amp; Teller Tell a Lie]]'' premiered on the [[Discovery Channel]] on October 5, 2011.

Since 2011, Penn &amp; Teller have hosted ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us]]'', originally on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], moving to [[The CW]] in 2015.

Penn &amp; Teller credit magician and [[Skeptical movement|skeptical activist]] [[James Randi]] for their own careers. During an interview at [[The Amazing Meeting|TAM! 2012]], Penn stated that Randi's book ''[[Flim-Flam!]]'' was an early influence on him, and said that "If not for Randi there would not be Penn &amp; Teller as we are today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="38 Years of Magic and B.S.: A Conversation with Penn &amp; Teller" - TAM 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_upx8URLI|website=Youtube.com|publisher=James Randi Foundation|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1:40}}

==Off-stage relationship==
Jillette has told interviewer [[Larry King]]{{when|date=October 2013}} and [[Seth Meyers]]{{when|date=July 2014}} that a big part of the duo's success and longevity is due to them never having been close friends. They respect each other as business partners and enjoy working together, but have little in common besides magic. As a result of their drastically different lifestyles and interests, they rarely socialize or interact when not working.

However, Jillette has also said, in a video where he and Teller responded to questions from members of [[Reddit]] and also in a video interview for [[Big Think]], that while they share few interests outside magic, Teller is his best friend and his children treat him as a close relative. He stated that while most entertainment partnerships such as [[Martin and Lewis]] and [[Lennon–McCartney]] were based on a deep affection for each other that lends to a certain volatility when things go wrong, their business relationship and friendship is based on a respect for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv_Xkz9zepI|title=IAMA: Penn and Teller &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; reddit's top ten questions |publisher=YouTube|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=2013-10-23|author=Penn &amp; Teller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcabRJRG54|title=Penn Jillette: Penn and Teller Are Not Lovers|publisher=YouTube|date= June 13, 2011|accessdate=2013-10-23|author=[[Penn Jillette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teller has made similar statements. In an NPR interview, Teller said their disagreements often lead to better artistic decisions because they bring out new ideas and expand the range of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2015/08/01/428169268/for-penn-tellers-magical-partnership-the-trick-is-telling-the-truth&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
[[File:PennFraserJillette&amp;RaymondJosephTellerHWOFApr2013.jpg|thumb|right|Penn &amp; Teller at a ceremony to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in April 2013.]]
On April 5, 2013, Penn &amp; Teller were honored with the 2,494th star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their achievement in the category of Live Performance. Their star is a few steps away from the star of [[Harry Houdini]] and down the street from [[The Magic Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magicians Penn &amp; Teller get star on Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://photos.mercurynews.com/2013/04/05/photos-magicians-penn-teller-get-star-on-hollywood-walk-of-fame/|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magicians Penn &amp; Teller Get Star On Walk Of Fame|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/04/05/magicians-penn-teller-set-for-walk-of-fame-star/|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magicians Penn &amp; Teller Honored With Star on Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://bhcourier.com/magicians-penn-teller-honored-star-hollywood-walk-fame/2013/04/05|accessdate=April 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621181229/http://bhcourier.com/magicians-penn-teller-honored-star-hollywood-walk-fame/2013/04/05|archivedate=June 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Penn &amp; Teller received the [[Emperor Has No Clothes Award]], which celebrates "plain speaking" on the shortcomings of religion by public figures. In 2005, they were awarded the [[Richard Dawkins Award]], an award given to people who raised public consciousness of [[atheism]] in the previous year.

==Tricks==
Penn &amp; Teller material varies from light-hearted gags such as [[Graphic violence|graphic]] tricks and clever pranks to tackling issues through [[political satire|political]] [[satire]] and by [[debunker|exposing frauds]]. Many of their effects rely heavily on shock appeal and [[fantasy violence]], although presented in a [[humor]]ous manner. Some of their more daring tricks include Teller hanging upside-down over a cushion of spikes in a [[straitjacket]], Teller submerged in a huge container of water, and Teller being run over by an 18-wheel [[Semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailer]]. Penn &amp; Teller will often present tricks that they initially appear to have botched, in the "trick gone wrong" vein.

Sometimes, the pair will claim to reveal a secret of how a magic trick is done, but those tricks are usually invented by the duo for the sole purpose of exposing them, and therefore designed with more spectacular and weird methods than would have been necessary had it just been a "conventional" magic trick. For example, during their NBC ''Off the Deep End'' special, an escape act was performed where Teller was placed into a wooden box that was then put into shark-infested waters. The live audience believed Teller to be inside, but the television audience was shown that Teller escaped the box through a trapdoor in the bottom before it was placed in the water. He continued to read a magazine and eat a snack while awaiting his cue. Often a trick will be presented as if to explain it to the audience, only for a more elaborate version to be performed. In a segment of ''Bullshit!'', Penn &amp; Teller demonstrate the illusion of sawing a woman in half, only for the saw to fall and "accidentally" cut the woman in half again.

Penn &amp; Teller perform their own adaptation of the famous [[bullet catch]] illusion. Each simultaneously fires a gun at the other through small panes of glass and then "catches" the other's bullet in his mouth. They also have an assortment of [[Card manipulation|card tricks]] in their repertoire, virtually all of them involving the [[Card force|force]] of the Three of Clubs on an unsuspecting audience member as this card is easy for viewers to identify on television cameras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071228042704/http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/faq.html#Show Penn &amp; Teller on force trick]&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo will sometimes perform tricks that discuss the intellectual underpinnings of magic. One of their routines, titled "Magician vs. Juggler", features Teller performing card tricks while Penn juggles and delivers a monologue on the difference between the two: jugglers start as socially aware children who go outside and learn juggling with other children; magicians are misfits who stay in the house and teach themselves magic tricks out of spite.

In one of their most politically charged tricks, they make an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] seem to disappear by wrapping it in a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], and apparently [[flag desecration|setting the flag on fire]], so that "the flag is gone but the Bill of Rights remains". The routine may also feature the "Chinese bill of rights", presented as a transparent piece of acetate. They normally end the trick by restoring the unscathed flag to its starting place on the flagpole; however, on a TV [[In the Room (The West Wing)|guest appearance]] on ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', this final part was omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westwingepguide.com/S6/Episodes/120_ITR.html#quote120 Guide to West Wing on Penn &amp; Teller]&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of the trick were revealed by the duo in an episode of ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us|Fool Us]]''.

One of their more recent tricks&lt;ref name="ITVFoolus"&gt;{{Cite episode |series=[[Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us]] |episodelink= &lt;!-- removed due to copyright claim |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaEC8dgQLIM |accessdate=October 18th, 2012--&gt; |credits= |network=ITV |station= |city= |date=July 16, 2011 |began= |ended= |season=1 |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves a powered [[nail gun]] with a quantity of missing nails from the series of nails in its [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]. Penn begins by firing several apparently real nails into a board in front of him. He then proceeds to fire the nail gun into the palm of his hand several times, while suffering no injuries. His pattern builds as he oscillates between firing blanks into his hand and firing nails into the board, and fires one blank into Teller's crotch. Near the end of the trick, he says that it is a trick and that he and Teller believe that it is morally wrong to do things on stage that are really dangerous—it makes the audience complicit in unnecessary human risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crackle.com/c/Penn_Says/Nail_Gun_Trick/2480512 Penn Says: Nail Gun Trick]&lt;/ref&gt;

A trick introduced in 2010 is a modern version of the bag escape, replacing the traditional sack with a black trash bag apparently filled with [[helium]]. Teller is placed in the bag which is then pumped full of helium and sealed by an audience member. For the escape, the audience is blinded by a bright light for a second and when they are able to see again, Teller has escaped from the bag and Penn is holding it, still full of helium, above his head, before releasing it to float to the ceiling. The duo had hoped to put the trick in their mini-tour in London; however, it was first shown to the public in their Las Vegas show on August 18, 2010. In June 2011, Penn &amp; Teller performed this trick for the first time in the United Kingdom on their [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us|Fool Us]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/MrTeller/status/21560011542 Twitter / MrTeller: Helium went in tonight. It&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The managing editor of ''[[Science-Based Medicine]]'', [[David Gorski]], has criticized Penn &amp; Teller for their implied endorsement of non-scientific advice and pseudoscience ("two skeptical icons lending their names to a daytime swamp of nonsense") via their appearance on ''[[Mehmet Oz#Controversy|The Dr. Oz Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/open-letter-to-penn-teller/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and personal lives==
On ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'', the duo described their social and political views as [[libertarian]]. In addition to disbelief in the [[paranormal]] and [[pseudoscience]], Penn &amp; Teller also take a view of doubtfulness to government authority.&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer|date=May 22, 2009 |url=http://media.libsyn.com/media/pointofinquiry/POI_2009_05_22_Michael_Shermer.mp3 |title=Michael Shermer - Science, Skepticism and Libertarianism |work=[[Point of Inquiry]] |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In various episodes of their show, they have heavily criticized both the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], as well as taken stances against [[circumcision]] and [[gun control]], and in support of ideas such as freedom to eat fast food, private property, and lower taxes. Penn &amp; Teller are both [[H.L. Mencken]] research fellows with the [[Cato Institute]], a [[libertarian]] think-tank and research organization.&lt;ref name="CatoPenn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/people/penn-jillette |title=Cato Institute fellow's page: Penn Jillette |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CatoTeller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/people/-teller |title=Cato Institute fellow's page: Teller |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn &amp; Teller have shown support for the [[Brights movement]]&lt;ref name="T-B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-brights.net/people/enthusiastic/index2.html|title=The Brights' Net – Enthusiastic Brights (Page 2)|publisher=The-Brights.net|accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are now listed on the movement's homepage under the Enthusiastic Brights section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://the-brights.net/people/enthusiastic/index2.html The Brights' Net:  Enthusiastic Brights]&lt;/ref&gt;

They have described themselves as [[teetotalers]]. Their book, ''Penn &amp; Teller's How to Play in Traffic'', explains that they avoid alcohol, drugs, and [[caffeine]], though they do smoke cigarettes in some videos.

The 1995 video game ''[[Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors]]'' featured a mini-game called [[Desert Bus]] in which the player drove a bus route between Tucson and Las Vegas. Once reaching the destination, the player gets one point and, if desired, can then drive the return route. The game was considered by some to be long and boring yet found a cult audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/03/penn_jillette_discusses_unrele.php Penn Jillette Discusses Unreleased Sega CD Game]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has since been used in an annual charity event called "Desert Bus for Hope" run by the Canadian internet comedy troupe [[LoadingReadyRun]]. The fundraiser involves members of LoadingReadyRun (and occasional guests) playing the game and streaming that live online, while interviewing celebrities via Skype and accepting challenges for the audience, with all proceeds being donated to [[Child's Play (charity)|Child's Play]]. On November 14, 2011, an [[iOS]] port of Desert Bus was created and released in the [[iTunes Store]]. The game was developed in conjunction with the Desert Bus For Hope event and all profits from the game are donated to charity.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

{{Violence against Hindus in independent India}}
Hindus have experienced [[religious persecution]] in the form of [[Forced conversion|forceful conversions]], documented [[massacre]]s, demolition and desecrations of [[Hindu temple|temples]], as well as the destruction of universities and schools. In modern times, Hindus in the [[Muslim]]-majority regions of [[Kashmir]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Afghanistan]] and other countries have suffered persecution.

==Medieval persecution by Muslim rulers==
{{See also|List of massacres in India#Pre-colonial India}}

[[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] began during the early 8th century AD. According to a 1900 translation of Persian text ''Chachnamah'' by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg, the [[Umayyad]] governor of [[Damascus]], [[Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef|Hajjaj]] responded to a plea by men and women attacked and imprisoned by a tribe off the coast of [[Debal]] (Karachi), who had gone there to purchase some Indian female slaves and rich goods.&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg: The Chachnamah, An Ancient History of Sind, Giving the Hindu period down to the Arab Conquest. [http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=12701030&amp;ct=18]&lt;/ref&gt; Hajjaj mobilised an expedition of 6,000 cavalry under [[Muhammad bin-Qasim]] in 712 CE. Records from the campaign recorded in the [[Chach Nama]] record temple demolitions, and mass executions of resisting [[Sindh]]i forces and the enslavement of their dependents. The raids attacked the kingdoms ruled by Hindu and Buddhist kings, wealth plundered, tribute (kharaj) settled and hostages taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wink|2002|pp=51, 204–205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Hindu Jats were captured as prisoners of war by the Muslim army and moved to Iraq and elsewhere as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wink|2002|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sun temple martand indogreek.jpg|thumb|right|250px| text|Ruins of the [[Martand Sun Temple]]. The temple was completely destroyed on the orders of Muslim Sultan [[Sikandar Butshikan]] in the early 15th century, with demolition lasting a year.&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu temples were felled to the ground and for one year a large establishment was maintained for the demolition of the grand Martand temple. But when the massive masonry resisted all efforts, it was set on fire and the noble buildings cruelly defaced.''-[[Firishta]], [[Muhammad Qãsim Hindû Shãh]]; [[John Briggs (East India Company officer)|John Briggs]] (translator) (1829–1981 Reprint). Tãrîkh-i-Firishta (History of the Rise of the Mahomedan Power in India). New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keay|2000|p=288}}: "The normally cordial pattern of Hindu–Muslim relations was interrupted in the early fifteenth century. The great Sun temple of Martand was destroyed and heavy penalties imposed on the mainly brahman Hindus".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Parts of India have historically been subject to Islamic rule from the period of [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] to the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]], as well as smaller kingdoms like the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] and [[Tipu Sultan]]'s kingdom of Mysore. After the conquest of Sindh, Qasim chose the [[Hanafi]]
school of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] which that when under Muslim rule, polytheists such as Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains are to be regarded as ''[[dhimmis]]'' (from the Arab term) as well as "[[People of the Book]]" and are required to pay [[jizya]] for religious freedom. This decision proved crucial into the way which Muslim rulers ruled in India for the next 800 years.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas F. Gier, FROM MONGOLS TO MUGHALS: RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN INDIA 9TH-18TH CENTURIES, Presented at the Pacific Northwest Regional Meeting American Academy of Religion, Gonzaga University, May 2006 [http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/ngier/mm.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[K. S. Lal]] in his book ''[[Theory and Practice of Muslim State in India]]'' claims that between the years 1000 AD and 1500 AD, the population of the Indian subcontinent decreased from 200 to 170 million.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{harvnb|Lal|1999|p=343}}: "I have arrived at the conclusion that the population of India in A.D. 1000 was about 200 million and in the year 1500 it was 170 million."&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Growth of Muslim Population in Medieval India]]'' meanwhile he claimed that it fell from 200 million to 120 million by establishment of the [[Mughal empire]] because of killings, deportations, dissemination, wars, and famines.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  He stated that his estimates were tentative and did not claim any finality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lal|1999|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace may at any time be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within. The Hindus had allowed their strength to be wasted in internal division and war; they had adopted religions like Buddhism and Jainism, which unnerved them for the tasks of life; they had failed to organize their forces for the protection of their frontiers and their capitals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Buddhism declined rapidly while Hinduism faced military-led and Sultanates-sponsored religious violence.&lt;ref name=willdurant/&gt; Even those Hindus who converted to Islam were not immune from persecution, which was illustrated by the Muslim Caste System in India as established by Ziauddin al-Barani in the Fatawa-i Jahandari.&lt;ref name="Caste in Muslim Society"&gt;[http://stateless.freehosting.net/Caste%20in%20Indian%20Muslim%20Society.htm Caste in Muslim Society] by Yoginder Sikand&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction of temples and educational institutions, the killings of learned monks and the scattering of students, led to a widespread decline in Hindu education. With the fall of Hindu kings, science research and philosophy faced some setbacks due to a lack of funding, royal support, and an open environment. Despite unfavourable treatment under the Muslim rule, Brahmanical education continued and was also patronised by rulers like Akbar and others. [[Bukka Raya I]], one of the founders of [[Vijaynagar Empire]], had taken steps to rehabilitate Hindu religious and cultural institutions which suffered a serious setback under Muslim rule. Buddhists centres of learning decayed, leading to the rise to prominence of Brahmanical institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Idols in numerous temples were unarmed, temples were desecrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ikram |first=S.

While [[Sanskrit]] language and research on [[Vedanta|Vedantic philosophy]] faced a period of struggle, with Muslim rulers often targeting well-established and well-known educational institutions that were often suffering at the time, the traditional educational institutions in villages continued as before,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistic and educational aspirations under colonial system|first=Narindar Kumar|last=Sharma|publisher=Concept Publishing, Delhi|year=1976|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnBvY0cyazkC|pages=34–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mehta |first=Jaswant Lal |year=1980 |title=Advanced Study in the History of Medieval India |volume=Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUk5k5AN54sC |page=287 |isbn=9788120706170}}&lt;/ref&gt; vernacular regional languages based on Sanskrit thrived.

[[Mahmud of Ghazni]], [[Sultan]] of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid empire]], invaded the Indian subcontinent during the early 11th century. His campaigns across the [[Gangetic plains]] are often cited for their [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] plundering and destruction of temples. Mahmud's court historian Al-Utbi viewed Mahmud's expeditions as a ''[[jihad]]'' to propagate Islam and extirpate idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;

Mahmud may not have personally hated Hindus, but he was after the loot and welcomed the honours and accolades in the Islamic world obtained by desecrating Hindu temples and idols.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avari|2013|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his campaign on [[Mathura]], it is written:

{{quote|Orders were given that all the temples should be burnt with naphthala and fire and levelled with the ground. The city was given up to plunder for twenty days. Among the spoil are said to have been five great idols of pure gold with eyes of rubies and adornments of other precious stones, together with a vast number of smaller silver images, which, when broken up, formed a load for more than a hundred camels.&lt;ref name=Growse&gt;{{cite book |first=F.

When he reached near the town of Sarsuti from the fort of Firozah and Bhatner, the residents who were mostly non-Muslims fled and were chased by a detachment of Timur's troops, with thousands of them being killed as well as looted by the troops. From there he travelled to Fatehabad, whose residents fled and a large number of those remaining in the town were massacred. The [[Ahirs]] resisted him at Ahruni but were defeated, with thousands being killed and many were taken prisoners while the town was burnt to ashes. From there he travelled to [[Tohana]]. [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]] said the inhabitants of that town were robbers. They tried to resist but were defeated and fled. Timur's army pursued and killed 200 Jats, while taking many more as prisoners. He then sent a detachment to chase the fleeing Jats and killed 2,000 of them. Meanwhile, their wives and children were enslaved and their property plundered. From there he proceeded to Kaithal; the residents were massacred and plundered and all the villages along the way were destroyed. On the next day, he reached [[Assandh]] which was deserted. Afterward, he subdued Tughlaqpur's fort and the town of [[Salwan]] before besieging [[Loni, Ghaziabad|Loni]]'s fort and ultimately marching on Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliot| Dowson|1871|p=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Phadke |first=H.

Over 1414 through 1423, according to the Muslim historian [[Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi|Yahya bin Ahmad]], the Islamic commanders "chastised and plundered the infidels" of Ahar, Khur, Kampila, Gwalior, Seori, Chandawar, Etawa, Sirhind, Bail, Katehr and Rahtors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliot|Dowson|1872|pp=47–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence was not one-sided. The Hindus retaliated by forming their own armed groups and attacking forts seized by Muslims. In 1431, [[Jalandhar]] for example, was retaken by Hindus and all Muslims inside the fort were placed in prison. Yahya bin Ahmad, the historian remarked on the arrest of Muslims by Hindus, "the unclean ruthless infidels had no respect for the Musulman religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliot|Dowson|1872|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of violence between Hindus and Muslims, in numerous parts of India, continued throughout the Sayyid dynasty according to Yahya bin Ahmad.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

====Lodhi dynasty (1451-1526)====
Religious violence and persecution continued during the reign of the two significant [[Lodi dynasty|Lodhi dynasty]] rulers, Bahlul Khan Lodhi and Sikandar Lodhi. The Delhi Sultanate, whose reach had shrunk to northern and eastern India, witnessed the burning and killing of Hindus for their religion, in Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haig|1928|pp=228–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1499, a Brahmin of Bengal was arrested because he had attracted a large following among both Muslims and Hindus with the following teaching: "the Mohammedan and Hindu religions were both true, and were but different paths by which God might be approached." Sikandar, with his governor of Bihar Azam Humayun, asked Islamic scholars and sharia experts of their time whether such pluralism and peaceful messages were permissible within the Islamic Sultanate.&lt;ref name=haig24/&gt; The scholars advised that it is not, and that the Brahmin should be given the option to either embrace and convert to Islam, or be killed. Sikandar accepted the counsel and gave the Brahmin an ultimatum. The Hindu refused to change his view and was killed.&lt;ref name=haig24&gt;{{harvnb|Haig|1928|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in Uttar Pradesh, a historian of Lodhi dynasty times, described the state sponsored religious violence as follows,&lt;ref&gt;This form of religious violence is summarized by multiple Muslim historians, for example in Zubdatu-t Tawarikh; {{harvnb|Elliot|Dowson|1875|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|He [Lodi] was so zealous...[as a Musulman] that he utterly destroyed diverse places of [infidel] worship... he entirely ruined the shrines of Mathura, [and] the minefield of heathenism. Their stone images were given to the butchers to use...as meat weights,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Yadgar, ''Wakiat-i Mushtaki'' and other texts say that this use of stone idol parts to weigh food, and particularly meat, served as a daily reminder, while humiliating the religious sentiments of Hindus, who held all killing of animal life to be wrong as they practiced vegetarianism.&lt;/ref&gt; and all the Hindus in Mathura were strictly prohibited from shaving their heads and beards, and from performing ablutions.

====Babur, Humayun, Suri dynasty (1526-1556)====
According to the autobiographical historical record of Emperor [[Babur]], ''Tuzak-i Babari'', Babur's campaign in northwest India targeted Hindu and Sikh civilians as well as non-Sunni sects of Islam. Immense numbers of people were killed, with the Muslim camps being described as building "towers of skulls of the infidels" on hillocks.&lt;ref&gt;Tuzak-i Babari: The Autobiography of Babur, Republished in 2006 as: {{ISBN|978-9693518733}}, Translators: Elliot and Dowson&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baburnama]], similarly records massacre of Hindu villages and towns by Babur's Muslim army, in addition to numerous deaths of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers in the battlefields.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Susannah Beveridge, [https://archive.org/stream/baburnamainengli02babuuoft#page/478/mode/2up Babur-nama] Volume 2, page 478-479; and [https://archive.org/stream/baburnamainengli02babuuoft#page/562/mode/2up Religious war and the massacres of 1526-1527] at pages 562-578&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under Sher Shah Suri====

In 1545, Sher Shah Suri's army attacked the Hindu fort of [[Kalinjar Fort|Kalinjar]] ruled by Kirat Singh. During the attack, Per [[Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi]] Suri was burnt in an explosion and ordered his nobles to take the fort while he was still alive. His forces captured the fort by afternoon and per the account put "everyone in there to the sword".&lt;ref name=eliott421&gt;{{harvnb|Elliot|Dowson|1872|pp=408–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2017}}

====Akbar (1556-1605)====
[[Akbar]] is known for his religious tolerance. However, in early years of his reign, religious violence included the massacre of Hindus of Garha in 1560 AD, under the command of Mughal Viceroy Asaf Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chatterton |first=Eyre |author-link=Eyre Chatterton |year=1916 |title=The Story of Gondwana |url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofgondwana00chat#page/n51 |location=London |publisher=Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons |pages=19–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliot|Dowson|1873|pp=168–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other campaigns targeted Chitor and Rantambhor. Maulana Ahmad, the historian of that era, wrote of the battle at Chitor fort,

{{quote|They (Hindus) committed [[jauhar]] (...). In the night, the (Muslim) assailants forced their way into the fortress in several places, and fell to slaughtering and plundering. At early dawn the Emperor went in mounted on an elephant, attended by his nobles and chiefs on foot. The order was given for a general massacre of the infidels as a punishment. The number exceeded 8,000 (Abu-l Fazl states there were 40,000 peasants with 8,000 Rajputs forming the garrison). Those who escaped the sword, men and women, were made prisoners and their property came into the hands of the Musulmans.|Maulana Ahmad, Tarikh-i Alfi&lt;ref name=eliott173&gt;{{harvnb|Elliot|Dowson|1873|pp=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another historian Nizamuddin Ahmad recorded the violence during the conquest of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Nagarkot]] (modern Himachal Pradesh), as follows,

{{quote|The fortress of Bhun, which is an idol temple of Mahámáí, was taken by valor of the (Muslim) assailants. A party of Rajputs, who had resolved to die, fought till they were all cut down. A number of Brahmins, who for many years had served the temple, never gave one thought to flight, and were killed. Nearly 200 black cows belonging to the Hindus, during the struggle, had crowded together for shelter in the temple. Some savage Turks, while the arrows and bullets were falling like rain, killed these cows one by one. They then took off their boots and filled them with the blood, and cast it upon the roof and walls of the temple.|Nizamuddin Ahmad, Tabakat-i Akbari&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliot|Dowson|1873|pp=356–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Aurangzeb (1658–1707)====
The reign of [[Aurangzeb]] witnessed one of the strongest campaigns of religious violence in the Mughal Empire's history. Aurangzeb re-introduced ''[[jizya]]'' (tax) on non-Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1919|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; led numerous campaigns of attacks against non-Muslims, forcibly converted Hindus to Islam and destroyed Hindu temples.{{sfn|Ayalon|1986|p=271}}{{sfn|Avari|2013|p=115 |ps=: citing a 2000 study, writes "Aurangzeb was perhaps no more culpable than most of the Sultans before him; they desecrated the temples associated with Hindu power, not all temples. It is worth noting that, in contrast to the traditional claim of hundreds of Hindu temples having been destroyed by Aurangzeb, a recent study suggests a modest figure of just fifteen destructions." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to Avari, the historian Abraham Eraly estimates Aurangzeb era destruction to be significantly higher; "in 1670, all temples around [[Ujjain]] were destroyed"; and later, "300 temples were destroyed in and around Chitor, [[Udaipur]] and [[Jaipur]]" among other Hindu temples destroyed elsewhere in campaigns through 1705.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eraly |first=Abraham |author-link=Abraham Eraly |year=2000 |title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals |publisher=Penguin Books |pages=398–399 |isbn=978-0141001432}}&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution during the Islamic period targeted non-Hindus as well. Avari writes, "Aurangzeb's religious policy caused friction between him and the ninth [[Sikhism|Sikh]] guru, Tegh Bahadur. In both [[Punjab]] and Kashmir the [[Sikh]] leader was roused to action by Aurangzeb's excessively zealous Islamic policies. Seized and taken to Delhi, he was called upon by [[Aurangzeb]] to embrace [[Islam]] and, on refusal, was tortured for five days and then beheaded in November 1675. Two of the ten Sikh gurus thus died as martyrs at the hands of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

He banned the construction of new temples, but permitted the repair and maintenance of existing temples. He also made generous donations of ''jagirs'' to several temples to win the sympathies of his Hindu subjects. There are several ''firman''s (orders) in his name, supporting temples and [[gurudwara]]s, including [[Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga|Mahakaleshwar temple]] of [[Ujjain]], Balaji temple of [[Chitrakoot district|Chitrakoot]], [[Umananda Temple]] of [[Guwahati]] and the [[Shatrunjaya]] [[Jain]] temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Puniyani |first=Ram |year=2003 |title=Communal politics: facts versus myths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn7GhTpJ4esC&amp;pg=PA60 |page=60 |isbn=978-0-7619-9667-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurangzeb issued orders in 1669, to all his governors of provinces to "destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels, and that they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practice of idolatrous forms of worship".&lt;ref name=smith437&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1919|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; These orders and his own initiative in implementing them led to the destruction of numerous temples, contributing to the list of temples destroyed during Islamic rule of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Richard M. |last=Eaton |url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1726/17260700.pdf |title=Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States |year=2000 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talbot |first=Cynthia |date=1995 |title=Inscribing the other, inscribing the self: Hindu-Muslim identities in pre-colonial India |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=692–722 |jstor=179206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temples were destroyed entirely; in other cases mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones.

In 1788, Tipu ordered his governor in [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] Sher Khan to begin the process of converting Hindus to Islam, and in July of that year, 200 Brahmins were forcibly converted and made to eat beef.&lt;ref name="Kerala 1992 p. 93"/&gt; Mohibbul Hasan, Prof. Sheikh Ali, and other historians cast great doubt on the scale of the deportations and forced conversions in Coorg in particular, and Hasan says that the British versions of what happened were intended to malign Tipu Sultan, and to be used as propaganda against him.&lt;ref name="hasan"/&gt; He argues that little reliance can be placed in Muslim accounts such as Kirmani's ''Nishan-e Haidari''; in their anxiety to represent the Sultan as a champion of Islam, they had a tendency to exaggerate and distort the facts: Kirmani claims that 70,000 Coorgis were converted, when forty years later the entire population of Coorg was still less than that number.

Sultãn [[Sikandar Butshikan]] of Kashmir (AD 1389–1413) is often considered the worst of these. Historians have recorded many of his atrocities. The ''Tarikh-i-Firishta'' records that Sikandar persecuted the Hindus and issued orders proscribing the residency of any other than Muslims in Kashmir. He also ordered the breaking of all "golden and silver images". The Tarikh-i-Firishta further states: "Many of the Brahmins, rather than abandon their religion or their country, poisoned themselves; some emigrated from their native homes, while a few escaped the evil of banishment by becoming Mahomedans. After the emigration of the Bramins, Sikundur ordered all the temples in Kashmir to be thrown down. Having broken all the images in Kashmeer, (Sikandar) acquired the title of 'Destroyer of Idols'".&lt;ref name="Firishta 1829- 1981 Reprint"/&gt;

Several ancient temples in Kashmir that were considered architectural masterpiece of those times were demolished during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Kak, Ram Chandra. [http://www.koausa.org/Monuments/Chapter5.html Ancient Monuments of Kashmir]. Retrieved 8 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bengal===

Richard Eaton states that the origin of the [[Caste system in India|caste system of modern form]] in the [[Bengal]] region of India may be traceable to the period of 1200-1500. This is after the Turkic conquests. He states that "Looking at Bengal's Hindu society as a whole, it seems likely that the caste system - far from being the ancient and unchanging essence of Indian civilization, as supposed by generations of Orientalists - emerged into something resembling its modern form only during the period 1200-1500". Before the Turkish conquest, the [[Sena dynasty]] kept order by distributing wealth and judging between the socially higher or lower in the context of the court and its rituals. However, with the collapse of the Hindu kingship that followed the Turkic conquest, these functions appear to have been displaced onto the society, with social order being maintained through enforced group endogamy, marriage regulation enforced through caste councils and specialists kept the genealogies.&lt;ref name=Eaton1204&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&amp;pg=PA103|author=Eaton, Richard|year=1993|title=The rise of Islam and the Bengal frontier, 1204-1760 |publisher= University of California Press|pages= 102–103, 224–226 |isbn= 978-0-520-08077-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of Indo-Turkish rule resulted in the end with patronage for the [[Brahmins]] who had enjoyed it under the Sena government and many of them fled into the eastern hinterlands. Until 1415, they served few positions in the government and were disdained. However, this changed with [[Raja Ganesha]]'s revolution and under the reign of his converted son [[Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah]], resulting in many of them gaining employment in the government by the time of [[Alauddin Husain Shah]].&lt;ref name=Eaton1204/&gt;

===Deccan wars===

[[Muhammad Shah I]]'s draft on [[Vijayanagara Empire]]'s treasury in 1365 incensed the king king [[Bukka Raya I]], who insulted the envoy with the draft and besieged the fort of [[Mudgal]] held by no less than 800 Muslim troops. Many men, women and children were killed. The fortress fell and its garrison was massacred before any relief could reach it. [[Ferishta]]'s claim of only one survivor narrating the incident to the Sulatn may be one-sided. Muhammad in response attacked Bukka's army and vowed to not sheathe his sword until he avenged the massacre by killing 100,000 Hindus. At [[Raichur Doab]], Muhammad killed 70,000 Hindus. He pursued Bukka throughout his dominions and the slaughtered no less than 400,000 Hindus around Vijaynagara. Bukka sued for peace and even the Muslim officers were moved to beg on hopes the slaughter might cease. Muhammad replied that though he had killed four times the number of Hindus than his promise, he will not desist until the draft on treasury was honoured. The envoys agreed to this, resulting in an end to the war. The Hindus shocked by the bloodshed called on both parties to avoid killing non-combatants in the future. Muhammad agreed and the agreement, though sometimes violated, was to some extent successful in stopping the atrocities during the long period of intermittent warfare between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Shorter History of India|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781317208716|location=|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haig|1928|pp=380–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Parts 1-2|publisher=[[Indian History Congress]]|year=1966|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bidar Sultanate|Barid Shahi]], surrounded by more powerful states, had invited the intervention of Vijayanagara in the affairs of the [[Deccan sultanates|Muslim kingdoms]]. The arrogance of [[Sadasiva Raya]] had embarrassed and disgusted both his enemies as well as allies, in addition the excesses of his troops had horrified the Muslims. He demanded cessation of extenstive territory from [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] for his assistance to [[Ali Adil Shah I|Ali]] as well as from [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golconda]] as punishment for duplicitous actions of [[Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah Wali|Ibrahim]]. It seemed apparent to them that the end of Muslim rule was at hand if his ambition was not curbed. The Hindu army was defeated at the [[Battle of Talikota]] and fled with their loss estimated at 100,000 men.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{harvnb|Haig|1928|pp=447, 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was hastily abandoned after its defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Dyke |first1=Ruth M. |last2=Alcock |first2=Susan E. |year=2008 |title=Archaeologies of Memory |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XfPgtl6PgwoC&amp;pg=PA29 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=29 |isbn=978-1-4051-4330-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Muslims and Hindus plundered and burnt the [[Vijayanagara]] city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haig|1928|p=682}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victors occupied the city for six months and had it destroyed while plundering the country.&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;

===Portuguese Goa===
{{Main|Goa Inquisition}}
[[File:StFrancisXavier.jpg|thumb|400px|right|[[St. Francis Xavier]] who requested the [[Inquisition]] in 1545]]
During the Portuguese rule of [[Goa]], thousands of Hindus were coerced into accepting Christianity by the passage of laws that made it difficult for them to practice their faith, harassed them under false pretences or petty complaints, and gave favourable status to converts (indiacatos) and [[mestiço]]s in terms of laws and jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Machado|1999|pp=94–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Goa Inquisition]], was established in 1560 by Portuguese missionaries in the [[Portuguese India|Estado Português da Índia]]. The [[Goa Inquisition]] was directed against backsliding converts (that is, former Hindus and Muslims who had converted to Christianity), and it has been recorded that at least 57 Goans were executed over a period of three hundred years, starting in the year 1560.&lt;ref name="Salomon, H.

According to [[Teotónio de Souza]] the Hindus faced severe persecution with great fortitude under the Portuguese in Goa.&lt;ref name="Teotonio De Souza"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Souza|first=Teotonio|title=Discoveries, Missionary Expansion, and Asian Cultures|year=1994|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vtf1eRE8FC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Discoveries,+Missionary+Expansion,+and+Asian+Cultures#v=snippet&amp;q=persecution&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 January 2014|isbn=9788170224976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicar general Miguel Vaz had written to the [[John III of Portugal|king of Portugal]] in 1543 from Goa requesting that the Inquisition be established in Goa as well. Three years later Francis Xavier made a similar request in view of the Muslims in the region and the Christians abandoning their faith. On hearing of the excesses of the Inquisition in Goa, Lourenco Pires, Portuguese ambassador at Rome, expressed his displeasure to the crown while warning that this zeal for religion was actually becoming a disservice to God and the kingdom. Again according to de Souza, the Inquisition was bad for its victims and led to the downfall of the Portuguese Empire in the East.&lt;ref name="Teotonio De Souza"/&gt;

==20th Century persecution==
While the vast majority of Hindus live in Hindu-majority areas of India, Hindus in other parts of South Asia and in the diaspora have sometimes faced persecution.

===Mappila Riots (1836-1921)===
{{Persecution of Hindus in pre-1947 India}}
{{Main|Mappila riots}}
''Mappila Riots'' or ''Mappila Outbreaks'' refers to a series of riots by the [[Mappila]] (Moplah) [[Muslim]]s of [[Malabar District|Malabar]], [[South India]] in the 19th century and the early 20th century (c.1836–1921) against native [[Hindu]]s and the state.

===Partition of India===

Hindus, like Muslims, Sikhs, and members of other religious groups, experienced severe dislocation and violence during the massive [[Population transfer#South Asia|population exchanges]] associated with the [[partition of India]], as members of various communities moved to what they hoped was the relative safety of an area where they would be a religious majority. Hindus were among the between 200,000 and a million who died during the rioting and other violence associated with the partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://necrometrics.com/20c300k.htm |title=Secondary Wars and Atrocities of the Twentieth Century |last=White |first=Matthew |author-link=Matthew White (historian) |website=Twentieth Century Atlas - Death Tolls and Casualty Statistics for Wars, Dictatorships and Genocides |access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct Action Day====
{{Persecution of Bengali Hindus}}
{{Main|Direct Action Day}}
In 1946, the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India|Cabinet Mission to India]] was planning the transfer of power from the [[British Raj]] to the Indian leadership. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the one time Congressman and Indian Nationalist, and now the leader of the Muslim League, had accepted the Cabinet Mission Plan of 16 June whereas the Congress rejected it outright. Fearing Hindu Domination in the Constituent Assembly, Jinnah denounced the British Cabinet Mission and decided to boycott the Constituent Assembly to try to put pressure on Congress and the British, by resorting to "Direct Action".

The Muslim League responded by planning and carrying out a ''[[hartal]]'' ("general strike") on 16 August 1946 (called Direct Action Day).&lt;ref name="Sato Tsugitaka"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsugitaka|first=Sato|title=Muslim Societies: Historical and Comparative Aspects|date=2 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HvqUOb-iUsUC&amp;pg=PT155&amp;dq=Programme+for+the+Day+(Direct+Action+Day)#v=onepage&amp;q=Programme%20for%20the%20Day%20(Direct%20Action%20Day)&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 January 2014|isbn=9781134320219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the request of [[Suhrawardy]], Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal, the Governor of Bengal [[Frederick Burrows]] declared a public holiday that day.&lt;ref name="Sato Tsugitaka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyson"&gt;{{cite book

There has been historical decline of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]] in the areas of what is now called [[Pakistan]]. This happened for a variety of reasons even as these religions have continued to flourish beyond the eastern frontiers of Pakistan. The region became predominantly [[Muslim]] during the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] due to the forced conversions in what is now called Pakistan and the rest of South Asia.

===1971 Bangladesh genocide===
{{Main|1971 Bangladesh genocide|Operation Searchlight}}
During the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]] there were widespread killings and acts of ethnic cleansing of civilians in Bangladesh (then [[East Pakistan]], a province of Pakistan), and widespread violations of human rights were carried out by the Pakistani Army, which was supported by political and religious militias during the Bangladesh Liberation War. In Bangladesh, the atrocities are identified as a genocide. ''Time'' magazine reported that "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military's hatred."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,878408,00.html "Pakistan: The Ravaging of Golden Bengal"]. ''Time''. 2 August 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

United States government cables noted that [[Hindus]] were specific targets of the Pakistani army.&lt;ref name="usconsulate_cable_march31"&gt;U.S. Consulate (Dacca) Cable, Sitrep: [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB6.pdf Army Terror Campaign Continues in Dacca; Evidence Military Faces Some Difficulties Elsewhere], 31 March 1971, Confidential, 3 pp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blood978&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/48049.pdf Telegram 978 From the Consulate General in Dacca to the Department of State, March 29, 1971, 1130Z]&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread killing of Hindu males, and rapes of women. Documented incidents in which Hindus were massacred in large numbers include the [[Chuknagar massacre]], the [[Jathibhanga massacre]], and the [[Shankharipara massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=S. |last=Bose |title=Dead Reckoning: Memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War |publisher=Hurst and Co. |location=London |year=2011 |pages=73, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60% of the Bengali refugees who fled to India were Hindus.&lt;ref name="usstatedept_south_asia_crisis"&gt;U.S. State Department, ''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969–1976'', Volume XI, "South Asia Crisis, 1971", page 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;Kennedy, Senator Edward, "Crisis in South Asia – A report to the Subcommittee investigating the Problem of Refugees and Their Settlement, Submitted to U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee", 1 November 1971, U.S. Govt.

Kennedy wrote, "Field reports to the U.S. Government, countless eye-witness journalistic accounts, reports of International agencies such as World Bank and additional information available to the subcommittee document the reign of terror which grips East Bengal (East Pakistan). Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked 'H'. All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad."&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this widespread violence against Hindus was motivated by a policy to purge East Pakistan of what was seen as Hindu and Indian influences&lt;ref name="sundaytimes6_13_71"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mascarenhas |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Mascarenhas |date=13 June 1971 |title=Genocide |newspaper=The Times |location=London |quote=The Government's policy for East Bengal was spelled out to me in the Eastern Command headquarters at Dacca.

The – Islamization of the masses – this is the official jargon – is intended to eliminate secessionist tendencies and provide a strong religious bond with West Pakistan; 3. When the Hindus have been eliminated by death and flight, their property will be used as a golden carrot to win over the under privileged Muslim middle-class.

According to [[R.J. Rummel]], professor of political science at the University of Hawaii,
{{quote|The genocide and gendercidal atrocities were also perpetrated by lower-ranking officers and ordinary soldiers. These "willing executioners" were fueled by an abiding anti-Bengali racism, especially against the Hindu minority. "Bengalis were often compared with monkeys and chickens. Said General Niazi, 'It was a low lying land of low lying people.' The Hindus among the Bengalis were as Jews to the Nazis: scum and vermin that [should] best be exterminated. As to the Moslem Bengalis, they were to live only on the sufferance of the soldiers: any infraction, any suspicion cast on them, any need for reprisal, could mean their death. And the soldiers were free to kill at will. The journalist Dan Coggin quoted one Pakistani captain as telling him, "We can kill anyone for anything. We are accountable to no one." This is the arrogance of Power.&lt;ref&gt;Death by Government, By R.J. Rummel New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1994 [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] dated 2 August 1971, stated "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,878408,00.html |title=World: Pakistan: The Ravaging of Golden Bengal - Printout |publisher=TIME |date=2 August 1971 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] wrote in a report that was part of [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] testimony dated 1 November 1971, "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked "H". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from [[Islamabad]]". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and [[World Health Organization]] the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country. The [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist [[Sydney Schanberg]] covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict. In a syndicated column "The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored", he wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. "Other reminders were the yellow "H"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army" (by "Muslim army", meaning the [[Pakistan Army]], which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), ([[Newsday]], 29 April 1994).

=== Jammu and Kashmir ===
{{Main|Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus}}
The [[Kashmiri Pandit]] population living in the Muslim majority region of [[Jammu]] and Kashmir has often come under threat from Islamic militants in recent years, in stark contrast to centuries of peace between the two religious communities in the State. Historians have suggested that some of these attacks have been in retaliation for the anti-Muslim violence propagated by the Hindutva movement during the demolition of the Babri Masjid, and the [[2002 Gujarat violence|2002 Gujarat riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan|pages=640–680}}&lt;/ref&gt; This threat has been pronounced during periods of unrest in the Kashmir valley, such as in 1989. Along with the Hindus, large sections of the Muslim population have also been attacked, ostensibly for "cooperating" with the Indian state. Some authors have found evidence that these militants had the support of the Pakistani security establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/2003/chapter9.htm |title=The Kashmiri Pandits: An Ethnic Cleansing the World Forgot |last=Gill |first=Kanwar Pal Singh |author-link=Kanwar Pal Singh Gill |publisher=South Asian Terrorism Portal |accessdate=26 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Under renewed threats, pandits may flee the Valley |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Under-renewed-threats-pandits-may-flee-the-Valley/H1-Article1-477268.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=17 November 2009 |access-date=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012052145/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Under-renewed-threats-pandits-may-flee-the-Valley/H1-Article1-477268.aspx |archive-date=12 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents of violence included the [[Wandhama Massacre]] in 1998, in which 24 Kashmiri Hindus were gunned down by Muslims disguised as Indian soldiers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Many Kashmiri Non-Muslims have been killed and thousands of children orphaned over the course of the conflict in Kashmir.

Bangladeshi feminist [[Taslima Nasrin]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Lajja]]'' deals with the anti-Hindu riots and anti-secular sentiment in Bangladesh in the wake of the destruction of the Babri Masjid in India. The book was banned in Bangladesh, and helped draw international attention to the situation of the Bangladeshi Hindu minority.

In October 2006, the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] published a report titled 'Policy Focus on Bangladesh', which said that since its last election, 'Bangladesh has experienced growing violence by religious extremists, intensifying concerns expressed by the countries religious minorities'. The report further stated that Hindus are particularly vulnerable in a period of rising violence and extremism, whether motivated by religious, political or criminal factors, or some combination. The report noted that Hindus had multiple disadvantages against them in Bangladesh, such as perceptions of [[dual loyalty]] with respect to India and religious beliefs that are not tolerated by the politically dominant [[Islamic Fundamentalists]] of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Violence against Hindus has taken place "in order to encourage them to flee in order to seize their property".&lt;ref name="USCIRF"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/02aziz.htm Bangladesh slammed for persecution of Hindus],''Rediff.com''&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 November 2006, USCIRF criticised Bangladesh for its continuing persecution of minority Hindus.

In Italy, Hinduism was previously not recognised as a religion, and during [[Durga Puja]] celebrations, the Italian police shut down a previously approved Durga Puja celebration in Rome.

However, on 14 December 2012, Hinduism, along with Buddhism, was recognised and given freedom as a religion not conflicting with the Italian Law, as per Article 8 of the Italian constitution.

In 2005 and 2006 Kazakh officials persistently and repeatedly tried to close down the Hare Krishna farming community near Almaty.

On 20 November 2006, three buses full of riot police, two ambulances, two empty lorries, and executors of the Karasai district arrived at the community in sub-zero weather and evicted the Hare Krishna followers from thirteen homes, which the police proceeded to demolish.

The [[Forum 18]] News Service reported, "Riot police who took part in the destruction threw the personal belongings of the Hare Krishna devotees into the snow, and many devotees were left without clothes. Power for lighting and heating systems had been cut off before the demolition began. Furniture and larger household belongings were loaded onto trucks. Officials said these possessions would be destroyed.

The Hare Krishna community had been promised that no action would be taken before the report of a state commission – supposedly set up to resolve the dispute – was made public. On the day the demolition began, the commission's chairman, Amanbek Mukhashev, told Forum 18, "I know nothing about the demolition of the Hare Krishna homes – I'm on holiday." He added, "As soon as I return to work at the beginning of December we will officially announce the results of the Commission's investigation." Other officials also refused to comment.

===Malaysia===
{{See also|Hinduism in Malaysia|Cow head protests}}
Approximately nine percent of the population of [[Malaysia]] are [[Tamil people|Tamil]] Indians, of whom nearly 90 percent are practising Hindus. Indian settlers came to Malaysia from [[Tamil Nadu]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930195228/http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please],''malaysiakini.com''&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-malaysia-demolishes-century-old-hindu-temple-1025317 |title=Malaysia demolishes century-old Hindu temple |publisher=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |accessdate=7 May 2015|date=2006-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor State has been helping to organise efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pressure on multi-faith Malaysia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4965580.stm |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus. The "Hindu Rights Action Force", a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Malaysian Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |newspaper=Financial Express |agency=AP |date=23 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |archive-date=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a lawyer for the Hindu Rights Action Task Force, a Hindu temple is demolished in [[Malaysia]] once every three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia ethnic Indians in uphill fight on religion |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-30397720071108?pageNumber=1 |newspaper=Reuters India |date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian Muslims have also grown more [[anti-Hindu]] over the years. In response to the proposed construction of a temple in [[Selangor]], Muslims chopped off the head of a cow to protest, with leaders saying there would be blood if a temple was constructed in [[Shah Alam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia Muslims protest proposed Hindu temple |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5RWG2ScAdC9V7eo-B6-KfUL3QjgD9ABV6U81 |newspaper=Associated Press |date=28 August 2009 |archive-url=http://archive.today/2009.09.02-210504/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5RWG2ScAdC9V7eo-B6-KfUL3QjgD9ABV6U81 |archive-date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws in the country, especially those concerning religious identity, are generally slanted towards compulsion into converting to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia strips Hindus of rights |url=http://dailypioneer.com/230183/Malaysia-strips-Hindus-of-rights.html |newspaper=Daily Pioneer |date=19 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122140638/http://www.dailypioneer.com:80/230183/Malaysia-strips-Hindus-of-rights.html |archive-date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus in [[Fiji]] constitute approximately 38% of the country's population. During the late 1990s there were several riots against Hindus by radical elements in Fiji. In the Spring of 2000, the democratically elected Fijian government led by Prime Minister [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] was held hostage by a guerilla group, headed by [[George Speight]]. They were demanding a segregated state exclusively for the native Fijians, thereby legally abolishing any rights the Hindu inhabitants have now. The majority of Fijian land is reserved for the ethnically Fijian community.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Fraenkel, Stewart Firth 2007 306"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fraenkel |first1=Jonathan |last2=Firth |first2=Stewart |year=2007 |title=From Election to Coup in Fiji: The 2006 Campaign and Its Aftermath |publisher=ANU E Press |page=306 |isbn=978-1-921313-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the practitioners of Hindu faith are predominantly Indians, racist attacks by the extremist Fijian Nationalists too often culminated into violence against the institutions of Hinduism. According to official reports, attacks on Hindu institutions increased by 14% compared to 2004. Hindus and Hinduism, being labelled the "outside others," especially in the aftermath of the May 2000 coup, have been victimised by Fijian fundamentalist and nationalists who wish to create a theocratic Christian state in Fiji. This intolerance towards Hindus has found expression in anti-Hindu speeches and destruction of temples, the two most common forms of immediate and direct violence against Hindus. Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighbouring Australia and New Zealand. Organised religious institutions, such as the [[Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma|Methodist Church of Fiji]], have repeatedly called for the creation of a theocratic Christian State and have propagated anti-Hindu sentiment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The [[Methodist church]] of Fiji repeatedly calls for the creation of a Christian State since a coup d'état in 1987&lt;ref name="Jonathan Fraenkel, Stewart Firth 2007 306"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/link.asp?id=u250pmj6q7047403 Roots of Land and Church: the Christian State Debate in Fiji – International journal for the Study of the Christian Church&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309182856/http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/link.asp?id=u250pmj6q7047403 |date=9 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has stated that those who are not Christian should be "tolerated as long as they obey Christian law".{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The Methodist Church of Fiji specifically objects to the constitutional protection of minority religious communities such as Hindus and Muslims. State favouritism of Christianity, and systematic attacks on temples, are some of the greatest threats faced by Fijian Hindus. Despite the creation of a human rights commission, the plight of Hindus in Fiji continues to be precarious.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Trinidad and Tobago===
{{See also|Hinduism in Trinidad and Tobago}}
During the initial decades of Indian indenture, Indian cultural forms were met with either contempt or indifference by the Christian majority.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;Singh, Sherry-Ann, Hinduism and the State in Trinidad, Inter-Asia Cultural Studies, Volume 6, Number 3, September 2005, pp. 353–365(13)&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus have made many contributions to Trinidad's history and culture even though the state historically regarded Hindus as second class citizens. Hindus in Trinidad struggled over the granting of adult franchise, the Hindu marriage bill, the divorce bill, the cremation ordinance, and other discriminatory laws.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; After Trinidad's independence from colonial rule, Hindus were marginalised by the African-based [[People's National Movement]]. The opposing party, the People's Democratic party, was portrayed as a "Hindu group", and Hindus were castigated as a "recalcitrant and hostile minority".&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; The displacement of PNM from power in 1985 would improve the situation.

Intensified protests over the course of the 1980s led to an improvement in the state's attitudes towards Hindus.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; The divergence of some of the fundamental aspects of local Hindu culture, the segregation of the Hindu community from Trinidad, and the disinclination to risk erasing the more fundamental aspects of what had been constructed as "Trinidad Hinduism" in
which the identity of the group had been rooted, would often generate dissension when certain dimensions of Hindu culture came into contact with the State. While the incongruences continue to generate debate, and often conflict, it is now tempered with growing awareness and consideration on the part of the state to the Hindu minority.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; Hindus have been also been subjected to persistent proselytisation by Christian missionaries.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14060.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2002: Trinidad and Tobago|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a series of attacks were committed against people of Indian origin by a street gang called the "[[Dotbusters]]" in [[New Jersey]] in 1987, the dot signifying the [[Bindi dot]] sticker worn on the forehead by Indian women.&lt;ref name="nyt12Oct1987"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marriott |first=Michel |date=12 October 1987 |title=In Jersey City, Indians Protest Violence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/nyregion/in-jersey-city-indians-protest-violence.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lackadaisical attitude of the local police prompted the South Asian community to arrange small groups all across the state to fight back against the street gang. The perpetrators have been put to trial. On 2 January 2012, a Hindu worship center in New York City was firebombed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre8010ie-us-crime-newyork/ "New York firebomb attacks hit mosque, Hindu site"]. ''News Daily''. 2 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dotbusters was a [[hate group]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], that attacked and threatened [[South Asian]]s in the fall of 1987. The name originated from the fact that traditional Hindu women and girls wear a [[Bindi (decoration)|bindi]] on their forehead.&lt;ref name="nyt12Oct1987" /&gt;

In October 1987, a group of youths attacked Navroze Mody, an Indian man of [[Parsi]] (Persian) origin, who was mistaken for a Hindu, after he had left the Gold Coast Cafe with his friend who fell into a coma. Mody died four days later. The four convicted of the attack were Luis Acevedo, Ralph Gonzalez and Luis Padilla - who were convicted of aggravated assault; and William Acevedo - who was convicted of simple assault. The attack was with fists and feet and with an unknown object that was described as either a baseball bat or a brick, and occurred after members of the group, which was estimated as being between ten and twelve youths, had surrounded Mr. Mody and taunted him for his baldness as either "Kojak" or "baldie". Mody's father, Jamshid Mody, later brought charges against the city and police force of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], claiming that "the Hoboken police's indifference to acts of violence perpetrated against Asian Indians violated Navroze Mody's equal protection rights" under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/959/959.F2d.461.91-5407.html Verdict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310144803/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/959/959.F2d.461.91-5407.html |date=10 March 2012 }} of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] in ''Mody v. City of Hoboken'' (959 F.2d 461)&lt;/ref&gt; Mody lost the case; the court ruled that the attack had not been proven a [[hate crime]], nor had there been proven any malfeasance by the police or prosecutors of the city.&lt;ref name="verdict" /&gt;

A few days after the attack on Mody, another Indian was beaten into a coma; this time on a busy street corner in Jersey City Heights. The victim, Kaushal Saran, was found unconscious at Central and Ferry Avenues, near a city park and firehouse, according to police reports. Saran, a licensed physician in India who was awaiting licensing in the United States, was discharged later from University Hospital in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/nyregion/in-jersey-city-indians-protest-violence.html?&amp;pagewanted=2 In Jersey City, Indians Protest Violence.] The New York Times, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The unprovoked attack left Saran in a partial coma for over a week with severe damage to his skull and brain. In September 1992, Thomas Kozak, Martin Ricciardi, and Mark Evangelista were brought to trial on federal civil rights charges in connection with the attack on Saran. However, the three were acquitted of the charges in two separate trials in 1993. Saran testified at both trials that he could not remember the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaulessar |first=Ricardo |date=2 May 2009 |title='DotBusters' victim looks back |url=http://hudsonreporter.com/printer_friendly/2488227 |location=Hudson County, New Jersey |newspaper=[[The Hudson Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dotbusters were primarily based in New York and New Jersey and committed most of their crimes in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]]. A number of perpetrators have been brought to trial for these assaults. Although tougher anti-hate crime laws were passed by the New Jersey legislature in 1990, the attacks continued, with 58 cases of hate crimes against Indians in New Jersey reported in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluralism.org/ocg/CDROM_files/hinduism/dot_busters.php |title=Dot Busters in New Jersey |website=The Pluralism Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923053125/http://www.pluralism.org/ocg/CDROM_files/hinduism/dot_busters.php |archive-date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Taylor Schilling at Paley Fest Orange Is The New Black.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor Schilling plays Piper Chapman]]
Chapman is a 31-year-old [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] who is sentenced to 15 months in prison for carrying a bag of drug-money ($50,000) to Belgium for her girlfriend, [[Alex Vause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/30/orange-is-the-new-black-star-taylor-schilling-on-her-path-to-prison.html|title='Orange Is the New Black' Star Taylor Schilling on Her Path to Prison|accessdate=October 4, 2014|date=July 30, 2013|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|author=Stern, Marlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to prison, Chapman owned an artisanal bath soap business in Brooklyn. She comes from a wealthy family, and was a debutante as a teenager.&lt;ref name=OItNBYi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2013/07/10/orange-new-black-yuppie-interrupted/sfQieZah74YFAVWZYugu2O/story.html|title='Orange Is the New Black': Yuppie, interrupted|accessdate=October 4, 2014|date=July 10, 2013|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|author=Gilbert, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is originally from [[Connecticut]]. Chapman is [[bisexual]], and in college was in a relationship with [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), a drug smuggler. 10 years prior to the series' beginning, she carried drug money from Colombia to Belgium with Vause. Eventually, Chapman grew disenchanted with Vause's lifestyle and broke up with her. She then began dating Larry Bloom ([[Jason Biggs]]), to whom she got engaged.

Piper is one of very few emphatically atheist inmates on the show. She responds to a request that she baptise herself by saying that she cannot pretend to believe in a god, saying that while it might make her happier if she believed in a religion, she "needs it to be true", and instead looks to science to explain the world. In another episode, when confronted on the subject again, she clarifies that "I've always thought [[agnosticism|agnostic]] was a sort of cop-out... If I had to label it I'd say that I'm a [[secular humanism|secular humanist]]."

In 2018, Schilling stated that while [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' was written with having a rationale for each action, "Piper’s behavior oftentimes feels groundless" and "the audience can’t quite grab onto Piper’s behavior. It seems like it’s coming out of nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tannenbaum, Emily|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a22603014/taylor-schilling-orange-is-the-new-black-season-6/|title=Taylor Schilling Is Ready to Hang Up Her Orange Jumpsuit|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|date=2018-08-03|accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
===Season 1===
Chapman is sentenced to 15 months in [[Litchfield Prison]] for Criminal conspiracy and [[Money laundering]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/orange-is-the-new-black-inmate-sentences.html|title=How Much Time Do the Women of Orange Is the New Black Have Left in Their Sentences?|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vause had been arrested and named Chapman as an accomplice in order to reduce her own sentence. On her first day, Chapman gets felt up by guard George "Pornstache" Mendez ([[Pablo Schreiber]]) and unintentionally offends prison matriarch Red ([[Kate Mulgrew]]), who runs the prison cafeteria. Red starves Chapman to make an example of her, and the other inmates are too intimidated to help except for [[Crazy Eyes (character)|Crazy Eyes]] ([[Uzo Aduba]]). Nonetheless, Chapman resists Crazy Eyes' subsequent advances, and makes amends with Red by making her lotion to help her back. She befriends [[Nicky Nichols]] ([[Natasha Lyonne]]), who becomes her confidante and protector. She also discovers Vause is sentenced to the same prison.

Chapman is assigned to the prison electrical workshop and accidentally steals a screwdriver. Her cellmate Miss Claudette ([[Michelle Hurst]]) helps her evade the guards' searches. In order to ingratiate herself with the other inmates, Chapman offers to review their appeal letters.

Although Bloom learns that Vause was the informant who gave Chapman up, he does not share this information with her. Chapman then rekindles her relationship with Vause. Meanwhile, Bloom, an aspiring writer, publishes a story about Chapman's incarceration that paints unflattering portraits of her fellow inmates and the prison staff. The article earns Chapman the ire of both the guards and the other prisoners, and puts a severe strain on her already fading relationship with Bloom.

Chapman is elected to the prison council, but finds that the only change she is able to make is to get the [[Cinder track|track]] reopened for Janae Watson ([[Vicky Jeudy]]) who was put in solitary confinement during the screwdriver incident. Chapman makes an enemy of [[Tiffany Doggett|Tiffany "Pennsatucky" Doggett]] ([[Taryn Manning]]), who wanted her spot on the council. Doggett tells inmate counselor Sam Healy ([[Michael J. Harney]]) about Chapman and Vause's relationship; Healy punishes her by putting her in solitary confinement and telling Bloom about the affair. Bloom gets back at Chapman by doing an interview on [[NPR]] that casts Litchfield in a harsh light, which makes her even more unpopular. During an angry phone call, Bloom reveals that Vause informed on her. Vause asks Chapman to choose between her and Bloom. Chapman chooses Bloom, but Vause breaks them up and spurns Chapman. When Doggett attacks Chapman with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]], Chapman finally snaps and beats her to a pulp.&lt;ref name=OITNBS1raotne&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-heres-your-recap-ahead-of-season-2-9486431.html|title=Orange Is The New Black: Season 1 recap ahead of the new episodes|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 4, 2014|website=[[The Independent]]|author=Hooton, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OISNBS1R&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/orange-new-black-season-1-recap-everything-know-season-2-premiere-1593957|title='Orange Is The New Black' Season 1 Recap: Everything To Know Before The Season 2 Premiere|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 3, 2014|website=[[International Business Times]]|author=Schaefer, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
After spending a month in [[solitary confinement]], Chapman is flown to [[Chicago]] to serve as a witness against the drug kingpin who had been Vause's boss.&lt;ref name=OItNBS2RP1/&gt; There, she spends time in a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security prison]] with dangerous inmates who menace her daily.&lt;ref name=TSOITNBSOS2AP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/06/23/taylor-schilling-orange-is-the-new-black-piper-chapman-interview_n_5522381.html|title=Taylor Schilling, 'Orange Is The New Black' Star, On Season 2 And Playing The Ever-Evolving Piper|accessdate=October 5, 2014|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|author=Jancelewicz, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in episode 1, "Thirsty Bird", we see Chapman as a young girl ([[Clare Foley]]) in a flashback, discovering that her father is cheating on her mother. Vause persuades Chapman to commit [[perjury]] in order to keep them safe from the drug lord, but ultimately cuts a deal to testify against her former boss in return for early release; she then leaves Chapman to suffer the consequences of her perjured testimony alone. In episode 3, "Hugs Can Be Deceiving", we find out that Crazy Eyes had run outside and knocked Chapman unconscious after she had beaten up Doggett at the end of season 1. In episode 6, "You Also Have a Pizza", Chapman starts a prison newsletter, and makes a deal with a reporter to investigate the financial goings on at the prison. She eventually uncovers evidence that assistant warden Natalie Figueroa ([[Alysia Reiner]]) has been embezzling from the prison.&lt;ref name=OItNBS2RP1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/community/post/orange-is-the-new-black-season-2-review-140195141813/|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2 Review, Part 1 (Episodes 1-6): Conflict Over Community|accessdate=September 6, 2014|publisher=[[TV.com]]|author=Surette, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep her quiet, Figueroa arranges for Chapman to be transferred to a facility in [[Virginia]]. However, when Chapman gives prison administrator Joe Caputo ([[Nick Sandow]]) the evidence implicating Figueroa, he cancels the transfer and gives the warden the incriminating information, resulting in Figueroa's resignation.

Chapman gets a [[furlough]] to go to her grandmother's funeral. At home in [[New York City]], she realizes that Larry has lost interest in her, and soon learns that he has fallen in love with her best friend, Polly Harper ([[Maria Dizzia]]). Chapman is furious at first, but eventually agrees to give them her blessing in return for either of them telling Vause's parole officer that Vause is going to break parole, which will land her back in Litchfield prison&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/community/post/orange-is-the-new-black-season-2-review-part-2-140267649464/|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2 Review, Part 2 (Episodes 7-13): Fight the Power|accessdate=September 6, 2014|publisher=[[TV.com]]|author=Surette, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
Chapman begins a business selling used panties to people outside of Litchfield, enlisting her brother Cal as her middleman. Chapman begins a romantic relationship with an Australian prisoner, Stella. After Stella steals Chapman's money, she plants contraband in Stella's bunk and orchestrates her being sent to the maximum security unit in retaliation the day before Stella's release date.

===Season 4===
Chapman continues her panty business but finds herself in competition with a group of Dominicans led by Maria Ruiz. When Chapman aligns herself with a gang of white supremacists and plants contraband in Maria's bunk, Maria retaliates by kidnapping her and having her branded with a swastika.&lt;ref&gt;VanArendonk, Kathryn.

A '''pontiff''' (from [[Latin]] ''pontifex'') was, in [[Roman antiquity]], a member of the most illustrious of the colleges of priests of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], the [[College of Pontiffs]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"Pontifex". "Oxford English Dictionary", March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Pontifex.html William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, article ''Pontifex'', pp. 939-942]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pontiff" was later applied to any high or chief priest and, in [[Roman Catholic]] ecclesiastical usage, to a [[bishop]] and more particularly to the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], the [[Pope#Pontiff|Pope]] or "Roman Pontiff".&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Pontiff ''Pontiff'', The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wikitionary|pontiff|Pontiff}}

==Etymology==
The English term derives through Old [[French language|French]] ''pontif''&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In modern French the corresponding term is ''pontife''&lt;/ref&gt; from Latin ''pontifex'', a word commonly held to come from the Latin root words ''pons'' (bridge) + ''facere'' (to do, to make), and so to have the literal meaning of "bridge-builder". This may be only a folk etymology,&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; but it may also recall antique tasks and magic rites associated with bridges.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507866/Roman-religion Encyclopædia Britannica, article ''Roman religion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Rome==
{{main|College of Pontiffs}}
There were four chief [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|colleges]] of priests in ancient Rome, the most illustrious of which was that of the ''pontifices''.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The others were those of the ''[[augures]]'', the ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]'', and the ''[[epulones]]''.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The same person could be a member of more than one of these groups.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Including the ''[[pontifex maximus]]'', who was president of the college, there were originally three&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; or five&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; ''pontifices'', but the number increased over the centuries, finally becoming 16 under [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; By the third century B.C., the pontiffs had assumed control of the state religious system.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Catholicism==
The word "pontiff", though now most often used in relation to a [[Pope]], technically refers to any bishop. The phrase "Roman Pontiff" is not tautological, but means "Bishop of Rome", as "[[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandrian Pontiff]]" means Bishop of Alexandria.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; In the same way, the adjective "pontifical" does not refer exclusively to the Pope: a [[Pontifical Mass]] is a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated by a bishop, not necessarily by a pope. From the adjective have been formed the nouns "the [[Roman Pontifical|Pontifical]]" (the liturgical book containing the prayers and ceremonies for rites used by a bishop)&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Pontifical''&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[pontificals]]" (the insignia of his order that a bishop uses when celebrating Pontifical Mass, not papal insignia, such as the [[papal tiara]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''pontificals''&lt;/ref&gt; Furtheron, while the pontificals primarily belong to bishops (as the name implies), they have also been granted by Papal favour or legally established Church custom to certain presbyters (e. g., abbots), and so (say) an abbot who (say) confers the [[Sacrament of Confirmation]] as extraordinary distributor, celebrating a Pontifical Mass at the occasion, might also be referred to as "the pontiff" (that is, celebrant of the Pontifical Mass) in this respect.

==Other religions==
&lt;!--Vyasatirtha links here.--&gt;
Inspiration for the Christian use of the name "pontiff" for a bishop could be found in the use of the same word (in Latin, ''pontifex'', not "pontifex maximus") for the Jewish High Priest in the [[Vulgate]] Latin translation of the Scriptures, where it appears 59 times. For example, in the Vulgate {{bibleverse||Mark|15:11}}, "pontifices" (plural) is the Latin term used for "The Chief Priests",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2015:11-15:11&amp;version=VULGATE Marcus 15:11]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]] "pontifex" (singular) is repeatedly used with reference to the Jewish High Priest and analogously to Jesus as the High Priest of Christians.

The word has been employed in English also for [[caliph]]s ([[Islam]]) and [[swami]]s and [[jagadguru]]s ([[Hinduism]]).&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;

The '''Principality of Ushrusana''' (also spelled ''Usrushana'' and ''Osrushana'') was a local [[Iranian people|Iranian]] dynasty of [[Sogdia]]n origin, which ruled the [[Ushrusana]] region from an unknown date to 892. The rulers of the principality were known by their title of ''[[Afshin]]''.

== History ==
Ushrusana was a frontier province in [[Central Asia]], bordering the [[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)|lands of Islam]] during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates. It was situated between the districts of [[Samarkand]] in the west and [[Khujand]] to the east, and was somewhat south of the [[Syr Darya]] River. As a result of its location, several roads ran through it, making the province a frequent stop for travelers. The terrain of the country consisted of a mixture of plains and mountains; some districts of Ushrusana had towns, but overall the region was little urbanized. The primary city was [[Bunjikath]], which was often referred to as the City of Ushrusana.&lt;ref&gt;Le Strange, pp. 474-75; Kramers, pp. 924-25; Bosworth, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;

Ushrusana is first mentioned during the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]], and was at times nominally subject to the Caliphate, but it remained effectively independent. Several Umayyad governors conducted raids into the country and received tribute from its rulers, but permanent conquest was not achieved by them.&lt;ref&gt;Kramers, p. 925; al-Tabari, v. 24: p. 173; v. 25: p. 148; v. 26: p. 31; al-Baladhuri, pp. 190, 203&lt;/ref&gt; After the Abbasids came to power in 750, the princes of Ushrusana made submissions to the caliphs during the reigns of [[al-Mahdi]] (r. 775–785) and [[Harun al-Rashid]] (r. 786–809), but these appear to have been nominal acts&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ya'qubi, ''Historiae,'' p. 479; al-Tabari, v. 30: p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and the people of the region continued to resist Muslim rule.&lt;ref&gt;For example, joining Rafi' ibn Layth's rebellion and reneging on tribute agreements: al-Ya'qubi, ''Historiae,'' p. 528; al-Baladhuri, pp. 203-04&lt;/ref&gt;

Ushrusana was more firmly brought under Abbasid control following a quarrel that broke out within the ruling dynasty, during the caliphate of [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813–833). In 822, a Muslim army under [[Ahmad ibn Abi Khalid al-Ahwal]] conquered Ushrusana and captured its ruler [[Kawus ibn Kharakhuruh]]; he was sent to [[Baghdad]], where he submitted to the caliph and converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, p. 590; Kramers, p. 925; Kennedy, p. 125; al-Baladhuri, pp. 204-05; al-Tabari, v. 32: pp. 107, 135&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, Ushrusana was generally considered to be part of the Abbasid state, although the ''afshin''s were allowed to retain their control over the country as subjects of the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Kramers, p. 925. The dynasty remained in power until 893, when Ushrusana became a directly-administered province of the [[Samanids]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawus was succeeded by his son Khaydar, who had assisted Ahmad ibn Abi Khalid in his campaign against Ushrusana. Khaydar, who is usually referred to in the sources simply as [[al-Afshin]],&lt;ref&gt;Barthold and Gibb, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; decided to enter the service of the Abbasids and made his way to al-Ma'mun's court. There he embarked on a military career, and became a commander in the caliphal army.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, p. 590; Kennedy, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; With Afshin came a number of his followers, a number of whom were fellow natives of Ushrusana. These men were integrated into the army and, serving under their prince, became known as the ''[[Ushrusaniyya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 125; Gordon, p. 43; Northedge, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; However, Afshin later tried to gain control over all of [[Khurasan]] and [[Transoxiana]] from the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Tahirid dynasty]]. He even secretly supported [[Mazyar]], the [[Qarinvand dynasty|Karenid]] ruler of [[Tabaristan]], who had rebelled against the Abbasids. The rebellion, however, was soon suppressed, and Afshin's ambitions were revealed by the Abbasids. Furthermore, Afshin was accused of being a [[Zoroastrian]], and he was soon imprisoned and died. His successor is not known; however, the Afshin family continued to rule Ushrusana until 892, when the [[Samanid]] ruler [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]] incorporated Ushrusana into his Empire and killed its ruler, [[Sayyar ibn 'Abdallah]].

As per the 2011 census, the predominant '''religion in Lithuania''' is [[Christianity]], with the largest confession being that of the [[Catholic Church]] (about 77% of the population is Catholic according to the 2011 census).&lt;ref name="stat.gov.lt"&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.lt/en/news/view/?id=12456] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also smaller groups of Orthodox Christians, Evangelical [[Lutherans]], members of [[Reformed]] churches, other [[Protestants]], Jews and [[Muslim]]s as well as people of other faiths. 

According to the 2010 [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]],&lt;ref name="EUROBAROMETER"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |title=Eurobarometer on Biotechnology|page=11|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=5 May 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47% of Lithuanian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", 37% answered that "they believe there is some sort of [[spirit]] or [[Energy (spirituality)|life force]]", and 12% said that "they do not believe there is any sort of [[spirit]], god, or [[Energy (spirituality)|life force]]".

==Christianity==
[[File:Vilnius cathedral.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vilnius Cathedral]], is the heart of Catholic spiritual life in Lithuania.]]
===Catholic Church===
{{main|Catholic Church in Lithuania}}
As per the 2011 census, 77.2% of Lithuanians belong to the [[Catholic Church]]. &lt;ref name="stat.gov.lt"/&gt;  Catholic Church has claimed the adherence of the majority of Lithuania since the [[Christianization of Lithuania]] in the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5aoId7nA4bsC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;f=false Foreword to the past: a cultural history of the Baltic people by Endre Bojtár], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  Lithuania kept her Catholic identity under the [[Russian Empire]] and later under the [[Soviet Union]] when some Catholic priests led the resistance against the Communist regime, which is commemorated in the [[Hill of Crosses]] near [[Šiauliai]], a shrine to the anti-communist resistance.

====Greek Catholics====
The center of [[Greek Catholic]] life in Lithuania is the Basilian Monastery and Church of the Holy Trinity in Vilnius.  In the past, the monastery was multiethnic but now serves a mostly Ukrainian community. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivilnius.com/explore/place-of-interest/churchs/church-of-the-holy-trinity-and-basilian-monastery/|title=Church of the Holy Trinity and Basilian Monastery - Aušros Vartų str. 7, Vilnius - Churches - Vilnius city guide|website=iVilnius.lt|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
[[Protestants]] are 0.8%, of which 0.6% are [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and 0.2% are [[Calvinism|Reformed]]. According to Losch (1932), the Lutherans were 3.3% of the total population; they were mainly [[Germans]] in the [[Memel territory]] (now Klaipėda). There was also a tiny Reformed community (0.5%)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160509100300/http://www.lmaleidykla.lt/publ/1392-1096/2004/2/Geo_026_33.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; which still persists. Protestantism has declined with the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans|removal of the German population]], and today it is mainly represented by ethnic Lithuanians throughout the northern and western parts of the country, as well as large urban areas. Believers and clergy suffered greatly during the Soviet occupation, with many killed, tortured or deported to Siberia. Newly arriving [[Evangelicalism|evangelical churches]] have established missions in Lithuania since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.2012693/k.AEBE/United_Methodists_evangelize_in_Lithuania_with_ads_brochures.htm |title=United Methodists evangelize in Lithuania with ads, brochures |publisher=Umc.org |date= 11 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Lutheranism====
[[File:Vyžiai._Evangelikų_liuteronų_bažnyčia.jpg|right|thumb|Evangelical Lutheran Church in [[Vyžiai]]]]
{{main|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania}}

[[Protestantism|Protestants]] make up 0.8% of the population,&lt;ref name="stat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.lt/uploads/docs/2002_11_07.pdf|title=Romos katalikų daugiausia|date=2002-11-07|publisher=Department of Statistics to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 0.56% belonging to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania]].

Lutheranism in Lithuania dates back to the 16th century, when it came mainly from the neighbouring German-controlled areas of [[Livonia]] and [[East Prussia]].  A Synod in Vilnius united the church in 1557.  The parish network covered nearly all of the Grand Duchy, with district centers in Vilnius, Kedainai, Biržai, Slucke, Kojdanove and Zabludove later Izabeline.  Small Protestant communities are dispersed throughout the northern and western parts of the country.

The majority of [[Prussian Lithuanians]] living in East Prussia and in Memelland (since 1945 the [[Klaipėda Region]] of Lithuania) belonged to the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]]. Most resettled in the [[West Germany]] after [[World War II]] along with the [[ethnic German]] inhabitants.

Since 1945, Lutheranism in Lithuania has declined largely due to the ongoing secularization that sweeps throughout Europe.
[[File:Evangeliku_reformatu_baznycia_birzai.JPG|right|thumb|Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church in [[Biržai]]]]
====Calvinism====
The [[Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church]] is a historic denomination it was founded in 1557. Notable member was [[Szymon Zajcusz]]. In the second half of the 16th century the Unitarians separated. The denomination has over 7000 members in 14 congregations. The church is a member of the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120907030841/http://www.ref.lt/index.php/en/english/1-english] &lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Reformed Fellowship]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080914010638/http://www.wrfnet.org/web/guest/aboutwrf/membershiplist] &lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Protestants====
Various Protestant churches have established missions in Lithuania since 1990, including the [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.2012693/k.AEBE/United_Methodists_evangelize_in_Lithuania_with_ads_brochures.htm|title=United Methodists evangelize in Lithuania with ads, brochures |publisher=Umc.org |date= 11 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Baptists|Baptist Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebf.org/articles/display-article.php?article=6&amp;cat=imp&amp;lang=eng|title=European Baptist Federation (EBF)|website=Ebf.org|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mennonites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mennonitemission.net/Resources/Publications/BeyondOurselves/V4N2/article4.asp|title=Graduation: Lithuania Christian College|website=Mennonitemission.net|accessdate=5 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621105432/http://www.mennonitemission.net/resources/Publications/BeyondOurselves/V4N2/article4.asp|archivedate=21 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
[[File:Russian Orthodox Church of The Holy Mother of God Vilnius (5990381200).jpg|right|thumb|[[Cathedral of the Theotokos, Vilnius|Cathedral of the Theotokos.]] The cathedral belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church and was once again renovated in 1998. Its services are attended mostly by ethnic Russian and Belarusian residents of Vilnius.]]
[[Eastern Orthodoxy]] claims 4.1% of the population, mainly from the [[Russians in Lithuania|Russian minority]].&lt;ref name="stat" /&gt;

=== Oriental Orthodoxy / Armenian Apostolic Church ===
Most of [[Armenians in Lithuania]], making up about 0.1% of population according to own estimates belong to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], which is often classified as an [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], in distinction from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (to which the main Russian, Greek and Georgian Churches belong). 

An Armenian Apostolic Church St. Vardan was opened in Vilnius in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=davkstudio|title=St. Vardan’s Armenian apostolic church in Vilnius 2017|date=2017-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGZ91fR2Gt8|accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Kauno musulmonu mecete1.2007-04-06.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kaunas Mosque]].]]
{{main|Islam in Lithuania}}
In [[Lithuania]], Islam has a long history unlike many other northern European countries.  The medieval [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] allowed Muslims, notably the [[Crimean Tatars]] to settle in the lands in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic peoples of the Soviet Union, by Shirin Akiner, pg. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Some of people from those lands were moved into ethnically Lithuanian lands, now the current Republic of Lithuania, mainly under the rule of Grand Duke [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]]. The Tatars, now referred to as [[Lithuanian Tatars]], lost their language over time and now speak [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] as natives; however, they have strongly maintained their [[Muslim]] faith.

==Judaism==
{{main|Lithuanian Jews}}
[[File:'Choral Synagogue' Pylimo g. Vilnius - Flickr - FaceMePLS.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Choral Synagogue of Vilnius]], the only synagogue in Vilnius to survive the [[Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation.]]]]
The Lithuanian Jewish community has roots that go back to before the time of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Lithuania was historically home to a large Jewish community and an important center of Jewish scholarship and culture from the 18th century until the community was almost [[Holocaust in Lithuania|entirely eliminated]] during [[the Holocaust]]. Before [[World War II]], the Lithuanian Jewish population numbered some 160,000, about 7% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005444|title=Lithuania|website=Ushmm.org|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilnius]] alone had a Jewish community of nearly 100,000, about 45% of the city's total population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Vilnius.html|title=Vilnius (Vilna), Lithuania Jewish History Tour|website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 110 [[synagogue]]s and 10 [[yeshiva|yeshivot]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litvakai.mch.mii.lt/jerusalem/Default.htm|title=Vilnius - Jerusalem of Lithuania|website=Litvakai.mch.mii.lt|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still communities of Jews of Lithuanian descent around the world, especially in [[Israel]], the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Brazil]] and [[Australia]].

According to the 2001 census, there were 1,272 adherents of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]] and [[Karaite Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.stat.gov.lt/sips/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=gs_dem21lt&amp;ti=Gyventojai+pagal+tautyb%E6+ir+tikyb%E0++&amp;path=../Database/cen_lt/s71lt/1.%20demografija/&amp;lang=1 |title=Gyventojai pagal tautybę ir tikybą |publisher=Department of Statistics to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 4,000 Jews were counted in Lithuania during the 2005 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.lt/en/pages/view/?id=1731&amp;PHPSESSID=311ec85274c89154e6f4befbc159a0e8|title=Lithuanian population by ethnicity|website=Stat.gov.lt|accessdate=5 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602195536/http://www.stat.gov.lt/en/pages/view/?id=1731&amp;PHPSESSID=a2cc98ebfc3a13b8297889cb6f68d571|archivedate=2 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karaites===
[[Image:Karaite Kenesa Vilnius.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]] [[kenesa]] in [[Vilnius]]]] 
According to a Karaite tradition several hundred [[Crimean Karaites]] were invited to Lithuania by Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] to settle in [[Trakai]] ca. 1397. A small community remains in Trakai today, which has preserved the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[Karaim language]] and distinctive customs, such as its traditional dish called "kibinai", a sort of meat pastry, and its houses with three windows, one for God, one for the family, and one for Grand Duke Vytautas.

==Romuva==
Medieval Lithuania was the last pagan nation in Europe, officially [[Christianization of Lithuania|converting in the 14th century]]. The neo-pagan movement [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], established in 1967, attempts to reconstruct and revive [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYtrv5qD9isC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=A History of Pagan Europe|first1=Prudence|last1=Jones|first2=Nigel|last2=Pennick|date=5 October 1997|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=5 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15427">[[Sacred music]] and dance are fundamental to the [[Santo Daime]] religion. The earliest [[hymns]] are those of the founder, [[Mestre Irineu|Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu']]. While the rituals and music originated with a very few hymns, sung by a small group in the Brazilian Amazon, the practice of these spiritual works in diverse parts of the world since it began expansion around the beginning of the 1990s has given rise to a significant body of music, in many languages. Daimistas from [[Brazil]] and other countries have contributed to this growing genre, while continuing to sing the principle hinarios in Portuguese. 

Among adherents to the doctrine, songs tend to be referred to as 'received'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santodaime.org/archives/murilo3.htm/ |title=SantoDaime.org archives, José Murilo C. Carvalho Jr. |accessdate=2009-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104204120/http://www.santodaime.org/archives/murilo3.htm |archivedate=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from a spiritual source rather than written from the writers mind alone and confirmed by their use in ritual. Variously these hymns may be viewed as 'calling' energies or divine entities, as transmitting sacred doctrine, as bringing healing through the act of singing what the community is affirming are eternal truths. In the spiritual works and communities of Santo Daime, the hymns are a bond of shared understanding and a daily practice. New hymns are often introduced in ceremony by those who receive them, by the leader's invitation.

A Santo Daime '''hinário''' (Portuguese) or ''hymn-book (hinario)'', can be a life work of its owner, chronicling that person's spiritual journey. During a ritual, one or several hinários or compilations may be sung in their entirety. While they are sung outside of the rituals in ensaio (practice) and listened to in various settings, the real distinction of is genre is that it is intended to be sung in ritual, by a group going into what is understood to be spiritual work of transformation. The hymns can be seen as integral to the ritual, the transformation, and the revealed messages as each person understands them. Hinarios that are central to the doctrine may be sung once or several times per year, and practiced many times more.

== Calendar of official hinarios ==

Mestre Irineu on the Virgin of Conception (Dec. 7), Christmas, Day of Kings (January 6), St. John (June 23). The hinario of Padrinho Sebastiao is sung on Irineu's birthday (Dec. 15), Saint Sebastian (January 19), Madrinha Rita's birthday (June 25), as well as Brazilian Father's Day. Padrinho Alfredo's hinario is sung on Padrinho Alfredo's birthday (January 7), St. Joseph (March 18), and Saint Peter (June 28), as well as New Year's Eve (December 31)

==Historical Hinarios==

===[[Mestre Irineu|Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu']]===

'O Cruzeiro' (The Cross), 'Cruzeirinho' (The Little Cross) and 'A Santa Missa' (The Holy Mass)

The first part of Mestre Irineu's hinário, '''''O Cruzeiro''''', contains hymns up to number 116. After an interval of 11 years he received hymns 117 through 128, which are now known as the '''''Cruzeirinho''''' or occasionally as the ''Hinos Novos''. After the time of Mestre Irineu it became a more common practice to finish or close an hinario as a complete work, after which a new hinario might be received.

===Sebastião Mota de Melo - 'Padrinho Sebastião'===

'O Justiceiro' and 'Nova Jerusalem' (The New Jerusalem)

Nova Jerusalem is the second and final hinario of Padrinho Sebastião, consisting of 26 hymns. 

===Rita Gregório de Melo- 'Madrinha Rita'===

'Lua Branca' (White Moon)

Rita Gregório de Melo is the widow of Padrinho Sebastião, matriarch of the CEFLURIS line, mother of 11 children, and lives in Céu do Mapiá. She is thought to have been born 25 June 1925 in Rio Grande do Norte.
 
===Júlia Gregório da Silva - 'Madrinha Júlia'===

'O Convite'  (The Invitation)

Júlia Gregório da Silva was born in Açu, Rio Grande do Norte, in 1933. She was the younger sister of Madrinha Rita, and the mother of six children.

===Cristina Raulino da Silva - 'Madrinha Cristina'===

'A Mensagem' (The Message)

Cristina Raulino da Silva was born in Rio Branco, Acre, in 1938. She married Manuel Gregório (Padrinho Nel), the brother of Madrinha Rita.
 
===Alfredo Gregório de Melo - 'Padrinho Alfredo'===

'O Cruzerinho', 'Nova Era' (The New Age) and 'Nova Dimensão' 

Nova Dimensão is the third (yet to be completed) hinario of Padrinho Alfredo.

Alfredo Gregório de Melo, one of the sons of Padrinho Sebastião and Madrinha Rita, today heads the CEFLURIS line which Padrinho Sebastião founded, based in Céu do Mapiá, Amazonas. He was born 7 January 1950 in the seringal (rubber extraction area) Adélia along the Juruá river in the state of Amazonas.

===João Pedro===

João Pedro was a contemporary of Mestre Irineu. All we know is that his strong, healing hinário only became known to Santo Daime after his death.

===Maria Marques Vieira - 'Maria Damião'===

'O Mensageiro' (The Messenger)

Maria Marques Vieira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/os_companheiros/maria_damiao_familiajuramidam.html|title=Bio of Maria Damiao (in portuguese) by Rodrigo Borges Conti Tavares|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in Belém do Pará, in 1917. She was very young when she moved with her family to Rio Branco, Acre, where she met Mestre Irineu, in the early 1930s. She was sallow and blond with white skin. Maria Damião, as she was known, married and had seven children (one adopted) but lost her husband early. She worked hard to support her family but had many difficulties in her material life, as in her works with Santo Daime. She died of pneumonia, aged just 32 years, on 2 April 1949.
 
===Antônio Gomes===

'O Amor Divino' (The Divine Love)

Antônio Gomes da Silva was born in Ceará, 30 April 1885. He married Maria de Nazaré in Ceará, and had five children. He lived in Belém do Pará for a while, and then moved to Rio Branco, Acre, in 1921. He worked as a seringueiro, or rubber tapper, and later as a farmer. He lost his first wife, married again, and had another four children. He met Mestre Irineu in 1938, and he received benefits for his unstable health. Antônio Gomes then became a member of the Santo Daime doctrine, as did his whole family. His son Leôncio became the new leader of Alto Santo, after Mestre Irineu's death, in 1971. His granddaughter, Peregrina Gomes, was the third wife of Mestre Irineu. Antônio Gomes da Silva died 14 August 1946.

===Germano Guilherme===

'Vós Sois Baliza' (Thou art a Beacon)

Germano Guilherme dos Santos was born in Piauí at the beginning of the 20th century. He moved with his family to Rio Branco, Acre, where he lived on the outskirts of the city working as a farmer. Germano was one of the first disciples of Mestre Irineu, becoming a member of Santo Daime in the 1930s. He was a black man with notably white teeth. Germano had special feelings for Mestre Irineu, and called him maninho, or 'my little brother'. He suffered a disease on his leg that bothered him a lot. Because of this, he couldn't eat some kinds of food. But when he was at maninho's house, Germano ate everything he wanted and didn't feel anything. He was married to Cecília Gomes, the daughter of Antônio Gomes and Maria de Nazaré, but had no children. His hinário is sung at CICLU - Alto Santo along with the O Cruzeiro hinário of Mestre Irineu. Germano Guilherme dos Santos died in 1964.
 
===João Pereira===

'Seis de Janeiro' (January 6; which is King's day, or [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]])

João Pereira was born in Porongaba, Ceará, in the end of the 19th century. Nobody knows the date he moved to Rio Branco, Acre. In the early 1930s, he joined Mestre Irineu, and became one of his first disciples. João Pereira was almost bald, and his complexion was swarthy or similar to that of caboclos, the mixed blood people of the Amazonian region. He worked as a farmer and wagon driver. He lived near Rio Branco and was married with Maria Franco (Maria Marques Feitosa), the mother of the second wife of Mestre Irineu, Raimunda. João Pereira died in 1954.
 
===Tetéu/Teteo (Francisco Fernandes Filho)===

After Mestre Irineu passed on, his last wife's uncle Leôncio Gomes assumed command of the works, and in turn after Leôncio Gomes' passing, Francisco Fernandes Filho (Tetéu or Teteo) took over; however, he apparently very soon quarreled with Mestre Irineu's widow, Dona Peregrina Gomes Serra, and was chased out of Mestre Irineu's house (Alto Santo), according to Edward MacRae. Tetéu then founded a new center less than a kilometer away, declaring himself to be the real CICLU.  Following Sr. Luis Mendes' presidency, Tetéu's eventual successor, Mr. João Rodrigues Facundes (who was also involved in the initial dispute), returned the legal name and charter of CICLU to Dona Peregrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/english/the_children_of_juramidam/genealogy.htm|title=Genealogy of the Santo Daime Doctrine|website=www.afamiliajuramidam.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Known for sleeping light and little, Tetéu received his nickname after a bird (''[[Southern lapwing|Vanellus chilensis]]'') commonly called "Tetéu" who was also believed to not sleep much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afamiliajuramidam.org/os_companheiros/teteo.htm|title=Os Companheiros - Tetéo|website=afamiliajuramidam.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hinario ''[http://nossairmandade.com/hinario.php?hid=32 O Assesor]'' has 132 hymns, including a number of Daime serving hymns (Eu Tomo Daime, O Daime Me Balançou, Mesa De Centro, Daime é O Nosso Pai, Um, Dois E Três) and is sung in some churches, where it is known, to honor the passing of Mestre Irineu on July 6. Where it is not known well, Mestre Irineu's hinario ''O Cruzeiro,'' is sung (a Capella in the churches of Sr. Luis Mendes). 
 
===Maria Brilhante===

Maria Brilhante was married with Padrinho Eduardo Salles Freitas, and they had four children, three of whom survive. Madrinha Maria Brilhante received a hinário which is officially sung on the festival of St. Anthony every 12-13 June.

==Some Contemporary Hinários==

===Baixinha===

'Guia Mestre' (Master Guide), 'Mensageiros da Cura' (Messengers of Healing),
'Hinário da Fé' (Hinario of the Faith), 'Estrela D'Água' (Star of the Water. Baixinha's new hinario)

Baixinha, ''tiny'' in Portuguese, is perhaps the best known practitioner of UmbanDaime. She is a small woman of scarcely one and a half meters, who has spent more than forty years in [[Umbanda]], twenty-one in [[Candomblé]], and eighteen years in Santo Daime. Despite her small stature, she was known by many as a true spiritual beacon and traveled extensively, even after she'd become very old. She led a spiritual community in Lumiar, a mountain village two hours from Rio de Janeiro until her passage in 2015 working in two worlds (spiritual and physical) and two doctrines (Daimista and Umbandista).

===Glauco Villas Boas===

'O Chaveirinho' &amp; 'O Chaveirão'

Hinário received by prominent cartoonist [[Glauco Villas Boas]] (March 10, 1957 - March 12, 2010), commander of the Céu de Maria church in São Paulo, and consisting of 41 hymns in O Chaveirinho and 11 in O Chaveirão. 

Glauco came from a [[Villas-B%C3%B4as brothers|family of legends]], and became a legend in his own right. As one of the most recognizable and timely artists of Brazil in the late 20th century, he formed a bond with fellow cartoonists [[Laerte]] and [[Angeli (cartoonist)|Angeli]] that produced a significant, massive body of work over decades.  As daily political cartoonist for [[Folha de S.Paulo|Folha de São Paulo]] (Sao Paulo's principal daily newspaper), he was looked to by Paulistas to interpret and shed light on the news of the day in his own courageous, take-no-prisoners style. 

While participating in early works at Flor das Aguas in Itapecerica da Serra (SP), Glauco inaugurated Ceu de Maria in his own home, then built a church on a peak high above Sao Paulo called [[Pico do Jaragu%C3%A1|Pico do Jaraguá]]. An accomplished musician, he was well known for his fiery accordion playing and said that he had never once practiced outside of ceremony, relying instead on the force of the Daime to pull the music.

===Alex Polari===

'Nova Anunciação'

Alex Polari spent years as a political prisoner during the rule of the military junta in Brazil, enduring torture, brutality, and deprivation. His quest for spiritual initiation eventually led him deep into the heart of the rainforest, to Mapiá, where he became a teacher and leader of the Santo Daime community. He is the author of 'Forest of Visions: Ayahuasca, Amazonian Spirituality, and the Santo Daime Tradition' which has been translated into English.
 
===Paulo Roberto===

Luz na Escuridão (A Light In The Darkness) is the hinário received by Paulo Roberto (Paulo Roberto Silva e Souza), padrinho of the Céu do Mar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceudomarteste.magaweb.com.br/|title=Website of Ceu do Mar (portuguese)|accessdate=2009-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215005628/http://ceudomarteste.magaweb.com.br/|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; church in Rio de Janeiro, and who is a psychologist by training.

==Selections from Hinarios==

(often sung as part of rituals)

===Oração===

Oração simply means prayer. In Daimista communities and households, it is normally sung around 6:30pm, in church or at home, with or without instruments. The oração of CEFLURIS consists of a selection of 12 hymns from Padrinho Sebastião's O Justiceiro hinário (or hymnbook), plus one from his son Padrinho Alfredo's O Cruzeirinho hinário, and a new one from Sebastião's daughter Madrinha Nonata.

===Cura===
(Divided into parts I and II)

The Cura is a selection of 32 healing hymns in two parts, taken mainly from the hinários of Padrinho Sebastião, Madrinha Rita, and Padrinho Alfredo, but also including a few from Mestre Irineu, Alex Polari, Vera Froes and Madrinha Tetê (Teresa Gregório), often used on occasions when healing is required, in particular physical healing.
 
===Finados===

Finados is a compendium of the hinarios of Antonio Gomes, Maria Damião, Germano Guilherme and João Pereira, among the earliest followers of Mestre Irineu.

[[File:Chapel2.jpg|thumb | upright | Silent Night Chapel]]
The '''Silent Night Chapel''' ('''Stille-Nacht-Kapelle''') is located in the town of [[Oberndorf bei Salzburg]] in the Austrian province of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], and is a monument to the Christmas carol ''[[Silent Night]]'' and its [[librettist]], [[Joseph Mohr]] and its [[composer]], [[Franz Xaver Gruber]]. It stands on the site of the former St Nicholas's Church, where on 24 December 1818 the Christmas carol was performed for the first time.

== History ==
[[File:Flood1899.jpg|thumb | upright = 1.7 | left | Flood of 1899]]
The church of [[St. Nicholas]] was damaged several times in the 1890s by flooding of the [[Salzach]] - especially by that of 1899, while the predominantly the district Altach destroyed a large part of the town and. This led to the conclusion that the whole of Oberndorf, including the parish church of St Nicholas, needed to be rebuilt about 800 m upstream.

Of refurbishment of damaged St. Nikola Church was apart for two reasons: On the one spared the costs and the threat of continued risk of flooding, on the other hand you wanted the church to accept the built in 1906, move less attractive church in the new town center. Thus, the old parish church was demolished in 1913 and only remembered a debris cone at the historical origin of the now-famous Christmas song far and wide.

[[File:Stnikola.jpg|thumb | Old St. Nicholas Church]]
The 100th anniversary of the song in December 1918 fell at a difficult time immediately after [[World War I]]. The more wanted to put the message of peace Mohr and Gruber, a monument to the citizens of Oberndorf. Adopted in 1924, but construction of a memorial chapel was under the difficult conditions (political and economic crises of the [[#Geschichte_Österreichs Erste_Republik_und_Austrofaschismus_.281918.E2.80.931938.29|First Republic]]) slowly in the phase of realization. Ultimately, the construction was completed on August 15, 1937 ([[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]). Meanwhile, the Memorial Chapel was the visible symbol of the song ''Silent Night''.

Every year, around the Memorial Chapel and Museum beside it, especially at [[Christmas]], there are thousands of visitors from around the world. On the 24th of December, every year by 17:00 (5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), a solemn memorial mass is held at the church, and the carol is sung in the many languages of the visitors and seen as a unifying experience. Since 2002, this celebration has been transmitted by means of the local webcam on the Internet.

== Design ==
The chapel is an [[octagon]] in form with a bell helmet and a lantern, and the portal has a [[hip roof|hipped roof]] canopy. The arched windows were created in 1935 by the Tyrolean Stained Glass. The high altar with a relief of the ''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' is by the sculptor Hermann Hutter, from 1915. The [[predella]]  (altar base) relief of ''[[The Adoration of the Magi]], [[The Crucifixion]], The Escape from Egypt'' is by the sculptor Max Domenig, from 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(German) Vollmer provides Silent Night chapel (December 19, 2011)|url=http://www.spur-g-blog.de/?p=3152|publisher=By [[Spur-G-Blog]]|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replicas ==
Replica models of the Silent Night Chapel exist in the Mini Mundus leisure park at [[Klagenfurt]] in [[Carinthia]] (1:25 scale) and the model park [[Mönichkirchen]] in Lower Austria. Furthermore, there is a 1:1 scale replica in [[Frankenmuth]] in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].

The '''Sons of Jacob Cemetery''' in rural [[Ramsey County, North Dakota]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2017.  It was the cemetery of the '''Garske Colony''', a farming community of Jewish immigrant homesteaders which was founded in 1883 and operated until about 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sojnorthdakota.org/#Garske Garske Colony]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish homesteaders came from Russia, where they were not allowed to own land, and tried to survive in harsh conditions in North Dakota.  Many built [[sod houses]] or tarpaper shacks to live in while attempting to prove their land claims for {{convert|160|acre|km2}} under the Homestead Act.

There once were nine rural Jewish cemeteries in North Dakota.  The cemetery of the largest Jewish farming community in the state, the [[Ashley Jewish Homesteaders Cemetery]], was listed on the National Register in May 2015.  The Garske one, the Ashley one, and one in Regan are the only three that are "not entirely overgrown" by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/jewish-homesteader-cemetery-added-to-national-register/article_2f589489-0635-59b8-85a7-92f982188c82.html |title=Jewish homesteader cemetery added to national register |author=Carolyn Grueskin |publisher=[[Bismarck Tribune]] |date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Augustine's Episcopal Church''' in [[Gary, Indiana]], is a historically black congregation and building in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Northern Indiana]]. The congregation was chartered in 1927, and the building, constructed in 1958, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2013 after being nominated for listing by a parishioner.&lt;ref name="wbez2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/blog/lee-bey/2012-03-25/gary-congregation-seeks-national-register-status-midcentury-modern-church-97|title=Gary congregation seeks National Register status for midcentury modern church|date=2012-03-28|author=Lee Bay|accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congregation==
The historically black parish was chartered in 1927 by thirty [[African American]] [[professionals]] as a [[Colored Episcopal Mission]]. St. Augustine's original home was at 19th and Adams in Gary's [[Midtown (Gary)|Midtown]] section in an old Roman Catholic Mission building. The first service in the congregation's new home was held on May 8, 1959.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000758.pdf|title=NRHP Nomination:St. Augustine's Episcopal Church|author=Paula M. DeBois|date=May 14, 2012|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the church struggled to hold regular services and maintain attendance. Only seventeen people attended the first service, and for the first decade of the congregation's existence, it was only able to attract part-time priests. In 1938 Episcopal Bishop [[Campbell Gray]] assigned Benedictine monks of [[St. Gregory's Abbey, Three Rivers]] to serve the struggling mission, and they remained with the church until 1946, two years after Gray's death. A retired rector named Rev. Langendorff headed the church for the next few years until in 1951 Rev. Wallace L. Wells, spouse of [[Henrietta Bell Wells]] and newly ordained, assumed leadership.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom"/&gt;

During the 1950s many African-Americans that moved to Gary did so as part of [[Second Great Migration (African American)|The Great Migration]], seeking employment opportunities that were kept from them in the South, and many of these newly relocated African-Americans joined St. Augustine's. With this influx, the congregation grew enough so that by 1955, the church was growing too large to remain in its rented Catholic Mission home. While inquiring about a [[pipe organ]] to use in services, the organ sales representative suggested the congregation ask [[Edward D. Dart]], now known as a prolific [[architect]], to design a new building for the congregation.&lt;ref name="modernbeauty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.preservationnation.org/2013/02/20/modern-beauty-in-gary-indiana-edward-dart-and-st-augustines-episcopal-church/|title=Modern Beauty in Gary, Indiana: Edward Dart and St. Augustine’s Episcopal Church|author=David Weible|date=2013-02-20|accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dart had designed many residential homes in suburban [[Chicago]] and had designed one other church in 1953 ([[St. Michael's Episcopal Church (Barrington, Illinois)|St. Michael's Episcopal Church]] in [[Barrington, Illinois]]) before St. Augustine's.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom"/&gt; Though having Dart design the building is significant in and of itself, the fact that the congregation was able to commission his services is even more significant since they were an [[African American]] congregation and Dart was white, a rare combination during [[Segregation in the United States|segregation]].&lt;ref name="wbez2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="modernbeauty"/&gt;

Dart was asked to design a building with a budget of $120,000, which the church was able to afford thanks to a $45,000 cash fund and a $20,000 grant from the [[National Council of Churches|National Council of the Protestant Church]]. Dart's initial design far exceeded this budget with large, ornate stained glass windows that cost $10,000 each, and the parish swiftly rejected it, preferring a more modest, minimalist design. Drawing upon this information, Dart produced a second custom design that was eventually agreed to by the congregation's leadership after discussions that lasted several years.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom"/&gt;

A new building was constructed from Dart's designs in 1958 at the corner of 19th and Ellsworth in the [[Tolleston]] section of Gary, and immediately attracted widespread recognition. In 1960 the building won awards from the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[Church Architectural Guild]]. Several magazines and newspapers including the [[Chicago Tribune]] ran articles about the building shortly after its completion due to its perceived architectural beauty, but few mentioned the fact that the congregation it housed was [[African American]]. Most of the pictures published about the building omitted any of the church's members.&lt;ref name="wbez2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="modernbeauty"/&gt;

St. Augustine's advanced to parish status in 1961, a full two years after the new building was completed.&lt;ref name="modernbeauty"/&gt;

==Building==
[[File:St. Augustine's Episcopal Church Interior.JPG|thumb|St. Augustine's Episcopal Church Interior]]
Designed by renowned [[Mid-Century Modern]] [[architect]] [[Edward D. Dart]], [[FAIA]] in 1958, the architecturally significant church garnered two architectural awards shortly after its construction. St. Augustine's successfully employs the use of [[Indiana limestone]], wood and [[stained glass]] clerestory [[window]]s. The building was the first of Dart's commissioned designs to be nominated to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; it was listed on September 18, 2013.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; At the time of the listing, St. Augustine's was Gary's only postwar modern church structure.&lt;ref name="wbez2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/blogs/lee-bey/2013-10/architecturally-daring-gary-church-earns-spot-national-register-109025|title=Architecturally-daring Gary church earns a spot on the National Register|author=Lee Bey|date=2013-10-29|accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was also given a $2,000 African American Heritage Grant from [[Indiana Landmarks]] to aid it in its preservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianalandmarks.org/newsphotos/pages/archivenews.aspx?newsid=809|title=Grant will aid preservation of Modernist church|date=2012-10-18|publisher=Indiana Landmarks|accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3514">The '''Vati-Con Scandal''' involved accusations that Italian real estate developer Raffaello Follieri misappropriated a $50 million investment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20080629/Inside+Story+Raffaello+Follieri "Inside Story: Raffaello Follieri"] (June 29, 2008) ''[[New York Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Bill Clinton]] and billionaire [[Ronald Burkle]] meant to buy [[Roman Catholic]] churches in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/030306/030306a.php "Catholic real estate bonanza"] (March 3, 2006) ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Follieri ultimately pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges in the U.S. and was sentenced to prison.

On July 15, 2008, Bishop [[Joseph Anthony Galante]] of the [[Diocese of Camden]], [[New Jersey]], was implicated in the scandal by a ''[[New York Post]]'' article titled "A Deal with the Devil" that revealed that Follieri had bought Galante's beach house for $400,000 in 2007 shortly after Galante began the study that resulted in his 2008 announcement to sell off half of the Diocese's church properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/07152008/news/regionalnews/a_deal_with_the_devil_119940.htm "A Deal with the Devil"] (July 18, 2008) ''[[New York Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Following disclosure of the bishop's involvement in Vati-Con, the Council of Parishes of Southern New Jersey demanded "a complete halt to the Bishop’s planned church closure program".{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Galante/Follieri beach house was put back on the market in 2008 and sold almost two years later for $310,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/749-W-Oak-Ave-North-Wildwood-NJ-08260/38359482_zpid/ Zillow.com 749 W Oak Ave., North Wildwood NJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2008, the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' reported that during a second raid of Follieri's apartment in New York City, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had confiscated the private journals of Follieri's former girlfriend, American film actress [[Anne Hathaway]], as part of their ongoing investigation into the scandal. Hathaway did not face any charges related to the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/07/24/2008-07-24_fbi_grabs_anne_hathaways_diaries.html "FBI Grabs Anne Hathaway's diaries"] (July 24, 2008) ''NY Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Follieri pleaded guilty in [[Manhattan]] to the charges, and [[United States federal judge|Federal Judge]] [[John G. Koeltl|John Koeltl]] imposed a 4½ year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesshollywood.com/anne-hathaways-ex-sentenced-to-54-months-in-prison_article_11841 "Anne Hathaway's Ex Sentenced To 54 Months In Prison"] (Oct. 23, 2008) Access Hollywood&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on May 25, 2012, from a federal prison in Pennsylvania.

'''William Leonard D'Mello''' (24 March 1931&amp;nbsp;– 19 July 2011) was the first [[Roman Catholic]] bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Karwar]], [[India]].

Born in [[Mangalore]] and ordained to the priesthood in 1957, D'Mello was named bishop of the Karwar Diocese in 1976 and retired in 2007.&lt;ref name="Joyson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bdmello.html |title=Bishop William Leonard D’Mello|publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
D'Mello was born on March 24, 1931, at Cascia, the third of six children born to Joseph and Santana D'Mello.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.daijiworld.com/viewNews.aspx?nid=108897|title=Former Bishop of Karwar William D'Mello Passes Away at 82|date=July 2011|work=[[Daijiworld Media]]|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop of Karwar==
On January 24, 1976, at 44 years of age, D'Mello was appointed Bishop of the newly-erected Diocese of Karwar by Pope [[Paul VI]]. His episcopal consecration took place only on April 29, 1977. Archbishop [[Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy]] served as Consecrator, assisted by Archbishop [[Packiam Arokiaswamy]] and Bishop [[Ignatius P. Lobo]].&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

One of D'Mello's key initiatives was promoting vocations to the priesthood and the religious life in his diocese. He encouraged young men to enter the seminary, and sought to bring more congregations of religious sisters into his new diocese.

==Retirement==
D'Mello submitted his resignation upon reaching the age of 75 as required by the [[Code of Canon Law]] and in February 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] accepted his resignation and appointed [[Derek Fernandes]] as his successor.

In retirement, he lived at the 'Sandhya Vandan'.  D'Mello died July 19, 2011, aged 80 and was buried in the Diocese of Karwar's Cathedral of the Assumption.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

'''Wojciech Michał Lemański''' (born September 22, 1960) is a Roman Catholic Polish priest. He is in conflict with his superior Archbishop [[Henryk Hoser]], who ordered him out of the parish for [[disobedience]] and failing to comply with some of the teachings of the Catholic Church.

First Mgr. Hoser banned Lemański from teaching religious studies in public schools. On July 7, 2013, he asked Lemański to leave the parish and move to a residence for retired priests, despite the fact he was only 52.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/world-news/detail/articolo/polonia-poland-chiesa-church-iglesia-26463/ Poland: Priest-bishop clash captures nation's attention], Vatican Insider, July 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another option was to be transferred to another parish, where he would serve as an auxiliary staff. Lemański did not agree with the decision and said that he would appeal against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbj.pl/article-63310-internal-conflict-in-polish-church-leads-to-a-popular-priest-resigning-from-his-post.html Internal conflict in Polish church leads to a popular priest resigning from his post], Warsaw Business Journal, July 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 he was made chaplain in an institution for mentally injured children, but two months later he was suspended from the priesthood.

== Critique of the Church ==
Lemański, ordained in 1987, has repeatedly criticised the church. He has accused the church leadership of not doing enough to oppose anti-Semitic tendencies among Poland's Catholics. Lemański himself is among a few Catholic priests who each year commemorate massacres of Jews at [[Treblinka extermination camp|the Treblinka camp]], where Jews, along with Poles and others, were gassed. He also recovered gravestones from abandoned and destroyed Jewish cemeteries, incorporating two of them into the main altar of his church. Some conservative Catholics said he was turning it into a [[synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/poland-catholic-church-jews_n_3688035.html Father Wojciech Lemanski's Dismissal Highlights Catholic Church's Uneasy Relation With Jews In Poland], HuffingtonPost.com, August 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemański has also criticized the establishment's lenient treatment of clerics accused of [[sexual abuse]] and its rejection of [[artificial insemination]] and [[contraceptive]]s.

== Suspension ==
[[Image:2014 Woodstock 109 Wojciech Lemański.jpg|thumb|Wojciech Lemański at the [[Przystanek Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] 2014]]
In July 2013, Lemański was suspended by the archbishop of Warsaw-Praga [[Henryk Hoser]]. On July 14, 2013, when three envoys dispatched by Hoser showed up at Lemanski's church in the town of [[Jasienica, Wołomin County|Jasienica]] near [[Warsaw]], they got surrounded by an angry crowd. The three clerics finally retreated after they were jeered at and booed. They barely managed to get into their car when the crowd began pushing the vehicle in the direction of Warsaw.

Lemański, who originally did not want to budge, later decided to resign, although he still considered the bishops' decision to be unfair. ''"Today you are pushing a car, but tomorrow you will flip it over or possibly even hurt somebody,"'' he told his parishioners. He then  left the parsonage saying he will wait for a decision from the Vatican regarding his dispute with the church hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/polish-priest-steps-down-after-clashes-with-catholic-church-a-911688.html Rebel Priest: Church's 'No. 1 Enemy' A Symbol of Polish Change], Spiegel International, July 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, front-page articles about the case appeared in the [[Newsweek Polska|Polish edition of Newsweek]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://polska.newsweek.pl/ostatnia-msza-w-jasienicy,106590,1,1.html Ostatnia msza w Jasienicy ''(The last mass in Jasienica)''], Newsweek Polska, 3. 8. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Gazeta Wyborcza]]. At the end of June 2014 archbishop Hoser changed his earlier decision and posted Lemański as a chaplain in an institution for mentally injured children. Lemański continued his activities, also took part in [[Przystanek Woodstock]] music festival. On August 22, 2014, he was suspended from being a priest altogether, the reason being a lack of regret over his deeds in the past and breaking the ban on talking to the media, imposed by the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvp.info/16535548/ksiadz-lemanski-suspendowany-arcybiskup-hoser-go-ukaral Ksiądz Lemański bez prawa do sutanny. Abp Hoser go ukarał], TVP info, 22. 8. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In 2008, Lemański received [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] from the hands of former Polish president [[Lech Kaczyński]] for keeping the memory of Polish Jews alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swidermajer.nazwa.pl/zo/ksleman.html Ks.
