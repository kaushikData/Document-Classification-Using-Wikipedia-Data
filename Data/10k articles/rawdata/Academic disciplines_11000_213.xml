&lt;/ref&gt;
) is an Argentina-born feminist and anti-trafficking activist. After a police raid at the brothel where she was being sexually exploited in 2012, she began advocating for the abolition of prostitution. She attracted media attention in Argentina when she sued her exploiters and the city where the brothel was located. She became known worldwide when the U.S. Department of State gave her an award for her anti-trafficking activism.

== Childhood and family ==
Kinan's family had enough money to provide her a good education, but her life began to spiral downhill when her father began to abuse her mother. Kinan has said that her mother, along with her grandmother and her aunts, were prostituted.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | dead-url=no | title=La historia de Alika Kinán, del trabajo sexual a la trata en primera persona | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731230249/http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | archive-date=2017-07-31 | date=2015-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described how her father used to tell stories after dinner about how he met her mother and how he rescued her from the ''zulo''.&lt;ref name="desprender"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso/ | title=Alika Kinan: "Estoy tratando de desprenderme del lugar de víctima. Es todo un proceso" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620210439/http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso | dead-url=no | archive-date=2017-06-20 | date=2015-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Zulo'' is a word with many meanings. In this context, it could mean either a small, wretched apartment, or a brothel.) Kinan was raped at age fourteen. Her parents separated when she was fifteen and her younger sister was nine, and her father stopped supporting the family.&lt;ref name="esclava"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428174854/http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-26 | title=Fui una esclava sexual durante 20 años y ahora busco justicia | archive-date=2015-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abandoned by parents, enters sex work ==
A year later Kinan's mother went to [[Buenos Aires]], leaving her to care for her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; (According to some sources, Kinan's mother took Kinan and her sister to [[Buenos Aires]] and Kinan later returned to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="incomoda"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-15 | title=Las incómodas verdades de Alika Kinan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204533/http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180  | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Kinan tried cooking and selling a local pastry but couldn't earn enough to support herself and her sister. Her father refused to help her.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Reportedly, he told her "You know what you have to do," implying that she should become a prostitute.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She worked for someone for three months but received no pay. A friend suggested working at Aries, a brothel run out of a private apartment.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

Kinan remembers her decision to enter sex work:

{{quote |text=My grandmother was a prostitute, my mom and my aunts too, it's like being in that situation seems natural. When my mom leaves I'm left in charge of my sister, who is a lot younger than me. There came a time when we did not have anything to eat, we had nowhere to live, it was an extreme situation, I was left with a small child and I was facing that situation. It was then that a girl makes me an offer in a place X, and tells me that we could go to a private apartment where they were hosting bachelor parties, it was like a massage place, it all seemed very strange. At that time I did not go, until the situation was so extreme that I was up to my neck and one day I found myself ringing the bell at the place that had been pointed out to me.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Kinan was seventeen at the time.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; She remembers her first client as being grotesquely fat and smelling like talcum powder.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She still remembers the odor:

{{quote |text=on the subject of the massages, there are those strange scents that stay with you for life. It's very disgusting. It's those memories that you try to bury under everything else.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

After that, she worked at bachelor parties and continued seeing individual clients. She received 40% of the clients' fees, which was enough to rent a place for her and her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While still underage, she attracted the attention of the police and spent more time hiding from them than servicing clients,&lt;ref name="aislada"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika Kinan esta aislada y declarara en Camara Gesell | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428184203/http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | archive-date=2017-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have reduced the amount of money she could earn to support herself and her sister. She says

{{quote |text=... when I was younger, I tried to avoid the police because there was a follow-up, a payment of fines, but I was still underage and if the police caught me it would be worse.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

At one point during this period, Kinan seems to have also been supporting her father. She says that he lived with her and asked her for money. He also threatened to get a lawyer and take her younger sister away from her.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

== Ushuaia ==
Up to this time, Kinan had been moving back and forth between [[Cruz del Eje]] and the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; Another woman recommended that she move to [[Ushuaia]], in [[Argentina]]'s [[Tierra del Fuego]] region.&lt;ref name="marea"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-24 | title=Contra viento y marea | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608172723/https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | archive-date=2016-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan was told that she would get many clients who paid well in dollars, and she could keep 50% of the clients fees, as opposed to the 40% that she kept in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].

{{ quote | text=She said to me "I was in the south, you earn very good money, there are fishing boats, many foreigners, you can charge in dollars, you earn double because you are paid best."  ... they gave you 40%, and so I went to Ushuaia where they did not deduct so much.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Different sources report her age at this time as fifteen,&lt;ref name="distinguida"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-03 | title=Alika Kinan, distinguida "Heroína" en Estados Unidos por su lucha contra la trata | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805105401/http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | archive-date=2017-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eighteen,&lt;ref name="honoree"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | dead-url=no | date=2017-06-29 | title=State Department Honoree Was Trapped In A Brothel For Nearly 20 Years | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703221203/http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | archive-date=2017-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nineteen&lt;ref name="sobrevivio"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas |dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10| title=Sobrevivió a la trata y es querellante contra sus proxenetas | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114132159/http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas | archive-date=2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or twenty.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She was born in 1976&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and went to [[Ushuaia]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; If she arrived before her birthday on 24 June, she would have been nineteen. If she arrived after her birthday, she would have been twenty. But in either case she was likely to be closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth. A plane ticket was sent to her and in [[Ushuaia]] she began work at a nightclub called Sheik where, as promised, she kept 50% of the clients' fees. After a while she rented a place and sent for her sister, paying for her school, English classes, computers, clothing, and food.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

(Various sources give the name of the nightclub as "El Sheikh", "El Sheik", "Sheikh", and "Sheik". Photographs of the nightclub show a sign saying "Sheik", so that is the name used in this article.)

== Marriage ==
According to Kinan's ex-husband, Miguel Pascual, they met in 1996, the same year she arrived in [[Ushuaia]]. She had already changed employers and was working at the nightclub Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="sola"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika no está sola: comienza el juicio en Tierra del Fuego | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109001257/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | archive-date=2016-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid her managers extra to spend extra time with her, but she wasn't informed&lt;ref name="denouncer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-03 | title=Argentina: Alika Kinan, from victim to denouncer of a trafficking network | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729225407/http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as she comments, "... obviously I did not see any of it."&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; Pascual served three yearlong tours of duty on a ship that supplied [[Spain]]'s Antarctic bases. He and Kinan saw each other during those three years when his boat docked in [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; He told her he wanted her to be his life partner.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; Kinan was apparently in danger at the time:

{{quote |text=People from Rio Grande had come looking for me with guns, I went with a boy a little bigger than I, who suggested that I go on vacation with him, he was very insistent and the truth that I had to run from here because at any moment some pimp with guns was going to create a bad situation ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In a different interview, she didn't mention the pimps with guns, but she indicated a similar degree of desperation:

{{ quote | text=The point is that this guy left a lot of money every time he came, always paid in dollars - it's the time of 1 to 1 [The Argentine peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar at one to one.] and I said that in order to leave that place I was going wherever he went. I was not in love. I submitted.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

So he took her on vacation in [[Barcelona]] where his family had businesses and drove Mercedes, and she ended up staying with him in Spain and bringing her sister over.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

In Kinan's description of the marriage, she worked at businesses owned by her husband's family. One source says that he collected half her wages,&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; another says that he collected all of her wages.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She wasn't allowed to use the car and was required to function as the maid. To support her sister, she secretly sold her eggs. (It must have been extremely difficult to hide this from her husband without a car.&lt;ref name="eggDonation"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation#The_egg_donor.27s_process_in_detail | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-01 | title=Egg donation - Wikipedia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127132005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation | archive-date=2017-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) She says her husband quickly became violent.

{{ quote | text=... I was faced with a violent guy, a family where violence was naturalized. I remember that the first time he hit me was the few months I went with him, and the first thing I did was tell the mother, because he had smashed the remote control in my face, and she asked me "but what did you do?" Then I realized I was to the oven. [An Argentine idiom indicating being in a bad situation from which there is no escape.]&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

A few days before the start of the trial, Pascual gave a very different description of their marriage, which he described as "hell from the first day." He claims that it was she who assaulted him, and that he defended himself without hitting her.

{{ quote | text=She tried to hit me two times, I am a master of martial arts, and both times I took her by the hair and back, and I put her on her knees ... Both times I immobilized her when she tried to hit me, but she never hit me.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Kinan says that at some point after the birth of their second child, her husband sent her to a brothel.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; Her husband denies the accusations of forced labor and forced prostitution.

{{ quote | text=At no time was she forced. She worked in Spain with my brother in a transport company. She has lied about me, about my mother saying that she forced her to work.

[The eldest daughter] was in Buenos Aires saying that her mother had been mistreated and forced into prostitution in Spain, and that never happened. I can give names of the companies in which she worked and I have a thousand witnesses.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Over nine years they had three children. According to Kinan, one night when the oldest was eight, she refused to do her homework and her father hit her hard enough to cause bleeding. Kinan decided that she needed to leave [[Spain]] and persuaded her husband to take them all back to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; According to her husband, Miguel Pascual, they moved to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] in [[Argentina]] in 2008, and separated in 2010. At that point he returned to Spain&lt;ref name="redito"&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-02 | title=Alika usa mis hijas para sacar redito economico | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106142803/http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | archive-date=2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kinan returned to [[Ushuaia]] and Sheik to support herself and her children.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

As with Kinan, there are some discrepancies in different versions of Pascual's story. At one point he said that he and Kinan separated, and he continued sending money for their daughters until he discovered that she had returned to sex work.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt; In another account he claimed to be present when she made the phone call to Sheik to ask about returning to sex work. In this telling, they separated because she was returning to sex work, and he later stopped sending money because she married another man whom she was supporting.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

== Brothel work ==
Following the police raid at the Black &amp; White nightclub/brothel, news outlets published information about the brothel's operations. Much of this information relates to aspects of brothel operation that aren't described in news reports describing Sheik. Kinan worked at Black &amp; White immediately before leaving for [[Spain]]. This section uses information about both Sheik and Black &amp; White to give a more complete picture of the working conditions that Kinan would have encountered.

Alika Kinan's experience at the two brothels were probably common for sex workers across the southern Cone area. Descriptions of brothels in two Chilean cities not far from [[Ushuaia]] and in [[Ushuaia]] itself closely match the business operations of Sheik and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="otherMenus"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-16 | title=Just Exploring Other Menus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729110434/http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus |archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information and employees seem to have moved more or less freely between the six brothels of [[Ushuaia]], which were located within a few blocks of each other.&lt;ref name="commercialized"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-19 | title=Commercialized sexual activity  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233852/http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | archive-date=2017-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When many of [[Ushuaia]]'s sex workers migrated to [[Punto Arenas]] in [[Chile]] after the police raids shut down the brothels in [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; it was a one-time group migration, but it probably followed a path previously forged by individual sex workers moving between the two cities. No two businesses operate in exactly the same way, but these two brothels can be taken as a rough proxy for legally regulated brothels in [[Patagonia]].

=== Management ===
==== Sheik ====
The primary manager at Sheik was Pedro Montoya, who was involved with the brothel throughout its existence. During an earlier period, his co-manager was his wife Claudia Quiroga, who owned the property where the brothel was located. The on-site supervisor under Quiroga was Corina Sánchez.

At the time of the police raid, Quiroga and Sánchez were no longer involved. The co-manager was Montoya's girlfriend Ivana Claudia García, and the on-site supervisor was Lucy Alberca Campos. García's brother Jorge Etcheverry worked as a recruiter for the brothel.

During the trial, Kinan described how the managers used surveillance cameras to monitor the women:

{{ quote | They ordered us where to position ourselves, how we should sit, because Claudia operated the cameras wherever you were. When the phone rang you knew it was Claudia who was watching who was coming in, who had to get on the phone, if you were standing, if you had gone to the bathroom a lot, because they monitored even the times you went to the bathroom. Everything was monitored.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

One woman was described by the managers as "like the fish, you use everything but the head."&lt;ref name="chicas"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Chicas pobres y vulnerables, las víctimas del negocio de la trata en Ushuaia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729214706/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Equivalent to the American expression "butterface" or the Australian expression "prawn.") This was cited at the trial as an example of the managers' contempt toward the women.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; At the trial, one of the police witnesses said that the managers mislead the women in order to recruit them, and then belittled them for their poverty and poor education.&lt;ref name="finalizo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10 | title=Finalizó la tercera jornada de juicio con la declaración de una de las mujeres rescatadas del Sheik | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803130104/http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | archive-date=2017-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan remembers the following scene:

{{ quote | text=Even the female owner, the girlfriend of the trafficker always told me that she was going to teach me how to work, then she would knock me against the bar and say "give it to me, baby, bring me money, give it to me" and hit the bar hard. I remember that I jumped a few leaps ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On the other hand, Kinan felt that the managers were

{{ quote | text=The family I had never had, the one that never cared for me, I said that they took care of me, gave me housing. That's why I made the decision to return. I thought that corresponded because I had to be working and these people gave me housing, they cared for me, because if something happened, I cut a finger or had to go to the doctor they accompanied me ... they took care that I did not spread disease, that I did not catch any infection, I did not catch the flu. When the snowy season began, they would tell me to go get the vaccine or take something so I would not get sick.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

As Kinan points out, it was good business to keep workers healthy and productive. The feeling that the managers were her family is not surprising, given that between the age of sixteen, when she was left to support herself and her sister, and the age of thirty six, when the police raided Sheik, the brothels of [[Ushuaia]] and her husband were the only ones who concerned themselves about her health, housing, and financial support.

==== Black &amp; White ====
The primary manager at Black &amp; White was Victor Morales, nicknamed "Jefe". His daughter seems to have been second in command. Other people involved in some sort of managerial capacity included his ex-wife, his current girlfriend, and his son.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Sheik, Black and White had security cameras. One woman was so unnerved by their presence that she left shortly after arrival.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Workers ===
==== Sheik ====
There were seven women working at Sheik at the time of the police raid, three from the Dominican Republic, one from Paraguay, and three from Argentina.&lt;ref name="operativo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2012/10/operativo-de-gendarmeria-en-el-sheik.html | dead-url=no | date=2012-10-09 | title=Operativo de Gendarmeria en El Sheik | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115023424/http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2012/10/operativo-de-gendarmeria-en-el-sheik.html | archive-date=2015-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were supporting children with no assistance from the fathers. Most of them hadn't finished formal basic education and had no good alternatives to sex work.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; One of the women had only the clothes she was wearing when she moved to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
Black &amp; White's web site promised twenty-five women. During the police investigation the number of women employed varied from twelve to twenty. At the time of the raid it employed eighteen women. The majority of them were from the Dominican Republic,

Most of them were in their twenties. A woman who was thirty eight said that Morales was initially reluctant to hire her because of her age.

Among the women who were described, one had left home and was struggling to support herself, one had debts, and two had been doing sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]] and came to [[Ushuaia]] for the job. One of the women was mentally ill and her condition prompted the police to end the investigation and raid the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women interviewed by the prosecutors during the Black &amp; White investigation testified that she had been seventeen years old when Morales recruited her. She said that he brought her to [[Ushuaia]] along with two other underage girls. When they arrived at the house they would live in, they found other employees of the brothel who were also underage.

However, at the time of the police raid, all of the women employed by the brothel were legally adults.

=== Government involvement in the brothels ===
When a sex worker first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], she would first be taken to the police station where the provincial police would take her finger prints,
&lt;ref name="fallo"&gt;

open a file on her, and ensure that she had no criminal record.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; The city government then set up a health book that recorded her medical examinations.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The city of [[Ushuaia]] required the women to undergo regular examinations, involving tests for HIV and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and analysis of vaginal discharges.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; There were no examinations at Sheik during the period of police surveillance. The women were probably relieved; a witness at the trial testified that the inspectors mocked and humiliated the women they were examining.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that there were two to three inspections per month,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; and listed inspections to confirm that the business permits were in order, that there was a fire extinguisher, and that the entertainers had their sanitary pads.
&lt;ref name="socio"&gt;

The city continued the police registration and medical inspections of women in the local brothels after the time Argentina's anti-trafficking law was passed in 2008 (see the article [[Human trafficking in Argentina]]) until the first brothel raids in 2012. In addition, one source says that the city charged for inspections and the renewal of a woman's health book,&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; which occurred quarterly.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

This matches a historical pattern in [[Argentina]]'s [[Patagonia]] region. Municipal governments, strongly influenced by local businessmen, wanted to use their powers of regulation to maintain their tax bases and were opposed to too much interference in the brothel business. The provincial police had other funding sources and wanted to restrict brothel activities in unprofitable ways. The municipal government of Rio Gallegos was founded in 1912, and by 1914 there was already conflict between the city and the police of Santa Cruz province over the regulation of brothels.
&lt;ref name="rioGallegos"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Ushuaia]], the conflict was between the municipal government and the federal justice system. About the same time as the police raid on Sheik, the city council of [[Ushuaia]] was advised that it should pass a law closing the remaining nightclubs.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

=== Recruitment ===
==== Sheik ====
None of the women working at Sheik were from [[Ushuaia]]. Some came from elsewhere in Argentina and some came from other countries.&lt;ref name="dia03"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-3 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Juicio de Alika.

Pedro Montoya, the owner, testified that all the women came from other brothels, either in [[Ushuaia]] or elsewhere.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Kinan herself worked at two brothels in [[Ushuaia]]. Montoya said that he got calls from women asking to work at Sheik.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Montoya and his girlfriend and business partner Ivana Claudia García were responsible for recruitment, but García seems to have done most of the recruiting with help from her brother, whose sole function at the nightclub was recruiter.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | title=Tiene fecha el juicio oral de un emblemático caso de trata | dead-url=no |date=2016-09-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728144115/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | archive-date=2017-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
Women were recruited from various provinces, including [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], as well as from outside the country. Between 2009 and 2012, Victor Morales published more than 100 ads in [[Buenos Aires]] newspapers.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Two of the ads running in the newspaper Clarin offered waitresses 20,000 pesos per month, and dancers 10,000 pesos per month. Both offered travel expenses to [[Ushuaia]], lodging, and relocation expenses.
&lt;ref name="rescataron"&gt;
{{cite news 
| title= Rescataron a 15 mujeres de una red de trata en Ushuaia

| archive-date= 2017-07-30 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The women who were recruited with these ads discovered that once they had arrived at [[Ushuaia]], they were expected to repay the travel costs. Morales was more honest with a sex worker he recruited through an ad and told her during their initial contact that she would repay him with the money from her sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; One of the sources who saw transcripts of the police wire taps put it this way:

{{ quote | text= According to the degree of naivety of the person who needed the job, [Morales] revealed more or less data.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

While this approach may have helped persuade more women to travel to [[Ushuaia]], it also meant that some left as soon as they arrived.

Police telephone taps recorded the following conversation:

{{ quote | text=Nancy: Clearly, and the work is?

Victor: Well the work you mix with the public, you are not forced to prostitute yourself if you don't want, that is what you choose, when and how, yes? And the price, at least I put a price that from there up, you can charge more or equal, but not less, that are three hundred pesos fifteen minutes, four hundred the half hour, and five hundred an hour, and then the part, Let's say that it closes to me, that it serves me, the others let's say is a consequence, if you want to do it, you do and if you do not want to do it you do not do it, those are the services yes, but the drinks cost one hundred ...&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

Morales wasn't telling her that both the city and provincial governments would label her a prostitute, the provincial police would fingerprint her, check her criminal record, and open a file on her, or that the city would periodically inspect her genitals, test her for STIs, and maintain a record of the results.

A women who had worked as a professional dancer answered one of Morales' ads for dancers. While Morales explains about selling drinks to "Nancy" in the transcript above, the dancer didn't learn about it until her first night in the nightclub. That was also when she learned that she was expected to make herself available for sexual sessions with the clients. When she objected to working in a brothel, one of the female managers slapped her and fined her four hundred pesos for talking back. She said that one night she hid in a bathroom and the managers beat her and forced her back to the bar.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

In contrast, eleven of the eighteen women at the brothel when the police raided it told investigators that they were there by their own choice. They didn't feel that they had been tricked or that they were being exploited.&lt;ref name="prueba"/&gt;

Over a period of two years, the city of [[Ushuaia]] issued seventy health books to Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since each health book represents a new employee, the nightclub was recruiting about three new employees every month. Assuming that the nightclub employed an average of eighteen women over that two year time period, the average period of employment would be about six months. Once the nightclub hired a woman, it would need to recruit her replacement six months later.

In addition to ads, women were recruited through informal networks. One woman contacted Morales through a friend. Another was recruited through contacts at Madaho's, a well known bar (strip joint

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
) in the [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Living conditions ===
==== Sheik ====
During the trial, lawyers for the [[complainant]] described the women living in rooms off the main hall of the nightclub,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; which they described as small, dirty, bad smelling, and visited by rats. Kinan described their quarters as a ''zulo'' (a cramped, impoverished living space) lacking hot water, with 2 people sharing a room.&lt;ref name="derogar"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm# | dead-url=no | date=2017-03-26 | title=Kinan: "Hay que derogar los códigos de contravención" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326165843/http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm | archive-date=2017-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a bell in the area of the rooms activated at the bar which was rung to signal to the woman that a client had entered the nightclub.&lt;ref name="conocera"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-08 | title=Alika Kinan: el 29 de noviembre se conocerá la sentencia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802011922/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia/ | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each room had its own entrance separate from the nightclub's main entrance and each of the women had their own key.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

Prior to the raid on Black &amp; White, the women serviced their clients in their rooms. Testimony at the trial described them using bleach to remove blood and semen stains from their mattresses.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; In addition to sharing a room with a coworker, each woman was also bringing clients into her room an average of two to three times a night. (See Money section.) With two women in a room, that would be a minimum of four client visits per room per night. There wouldn't have been much privacy.

A post on a monger board made in 2006 says that Sheik had four bedrooms, which matches with other testimony. However, the post says that Sheik had eighteen women working there at the time.
&lt;ref name="ushuaiaLists"&gt;{{cite web

 |df           = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If they were all living at the brothel, that would be four women in each of two rooms and five women in each of the other two, with a corresponding number of client visits to each room every night. Even if some of the women were living and servicing their clients off-site, it would have been pretty crowded.

==== Black &amp; White ====
Unlike Sheik, the women at Black &amp; White lived off-site. They shared a house with coworkers and paid 300 pesos rent per month.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; Rent for one room in [[Ushuaia]] can go as high as 15,000 pesos per month,&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; so the rent charged by Black &amp; White was not unreasonable for shared living space. The nightclub had two rooms where the women and their clients had their sessions,&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; so the women weren't bringing clients into their living space.

While the women at Sheik had keys to their living quarters, one witness reported being barred from leaving the house where Black &amp; White's employees lived. She said that there were three men who lived in the house who transported them between the house and the nightclub. When she wanted to walk out of the house onto the street in order to have a phone conversation with relatives without house mates around, the men prevented her from leaving.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt;

In contrast, Kinan was working at Black &amp; White during all but a few months of the first three years she lived in [[Ushuaia]]. During this period she rented a place for her sister to live in, which suggests that she was free to travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; The dancer who objected to being tricked into working at a brothel sometimes left the house on her own and was allowed to use a computer with Internet access.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

One of the women was mentally ill, and the prosecutors said that she was imprisoned. From the prosecutors statements, it's impossible to tell if the brothel recruited her inadvertently and didn't know how to care for her properly while they figured out how to get rid of her, or if they were taking advantage of her illness in some way.

=== Interaction with clients ===
==== Sheik ====
The city is far enough south that during the summer there is daylight twenty four hours a day. The premises opened at 8 pm.&lt;ref name="sinFin" /&gt; The police testimony at the trial described women arriving at the nightclub from the living quarters.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; The women were required to be on duty from 11 pm to 6 am, and received one day off each week.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; (In one interview, Kinan said that the work shift started at 11:30 pm.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;) However, Kinan testified that shifts could extend to 8 am or even 2 pm.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; There was a listing near the bar with prices for drinks and women. The women were available for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; Police witnesses said that men started arriving at the nightclub around midnight, and women would leave with the men, returning alone.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When a customer left the nightclub with a woman, he had to pay the nightclub the price of a cup or half a cup, depending on how long the woman was going to be gone. (The nightclub paid 20 pesos for a drink and charged the customers 150 pesos, which the owner himself described as "cheating the customers".)&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

When the women first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], the nightclub seems to have given them names to use while working. Kinan was given the name "Carla".&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The women wore shorts or dresses while working, with tops, exaggerated high heels, and carefully styled hair. Clothing was brightly colored. Police officers described the clothing as scanty and less than is normally worn in a pub.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; (This may be an exaggeration. The [https://www.diomedia.com/stock-photo-prostitutes-in-ushuaia-argentina-image8281289.html two sex workers in a photo taken at the Black &amp; White Club] in [[Ushuaia]] look like any two women at a bar.)

Women were not allowed to wear the same clothes two days in a row and were required to smell like imported perfume. According to the owner Montoya, they were to be "fine whores".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nightclub Black &amp; White had been raided about six months before the police raid at Sheik. Prior to the raid at Black &amp; White, the women at Sheik had serviced their clients in the rooms where they lived. After the raid at Black &amp; White, the women and their clients left Sheik and either went to the client's home or to a hotel room.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Women who were menstruating were required to stanch the flow with a sponge to avoid getting the client dirty.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Kinan described her clients as

{{ quote | text=politicians, municipal officials, government officials, even a commissioner would come and get me. Also those of fishing vessels and foreign tourists. And those who were going to ski that left the women in the hotels.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

Until the raids, ''quecos'', or tours of the brothels, were an accepted male pastime.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ushuaiaLists"/&gt;

Women could be fined for refusing a client, for client complaints, or "delaying too much" with a client (i.e. going over the allotted time).&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; For poor single women supporting children, the fines were coercive. If a woman tried to avoid a fine by accepting a client with a bad reputation and showed displeasure during an abusive session, she could end up earning less if the client complained and she was fined. The women's ability to manage or negotiate client behavior was considerably reduced. Even the fine for "delaying too much" placed her at the client's mercy. Kinan describes the result:

{{ quote | text=... you find yourself with a crazy boy, a healthy son of the patriarchy, who breaks your ass, who leaves the vagina hanging, with everything that indicates an aggressive sexual act ... I could not handle them when they removed the condom, they would put me on all fours and they would break me. There are no women with rights inside a brothel.
&lt;ref name="extrema"&gt;

| archive-date= 2017-07-28 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The nightclub had installed bells in the women's rooms that they could ring if they needed help, for example if a client became violent. However, Kinan testified that often no one would come, the excuse being that the manager was busy with customers.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In addition, women were expected to encourage clients to buy them the nightclub's overpriced drinks. The constant consumption of alcohol further reduced the women's ability to handle badly behaved clients. Kinan tells the following story, which illustrates the combined effects of coercive fines, too much alcohol, and managerial indifference:

{{ quote | text=One day I was smoking a cigarette and I see one of the girls, very young, Correntina, 18, who goes with an old man we already knew was terrible, a degenerate. Then I tell the manager not to let her go with that degenerate because she was very little. And he says, "Well, well, you're going to work." I say "poor girl," but I finished my cigarette and left, but then I see that he starts asking for the Fresita champagne, and takes seven in a period of an hour and a half, got drunk, a terrible state. I am very motherly, I always tried to take care of my companions, then I see that he is going to ask for the keys of the room where they had sex, and I tell the manager not to give them to him. But he leaves and I continue with what I was doing, I am preoccupied with my own work and I forget, it wasn't my job to monitor her, nor to take care of her, I had to take care of myself, for that there were the managers and so on. Then it was like five o'clock in the morning and the little girl appeared crying, she was still very drunk, and she says "he took me without a condom", and she tells me that she had fallen asleep from her drunkenness and he had raped her, I didn't know if there were one, five, or how many they had put into the room, and the manager only told her to take a bath in order to go to the hospital to ask for the pill the day after. And nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything, everything was covered because he was a customer and customers had to be taken care of.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In at least one instance, the managers punished a women who used a bottle to defend herself against four clients who wanted to rape her. The information source doesn't say what the punishment was, only that it lasted a month. Her offense was failing to serve the clients well.
&lt;ref name="juicio"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of condoms, if a client was too forceful during penetration and tore one, the women got a syringe full of vinegar in the vagina.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt;

In regard to her experience with violent clients, Kinan says:

{{ quote | text= I have fought, my whole mouth is broken, because I fought to survive, with guys, with girls, guys might have paid me for a hotel and then they wanted to get me the same money they had given me because I do not know they did not like me, or they took too long and I had to go because I had to respond to a house, before the traffickers. [She had to return to the brothel.] Then they told me that they did not pay me anything or that I stayed until they told me. You have to endure rapes, consented or not, it is still a rape, if you are about to [be killed] you have to consent to a rape.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

==== Black &amp; White ====
The brothel operated from midnight to 6 am. According to an employee, the nightclub had the same clients found at Sheik: "... policemen, high-ranking officials, gendarmes and municipal personnel."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; The fines were similar to the fines imposed at Sheik, and a client complaint or a session that went over its allotted time could cost a woman over half of her share of the earnings from the session.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Alcohol and drugs ===
{{ quote | text=Alcohol and drugs were good options to be able to make this situation more bearable.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

... we were forced to consume alcohol, we had to drink a lot, we used drugs to resist the long nights.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; }}

Aside from numbing effects of alcohol, the women were being paid to sell and consume drinks. The drinks the women persuaded the men to buy were an important source of income for both the women and the brothel. When a woman approached a potential client, she would tell him to buy her a drink.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; If a women averaged two to three sessions per night (see Money section), that suggests that a woman's clients bought her at least two drinks on the average night. Since she was getting a share of the earnings from the drinks, it was in her interest, financially if not in terms of health, to persuade clients to buy her more. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, drinking more than three drinks per night or seven drinks per week is high-risk drinking for a woman.
&lt;ref name="highRiskDrinking"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brothels didn't sell drugs as part of their business, but they were present. They show up in Kinan's interviews as part of the environment she worked in. If a client paid for an hour with a woman and wanted her to do a line of coke with him, the ever-present threat of fines and the pressure to keep the client happy would have made it hard to refuse. Stimulants would also counter the effects of alcohol and help the woman stay alert enough to continue working into the morning.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

=== Money ===
==== Sheik ====
Police officers who entered Sheik undercover said that women would approach the clients and tell them to buy them a drink, which was paid for at the bar.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When the women and their clients conducted their sessions at a hotel, payment for the room was made at the bar.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; However, the women seem to have collected the payment for their services directly from the clients and paid the nightclub's share to the manager.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; As mentioned in the Ushuaia section above, the women turned half of the money over to the nightclub.

The nightclub kept all the money for the first five drinks a woman persuaded customers to buy in one night, and then split the proceeds with the woman for all successive drinks. Kinan said that an average night for one woman was eighteen drinks and eight sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; (The Black &amp; White section below gives an estimate of two to three clients per night.) Given the high price of the drinks, the women's share of the proceeds from their sale was probably an important source of income for them.

Reportedly, they were forced to buy clothes, shoes, jewelery, perfumes and condoms from the nightclub. Women were fined for taking too long to come when the bell was rung, for not cleaning, for taking longer than the client paid for, for taking a day off, for refusing to have sex with a client, and for a number of other offences.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

Kinan described how the managers maintained the ''libro de pases''. In the brothel trade, a ''pase'' is a session in which a prostitute provides sexual services to a client. A ''libro de pases'' is basically a log of the brothel's business activities.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
The recruitment pitch quoted above gives minimum prices for sessions of between 300 and 500 pesos, depending on the time involved. Actual prices were between 600 and 800 pesos. The women kept 60% to 70% of the fee. Black &amp; White had the same system of fines as Sheik, with fines for being late, not cleaning, and going over the time the client had paid for, and so on. Most fines were around 300 pesos. The women where charged 400 pesos for each of the city's health inspections.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; The brothel transported women to [[Ushuaia]] by buying their airline tickets, and the women paid the brothel back from their earnings.

According to the testimony of the managers, each women generated 900 pesos a night in earnings for the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since the brothel was keeping 30% to 40% of the client fees, and the women were charging between 600 and 800 pesos, and the brothel was earning money from the drinks the women sold, then the women were probably averaging two to three men per night, less than half of Kinan's estimate. That would have made traffic through the two brothel bedrooms a lot more manageable.

When the nightclub was raided, none of the women had more than fifteen pesos with them. Their earnings were held by the Morales family, "for safety."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; If they didn't have access to a bank, the house where they lived and where they had no control over who their house mates were was probably not a secure place to keep large sums of cash. Banking with the Morales family was probably more secure than cash under the mattress.

=== Credit and debt bondage ===
Claudia Quiroga, who managed Sheik at an earlier time, paid for the airline tickets that brought the women to [[Ushuaia]], bought clothes, paid for lodging, and the women paid her back from their earnings. Kinan described this as credit extended from Quiroga personally,&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; and the owner testified at his trial that the manager at the time of the police raid paid for the women's airplane tickets out of her salary.&lt;ref name="dia04"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-11 | title=Juicio de Alika. Día 4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807045002/http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4/ | archive-date=2017-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, the women would have repaid the manager and not the nightclub. This seems to show the managers personally making loans to the sex workers. On the other hand, the managers who made loans were part owners, and there may have been no clear line between their money and the nightclub's money.

At least some of the women who worked at Sheik arrived in such a state of poverty that the nightclub or its managers had to extend credit for the airplane fare, clothes for the women to wear while working, and housing. The employees would not have been able to work at Sheik and the nightclub would not have been able to recruit and keep employees without making loans to them.

Kinan has said "Every time we said we wanted to leave, we were told that we could not because we had debts,"&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; which suggests that employees were bound to the nightclub by [[debt bondage]]. Furthermore, the nightclub held the women's documentation,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; which may have made it difficult to travel or leave the nightclub. However, Kinan was working at the Black &amp; White in 1996, which means she changed employer just a few months after she started working at Sheik.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; Without an accounting of the women's debts and a record of their movement between employers and into and out of the city, it's impossible to know how bound to their employers the women were.

[[Debt bondage]] usually involves high interest rates, which sometimes cause the debt to grow faster than it can be paid off. However, none of the available information on loans made to Sheik's employees mention interest. That, plus the personal nature of the loans, suggests that the nightclub wasn't making money off the loans. On the other hand, it's entirely possible that managers tried to stop women from leaving before they had repaid loans owed to the managers personally.

The many and intrusive fines could have been a cause of debt bondage. If the fines were levied often enough they could have caused the women's debts to grow faster than they could pay them off. But again, the women seemed to move between brothels on their own initiative. The fines seemed to be more effective as a means of control while the women were employed than as a means of keeping them from leaving employment.

When Kinan first arrived in [[Ushuaia]], the city was at the end of a manufacturing boom. Factory wages in [[Ushuaia]] were twice as high as they were in [[Buenos Aires]]. [[Baumol's cost disease]] indicates that service wages, including sex work wages, would also be doubled. But the cost of living was three times as high, meaning that both factory and service workers were earning less in real terms.&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | dead-url=no | date=1995-07-02 | title=Trouble in world's southernmost city | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729131819/http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During both periods that Kinan was working in [[Ushuaia]] as a sex worker, the cost of living was higher than more northern parts of Argentina. Anyone moving there for higher wages would discover that they were having trouble retaining the extra money they were earning. When the women at Sheik complained about not being able to hold on to a single peso, their complaints may have been due as much to the cost of living as to the fines and costs the brothel was imposing on them.

=== Children ===
{{ quote | text=I arranged for my daughters to be cared for away from me, so that they would not see the mother they had.

[After the raid] all I wanted was to be with my daughters&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Aside from feelings of shame, it simply would not have been possible to raise children in the brothel. The shared living spaces, the presence of clients and the sexual services provided in the living spaces, the working hours that extended to 6 am or later, and the sale of alcohol all ruled out the presence of children.

All of the women were mothers and all of them were living apart from their children. When Kinan's life was turned upside down by the police raid, her first impulse was to return to her children. A full understanding the situation of Kinan and her coworkers would require an accounting of child care costs, knowing who provided child care and on what terms, and the complex of contradictory feelings they had toward their job and their children. That information isn't available.

=== Leaving employment ===
==== Sheik ====
As mentioned in the Recruitment section, sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] were recruited from all over Latin America, and Sheik itself had at least one recruiter. None of the available sources talk about leaving employment, but the presence of a recruiter shows that recruitment required more effort than the managers could devote to it on their own. Sheik employed only seven women and wasn't expanding its workforce, which indicates that women were leaving as fast as they were being recruited. As the city of the world closest to Antarctica, [[Ushuaia]] is isolated, has a harsh climate, and a small population. It doesn't attract a lot of people, making it necessary for the brothels to recruit from many countries to replace women leaving the city.

According to Kinan, women who behaved badly passed to other businesses where working conditions were worse.&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that he had had problems with Kinan and another woman and had intended to fire them.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; However, he never did, which suggests that he would have had trouble replacing them.

As mentioned above, Kinan changed employers once and left the brothel to move to [[Spain]]. The owner of Sheik reported hiring from other brothels and getting phone calls from women who wanted to work for him. If the constant debts and the withholding of documentation were intended to bind the workers to their employers, the measures weren't entirely successful.

==== Black &amp; White ====
If, as indicated in the Recruitment section above, Black &amp; White was recruiting three new employees every month, then it was also losing three employees every month. Women were leaving six months after they were hired. Victor Morales' less-than-honest recruitment pitch resulted in some women leaving as soon as they arrived. The woman who was unnerved by the security cameras simply lifted the chain and walked out the door.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One might imagine that the women who stayed would be the ones who had previous experience with sex work and were used to the work, but that's not necessarily the case. The two sex workers recruited from [[Rosario]] left at the first opportunity.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women taken into custody during the raid was about to be transferred to another province because "she was a problem for the owner," according to one of her coworkers.
&lt;ref name="saltena"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another woman was told that she was going to be sent to [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt; There's no mention of anyone actually being sent to another location, so these may have been empty threats made in an attempt to control someone's behavior.

While employed, the women didn't have possession of their earnings, which were held by the Morales family.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; This gave the managers an obvious way of collecting debts, provided the debt wasn't larger than the money the family held. In theory, the managers could have tried to prevent women from leaving the brothel by threatening to withhold their earnings, but none of the women appear to have complained about this happening. The fact that the cycle of recruitment and exit was so routine suggests that their exits were usually mutually agreed upon and the women left with their money.

The brothel held the identification documents of its employees. Almost all of them were at the bar in the nightclub, although a few were held in the owner's home.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Getting a certificate of loss of documentation from the police is a matter of routine. The government of Argentina currently promises to provide replacement DNI cards within fifteen days of receiving an application. In the days of the ''libreta'' it reportedly could be done in a week to six weeks if there were no problems. Someone leaving the brothel and leaving their ID booklet behind could probably get a replacement.

The underage immigrant sex worker mentioned earlier that Morales recruited to work at the brothel doesn't seem to have been bound to the brothel when the managers held her documentation. When Morales recruited her, she was a seventeen year old immigrant from Paraguay who had been doing sex work prior to meeting him. She worked for him for two and a half years before leaving and making her way back to [[Buenos Aires]]. Several months after returning to [[Buenos Aires]] and just shortly before the police raid on Black &amp; White, Morales showed up on her doorstep asking her to come back to the brothel.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; She was clearly an employee that Morales wanted to keep, but either he returned her documentation when she wanted to leave, or lack of documentation didn't stop her from leaving and traveling across the country. If she returned to [[Buenos Aires]] without documentation, she either had it replaced or managed without it.

At both Sheik and Black &amp; White, fines, debt, and confiscating ID documentation may have helped managers control employee behavior, but they don't seem to have been particularly effective in preventing women from leaving. The ones that stayed the longest seemed to be the ones that had the worst job prospects. Alika Kinan and the Paraguayan immigrant both started sex work at seventeen because they couldn't support themselves any other way. Both came to [[Ushuaia]] in search of better paid sex work. Both left after working in the brothels for roughly three years. Kinan returned after eleven years of marriage left her with three children and no better job prospects. Length of employment seems to have had more to do with poverty and lack of alternative jobs than anything else.

=== Self-image ===
Immediately after the police raid at Sheik, all of the women denied being victims of trafficking and stated that they were sex workers who had been hired to do sex work.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt; Two of them, Alika Kinan and another woman who has not been publicly identified, changed their minds and testified as victims during the trial, which occurred four years after the raid.

Kinan described herself and her coworkers at the time of the police raid:

{{ quote | text=We felt like criminals.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

When the rescue occurs I deny that I am a victim of trafficking, I said that I was not a victim and that I wanted to leave. I had just been taken from where I was and was my only source of income. At that time I had four daughters and I wanted to run and look for them and I felt guilty, I felt that I had committed a crime ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On her work:

{{ quote | text=The concept I had was that the bitch is the one who goes to bed with someone and does not charge, so I'm a prostitute because I lie down and I charge, inside everything I was proud of that.

I always considered myself a fighter, who did whatever it took to support her family or my sister at that time or my daughters afterwards.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Her rejection of victimization at the time of the raid:

{{ quote | text=How I was going to be victim, with the lioness and fighter that I was!&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

On the brothels:

{{ quote | text=the cabarets and the ''whiskerías'' burn your hands [Working at the brothels was like pressing your hands against something hot enough to burn them.]&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;

But I never wanted to be there. You do not choose it, you don't say "I want to do this the rest of my days."&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

On the health inspections:

{{ quote | text=We were thought of as food undergoing a food safety inspection.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt; }}

The effect of spending five hours in court describing life in the brothel:

{{ quote | text=When I testified, I realized that my life was shit.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt; }}

== Victim ==
In October 2012 Argentinian authorities raided Sheik.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Kinan and six other people retained were determined by the prosecuting authorities to be trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="denouncer" /&gt; This made her angry, but she gradually came to agree. She says that the thing that led her to change her mind was a question from the prosecutor's secretary:

{{ quote | text=If you analyze your history, that of your mother, that of your grandmother, that of your aunts, what do you think Is it going to be the destiny of your daughters?&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

This was followed by what she describes as a long, agonizing process of self-reflection.

{{ quote | text= The first year is terrible, it is a process of denial, you can not believe everything that is happening to you, you are trying to reconcile at a family level, a series of things, and it is not easy.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

The city of [[Ushuaia]] supplied her with housing for one month and twenty days.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The house had been declared uninhabitable by the Ministry of Social Development several months previously.

At one point Kinan says her family almost died from fumes from a faulty water heater. The authorities response was to shut off the gas, leaving them without heating.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; (Mean temperature in [[Ushuaia]] in the warmest month of the year is below 50&amp;nbsp;°F.) When the city tried to evict her at the end of the term,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; she turned to the María de los Angeles Foundation (founded by the mother of [[Marita Verón]]) for help, and the foundation's lawyers informed her that she was entitled to decent housing, work, subsidies, and to be reinserted into society.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; Kinan said:

{{ quote | text=I go back to the prosecution and I tell them that I was pressured to recognize myself as a victim and that now nobody wanted to represent me, that I had no psychologist and was in a house without heating. They destroyed me, made me recognize something that I never wanted to recognize, and when I recognize it, it turns out that I do not have the rights.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Through the intervention of governor Fabiana Ríos, Kinan was granted a plot of land by the city of [[Ushuaia]] and a subsidy of 250,000 pesos to build a house. She signed a contract for 259,224 pesos for the house construction, but the contractor was apparently unable to carry out the contract. As the Court of Accounts was setting a deadline and threatening to sue for return of the subsidy, the State Attorney filed a case for eviction, to remove Kinan and her family from the temporary housing she was living in until the new house was built.

Her lawyer claimed that the necessary documents had been filed a month previously. He pointed out that it's not possible to build a house in [[Ushuaia]] for 250,000 pesos, and the prefab housing company Kinan signed a contract with couldn't meet the city's documentation requirements. In the end, he was able to stave off the eviction, but Kinan's temporary house continued to be unheated.

Kinan became a [[complainant]] in the criminal case against her managers, and simultaneously filed a civil suit against her ex-managers and the municipality of [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; The legal theory behind the civil suit seems to have been the following: The city conducted regular medical exams on each sex worker in the city's brothels and recorded the results in a book the city maintained for each sex worker. In doing this with each of the city's prostitutes, the city regularized prostitution and became legally complicit in any trafficking that occurred. When her ex-managers were convicted of trafficking in the criminal case, the city became liable for the harm Kinan suffered as a prostitute under the city's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt;

A social worker writing the initial report on Kinan concluded that she had not been a victim because she had not been submissive. When Kinan came to view herself as a victim, she made a claim to the authorities for her rights as a victim of [[trafficking]], but was not recognized. She appealed to the courts, which refused her because the judge held that she had consented. At the next level of appeal, the [[appellate court]] found that there was a possibility that she had been a [[trafficking]] victim, but since she had not declared herself a victim when her employer was raided, she could not do so now.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; None of the available sources describe how this was resolved, but eventually she was recognized as a victim.

== Leadup to trial ==
On November 19, 2011, a woman from [[Tucumán province]] in [[Argentina]] filed a complaint, claiming that she had been exploited in a brothel called Sheik in [[Ushuaia]]. She claimed that she lived there with other women, between the ages of twenty one and twenty eight, who were natives of Argentine, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia. On April 12, 2012, the head of Prosecutor's Office for Trafficking and Exploitation of Persons filed a formal complaint in the Federal Court of Ushuaia against the brothel.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After an investigation, the National Gendarmerie raided the nightclub on October 8, 2012.&lt;ref name="operativo"/&gt;

The lead up to the trial involved the usual legal maneuvering. Originally there were six defendants, but three were dismissed by the investigating judge. The first of these was Claudia Quiroga, Pedro Montoya's ex-wife, who owned the property where Sheik was located and had been Montoya's business partner. The second was Corina Sánchez, who had been the on-site supervisor. These two were no longer involved with the brothel at the time of the raid. The third person dismissed from the trial was Jorge Etcheverry, recruiter and brother of Ivana García, Montoya's girlfriend and business partner when the raid occurred.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

Kinan's lawyer objected to the dismissals. The investigating judge had postponed Kinan's testimony repeatedly, and eventually dismissed the three without evidence from Kinan. Her lawyer insisted that Kinan could "provide evidence, new data, more information regarding these accused and what their responsibility is."&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; She appealed the dismissals, but they were sustained and the trial headed for the court date with only three defendants.

A week before the trial began, Kinan's sister and ex-husband began criticizing her publicly. The sister, Maria Fernanda, who still lives in Europe, sent Kinan's ex-husband a video&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; of a sexual scene in which the female was purportedly one of Kinan's daughters. It was later proved that the video did not involve her daughter.
&lt;ref name="necesitan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kinan's sister claimed that she had received it from someone in [[Ushuaia]]. Maria Fernanda said there was no truth in her sister's claims and she was concerned for her nieces. Kinan's ex-husband released the video to a journalist and claimed that his daughters were at risk. He was living in Scotland and said he couldn't afford to travel to [[Ushuaia]], but offered to testify against his ex-wive via videoconference.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

She also began getting threats.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; On a street in downtown [[Ushuaia]], a group of people shouted ""Be careful what you are going to say at the trial." She received threats and insults on her cell phone and through her Facebook account. The trial prosecutor called the threats "a well organized operation." The week before the trial she felt so threatened that she kept herself and her family in the house.
&lt;ref name="amenazan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The police guarded her house until the beginning of the trial, and she joined a witness protection program.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

On a positive note, she got a new personal lawyer for the trial, a woman she felt she could trust: Marcela Rodríguez, the coordinator of the Counseling and Sponsorship Program for Victims of Trafficking in Persons of the Office of the Ombudsman. And a large number of number of social and feminist organizations organized in her support.&lt;ref name="amenazan"/&gt;

== Trial ==
Because she continued to receive threats during the trial, Kinan's protectors restricted her movement and communication. One observer pointed out that the people eventually convicted of trafficking her were not detained and enjoyed complete freedom of movement and communication.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

Argentina doesn't have separate civil and criminal courts, and the civil and criminal cases against Kinan's managers at the nightclub Sheik were carried out simultaneously before the same panel of judges. During the trial, Kinan testified in a Gesell chamber, so that the accused were not able to witness her testimony.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; A witness known only as "F" testified under the same conditions.&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

=== Criminal trial ===
The defendants were charged with violating [[Argentina]]'s anti-trafficking law. The law has a four part test for trafficking: recruitment; transport; receiving and/or harboring persons; and exploitation. (See [[Human trafficking in Argentina]].) The prosecution claimed that the defendants recruited by advertising in media, they transported their victims by advancing money for their plane tickets, and they received and harbored them by meeting them at the airport and bringing them to the brothel and housing them there. To show exploitation they claimed that the victims had characteristics of social vulnerability when recruited, and that they were bound to the brothel by debts and rules that compromised their ability to leave when they chose.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt;

The prosecutors argued that requiring the women to use a sponge during menstruation was proof that the women weren't working willingly. (Many independent escorts use a sponge so their clients won't know that they're menstruating, and some prefer the sponge to the usual tampons and sanitary napkins. However, women vary a lot in the pain they experience during menstruation. Even a woman who usually doesn't have problems may have a bad month. Escorts participating in a discussion of this on an on-line forum said that forcing women to work when they feel bad or need rest is exploitative, even if the sponge itself isn't a problem.
&lt;ref name="sponge0"&gt;

| access-date= 2017-08-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Kinan's lawyer argued that the defendants' actions violated the 1949 UN protocol on trafficking, which [[Argentina]] has signed. (See [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]].) She pointed out that under the protocol, a victim's consent is immaterial.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

Montoya's lawyer made the following arguments:

{{ quote | text=[The night club was a] duly authorized establishment and the accusation of sex in exchange for money has not been proven and there were no places where they had sex. There is no concrete proof of these federal crimes.&lt;ref name="vigencia"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He pointed out that Montoya had faced a similar charge in the provincial court in 2011 and the case had been dismissed.

{{ quote | text=... now the same complaint has been reissued in Federal, therefore we will ask for acquittal.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

Excerpts from Pedro Montoya's testimony:

{{ quote | text=I am being tried for a crime that I consider to be aberrant. I do not consider that I have deviated from the law. I do not see them as victims but rather as majority partners. I am the minority partner of the ladies.

[Trafficking] is a fashionable crime.

This is a trade in which we take advantage of both of a man's needs, because the man needs to go to a place to look for company. The public goes and the women act as psychologists ... Sometimes men went after spending forty days on board.

The girl is in the capacity of entertainer because they are to entertain and be a companion of a person. It is a service of accompaniment or entertainment that is framed in the Collective Agreement of Work according to an ordinance of the Deliberating Council.

[Clients] had to pay the value of a glass for the time that they were going to be absent from the place ... I consider relationships outside the nightclub to be an agreement between two people, it is not my problem.

There was no [criminal] organization here at all. This business made me tired, it caused me psychophysical discomforts and even losses sometimes.&lt;ref name="socio"/&gt;

I asked my lawyer and he answered that we were not guilty of any crime and we were under the ordinances in force, subject to inspections, of all the Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police, Migrations, Public Ministry of Labor, Sadaic, Capif, DGR Province and, of course, Municipality Of Ushuaia, licensing organs that always inspected the commercial activity carried out. I always thought I was doing a lawful job.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

=== Civil trial ===
A team of psychologists and psychiatrists asserted that Kinan suffered from [[PTSD]] which caused sleep disorders and made her afraid of embracing and of touching things that had passed through many hands, such as money. They recommended psychological counseling three times a week for twenty years, which would cost 2,496,000 pesos at current prices. In addition, scars on her face and missing teeth were physical evidence of the violence she had suffered. The experts testified that Kinan is expected to be 70% incapacitated.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

The municipality of [[Ushuaia]] argued that it had no legal liability because any laws and international treaties violated by the brothel's actions fell under the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial governments, and the city's actions had all been consistent with law. It also pointed out that it was cooperating with a foundation created by Alika Kinan for the purpose of assisting victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

The doctor from Ushuaia Regional Hospital who issued the health books testified. When asked if she ever issued health books to men, she said she only issued them to women and "sex change."&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

== Outcome of trial ==
On 30 November 2016, the court decided in Kinan's favor. The city of [[Ushuaia]] was ordered to pay Kinan 780,000 [[Argentine peso|pesos]] (about US$47,000.) The owner of Sheik received a [[prison sentence]] of seven years and a fine of 70,000 pesos. His girlfriend/business partner got a three-year [[suspended sentence]] and a fine of 30,000 pesos. The woman who managed the club received a three-year [[suspended sentence]].

As part of the suspended sentences, the court placed restrictions on where the two women could reside, required them to avoid overconsumption of alcohol, and ordered them to refrain from using narcotics.

The [[prosecutor]] stated that even though the penalties were less than the prosecution had requested, the [[verdict]] was a change in the way the [[judicial system]] viewed [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name="sentencia"/&gt;

== Epilogue ==
On 1 December 2016, the court published the grounds for its decision. At that point the convicted exercised their right of [[appeal]] and remained free. Kinan continues to feel anxiety over the outcome and she's also still getting threats.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The protective personnel provided by the government Program for Rescue were withdrawn.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

The [[Ushuaia]] city counsel ended the licensing of brothels in 2013, effectively putting them all out of business.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Many of the women left to continue [[sex work]] elsewhere. Most of them went to [[Punta Arenas]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; A ferry service connects [[Punta Arenas]] with the island of [[Tierra del Fuego]] where [[Ushuaia]] is located, making it easy to move there. The brothels of southern [[Chile]] are active, operate similarly to the ones driven out of [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="otherMenus"/&gt; and [[Punta Arenas]] is visited by the same types of ships that gave [[Ushuaia]] many of its customers for its sex business.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;

The women left, but they've been replaced. There are still places where you can rent a room for an hour. There's a wider variety of business models, but the dominant one is reportedly the private apartment. While Kinan and her coworkers lived two to a room, the new model is three to an apartment. If sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] benefited from closing the brothels, it was primarily from the change in housing; they now have hot water. Women still come from the same places far away from [[Ushuaia]], but they rotate in and out faster. Advertising is done on the web, where the pictures and names change, but the phone numbers stay the same. Periodically, the police raid an apartment and liberate its occupants, rendering them homeless until they can reconnect with their pimps. While they are working for their pimps, they are plagued by the same system of debts that plagued Kinan and her coworkers. When the police liberate them, they become homeless mothers with no way of supporting their children.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Kinan believes that the official count of rescued women is inflated because many of the women have been rescued one or more times previously.

{{ quote | text=Why do the victims relapse? Because they have no resources, because there are no public policies, because politicians make policy under the banner of "Not One Less" but they haven't filed even one bill that protects women. The trafficking law came without legs, it doesn't function. I am grateful because it rescued me and freed me from a brothel, helped me grow as a militant and empower me. But after I was released, after being told that I was a victim all these years and that I had to go home with my daughters I thought "What do I live for? What I do?" The Law of Trafficking doesn't work without public policies, that is to say, access to housing, therapeutic psychological support for victims of trafficking, reintegration into genuine work and access to education.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; }}

Kinan currently works at the National University of San Martín, in Buenos Aires, doing research and giving lectures on human trafficking, and organizes activities related to the same topic.

== Kinan on sex work ==
Kinan is an abolitionist opposed to decriminalization. She believes that trafficking can only be abolished by giving women the things that she herself has struggled for.

{{ quote | text=I always insist, when you ask me if I am an abolitionist, yes, I am because I am convinced that if a woman in a state of vulnerability, who is being sexually exploited, you give her or she is given a series of instruments to defend herself in life, education, a well-paid job, not one in the informal economy where she earns little, decent housing where she can support her family even though she is single, I'm sure that woman does not prostitute herself, I'm totally convinced she does not arrive at prostitution. Then, by that point, I consider myself an abolitionist ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In Kinan's view, women enter sex work because they lack housing, jobs, and education. But she also views sex workers as trapped by not understanding that they are victims and have rights.

{{ quote | text=Because you are very afraid, you are not sure if you are a victim or you are not a victim, you don't become aware if you are a victim, if you knew that you were a victim, you would ask for help immediately. Social myth is "Why don't these women who are locked up ask for help at the time? Why don't they come out screaming that they are in these places where they are being exploited sexually, if as a society we know this is wrong?" Because the victims do not know, because they have a great ignorance about international treaties signed by our country, there is a great ignorance that our country is abolitionist.&lt;ref name="carne"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For Kinan, the alternative to abolishing sex work is regulating it. Her experience of regulation was the medical exams at [[Ushuaia]], where physicians authorized by the city ridiculed and disparaged the sex workers they were examining. This combined with similar treatment from clients leads her to place regulators and clients in interlocking roles.

{{ quote | text=The Municipality set up the sanitary notebooks, very much like Senasa or bromatological analysis. [SENASA is the federal food safety agency in Argentina.] Did you see when you go to buy meat in the supermarket? There you walk down the aisle and you see that everything has passed through sanitary inspections, and that the meat is fit for human consumption. And you are one more piece of meat. The client of prostitution enters the premises and says I'm having a ribeye, or a piece of beef, a hamburger. You feel like the merchandise that has given up its own will, to be consumed, to be raped.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Kinan wants to attack commercialized sex in three steps. First is the end of government regulation and shutting down sex-related businesses via the existing anti-trafficking law. The next step is to eliminate the commodity being sold by giving women the resources that make it unnecessary for them to turn to sex work for survival.

{{ quote | text=At the moment the most important thing is to be able to conjoin the Law of Trafficking with real public policies, that restore the rights of the victims in terms of housing and labor solutions. And the supportive therapy and the ability to provide them with education.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Failure to take this step means that women return to their traffickers.

{{ quote | text=When we talk about Human Rights, it is wonderful that we have the closure of brothels, which are clandestine and non-clandestine centers of torture and sexual exploitation, but what do we do to avoid having the same victim show up in later raids, as has happened?&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

The final step is to eliminate the buyer by criminalizing the client, but this must proceed from the second step described above, which Kinan calls "the restoration of rights."

{{ quote | text=We have a lot of work ahead of us, regarding the restoration of rights, of women who are victims of trafficking and from there to be able to advance in a direct line on the criminalization of the client of prostitution.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Argentina has a union of sex workers called Ammar that is part of CTA, a trade union federation. As a sex worker, Kinan saw herself as a strong woman doing a difficult job, but she now believes that viewpoint is a part of victimization.

{{ quote | text=I saw myself as a strong woman who had come there because I had no choice, a concept that is also part of the crime of trafficking, because that is what you are made to believe when you enter the circuit.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; }}

She has no sympathy for Ammar or other sex worker rights organizations, viewing them as essentially the same as the managers at the brothels where she worked.

{{ quote | text=For me Ammar is a union and acts as such, these women have never stood at the street corners, none of them are kept in the brothels as victims, but they have presided over brothels and have presided over women. My personal opinion is that they are trying to take care of their backs for future raids that are made for the crime of trafficking. It is not innocent that they have gone from claiming rights and guarantees as autonomous prostitutes and today demand the reopening of brothels. Argentina and the Constitution are abolitionist, where clearly we are not going to allow prostitution to exist on behalf of others.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

== Discrepancies ==
Part of Alika Kinan's story is the fact that news sources report things about her that are contradicted by other sources. Since there's no way of knowing why different information is being reported a different times, nothing in this section should be taken as evidence that anyone is intentionally being untruthful.

=== Age of arrival at Ushuaia ===
In at least two different interviews, Kinan has apparently said that she was eighteen years old when she arrived at [[Ushuaia]].

&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another source said she was fifteen.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; She was reportedly born on June 24, 1976.&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; She has said that she was thirty six when Sheik was raided in 2012,&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt; and in 2017 she said that she was forty one,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; both of which would be consistent with a 1976 birth date. Various sources state that she came to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik in 1996.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; So she was either nineteen or twenty, and in either case closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth.

=== Time in sex work ===
One source says Kinan was trapped by prostitution for twenty years.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; Another says that she was trapped in a brothel for nearly twenty years.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another claims that she was "a victim of trafficking networks and male clients for two decades."

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
And another says she was "a victim of forced prostitution for 16 years."&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

She did sex work in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] for three years, worked in brothels in [[Ushuaia]] for three years, and after returning to [[Ushuaia]] from [[Spain]], worked in one brothel for another two years. These three time periods add up to about eight years.

=== Number of brothels ===
When news reports say that Kinan was trapped in a brothel for twenty years, they're referring to the brothel named Sheik. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], she worked at a brothel named Aries.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; In [[Ushuaia]], she worked at both Sheik&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

=== Entrapment ===
On the subject of entrapment, a writer familiar with the details of Kinan's history wrote that "Alika Kinan was not kidnapped or cheated..."&lt;ref name="incomoda"/&gt;

One news report says that she was held prisoner.
&lt;ref name="heldInBrothel"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The sources cited use the word "trapped" in a context implying some sort of physical coercion. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] she didn't live in the brothel. The brothel work paid for the place she rented for herself and her younger sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Black &amp; White she rented another place for her sister, indicating that she could travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Sheik, she had keys to the entrance to her living quarters. She worked under abusive and expolitative conditions, compelled by poverty and the need to support people dependent on her. But she has ruled out physical coercion in two different interviews.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

As far as trickery or deceptive recruiting is concerned, in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] there was no need for the brothel to recruit her. She and her sister were starving, she was desperate, and she had no alternatives. She went to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik because they paid better.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; It's not clear why she moved from Sheik to Black &amp; White, but at Sheik she kept fifty percent of the client fees and at Black &amp; White she kept sixty to seventy percent. Also, the women at Black &amp; White didn't have to entertain their clients in their living quarters.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Number of clients per night ===
In 2015 a news report said that Kinan had up to ten or twelve clients a night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt; In 2016 she estimated an average of eight clients per night.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In 2017, she told one interviewer that she had seen fifteen to thirty men per night,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; and she told another that she had twenty to thirty men per night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt;

As stated in the Money section above, brothel revenue data indicates that the women working in the brothels were averaging two to three clients per night.

=== Isolation ===
According to NPR, the women working in the brothel couldn't make friends outside the brothel.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], Kinan actually did have friends outside the brothel. At both brothels in [[Ushuaia]], she appears to have had freedom of movement outside the brothels. However, [[Ushuaia]] was a small city, everyone knew what she did for a living, and sex work has a lot of stigma. She probably was socially isolated, but mostly because of the stigma associated with her work.

The '''American Law Institute''' ('''ALI''') was established in 1923 to promote the clarification and simplification of [[United States]] [[common law]] and its adaptation to changing social needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ali.org/about-ali/|title=About ALI {{!}} American Law Institute|last=Institute|first=The American Law|website=American Law Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of ALI include law professors, attorneys, judges and other professionals in the legal industry. ALI writes documents known as "treatises", which are summaries of state common law (legal principles that come out of state court decisions.) Many courts and legislatures look to ALI's treatises as authoritative reference material concerning many legal issues. However, some legal experts and the late Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] have voiced concern about ALI rewriting the law ''as they want it to be'' instead of ''as it is''.&lt;ref name="lammi"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wlf/2015/04/28/will-the-american-law-institute-restate-or-try-to-rewrite-u-s-copyright-law/print/|title=Will The American Law Institute 'Restate' Or Try To Rewrite U.S. Copyright Law?|last=Lammi|first=Glenn G.|date=2015-04-28|work=Forbes|access-date=2016-03-24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALI drafts, approves, and publishes [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements of the Law]], Principles of the Law, model codes, and other proposals for law reform. The ALI is headquartered in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

At any time, ALI is engaged in up to 20 projects examining the law. Some current projects have been watched closely by the media, particularly the revision of the Model Penal Code Sexual Assault provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/magazine/the-st-pauls-rape-case-shows-why-sexual-assault-laws-must-change.html|title=The St. Paul's Rape Case Shows Why Sexual-Assault Laws Must Change|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|date=2015-08-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/behind-the-scenes-of-the-legal-group-that-could-change-americas-definition-of-sexual-consent|title=Behind the Scenes of the Legal Group That Could Change America's Definition of Sexual Consent {{!}} VICE {{!}} Canada|date=2016-10-22|newspaper=VICE|language=en-ca|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/17/american-law-institute-rejects-affirmative-consent/|title=American Law Institute rejects affirmative consent standard in defining sexual assault|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The American Law Institute was founded in 1923 on the initiative of [[William Draper Lewis]], Dean of the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]], following a study by a group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers who sought to address the uncertain and complex nature of early 20th century American law.  According to the "Committee on the Establishment of a Permanent Organization for the Improvement of the Law," part of the law's uncertainty stemmed from the lack of agreement on fundamental principles of the common-law system, while the law's complexity was attributed to the numerous variations within different jurisdictions.  The Committee recommended that a perpetual society be formed to improve the law and the administration of justice in a scholarly and scientific manner.

The organization was incorporated on February 23, 1923, at a meeting called by the Committee in the auditorium of [[Memorial Continental Hall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] According to ALI's Certificate of Incorporation, its purpose is "to promote the clarification and simplification of the law and its better adaptation to social needs, to secure the better administration of justice, and to encourage and carry on scholarly and scientific legal work".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eV9Y5Dx-zfcC&amp;pg=PA761 ''ABA Journal'']  "The A.L.I. at 50", ''American Bar Association'', 1973, page 761. Retrieved June 21, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

[[File:ALI.headquarters.JPG|thumb|Headquarters of The American Law Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]
Membership in the American Law Institute is limited to 3,000 elected members who are judges, lawyers, and legal scholars from a wide range of practice areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ali.org/members/|title=Members {{!}} American Law Institute|last=Institute|first=The American Law|website=American Law Institute|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from all areas of the United States and from many foreign countries. The total membership of more than 4,200 includes ''ex officio'' members and life members who, after 25 years as an elected member, are no longer required to pay dues. New members must be proposed by an existing member, who writes a letter of recommendation, and seconded by two others. Proposals are evaluated by a Membership Committee that selects members based on several factors, including professional achievement, personal character, and demonstrated interest in improving the law.

ALI members actively support the work of the Institute, including attending Annual Meetings and other project conferences, joining Members Consultative Groups for Institute projects, and submitting comments on project drafts. Members are asked to write, speak, and vote on the basis of their own personal and professional convictions, without regard to client interests, so as to maintain ALI's respected reputation for thoughtful and impartial analysis.

==Governance==

The Institute is governed by its Council, a volunteer board of directors that oversees the management of ALI's business and projects.  Having no fewer than 42 and no more than 65 members, the Council consists of lawyers, judges, and academics, and reflects a broad range of specialties and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ali.org/about-ali/governance/ American Law Institute - Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restatements of the Law==
{{main|Restatement of the Law}}

Restatements are essentially codifications of [[case law]], common law [[judge]]-made doctrines that develop gradually over time because of the principle of [[stare decisis]].  Although Restatements are not [[binding authority]] in and of themselves, they are highly [[Persuasive authority|persuasive]] because they are formulated over several years with extensive input from law professors, practicing attorneys, and judges.  They are meant to reflect the consensus of the American legal community as to what the law is (and in some areas, what it should become).  All told, the Restatement of the Law is one of the most respected and well-used sources of secondary authority, covering nearly every area of common law.

'''Restatements'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thealiadviser.org/projects/&lt;/ref&gt; are primarily addressed to courts and aim at clear formulations of common law and its statutory elements, and reflect the law as it presently stands or might appropriately be stated by a court. Although Restatements aspire toward the precision of statutory language, they are also intended to reflect the flexibility and capacity for development and growth of the common law. That is why they are phrased in the descriptive terms of a judge announcing the law to be applied in a given case rather than in the mandatory terms of a statute.&lt;ref name="How ALI Works - The ALI Adviser"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thealiadviser.org/how-ali-works/|title=How ALI Works - The ALI Adviser|newspaper=The ALI Adviser|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALI recently completed the Fourth Restatement of U.S. Foreign Relations Law&lt;ref&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2972612&lt;/ref&gt; and the Principles of Election Administration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thealiadviser.org/election-administration/election-administration-principles-approved/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of the Law==
Beginning with the Principles of [[Corporate Governance]] (issued in 1994), the American Law Institute has more recently undertaken intensive studies of areas of law thought to need reform. This type of analysis typically results in a publication that recommends changes in the law.  Principles of the Law issued so far include volumes on Aggregate Litigation (2010), Family Dissolution (2002), Intellectual Property (2008), Software Contracts (2010), Transnational Civil Procedure (2006; cosponsored by [[UNIDROIT]]), and Transnational Insolvency: Cooperation Among the NAFTA Countries (2003). Work in the Principles of the Law series continues with projects covering Corporate Compliance, Data Privacy, Election Law, and Government Ethics.&lt;ref name="How ALI Works - The ALI Adviser"/&gt;

==Model Codes==

Another important area of the Institute's work is model statutory codification.  ALI code projects have included model acts dealing with air flight, criminal procedure, evidence, federal securities law, land development, pre-arraignment procedure, and property.  Some of these projects were undertaken jointly with the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] (NCCUSL).

The chief joint ALI-NCCUSL project is the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC), which the Institute has been developing and revising with the National Conference since the 1940s.  First published in 1952, the UCC is one of a number of [[uniform acts]] that have been promulgated in conjunction with efforts to harmonize the law of [[sales]] and other commercial transactions in all 50 [[U.S. state|states]] within the [[United States|United States of America]].  The Uniform Commercial Code is generally viewed as one of the most important developments in American law, having been enacted (with local adaptations) in almost every jurisdiction.

The [[Model Penal Code]] (MPC) is another ALI statutory formulation that has been widely accepted throughout the United States. Adopted by the Institute membership in 1962 after twelve years of drafting and development, the Code's purpose was to stimulate and assist legislatures in making an effort to update and standardize the penal law of the United States. Primary responsibility for criminal law lies with the individual states, and such national efforts work to produce similar laws in different jurisdictions.  The standard they used to make a determination of what the penal code should be was one of "contemporary reasoned judgment" — meaning what a reasoned person at the time of the development of the MPC would judge the penal law to do.  The Chief Reporter for this undertaking was [[Herbert Wechsler]], who later became a Director of the Institute.

ALI recently completed the Sentencing revision,&lt;ref&gt;http://robinainstitute.umn.edu/news/american-law-institute-approves-model-penal-code-sentencing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://robinainstitute.umn.edu/publications/model-penal-code-sentencing-proposed-final-draft-approved-may-2017&lt;/ref&gt; and is still working on the sexual assault and related offenses project that is re-examining Article 213 of the Model Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thealiadviser.org/sexual-assault/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young Scholars Medal==

Every other year, ALI awards the [https://www.ali.org/about-ali/awards/young-scholars-medal/ Young Scholars Medal] to one or two outstanding early-career law professors whose work is relevant to the real world and has the potential to influence improvements in the law. The purpose of the award is to encourage practical scholarly work and to publicize the work of the honorees by sponsoring conferences on issues related to their work. Honorees are also asked to speak at an ALI Annual Meeting.

2015 Recipients&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ali.org/about-ali/awards/young-scholars-medal/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2015/03/elizabeth-chamblee-burch-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, University of Georgia School of Law&lt;ref&gt;http://law.uga.edu/news/45656&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor Burch's research focuses on class actions and large-scale, non-class aggregation, often drawing from fields beyond law including social psychology, behavioral law, and economics.

2011 Recipients

Oren Bar-Gill, Harvard Law School&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/bar-gill_ali_medal&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor Bar-Gill's medal recognizes his insights into consumer psychology, which are the basis for his proposal of specific legal solutions to match specific problems in the markets for cell phones, subprime mortgages, and credit cards.  Professor Bar-Gill subsequently became a reporter on the Restatement of Consumer Contracts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/american_law_institute_names_oren_bar-gill_a_reporter&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeanne C. Fromer, New York University School of Law&lt;ref&gt;http://news.fordham.edu/inside-fordham-category/professor-receives-american-law-institute-medal/&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor Fromer was honored for her work exploring the claiming systems of patent and copyright law, as well as forum shopping in patent litigation.

==Other work==

The American Law Institute has also worked over the years on studies and other proposals dealing with complex litigation, criminal law, enterprise responsibility, federal estate and gift taxation, federal income taxation, federal judicial code revision, and the division of jurisdiction between federal and state courts.

One particularly interesting ALI project was the ''Statement of Essential Human Rights''.  In response to reports of human rights atrocities during [[World War II]], the Institute in 1942 appointed a committee of lawyers and political scientists, supposedly representing the principal cultures of the world, to compile a list of agreed-upon individual rights: an international bill of rights.  The committee reported to the ALI Council in February 1944.  Although the project was never presented for a vote by the ALI membership, the ''Statement of Essential Human Rights'' was published in 1945 by the Americans United for World Organizations, Inc., independently of the Institute.  Along with other sources, the Statement was then used to prepare the [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted on December 10, 1948.

==How the Institute works==
The basic approach and format of all American Law Institute publications is similar.&lt;ref name="How ALI Works - The ALI Adviser"/&gt;

* An expert in the field of law, usually a legal scholar, is designated as Reporter. With the help of assistants, the Reporter does the basic research and prepares material.
* An initial draft is submitted for suggestions and revisions to a small group of Advisers—judges, lawyers, and law teachers—with special knowledge of the subject. In most projects, the draft is also reviewed by a group of ALI members with a particular interest in the topic.
* The revised draft is next submitted for additional analysis and consideration to the ALI Council, a body of some 70 prominent judges, practicing lawyers, and law teachers. The draft can then be referred either to the Reporter and Advisers for further review or to the general ALI membership.
* When approved by the Council, the draft is presented as a Tentative Draft to an Annual Meeting of the entire membership for debate and discussion.  The membership may approve the draft, subject to revisions, or refer it back to the Reporter and Advisers.  A series of Tentative Drafts is produced in this way over a number of years.
* A Proposed Final Draft consisting of all prior Tentative Drafts as modified by membership action may then be submitted to the Council and the membership.  When the project has been approved by both, an official text is published.

The final product thus reflects the review and criticism of experienced members of the bench, bar, and academia.  The process may take many years, and it is not unusual for a single Restatement of the law project to take over twenty years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenbag.org/v12n3/v12n3_boskey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing legal education with ALI CLE (formerly ALI-ABA)==

The need to establish a permanent entity devoted to the continuing training of lawyers became apparent after the end of [[World War II]], as young lawyers returning from years of military service overseas found that they needed refresher courses in the law. Furthermore, the huge complex of government regulations that had begun with the [[New Deal]] and had greatly expanded during the war years provided another impetus for the post-admission education of all lawyers, whether or not they were veterans. Therefore, in 1947, the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) asked the American Law Institute to undertake the first national program of post-admission [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) for practicing attorneys.

The governing bodies of ALI and ABA approved a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] in 1947 that created a "Committee on Continuing Education of the Bar of the American Law Institute Collaborating with the American Bar Association", comprising representatives from both organizations. Initial work focused on producing a series of CLE publications for a national audience and on encouraging and assisting state and local bar groups to establish and conduct their own programs of continuing legal education.

On April 30, 2012, by mutual agreement, the American Bar Association and the American Law Institute chose to move forward separately in their CLE efforts, with the abundant intellectual content and cutting-edge technology of ALI-ABA being absorbed into the CLE group of ALI, now known as The American Law Institute Continuing Legal Education Group (ALI CLE.)

Today, the thousands of prominent lawyers, judges, and legal academics in the United States and abroad who taught and wrote for ALI-ABA continue to do so for ALI CLE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ali-cle.org|title=CLE {{!}} Continuing Legal Education {{!}} MCLE {{!}} ALI-CLE.org|website=www.ali-cle.org|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary by Antonin Scalia==
The late [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] offered a criticism of ALI's approach to restatement:&lt;ref name="lammi" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I write separately to note that modern Restatements—such as the Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment (2010), which both opinions address in their discussions of the disgorgement remedy—are of questionable value, and must be used with caution. The object of the original Restatements was "to present an orderly statement of the general common law." Restatement of Conflict of Laws, Introduction, p. viii (1934). Over time, the Restatements' authors have abandoned the mission of describing the law, and have chosen instead to set forth their aspirations for what the law ought to be . . . Restatement sections such as that should be given no weight whatever as to the current state of the law, and no more weight regarding what the law ought to be than the recommendations of any respected lawyer or scholar. — ''Justice Antonin Scalia, [[dissenting opinion]], ''Kansas v. Nebraska'', February 25, 2015''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chambers 1908 Bell Crank.png|thumb|Illustration from 1908 Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary. Bell-crank, n. a rectangular lever in the form of a crank, used for changing the direction of bell-wires.]]
A '''bellcrank''' is a type of [[crank (mechanism)|crank]] that changes motion through an angle. The angle can be any angle from 0 to 360 degrees, but 90 degrees and 180 degrees are most common. The name comes from its first use, changing the vertical pull on a rope to a horizontal pull on the striker of a [[bell (instrument)|bell]], used for calling staff in large houses or commercial establishments.

==Angles==
A typical 90 degree bellcrank consists of an "L" shaped crank pivoted where the two arms of the L meet. Moving rods (or cables or ropes) are attached to the ends of the L arms. When one is pulled, the L rotates around the pivot point, pulling on the other arm. A typical 180 degree bellcrank consists of a straight bar pivoted in the center. When one arm is pulled or pushed, the bar rotates around the pivot point, pulling or pushing on the other arm.

==Mechanical advantage==
Changing the length of the arms changes the [[mechanical advantage]] of the system. Many applications do not change the direction of motion but instead amplify a force "in line", which a bellcrank can do in a limited space. There is a tradeoff between range of motion, linearity of motion, and size. The greater the angle traversed by the crank, the more non-linear the motion becomes (the more the motion ratio changes).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Applications==
===Aircraft===
Bellcranks are often used in aircraft control systems to connect the pilot's controls to the control surfaces. For example: on light aircraft, the rudder often has a bellcrank whose pivot point is the rudder hinge. A cable connects the pilot's rudder pedal to one side of the bellcrank. When the pilot pushes on the rudder pedal, the rudder rotates on its hinge. The opposite rudder pedal is connected to the other end of the bellcrank to rotate the rudder in the opposite direction. Also referred to as a control horn.

===Automotive===
Bellcranks are also seen in automotive applications, as part of the linkage connecting the throttle pedal to the [[carburetor]], and connecting the brake pedal to the master brake cylinder. In vehicle suspensions, bellcranks are used in [[Suspension (vehicle)#Air resistance .28drag.29|pushrod-style suspensions]] in automobiles or in the [[Christie suspension]] in tanks. Vertically-mounted suspensions may not be feasible in some vehicle designs due to space, aerodynamic, or other design constraints; bellcranks translate the vertical motion of the wheel into horizontal motion, allowing the suspension to be mounted transversely or longitudinally within the vehicle.

Such posts are manned by [[border guard]]s and are at all times connected by [[radio communication]] with ongoing border patrols in their [[region]] and the force headquarters in the interior of the country for their day-to-day functioning, passing on [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and for requesting supplies and any needed reinforcements in emergencies.

Depending on the length and breath of a country's borders and geography, are located in a wide variety of terrain, including the inhospitable areas that often mark political boundaries.

==Layout==
Border outposts, where available, are built on strategic locations which are usually elevated at the highest points in the local terrain and where possible on hilltops along the border.

Depending upon [[international relations]] with the neighboring country and local [[Military strategy|strategic]] needs, BOPs are sometimes built with an assortment of a few administration and residential buildings or [[tent]]s, an [[Armory (military)|armory]], [[trenches]], [[bunkers]], [[wire obstacle]]s and fortified [[machine gun]] positions with a [[watchtower]].

A [[flagpole]] flying the country's [[national flag]] may be located on the premise along with a [[Antenna (radio)|Wireless Communication Antenna]] and a designated clearing as a make-do [[helipad]].

==Peacetime function==
Border outposts are manned in peacetime by the border guard to check [[smuggling]], [[Espionage|infiltration]] by [[spy|spies]] of untrusted neighboring countries, [[insurgents]] bent on smuggling weapons and explosives for [[terrorist]] attacks and [[subversive]] activities, [[illegal immigration]] and [[human trafficking]] etc.. They usually have [[watchtower]]s where soldiers are posted day and night on [[General Orders for Sentries|Sentry duty]] looking for intruders and illegal cross-border activity of any kind. Patrols go out regularly to patrol the international border to check illegal crossings and track any footprints of those who may have crossed over illegally or attempted to. In case intrusion by foreign elements is confirmed, it is the responsibility of the Border guard based on the BOP to trace the intruders by checking the nearby settlements, villages and towns and inform the law enforcement agencies, Customs and Police authorities.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"&gt;Indian [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]'' (1997) made with the official assistance of the [[Border Security Force]] (BSF), [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Airforce]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Refugee (2000)"&gt;Indian Bollywood film ''[[Refugee (2000 film)|Refugee]]'' (2000) made with the official assistance of the Border Security Force (BSF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime function==
During [[war]]time however the Border guard, the special forces tasked with patrolling the border in peacetime, withdraw from the Border outposts and provide assistance in a limited capacity to the country's regular [[Army]] which then comes and mans all the border outposts at the international border facing the enemy neighboring country. Wartime assistance of the Border guard to the Army is essential as they are familiar with the local terrain having patrolled it on a daily basis during peacetime. During [[war]]s these BOPs are reworked into well [[fortification|fortified]] dug-in positions from where regular [[Army (unit)|Army unit]]s can operate to defend the territorial integrity of the country.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"/&gt;

==Heredity==

{{Main|Cancer syndrome}}
Although there are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer, less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a cancer-related genetic mutation and these make up less than 3–10% of all cancer cases.&lt;ref name="Expert09" /&gt; The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary ("sporadic cancers"). [[Hereditary cancer]]s are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. A [[cancer syndrome]] or family cancer syndrome is a genetic disorder in which inherited genetic mutations in one or more genes predisposes the affected individuals to the development of cancers and may also cause the early onset of these cancers. Although cancer syndromes exhibit an increased risk of cancer, the risk varies. For some of these diseases, cancer is not the primary feature and is a rare consequence.

Many of these syndromes are caused by mutations in [[tumor suppressor genes]] that regulate cell growth. Other common mutations alter the function of [[DNA repair|DNA repair genes]], [[oncogenes]] and [[Angiogenesis|genes involved in the production of blood vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson S | title = Mechanisms of inherited cancer susceptibility | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University. Science.

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of [[thyroid cancer]] and [[bone cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;  For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of [[testosterone]] than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating [[androstanediol glucuronide]], have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Other factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Women who take [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; [[Osteosarcoma]] may be promoted by [[growth hormone]]s.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of gene expression in certain cancer cells, changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing or even undergo cell death.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt; Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in oncology is the use of the [[selective estrogen-receptor modulator]] [[tamoxifen]] for the treatment of breast cancer. Another class of hormonal agents, [[aromatase inhibitors]], now have an expanding role in the treatment of breast cancer.

== Infection and inflammation ==
{{Main|Infectious causes of cancer}}
Worldwide, approximately 18% of cancer cases are related to [[infectious disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-06-01|title=Global burden of cancers attributable to infections in 2008: a review and synthetic analysis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204512701377|journal=The Lancet Oncology|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=607–615|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70137-7|issn=1470-2045}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt; [[Virus]]es are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but [[bacteria]] and [[parasites]] also contribute. Infectious organisms that increase the risk of cancer are frequently a source of DNA damage or genomic instability.

===  Viruses ===
[[File:HPV causing cervical cancer.jpg|thumb|HPV is the most common virus that infects the reproductive tract. Infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer in women.]]

== Radiation ==
{{main|Radiation-induced cancer}}
Up to 10% of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure, including both [[non-ionizing radiation|non-ionizing]] radiation and [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name="Enviro2008" /&gt; Unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer, ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly. If it happens to strike a [[chromosome]], it can break the chromosome, result in an [[aneuploidy|abnormal number of chromosomes]], inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit, delete parts of the DNA sequence, cause [[chromosome translocation]]s, or cause other types of [[chromosome abnormality|chromosome abnormalities]].&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20793/|title=Cancer medicine|author=Little JB|publisher=B.C.

===  Non-ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Squamous cell carcinoma (3).jpg|thumb|Squamous cell carcinoma on the sun-exposed skin of the nose.]]Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. Low-energy waves on the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light are thought not to be because they have insufficient energey to break [[chemical bonds]]. Non-ionizing [[radio frequency]] radiation from [[mobile phone]]s, [[electric power transmission]], and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|title=IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php|title=IARC Monographs- Classifications|website=monographs.iarc.fr|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have not found a consistent link between cell phone radiation and cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones|title=Cell Phones and Cancer Risk - National Cancer Institute|date=2013-05-08|publisher=Cancer.gov|access-date=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-energy radiation, including [[ultraviolet radiation]] (present in sunlight), [[x-rays]], and [[gamma radiation]], generally is carcinogenic, if received in sufficient doses. Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]] can lead to [[melanoma]] and other skin malignancies.&lt;ref name="Cleaver"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20854/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Cleaver JE, Mitchell DL|publisher=B.C.

Ultraviolet Radiation Carcinogenesis|oclc=|access-date=31 January 2011|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma [[skin cancer]]s caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave [[UVB]], as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.&lt;ref name="Cleaver" /&gt;

===  Ionizing radiation ===
[[File:Meningioma.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a meningioma displacing the underlying brain.]]Sources of ionizing radiation include [[medical imaging]], and [[radon]] gas. Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest, and radiation-induced [[leukemia]]s typically require 2–10 years to appear.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation-induced [[meningiomas]] are an uncommon complication of cranial irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamanaka R, Hayano A, Kanayama T | title = Radiation-Induced Meningiomas: An Exhaustive Review of the Literature | journal = World Neurosurgery | volume = 97 | pages = 635–644.e8 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27713063 | doi = 10.1016/j.wneu.2016.09.094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, such as those with [[nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]] or [[retinoblastoma]], are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

Ionizing radiation is also used in some kinds of [[medical imaging]]. In industrialized countries, medical imaging contributes almost as much radiation dose to the public as natural background radiation. [[Nuclear medicine]] techniques involve the injection of radioactive pharmaceuticals directly into the bloodstream. [[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] deliberately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors and surrounding tissues as a form of disease treatment. It is estimated that 0.4% of cancers in 2007 in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with rates of CT usage during this same time period.&lt;ref name="pmid18046031"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner DJ, Hall EJ | title = Computed tomography--an increasing source of radiation exposure | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 22 | pages = 2277–84 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18046031 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra072149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential exposure to radon gas has similar cancer risks as [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Low-dose exposures, such as living near a [[nuclear power plant]], are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

==Rare causes==
*

===  Organ transplantation ===
[[File:Metastatic malignant melanoma, heart.jpg|thumb|Malignant melanoma metastases in a heart.]]
The development of donor-derived tumors from [[organ transplants]] is exceedingly rare. The main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], that was undetected at the time of organ harvest.&lt;ref name="pmid16957717"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dingli D, Nowak MA | title = Cancer biology: infectious tumour cells | journal = Nature | volume = 443 | issue = 7107 | pages = 35–6 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16957717 | pmc = 2711443 | doi = 10.1038/443035a | bibcode = 2006Natur.443...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] occurring after transplantation due to tumorous outgrowth of virus-infected donor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barozzi P, Luppi M, Facchetti F, Mecucci C, Alù M, Sarid R, Rasini V, Ravazzini L, Rossi E, Festa S, Crescenzi B, Wolf DG, Schulz TF, Torelli G | title = Post-transplant Kaposi sarcoma originates from the seeding of donor-derived progenitors | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 554–61 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12692543 | doi = 10.1038/nm862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Trauma ===
Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20784/|title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|vauthors=Gaeta JF|publisher=B.C.

It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by [[kanger]] and kairo heaters (charcoal [[hand warmer]]s), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Frequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.&lt;ref name="Gaeta3" /&gt; However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.

=== Maternal-fetal transmission ===
In the United States, approximately 3,500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually, and transplacental transmission of [[acute leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], [[melanoma]] and [[carcinoma]] from mother to fetus has been observed.&lt;ref name="Tolar"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tolar J, Neglia JP | title = Transplacental and other routes of cancer transmission between individuals | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–4 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12794519 | doi = 10.1097/00043426-200306000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors, cancer is generally not a [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]]. The main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] [[histocompatibility|incompatibility]].&lt;ref name="Tolar" /&gt; In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells because these antigens are different from person to person. When non-self antigens are encountered, the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell. Such reactions may protect against tumor cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells.

'''Chemical biology''' is a scientific discipline spanning the fields of [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]. The discipline involves the application of chemical techniques, analysis, and often [[small molecule]]s produced through [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]], to the study and manipulation of biological systems. In contrast to [[biochemistry]], which involves the study of the chemistry of biomolecules and regulation of biochemical pathways within and between cells, chemical biology deals with chemistry ''applied to'' biology.

==Introduction==
Some forms of chemical biology attempt to answer biological questions by directly probing living systems at the chemical level.  In contrast to research using [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], or [[molecular biology]], where [[mutagenesis]] can provide a new version of the organism, cell, or biomolecule of interest, chemical biology probes systems ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' with [[small molecule]]s that have been designed for a specific purpose or identified on the basis of biochemical or cell-based screening (see [[chemical genetics]]).

Chemical biology is one of several [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] sciences that tend to differ from older, [[reductionist]] fields and whose goals are to achieve a description of scientific [[holism]]. Chemical biology has scientific, historical and philosophical roots in [[medicinal chemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[bioorganic chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[metabolic engineering]].

==Systems of interest==

===Proteomics===
{{main|Proteomics}}
[[Proteomics]] investigates the [[proteome]], the set of expressed proteins at a given time under defined conditions. As a discipline, proteomics has moved past rapid protein identification and has developed into a biological assay for quantitative analysis of complex protein samples by comparing protein changes in differently perturbed systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Cox Jü)), Mann M | title = Is Proteomics the New Genomics? | journal = Cell | volume = 130 | issue = 3 | pages = 395–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17693247 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current goals in proteomics include determining [[protein sequences]], abundance and any [[post-translational modifications]]. Also of interest are [[protein–protein interactions]], cellular distribution of proteins and understanding protein activity. Another important aspect of proteomics is the advancement of technology to achieve these goals.

Protein levels, modifications, locations, and interactions are complex and dynamic properties. With this complexity in mind, experiments need to be carefully designed to answer specific questions especially in the face of the massive amounts of data that are generated by these analyses. The most valuable information comes from proteins that are expressed differently in a system being studied. These proteins can be compared relative to each other using [[quantitative proteomics]], which allows a protein to be labeled with a mass tag. Proteomic technologies must be sensitive and robust; for these reasons, the [[mass spectrometer]] has been the workhorse of protein analysis. The high precision of mass spectrometry can distinguish between closely related species and species of interest can be isolated and fragmented within the instrument. Its applications to protein analysis was only possible in the late 1980s with the development of protein and peptide ionization with minimal fragmentation. These breakthroughs were [[Electrospray ionization|ESI]] and [[MALDI]]. Mass spectrometry technologies are modular and can be chosen or optimized to the system of interest.

Chemical biologists are poised to impact proteomics through the development of techniques, probes and assays with [[synthetic chemistry]] for the characterization of protein samples of high complexity. These approaches include the development of enrichment strategies, chemical affinity tags and probes.

==== Enrichment techniques ====
Samples for Proteomics contain a myriad of peptide sequences, the sequence of interest may be highly represented or of low abundance. However, for successful MS analysis the peptide should be enriched within the sample. Reduction of sample complexity is achieved through selective enrichment using [[affinity chromatography]] techniques. This involves targeting a peptide with a distinguishing feature like a [[biotin label]] or a [[post translational modification]].&lt;ref name="pmid19743430"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao Y, Jensen ON | title = Modification-specific proteomics: strategies for characterization of post-translational modifications using enrichment techniques | journal = Proteomics | volume = 9 | issue = 20 | pages = 4632–41 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19743430 | pmc = 2892724 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200900398  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods have been developed that include the use of antibodies, lectins to capture glycoproteins, [[Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography|immobilized metal ions]] to capture phosphorylated peptides and suicide enzyme substrates to capture specific enzymes. Here, chemical biologists can develop reagents to interact with substrates, specifically and tightly, to profile a targeted functional group on a proteome scale. Development of new enrichment strategies is needed in areas like non-ser/thr/tyr phosphorylation sites and other post translational modifications. Other methods of decomplexing samples relies on upstream [[chromatography|chromatographic separations]].

==== Affinity tags ====
Chemical synthesis of [[protein tag|affinity tags]] has been crucial to the maturation of quantitative proteomics. [[iTRAQ]], [[Tandem mass tags]] (TMT) and [[Isotope-coded affinity tag]] (ICAT) are protein mass-tags that consist of a covalently attaching group, a mass (isobaric or isotopic) encoded linker and a handle for isolation. Varying mass-tags bind to different proteins as a sort of footprint such that when analyzing cells of differing perturbations, the levels of each protein can be compared relatively after enrichment by the introduced handle. Other methods include [[SILAC]] and [[Isotopic labeling|heavy isotope labeling]]. These methods have been adapted to identify complexing proteins by labeling a bait protein, pulling it down and analyzing the proteins it has complexed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Gingras A-C)), Gstaiger M, Raught B, Aebersold R | title = Analysis of protein complexes using mass spectrometry | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 645–54 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17593931 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another method creates an internal tag by introducing novel amino acids that are genetically encoded in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. These modifications create a new level of control and can facilitate photocrosslinking to probe protein–protein interactions.&lt;ref name="pmid12404640"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chin JW, Schultz PG | title = In vivo photocrosslinking with unnatural amino Acid mutagenesis | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 1135–7 |date=November 2002 | pmid = 12404640 | doi = 10.1002/1439-7633(20021104)3:11&lt;1135::AID-CBIC1135&gt;3.0.CO;2-M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, keto, acetylene, azide, thioester, boronate, and dehydroalanine- containing amino acids can be used to selectively introduce tags, and novel chemical functional groups into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu W, Brock A, Chen S, Chen S, Schultz PG | title = Genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–44 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17322890 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth1016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enzyme probes ====
To investigate enzymatic activity as opposed to total protein, activity-based reagents have been developed to label the enzymatically active form of proteins (see [[Activity-based proteomics]]). For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to [[suicide inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = López-Otín C, Overall CM | title = Protease degradomics: A new challenge for proteomics | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 509–19 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12094217 | doi = 10.1038/nrm858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting. Structures that mimic these inhibitors could be introduced with modifications that will aid proteomic analysis- like an identification handle or mass tag.&lt;ref name="pmid11182321"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adam GC, Cravatt BF, Sorensen EJ | title = Profiling the specific reactivity of the proteome with non-directed activity-based probes | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–95 |date=January 2001 | pmid = 11182321 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(00)90060-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enzyme activity can also be monitored through converted substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tureček F | title = Mass spectrometry in coupling with affinity capture-release and isotope-coded affinity tags for quantitative protein analysis | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11813306 | doi = 10.1002/jms.275 | bibcode = 2002JMSp...37....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy relies on using synthetic substrate conjugates that contain moieties that are acted upon by specific enzymes. The product conjugates are then captured by an affinity reagent and analyzed. The measured concentration of product conjugate allow the determination of the enzyme velocity. Other factors such as temperature, enzyme concentration and substrate concentration can be visualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warmerdam A, Boom RM, Janssen AE | title = β-galactosidase stability at high substrate concentrations | journal = SpringerPlus | volume = 2 | pages = 402 | date = 2013-08-27 | pmid = 24024090 | pmc = 3765595 | doi = 10.1186/2193-1801-2-402 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/2193-1801-2-402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of enzyme substrates (of which there may be hundreds or thousands, many of which unknown) is a problem of significant difficulty in proteomics and is vital to the understanding of signal transduction pathways in cells; techniques for labelling cellular substrates of enzymes is an area chemical biologists can address. A method that has been developed uses "analog-sensitive" kinases to label substrates using an unnatural ATP analog, facilitating visualization and identification through a unique handle.&lt;ref name="pmid18265343"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blethrow J, Zhang C, Shokat KM, Weiss EL | title = Design and use of analog-sensitive protein kinases | journal = Curr Protoc Mol Biol | volume = Chapter 18 | issue = | pages = Unit 18.11 |date=May 2004 | pmid = 18265343 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb1811s66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycobiology===
While [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and proteins are all encoded at the genetic level, there exists a separate system of trafficked molecules in the cell that are not encoded directly at any direct level: sugars. Thus, [[glycomics|glycobiology]] is an area of dense research for chemical biologists. For instance, live cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars in order to probe the function of the sugars in vivo. [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Carolyn Bertozzi]], previously at [[University of California, Berkeley]], has developed a method for site-specifically reacting molecules the surface of cells that have been labeled with synthetic sugars.

===Combinatorial chemistry===
Chemical biologists used automated synthesis of many diverse compounds in order to experiment with effects of small molecules on biological processes. More specifically, they observe changes in the behaviors of [[protein]]s when small molecules bind to them. Such experiments may supposedly lead to discovery of small molecules with [[antibiotic]] or chemotherapeutic properties.  These approaches are identical to those employed in the discipline of pharmacology.

===Molecular sensing===
Chemical biologists are also interested in developing new small-molecule and biomolecule-based tools to study biological processes, often by molecular imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cb700248m | volume=3 | title=Bright Ideas for Chemical Biology | year=2008 | journal=ACS Chemical Biology | pages=142–155 | vauthors=Lavis LD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of molecular sensing was popularized by [[Roger Tsien]]'s work developing calcium-sensing fluorescent compounds as well as pioneering the use of [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], for which he was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/index.html The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, researchers continue to utilize basic chemical principles to develop new compounds for the study of biological metabolites and processes.

===Employing biology===
Many research programs are also focused on employing natural biomolecules to perform biological tasks or to support a new chemical method or material. In this regard, researchers have shown that DNA can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry, self-assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials, and RNA can be evolved ''in vitro'' to produce new catalytic function. Additionally, heterobifunctional (two-sided) synthetic small molecules such as dimerizers or [[Proteolysis targeting chimera|PROTACs]] bring two proteins together inside cells, which can synthetically induce important new biological functions such as targeted protein degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cermakova K, Hodges HC | title = Next-Generation Drugs and Probes for Chromatin Biology: From Targeted Protein Degradation to Phase Separation | journal = Molecules | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30082609 | pmc = 6102721 | doi = 10.3390/molecules23081958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein misfolding and aggregation as a cause of disease===
A common form of aggregation is long, ordered spindles called amyloid fibrils that are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and that have been shown to consist of cross-linked [[beta sheet]] regions perpendicular to the backbone of the polypeptide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordens S, Adamcik J, Amar-Yuli I, Mezzenga R | title = Disassembly and Reassembly of Amyloid Fibrils in Water−Ethanol Mixtures | journal = Biomacromolecules | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–93 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21142059 | doi = 10.1021/bm101119t }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of aggregation occurs with [[prion| prion proteins]], the glycoproteins found with [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]. In both structures, aggregation occurs through [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic interactions]] and water must be excluded from the binding surface before aggregation can occur.&lt;ref name="pmid21098298"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy G, Straub JE, Thirumalai D | title = Dry amyloid fibril assembly in a yeast prion peptide is mediated by long-lived structures containing water wires | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 107 | issue = 50 | pages = 21459–64 |date=December 2010 | pmid = 21098298 | pmc = 3003024 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1008616107 |bibcode = 2010PNAS..10721459R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A movie of this process can be seen in "Chemical and Engineering News".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borman SA | title = Water Factors in on Amyloid And Prion Aggregation Rates | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | volume = 88 | issue = 49 | pages = 37 | year = 2010 | pmid = | doi =  | url = http://cen.acs.org/articles/88/i49/Water-Factors-Amyloid-Prion-Aggregation.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases associated with misfolded proteins are life-threatening and extremely debilitating, which makes them an important target for chemical biology research.

Through the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] process, [[DNA]] encodes for specific sequences of [[amino acids]]. The resulting polypeptides [[Protein folding|fold]] into more complex secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures to form proteins. Based on both the sequence and the structure, a particular protein is conferred its cellular function. However, sometimes the folding process fails due to mutations in the genetic code and thus the amino acid sequence or due to changes in the cell environment (e.g. pH, temperature, reduction potential, etc.). Misfolding occurs more often in aged individuals or in cells exposed to a high degree of [[oxidative stress]], but a fraction of all proteins misfold at some point even in the healthiest of cells.

Normally when a protein does not fold correctly, [[molecular chaperones]] in the cell can encourage refolding back into its active form.   When refolding is not an option, the cell can also target the protein for degradation back into its component amino acids via [[Proteasome|proteolytic]], [[Lysosome|lysosomal]], or [[Autophagy (cellular)|autophagic]] mechanisms. However, under certain conditions or with certain mutations, the cells can no longer cope with the misfolded protein(s) and a disease state results. Either the protein has a loss-of-function, such as in [[cystic fibrosis]], in which it loses activity or cannot reach its target, or the protein has a gain-of-function, such as with [[Alzheimer's disease]], in which the protein begins to aggregate causing it to become insoluble and non-functional.

Protein misfolding has previously been studied using both computational approaches as well as ''in vivo'' biological assays in [[model organisms]] such as ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and ''C. elegans''. Computational models use a ''de novo'' process to calculate possible protein structures based on input parameters such as amino acid sequence, solvent effects, and mutations. This method has the shortcoming that the cell environment has been drastically simplified, which limits the factors that influence folding and stability. On the other hand, biological assays can be quite complicated to perform ''in vivo'' with [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] like efficiency and there always remains the question of how well lower organism systems approximate human systems.
	
[[Chris Dobson|Dobson]] et al. propose combining these two approaches such that computational models based on the organism studies can begin to predict what factors will lead to protein misfolding.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luheshi LM, Crowther DC, Dobson CM | title = Protein misfolding and disease: from the test tube to the organism | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–31 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18295611 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several experiments have already been performed based on this strategy. In experiments on ''Drosophila'', different mutations of beta amyloid peptides were evaluated based on the survival rates of the flies as well as their motile ability. The findings from the study show that the more a protein aggregates, the more detrimental the neurological dysfunction.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luheshi LM, Tartaglia GG, ((Brorsson A-C)), Pawar AP, Watson IE, Chiti F, Vendruscolo M, Lomas DA, Dobson CM | title = Systematic in Vivo Analysis of the Intrinsic Determinants of Amyloid β Pathogenicity | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = e290 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17973577 | pmc = 2043051 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crowther DC, Kinghorn KJ, Miranda E, Page R, Curry JA, ((Duthie FAI)), Gubb DC, Lomas DA | title = Intraneuronal Aβ, non-amyloid aggregates and neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 132 | issue = 1 | pages = 123–35 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15780472 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.12.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies using [[transthyretin]], a component of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] that binds to beta amyloid peptide deterring aggregation but can itself aggregate especially when mutated, indicate that aggregation prone proteins may not aggregate where they are secreted and rather are deposited in specific organs or tissues based on each mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammarström P, Sekijima Y, White JT, Wiseman RL, Lim A, Costello CE, Altland K, Garzuly F, Budka H | title = D18G Transthyretin is Monomeric, Aggregation Prone, and Not Detectable in Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid:  A Prescription for Central Nervous System Amyloidosis?† | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 22 | pages = 6656–63 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12779320 | doi = 10.1021/bi027319b }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly et al. have shown that the more stable, both kinetically and thermodynamically, a misfolded protein is the more likely the cell is to secrete it from the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] rather than targeting the protein for degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sekijima Y, Wiseman RL, Matteson J, Hammarström P, Miller SR, Sawkar AR, Balch WE, Kelly JW | title = The Biological and Chemical Basis for Tissue-Selective Amyloid Disease | journal = Cell | volume = 121 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–85 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15820680 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the more stress that a cell feels from misfolded proteins the more probable new proteins will misfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gidalevitz T, Ben-Zvi A, Ho KH, Brignull HR, Morimoto RI | title = Progressive Disruption of Cellular Protein Folding in Models of Polyglutamine Diseases | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5766 | pages = 1471–1474 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16469881 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124514 |bibcode = 2006Sci...311.1471G }}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments as well as others having begun to elucidate both the intrinsic and extrinsic causes of misfolding as well as how the cell recognizes if proteins have folded correctly.

As more information is obtained on how the cell copes with misfolded proteins, new therapeutic strategies begin to emerge. An obvious path would be prevention of misfolding. However, if protein misfolding cannot be avoided, perhaps the cell's natural mechanisms for degradation can be bolstered to better deal with the proteins before they begin to aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen E, Bieschke J, Perciavalle RM, Kelly JW, Dillin A | title = Opposing Activities Protect Against Age-Onset Proteotoxicity | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5793 | pages = 1604–1610 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16902091 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124646 |bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1604C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before these ideas can be realized, many more experiments need to be done to understand the folding and degradation machinery as well as what factors lead to misfolding. More information about protein misfolding and how it relates to disease can be found in the recently published book by Dobson, Kelly, and Rameriz-Alvarado entitled Protein Misfolding Diseases Current and Emerging Principles and Therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez-Alvarado, M., Kelly, J.

=== Chemical synthesis of peptides ===
{{main|Peptide synthesis}}
In contrast to the traditional biotechnological practice of obtaining [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] by isolation from cellular hosts through cellular [[protein production]], advances in chemical techniques for the synthesis and ligation of peptides has allowed for the total synthesis of some peptides and proteins. Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue specific incorporation of "[[posttranslational modification]]s" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even [[ubiquitin]]ation. These capabilities are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein. Given the widely recognized importance of proteins as cellular catalysts and recognition elements, the ability to precisely control the composition and connectivity of polypeptides is a valued tool in the chemical biology community and is an area of active research.
 
While chemists have been making peptides for over 100 years,&lt;ref name=reference2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimmerlin T, Seebach D | title = '100 years of peptide synthesis': ligation methods for peptide and protein synthesis with applications to beta-peptide assemblies | journal = J Pept Res | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–260 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15705167 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3011.2005.00214.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ability to efficiently and quickly synthesize short peptides came of age with the development of [[Bruce Merrifield]]'s [[peptide synthesis|solid phase peptide synthesis]] (SPPS). Prior to the development of SPPS, the concept of step-by-step polymer synthesis on an insoluble support was without chemical precedent.&lt;ref name="pmid16778881"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kent S | title = Obituary: Bruce Merrifield (1921–2006) | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7095 | pages = 824 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16778881 | doi = 10.1038/441824a |bibcode = 2006Natur.441..824K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a covalently bound insoluble polymeric support greatly simplified the process of peptide synthesis by reducing purification to a simple "filtration and wash" procedure and facilitated a boom in the field of peptide chemistry. The development and "optimization" of SPPS took peptide synthesis from the hands of the specialized peptide synthesis community and put it into the hands of the broader chemistry, biochemistry, and now chemical biology community. SPPS is still the method of choice for linear synthesis of polypeptides up to 50 residues in length&lt;ref name="pmid16778881"/&gt; and has been implemented in commercially available automated peptide synthesizers. One inherent shortcoming in any procedure that calls for repeated coupling reactions is the buildup of side products resulting from incomplete couplings and side reactions. This places the upper bound for the synthesis of linear polypeptide lengths at around 50 amino acids, while the "average" protein consists of 250 amino acids.&lt;ref name=reference2/&gt; Clearly, there was a need for development of "non-linear" methods to allow synthetic access to the average protein.

Although the shortcomings of linear SPPS were recognized not long after its inception, it took until the early 1990s for effective methodology to be developed to ligate small peptide fragments made by SPPS, into protein sized polypeptide chains (for recent review of peptide ligation strategies, see review by Dawson ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dirksen A, Dawson PE | title = Expanding the scope of chemoselective peptide ligations in chemical biology | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 760–6 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19058994 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The oldest and best developed of these methods is termed [[native chemical ligation]]. Native chemical ligation was unveiled in a 1994 paper from the laboratory of [[Stephen Kent (chemist)|Stephen B. H. Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawson PE, Muir TW, Clarklewis I, ((Kent SBH)) | title = SYNTHESIS OF PROTEINS BY NATIVE CHEMICAL LIGATION | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5186 | pages = 776–779 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7973629 | doi = 10.1126/science.7973629 |bibcode = 1994Sci...266..776D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Native chemical ligation involves the coupling of a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine residue, ultimately resulting in formation of a "native" amide bond. Further refinements in native chemical ligation have allowed for kinetically controlled coupling of multiple peptide fragments, allowing access to moderately sized peptides such as an HIV-protease dimer&lt;ref name="pmid17397076"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torbeev VY, Kent SB | title = Convergent chemical synthesis and crystal structure of a 203 amino acid "covalent dimer" HIV-1 protease enzyme molecule | journal = Angew.

Some of these drawbacks include the installation and preservation of a reactive C-terminal thioester, the requirement of an N-terminal cysteine residue (which is the second-least-common amino acid in proteins),&lt;ref name="pmid3227018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCaldon P, Argos P | title = Oligopeptide biases in protein sequences and their use in predicting protein coding regions in nucleotide sequences | journal = Proteins | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–122 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3227018 | doi = 10.1002/prot.340040204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the requirement for a sterically unincumbering C-terminal residue.

Other strategies that have been used for the ligation of peptide fragments using the acyl transfer chemistry first introduced with native chemical ligation include expressed protein ligation,&lt;ref name="pmid9618476"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muir TW, Sondhi D, Cole PA | title = Expressed protein ligation: a general method for protein engineering | journal = Proc.

Expressed protein ligation allows for the biotechnological installation of a C-terminal thioester using [[intein]] biochemistry, thereby allowing the appendage of a synthetic N-terminal peptide to the recombinantly produced C-terminal portion. This technique allows for access to much larger proteins, as only the N-terminal portion of the resulting protein has to be chemically synthesized. Both sulfurization/desulfurization techniques and the use of removable thiol auxiliaries involve the installation of a synthetic thiol moiety to carry out the standard native chemical ligation chemistry, followed by removal of the auxiliary/thiol. These techniques help to overcome the requirement of an N-terminal cysteine needed for standard native chemical ligation, although the steric requirements for the C-terminal residue are still limiting.
 
A final category of peptide ligation strategies include those methods not based on native chemical ligation type chemistry. Methods that fall in this category include the traceless Staudinger ligation,&lt;ref name="pmid16819875"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soellner MB, Nilsson BL, Raines RT | title = Reaction mechanism and kinetics of the traceless Staudinger ligation | journal = J.

===Protein design by directed evolution===
{{main|Directed evolution}}
One of the primary goals of [[protein engineering]] is the design of novel [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] with a desired structure and chemical activity. Because our knowledge of the relationship between primary sequence, structure, and function of proteins is limited, [[protein design|rational design]] of new proteins with [[enzyme|enzymatic activity]] is extremely challenging. Directed evolution, repeated cycles of genetic diversification followed by a screening or selection process, can be used to mimic [[natural selection|Darwinian evolution]] in the laboratory to design new proteins with a desired activity.&lt;ref name="pmid18573077"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jäckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D | title = Protein design by directed evolution | journal = Annu Rev Biophys | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 153–73 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18573077 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods exist for creating large libraries of sequence variants. Among the most widely used are subjecting [[DNA]] to [[UV radiation]] or [[mutagen|chemical mutagens]], [[PCR|error-prone PCR]], [[genetic code|degenerate codons]], or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].&lt;ref name="Bittker_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15118093"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bittker JA, Le BV, Liu JM, Liu DR | title = Directed evolution of protein enzymes using nonhomologous random recombination | journal = Proc.

Common selection/screening techniques include [[fluorescence-activated cell sorting]] (FACS),&lt;ref name="pmid15811807"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aharoni A, Griffiths AD, Tawfik DS | title = High-throughput screens and selections of enzyme-encoding genes | journal = Curr Opin Chem Biol | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–6 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 15811807 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2005.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mRNA display]],&lt;ref name="pmid11274392"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson DS, Keefe AD, Szostak JW | title = The use of mRNA display to select high-affinity protein-binding peptides | journal = Proc.

USA | volume = 98 | issue = 7 | pages = 3750–5 |date=March 2001 | pmid = 11274392 | pmc = 31124 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.061028198 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.3750W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[phage display]], or [[in vitro compartmentalization|''in vitro'' compartmentalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tawfik DS, Griffiths AD | title = Man-made cell-like compartments for molecular evolution | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 652–6 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9661199 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0798-652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once useful variants are found, their DNA sequence is amplified and subjected to further rounds of diversification and selection. Since only proteins with the desired activity are selected, multiple rounds of directed evolution lead to proteins with an accumulation beneficial traits.

There are two general strategies for choosing the starting sequence for a directed evolution experiment: ''de novo'' design and redesign. In a protein design experiment, an initial sequence is chosen at random and subjected to multiple rounds of directed evolution. For example, this has been employed successfully to create a family of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-binding proteins with a new folding pattern not found in nature.&lt;ref name="pmid15024384"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lo Surdo P, Walsh MA, Sollazzo M | title = A novel ADP- and zinc-binding fold from function-directed in vitro evolution | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 382–3 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 15024384 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Random sequences can also be biased towards specific folds by specifying the characteristics (such as polar vs. nonpolar) but not the specific identity of each amino acid in a sequence. Among other things, this strategy has been used to successfully design [[helix bundle|four-helix bundle]] proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamtekar S, Schiffer JM, Xiong HY, Babik JM, Hecht MH | title = Protein Design by Binary Patterning of Polar and Nonpolar Amino-acids | journal = Science | volume = 262 | issue = 5140 | pages = 1680–1685 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8259512 | doi = 10.1126/science.8259512 |bibcode = 1993Sci...262.1680K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14593201"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei Y, Kim S, Fela D, Baum J, Hecht MH | title = Solution structure of a de novo protein from a designed combinatorial library | journal = Proc.

In a protein redesign experiment, an existing sequence serves as the starting point for directed evolution. In this way, old proteins can be redesigned for increased activity or new functions. Protein redesign has been used for protein simplification, creation of new quaternary structures, and topological redesign of a [[chorismate mutase]].&lt;ref name="Bittker_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SV, Walter KU, Kast P, Hilvert D | title = Searching sequence space for protein catalysts | journal = Proc.

In this regard, directed evolution has been used on γ-humulene synthase, an enzyme that creates over 50 different [[sesquiterpenes]], to create enzymes that selectively synthesize individual products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshikuni Y, Ferrin TE, Keasling JD | title = Designed divergent evolution of enzyme function | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | issue = 7087 | pages = 1078–1082 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16495946 | doi = 10.1038/nature04607 |bibcode = 2006Natur.440.1078Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, completely new functions can be selected for from existing protein scaffolds. In one example of this, an RNA [[ligase]] was created from a [[zinc finger]] scaffold after 17 rounds of directed evolution. This new enzyme catalyzes a chemical reaction not known to be catalyzed by any natural enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seelig B, Szostak JW | title = Selection and evolution of enzymes from a partially randomized non-catalytic scaffold | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7155 | pages = 828–31 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17700701 | doi = 10.1038/nature06032 |bibcode = 2007Natur.448..828S | pmc = 4476047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[computational chemistry|Computational methods]], when combined with experimental approaches, can significantly assist both the design and redesign of new proteins through directed evolution. Computation has been used to design proteins with unnatural folds, such as a right-handed [[coiled coil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harbury PB, Plecs JJ, Tidor B, Alber T, Kim PS | title = High-resolution protein design with backbone freedom | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5393 | pages = 1462–1467 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9822371 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5393.1462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These computational approaches could also be used to redesign proteins to selectively bind specific target molecules. By identifying lead sequences using computational methods, the occurrence of functional proteins in libraries can be dramatically increased before any directed evolution experiments in the laboratory.

[[Manfred T. Reetz]], [[Frances Arnold]], Donald Hilvert, and [[Jack W. Szostak]] are significant researchers in this field.

===Biocompatible click cycloaddition reactions in chemical biology===
Recent advances in technology have allowed scientists to view substructures of cells at levels of unprecedented detail.  Unfortunately these "aerial" pictures offer little information about the mechanics of the biological system in question.  To be fully effective, precise imaging systems require a complementary technique that better elucidates the machinery of a cell.  By attaching tracking devices (optical probes) to [[biomolecules]] ''in vivo'', one can learn far more about [[cell metabolism]], [[molecular transport]], [[cell-cell interaction]]s and many other processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jewett JC, Bertozzi CR | title = Cu-free click cycloaddition reactions in chemical biology | journal = Chemical Society Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 1272–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20349533 | pmc = 2865253 | doi = 10.1039/b901970g }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bioorthogonal reactions====
Successful labeling of a molecule of interest requires specific functionalization of that molecule to react chemospecifically with an optical probe.  For a labeling experiment to be considered robust, that functionalization must minimally perturb the system.&lt;ref name="pmid19714693"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sletten EM, Bertozzi CR | title = Bioorthogonal chemistry: fishing for selectivity in a sea of functionality | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. | volume = 48 | issue = 38 | pages = 6974–98 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19714693 | pmc = 2864149 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200900942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, these requirements can often be extremely hard to meet.  Many of the reactions normally available to organic chemists in the laboratory are unavailable in living systems.  Water- and redox- sensitive reactions would not proceed, reagents prone to nucleophilic attack would offer no chemospecificity, and any reactions with large kinetic barriers would not find enough energy in the relatively low-heat environment of a living cell.
Thus, chemists have recently developed a panel of [[bioorthogonal chemistry]] that proceed chemospecifically, despite the milieu of distracting reactive materials ''in vivo''.

====Design of bioorthogonal reagents and bioorthogonal chemical reporters====
The coupling of an optical probe to a molecule of interest must occur within a reasonably short time frame; therefore, the kinetics of the coupling reaction should be highly favorable.  [[Click chemistry]] is well suited to fill this niche, since click reactions are, by definition, rapid, spontaneous, selective, and high-yielding.&lt;ref name="pmid11433435"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolb HC, Finn MG, Sharpless KB | title = Click Chemistry: Diverse Chemical Function from a Few Good Reactions | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 2004–2021 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11433435 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20010601)40:11&lt;2004::AID-ANIE2004&gt;3.0.CO;2-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the most famous "click reaction," a [3+2] [[cycloaddition]] between an [[azide]] and an acyclic [[alkyne]], is copper-catalyzed, posing a serious problem for use ''in vivo'' due to copper's toxicity.&lt;ref name="pmid12203546"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rostovtsev VV, Green LG, Fokin VV, Sharpless KB | title = A stepwise huisgen cycloaddition process: copper(I)-catalyzed regioselective "ligation" of azides and terminal alkynes | journal = Angew.

The issue of copper toxicity can be alleviated using copper-chelating ligands, enabling copper-catalyzed labeling of the surface of live cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hong V, Steinmetz NF, Manchester M, Finn MG | title = Labeling Live Cells by Copper-Catalyzed Alkyne−Azide Click Chemistry | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 1912–6 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20886827 | pmc = 3014321 | doi = 10.1021/bc100272z }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To bypass the necessity for a catalyst, the lab of [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Dr. Carolyn Bertozzi]] introduced inherent strain into the alkyne species by using a cyclic alkyne.  In particular, [[cyclooctyne]] reacts with azido-molecules with distinctive vigor.&lt;ref name="pmid15547999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agard NJ, Prescher JA, Bertozzi CR | title = A strain-promoted [3 + 2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition for covalent modification of biomolecules in living systems | journal = J.

====Use in biological systems====
As mentioned above, the use of bioorthogonal reactions to tag biomolecules requires that one half of the reactive "click" pair is installed in the target molecule, while the other is attached to an optical probe.  When the probe is added to a biological system, it will selectively conjugate with the target molecule.

The most common method of installing bioorthogonal reactivity into a target biomolecule is through metabolic labeling.  Cells are immersed in a medium where access to nutrients is limited to synthetically modified analogues of standard fuels such as sugars.  As a consequence, these altered biomolecules are incorporated into the cells in the same manner as their wild-type brethren.  The optical probe is then incorporated into the system to image the fate of the altered biomolecules.  Other methods of functionalization include enzymatically inserting [[azides]] into [[proteins]],&lt;ref name="pmid19345117"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hur GH, Meier JL, Baskin J, Codelli JA, Bertozzi CR, Marahiel MA, Burkart MD | title = Crosslinking studies of protein–protein interactions in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 372–81 |date=April 2009 | pmid = 19345117 | pmc = 2743379 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2009.02.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and synthesizing [[phospholipid]]s conjugated to cyclooctynes.&lt;ref name="pmid19145623"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neef AB, Schultz C | title = Selective fluorescence labeling of lipids in living cells | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 1498–500 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19145623 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200805507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future directions====
As these bioorthogonal reactions are further optimized, they will likely be used for increasingly complex interactions involving multiple different classes of biomolecules.  More complex interactions have a smaller margin for error, so increased reaction efficiency is paramount to continued success in optically probing cellular machinery.  Also, by minimizing side reactions, the experimental design of a minimally perturbed living system is closer to being realized.

===Discovery of biomolecules through metagenomics===
{{main|Metagenomics}}
The advances in modern sequencing technologies in the late 1990s allowed scientists to investigate DNA of communities of organisms in their natural environments, so-called "eDNA", without culturing individual species in the lab. This metagenomic approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition. These sources of eDNA include, but are not limited to, [[soils]], ocean, [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]], [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal vents]], [[polar ice caps]], hypersaline habitats, and extreme pH environments.&lt;ref name="pmid15040261"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keller M, Zengler K | title = Tapping into microbial diversity | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–50 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 15040261 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many applications of metagenomics, chemical biologists and microbiologists such as [[Jo Handelsman]], [[Jon Clardy]], and [[Robert M. Goodman]] who are pioneers of metagenomics, explored metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of biologically active molecules such as [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref name="pmid9818143"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Handelsman J, Rondon MR, Brady SF, Clardy J, Goodman RM | title = Molecular biological access to the chemistry of unknown soil microbes: a new frontier for natural products | journal = Chem.

[[File:Overview of metagenomic methods.jpg|thumb|370px|alt=Overview of metagenomic methods|Overview of metagenomic methods]]
[[Functional symptom|Functional]] or [[homology (biology)|homology]] screening strategies have been used to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules. Functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific [[phenotypes]] that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics. Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify [[conserved sequences]] that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Banik JJ, Brady SF | title = Recent application of metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of antimicrobials and other bioactive small molecules | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 603–609 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20884282 | pmc = 3111150 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2010.08.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Functional metagenomic studies enable scientists to discover novel genes that encode biologically active molecules. These assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes, and pH assays that can screen for pH change due to newly synthesized molecules using pH indicator on an [[agar]] plate.&lt;ref name="Daniel_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Daniel R | title = The metagenomics of soil | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 470–478 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15931165 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds, has also been used to search genes with specific functions.&lt;ref name = "Daniel_2005"/&gt; These led to the discovery and isolation of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, the Schipper group identified three eDNA derived AHL [[lactonase]]s that inhibit [[biofilm]] formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via functional metagenomic assays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schipper C, Hornung C, Bijtenhoorn P, Quitschau M, Grond S, Streit WR | title = Metagenome-Derived Clones Encoding Two Novel Lactonase Family Proteins Involved in Biofilm Inhibition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 224–233 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18997026 | pmc = 2612230 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01389-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these functional screening methods require a good design of probes that detect molecules being synthesized and depend on the ability to express metagenomes in a host organism system.&lt;ref name="Daniel_2005"/&gt;
	
In contrast, homology metagenomic studies led to a faster discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the [[biosynthesis]] of biologically active molecules. As soon as the genes are sequenced, scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"/&gt; The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes. These also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, Banik et al. screened for clones containing genes associated with the synthesis of teicoplanin and vancomycin-like [[glycopeptide]] [[antibiotics]] and found two new biosynthetic gene clusters.&lt;ref name="pmid20834152"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bunterngsook B, Kanokratana P, Thongaram T, Tanapongpipat S, Uengwetwanit T, Rachdawong S, Vichitsoonthonkul T, Eurwilaichitr L | title = Identification and characterization of lipolytic enzymes from a peat-swamp forest soil metagenome | journal = Biosci.

There are challenges to metagenomic approaches to discover new biologically active molecules. Only 40% of enzymatic activities present in a sample can be expressed in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gabor EM, ((Alkema WBL)), Janssen DB | title = Quantifying the accessibility of the metagenome by random expression cloning techniques | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 879–86 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15305913 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00640.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the purification and isolation of eDNA is essential but difficult when the sources of obtained samples are poorly understood. However, collaborative efforts from individuals from diverse fields including [[Microbial genetics|bacterial genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genomics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[robots]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[chemistry]] can solve this problem together and potentially lead to the discovery of many important biologically active molecules.&lt;ref name="Banik_2010"/&gt;

===Protein phosphorylation===
[[Posttranslational modification]] of proteins with [[phosphate]] groups has proven to be a key regulatory step throughout all biological systems.  Phosphorylation events, either phosphorylation by protein [[kinase]]s or dephosphorylation by [[phosphatases]], result in protein activation or deactivation.  These events have an immense impact on the regulation of physiological pathways, which makes the ability to dissect and study these pathways integral to understanding the details of cellular processes.   There exist a number of challenges—namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome, the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques—that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area.  A recent review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrant MK, Cole PA | title = The Chemical Biology of Protein Phosphorylation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 78 | issue =  | pages = 797–825 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19489734 | pmc = 3074175 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.78.070907.103047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a detailed examination of the impact of newly developed chemical approaches to dissecting and studying biological systems both in vitro and in vivo.

Through the use of a number of classes of small molecule modulators of protein kinases, chemical biologists have been able to gain a better understanding of the effects of protein phosphorylation.  For example, nonselective and selective kinase inhibitors, such as a class of pyridinylimidazole compounds described by Wilson, et al.,&lt;ref name="pmid9224565"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson KP, McCaffrey PG, Hsiao K, Pazhanisamy S, Galullo V, Bemis GW, Fitzgibbon MJ, Caron PR, Murcko MA, Su MS | title = The structural basis for the specificity of pyridinylimidazole inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 423–31 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224565 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(97)90194-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are potent inhibitors useful in the dissection of [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAP kinase]] signaling pathways.  These pyridinylimidazole compounds function by targeting the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] binding pocket.  Although this approach, as well as related approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargellis C, Tong L, Churchill L, Cirillo PF, Gilmore T, Graham AG, Grob PM, Hickey ER, Moss N, Pav S, Regan J | title = Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by utilizing a novel allosteric binding site | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 268–72 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11896401 | doi = 10.1038/nsb770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schindler T, Bornmann W, Pellicena P, Miller WT, Clarkson B, Kuriyan J | title = Structural mechanism for STI-571 inhibition of abelson tyrosine kinase | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5486 | pages = 1938–42 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10988075 | doi = 10.1126/science.289.5486.1938 | bibcode = 2000Sci...289.1938S }}&lt;/ref&gt; with slight modifications, has proven effective in a number of cases, these compounds lack adequate specificity for more general applications.  Another class of compounds, mechanism-based inhibitors, combines detailed knowledge of the chemical mechanism of kinase action with previously utilized inhibition motifs.  For example, Parang, et al. describe the development of a "bisubstrate analog" that inhibits kinase action by binding both the conserved ATP binding pocket and a protein/peptide recognition site on the specific kinase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parang K, Till JH, Ablooglu AJ, Kohanski RA, Hubbard SR, Cole PA | title = Mechanism-based design of a protein kinase inhibitor | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–41 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11135668 | doi = 10.1038/83028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no published in vivo data on compounds of this type, the structural data acquired from in vitro studies have expanded the current understanding of how a number of important kinases recognize target substrates.

The development of novel chemical means of incorporating [[phosphomimetics]] into proteins has provided important insight into the effects of phosphorylation events.  Historically, phosphorylation events have been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site ([[serine]], [[threonine]] or [[tyrosine]]) to an amino acid, such as [[alanine]], that cannot be phosphorylated.   While this approach has been successful in some cases, mutations are permanent in vivo and can have potentially detrimental effects on protein folding and stability. Thus, chemical biologists have developed new ways of investigating protein phosphorylation.  By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous [[phosphonate]] mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations.  Protein semisynthesis, or more specifically [[expressed protein ligation]] (EPL), has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either the C- or the N-terminus.&lt;ref name="pmid9618476"/&gt; In addition, researchers have built upon an established technique in which one can insert an unnatural amino acid into a peptide sequence by charging synthetic tRNA that recognizes a nonsense codon with an unnatural amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noren CJ, Anthony-Cahill SJ, Griffith MC, Schultz PG | title = A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901 | pages = 182–188 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2649980 | doi = 10.1126/science.2649980 |bibcode = 1989Sci...244..182N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments indicate that this technique can also be employed in vivo, although, due to permeability issues, these in vivo experiments using phosphomimetic molecules have not yet been possible.&lt;ref name="pmid16689635"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L, Xie J, Schultz PG | title = Expanding the genetic code | journal = Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 225–49 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16689635 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.35.101105.121507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in chemical biology have also improved upon classical techniques of imaging kinase action.  For example, the development of [[peptide biosensors]]—peptides containing incorporated [[fluorophore]] molecules—allowed for improved temporal resolution in in vitro binding assays.&lt;ref name="pmid17881302"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma V, Wang Q, Lawrence DS | title = Peptide-based fluorescent sensors of protein kinase activity: design and applications | journal = Biochim.

One of the most useful techniques to study kinase action is [[Förster resonance energy transfer|Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer]] (FRET).  To utilize FRET for phosphorylation studies, fluorescent proteins are coupled to both a phosphoamino acid binding domain and a peptide that can by phosphorylated.  Upon phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a substrate peptide, a conformational change occurs that results in a change in fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Violin JD, Zhang J, Tsein RY, Newton AC | title = A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter reveals oscillatory phosphorylation by protein kinase C | journal = J.

Through the augmentation of classical biochemical methods as well as the development of new tools and techniques, chemical biologists have improved accuracy and precision in the study of protein phosphorylation.

===Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology===
{{main|Stem Cell|Induced stem cells}}
Advances in stem-cell biology have typically been driven by discoveries in [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]]. These have included optimization of culture conditions for the maintenance and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of [[Cell potency|pluripotent]] and multipotent stem-cells and the deciphering of [[cell signaling|signaling circuits]] that control stem-cell fate. However, chemical approaches to stem-cell biology have recently received increased attention due to the identification of several [[small molecules]] capable of modulating stem-cell fate in vitro.&lt;ref name="pmid17493865"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Emre N, Coleman R, Ding S | title = A chemical approach to stem cell biology | journal = Curr Opin Chem Biol | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 252–8 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17493865 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.04.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small molecule approach offers particular advantages over traditional methods in that it allows a high degree of temporal control, since compounds can be added or removed at will, and tandem inhibition/activation of multiple cellular targets.

Small molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior are commonly identified in [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput screens]]. Libraries of compounds are screened for the induction of a desired phenotypic change in cultured stem-cells. This is usually observed through activation or repression of a fluorescent reporter or by detection of specific cell surface markers by [[fluorescence-activated cell sorting|FACS]] or [[immunohistochemistry]]. Hits are then structurally optimized for activity by the synthesis and screening of secondary libraries. The cellular targets of the small molecule can then be identified by [[affinity chromatography]], [[mass spectrometry]], or [[DNA microarray]].  
	
A trademark of pluripotent stem-cells, such as [[embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem-cells]] (ESCs), is the ability to [[biological immortality|self-renew]] indefinitely. The conventional use of feeder cells and various exogenous growth factors in the culture of ESCs presents a problem in that the resulting highly variable culture conditions make the long-term expansion of un-differentiated ESCs challenging.&lt;ref name="pmid20714081"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vazin T, Freed WJ | title = Human embryonic stem cells: derivation, culture, and differentiation: a review | journal = Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–603 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20714081 | pmc = 2973558 | doi = 10.3233/RNN-2010-0543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, chemically defined culture conditions could be developed to maintain ESCs in a pluripotent state indefinitely. Toward this goal, the Schultz and Ding labs at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] identified a small molecule that can preserve the long-term self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of feeder cells and other exogenous growth factors.&lt;ref name="pmid17088537"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Do JT, Zhang Q, Yao S, Yan F, Peters EC, Schöler HR, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = Self-renewal of embryonic stem cells by a small molecule | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 103 | issue = 46 | pages = 17266–71 |date=November 2006 | pmid = 17088537 | pmc = 1859921 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0608156103 |bibcode = 2006PNAS..10317266C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel molecule, called pluripotin, was found to simultaneously inhibit multiple differentiation inducing pathways.

[[File:Stemcellmodulators.tif|thumb|275px|Small molecule modulators of stem-cell fate.]]
The utility of stem-cells is in their ability to differentiate into all cell types that make up an organism. Differentiation can be achieved in vitro by favoring development toward a particular cell type through the addition of lineage specific growth factors, but this process is typically non-specific and generates low yields of the desired phenotype. Alternatively, inducing differentiation by small molecules is advantageous in that it allows for the development of completely chemically defined conditions for the generation of one specific cell type. A small molecule, neuropathiazol, has been identified which can specifically direct differentiation of multipotent [[neural stem cells]] into [[neurons]].&lt;ref name="pmid16323231"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warashina M, Min KH, Kuwabara T, Huynh A, Gage FH, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = A synthetic small molecule that induces neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Because of the ethical issues surrounding ESC research, the generation of pluripotent cells by reprogramming existing [[somatic cells]] into a more "stem-like" state is a promising alternative to the use of standard ESCs. By genetic approaches, this has recently been achieved in the creation of ESCs by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Egli D, Rosains J, Birkhoff G, Eggan K | title = Developmental reprogramming after chromosome transfer into mitotic mouse zygotes | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145 | pages = 679–85 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17554301 | doi = 10.1038/nature05879 |bibcode = 2007Natur.447..679E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the generation of [[induced pluripotent stem cell|induced pluripotent stem-cells]] by viral [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] of specific genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a therapeutic perspective, reprogramming by chemical means would be safer than genetic methods because induced stem-cells would be free of potentially dangerous [[transgenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anastasia L, Pelissero G, Venerando B, Tettamanti G | title = Cell reprogramming: Expectations and challenges for chemistry in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine | journal = Cell Death and Differentiation | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 1230–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20168332 | doi = 10.1038/cdd.2010.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples of small molecules that can de-differentiate somatic cells have been identified. In one report, lineage-committed [[myoblasts]] were treated with a compound, named reversine, and observed to revert to a more stem-like phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Zhang Q, Wu X, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = Dedifferentiation of Lineage-Committed Cells by a Small Molecule | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 410–1 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14719906 | doi = 10.1021/ja037390k }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells were then shown to be capable of differentiating into [[osteoblasts]] and [[adipocytes]] under appropriate conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid17566101"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Takanashi S, Zhang Q, Xiong W, Zhu S, Peters EC, Ding S, Schultz PG | title = Reversine increases the plasticity of lineage-committed mammalian cells | journal = Proc.

Stem-cell therapies are currently the most promising treatment for many [[degenerative diseases]]. Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology support the development of cell-based therapies by enhancing stem-cell growth, maintenance, and differentiation in vitro. Small molecules that have been shown to modulate stem-cell fate are potential therapeutic candidates and provide a natural lean-in to pre-clinical drug development. Small molecule drugs could promote endogenous stem-cells to differentiate, replacing previously damaged tissues and thereby enhancing the body's own [[regenerative medicine|regenerative]] ability. Further investigation of molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior will only unveil new therapeutic targets.

===Fluorescence for assessing protein location and function===

====Fluorophores and techniques to tag proteins====
Organisms are composed of cells that, in turn, are composed of macromolecules, e.g. proteins, ribosomes, etc. These macromolecules interact with each other, changing their concentration and suffering chemical modifications. The main goal of many biologists is to understand these interactions, using [[MRI]], ESR, [[electrochemistry]], and [[fluorescence]] among others. The advantages of fluorescence reside in its high sensitivity, non-invasiveness, safe detection, and ability to modulate the fluorescence signal. Fluorescence was observed mainly from small organic dyes attached to antibodies to the protein of interest. Later, fluorophores could directly recognize organelles, nucleic acids, and important ions in living cells. In the past decade, the discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP), by [[Roger Y. Tsien]], hybrid system and quantum dots have enable assessing protein location and function more precisely.&lt;ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Giepmans BNG)), Adams SR, Ellisman MH, Tsien RY | title = The Fluorescent Toolbox for Assessing Protein Location and Function | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5771 | pages = 217–224 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16614209 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124618 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..217G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of fluorophores are used: small organic dyes, green fluorescent proteins, and [[quantum dots]]. Small organic dyes usually are less than 1 kD, and have been modified to increase photostability, enhance brightness, and reduce self-quenching. Quantum dots have very sharp wavelength, high molar absorptivity and quantum yield. Both organic dyes and quantum dyes do not have the ability to recognize the protein of interest without the aid of antibodies, hence they must use [[immunolabeling]]. Since the size of the fluorophore-targeting complex typically exceeds 200 kD, it might interfere with multiprotein recognition in protein complexes, and other methods should be use in parallel.  An advantage includes diversity of properties and a limitation is the ability of targeting in live cells. Green fluorescent proteins are genetically encoded and can be covalently fused to your protein of interest. A more developed genetic tagging technique is the tetracysteine biarsenical system, which requires modification of the targeted sequence that includes four cysteines, which binds membrane-permeable biarsenical molecules, the green and the red dyes "FlAsH" and "ReAsH", with picomolar affinity. Both fluorescent proteins and biarsenical tetracysteine can be expressed in live cells, but present major limitations in ectopic expression and might cause lose of function. Giepmans shows parallel applications of targeting methods and fluorophores using GFP and tetracysteine with ReAsH for α-tubulin and β-actin, respectively. After fixation, cells were immunolabeled for the Golgi matrix with QD and for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome with Cy5.&lt;ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"/&gt;

====Protein dynamics====
Fluorescent techniques have been used assess a number of protein dynamics including protein tracking, conformational changes, protein–protein interactions, protein synthesis and turnover, and enzyme activity, among others.

Three general approaches for measuring protein net redistribution and diffusion are single-particle tracking, [[correlation spectroscopy]] and photomarking methods. In single-particle tracking, the individual molecule must be both bright and sparse enough to be tracked from one video to the other. Correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects into and out of a small volume at the focus of a laser. In photomarking, a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the marked molecule can be imaged directly. Michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single-particle tracking using biotin-quantum dots in HeLa cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalet X, Pinaud FF, Bentolila LA, Tsay JM, Doose S, Li JJ, Sundaresan G, Wu AM, Gambhir SS | title = Quantum Dots for Live Cells, in Vivo Imaging, and Diagnostics | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5709 | pages = 538–544 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15681376 | pmc = 1201471 | doi = 10.1126/science.1104274 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..538M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to sandwich said protein between two fluorophores. [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] will respond to internal conformational changes result from reorientation of the fluorophore with respect to the other. Dumbrepatil sandwiched an estrogen receptor between a CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and a YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) to study conformational changes of the receptor upon binding of a ligand.&lt;ref name="pmid20049819"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dave SR, Gao X | title = Monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles for biodetection, imaging, and drug delivery: a versatile and evolving technology | journal = Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 583–609 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20049819 | doi = 10.1002/wnan.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorophores of different colors can be applied to detect their respective antigens within the cell. If antigens are located close enough to each other, they will appear colocalized and this phenomenon is known as [[colocalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zinchuk V, Grossenbacher-Zinchuk O | title = Recent advances in quantitative colocalization analysis: Focus on neuroscience | journal = Progress in Histochemistry and Cytochemistry | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–72 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19822255 | doi = 10.1016/j.proghi.2009.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized computer software, such as [[CoLocalizer Pro]], can be used to confirm and characterize the degree of colocalization.

FRET can detect dynamic protein–protein interaction in live cells providing the fluorophores get close enough. Galperin ''et al.'' used three fluorescent proteins to study multiprotein interactions in live cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galperin E, Verkhusha VV, Sorkin A | title = Three-chromophore FRET microscopy to analyze multiprotein interactions in living cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–17 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15782196 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetracysteine biarsenical systems can be used to study protein synthesis and turnover, which requires discrimination of old copies from new copies. In principle, a tetracysteine-tagged protein is labeled with FlAsH for a short time, leaving green labeled proteins.  The protein synthesis is then carried out in the presence of ReAsH, labeling the new proteins as red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaietta G, Deerinck TJ, Adams SR, Bouwer J, Tour O, Laird DW, Sosinsky GE, Tsien RY, Ellisman MH | title = Multicolor and Electron Microscopic Imaging of Connexin Trafficking | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5567 | pages = 503–507 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11964472 | doi = 10.1126/science.1068793 |bibcode = 2002Sci...296..503G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also use fluorescence to see endogenous enzyme activity, typically by using a quenched [[activity based proteomics]] (qABP). Covalent binding of a qABP to the active site of the targeted enzyme will provide direct evidence concerning if the enzyme is responsible for the signal upon release of the quencher and regain of fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Terai T, Nagano T | title = Fluorescent probes for bioimaging applications | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 515–21 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18771748 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique combination of high spatial and temporal resolution, nondestructive compatibility with living cells and organisms, and molecular specificity insure that fluorescence techniques will remain central in the analysis of protein networks and systems biology.&lt;ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">'''Chemogenetics''' is the processes by which [[macromolecule]]s can be engineered to interact with previously unrecognized small molecules. Chemogenetics as a term was originally coined to describe the observed effects of mutations on [[chalcone isomerase]] activity on substrate specificities in the flowers of ''[[Dianthus caryophyllus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forkmann G, Dangelmayr B | title = Genetic control of chalcone isomerase activity in flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = 5-6 | pages = 519–27 | date = June 1980 | pmid = 7437010 | doi = 10.1007/bf00484399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is very similar to [[optogenetics]] however, it uses chemically engineered molecules and ligands instead of light and light-sensitive channels known as [[Opsin]]s.

In recent research projects, chemogenetics has been widely used to understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Prior to chemogenetics, researchers used methods such as [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)]] and [[Deep brain stimulation|deep brain stimulation (DBS)]] to study the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobrzanski G, Kossut M | title = Application of the DREADD technique in biomedical brain research | journal = Pharmacological Reports | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–221 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28092807 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharep.2016.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to optogenetics ==
[[Optogenetics]] and chemogenetics are the more recent and popular methods used to study this relationship. Both of these methods target specific brain circuits and cell population to influence cell activity. However, they use different procedures to accomplish this task. Optogenetics uses light-sensitive channels and pumps that are virally introduced into neurons. Cells' activity, having these channels, can then be manipulated by light. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, uses chemically engineered receptors and exogenous molecules specific for those receptors, to affect the activity of those cells. The engineered macromolecules used to design these receptors include [[Nucleic acid hybridization|nucleic acid hybrids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strobel SA, Ortoleva-Donnelly L, Ryder SP, Cate JH, Moncoeur E | title = Complementary sets of noncanonical base pairs mediate RNA helix packing in the group I intron active site | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–6 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9437431 | doi = 10.1038/nsb0198-60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[kinase]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishop AC, Shah K, Liu Y, Witucki L, Kung C, Shokat KM | title = Design of allele-specific inhibitors to probe protein kinase signaling | journal = Current Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–66 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9501066 | doi = 10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70198-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; variety of [[Metabolism|metabolic enzymes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collot J, Gradinaru J, Humbert N, Skander M, Zocchi A, Ward TR | title = Artificial metalloenzymes for enantioselective catalysis based on biotin-avidin | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 125 | issue = 30 | pages = 9030–1 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 15369356 | doi = 10.1021/ja035545i }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Häring D, Distefano MD | title = Enzymes by design: chemogenetic assembly of transamination active sites containing lysine residues for covalent catalysis | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11353536 | doi = 10.1021/bc000117c }}&lt;/ref&gt; and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as [[Receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|DREADDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strader CD, Gaffney T, Sugg EE, Candelore MR, Keys R, Patchett AA, Dixon RA | title = Allele-specific activation of genetically engineered receptors | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 266 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–8 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 1670767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coward P, Wada HG, Falk MS, Chan SD, Meng F, Akil H, Conklin BR | title = Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 352–7 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9419379 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.1.352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0223-5234(99)80094-4 |title=Engineering a region of bulk tolerance in the 5-HT2A receptor |journal=European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=441–447 |year=1999 |last1=Westkaemper |first1=Richard B |last2=Hyde |first2=Edward G |last3=Choudhary |first3=Mohammad S |last4=Khan |first4=Naseem |last5=Gelbar |first5=Edward I |last6=Glennon |first6=Richard A |last7=Roth |first7=Bryan L | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armbruster BN, Li X, Pausch MH, Herlitze S, Roth BL | title = Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 5163–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17360345 | pmc = 1829280 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700293104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DREADDs are the most common [[G protein–coupled receptor|GPCRs]] used in chemogenetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth BL | title = DREADDs for Neuroscientists | journal = Neuron | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 683–94 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26889809 | pmc = 4759656 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These receptors solely get activated by the drug of interest (inert molecule) and influence physiological and neural processes that take place within and outside of the central nervous system.

Chemogenetics has recently been favored over Optogenetics, and it avoids some of the challenges of Optogenetics. Chemogenetics does not require the expensive light equipment, and therefore, is more accessible. The resolution in Optogenetic declines due to light scattering and illuminance declined levels as the distance between the subject and the light source increases.These factors, therefore, don’t allow for all cells to be affected by light and lead to a lower spatial resolution. Chemogenetics, however, does not require light usage and therefore can achieve a higher spatial resolution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montgomery KL, Yeh AJ, Ho JS, Tsao V, Mohan Iyer S, Grosenick L, Ferenczi EA, Tanabe Y, Deisseroth K, Delp SL, Poon AS | title = Wirelessly powered, fully internal optogenetics for brain, spinal and peripheral circuits in mice | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 969–74 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26280330 | pmc = 5507210 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
GPCRs' usage and chemogenetics are nowadays the targets for many of the pharmaceutical companies to cure and alleviate symptoms of diseases that involve all tissues of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith RS, Hu R, DeSouza A, Eberly CL, Krahe K, Chan W, Araneda RC | title = Differential Muscarinic Modulation in the Olfactory Bulb | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 30 | pages = 10773–85 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26224860 | pmc = 4518052 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0099-15.2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, DREADDs have been used to explore treatment options for various neurodegenerative and psychological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, anxiety, and addiction. These aforementioned conditions involve processes that occur within and outside of the nervous system involving neurotransmitters such as [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[Glutamic acid|Glutamate]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkow ND, Koob GF, McLellan AT | title = Neurobiologic Advances from the Brain Disease Model of Addiction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 374 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26816013 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra1511480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemogenetics has therefore been used in pharmacology to adjust the levels of such neurotransmitters in specific neuron while minimizing the side effects of treatment. To treat and relieve the symptoms of any disease using the DREADDs, these receptors are delivered to the area of interest via viral transduction.

Recently some studies have considered using a new method called retro DREADDs. This method allows specific neuronal pathways to be studied under cellular resolution. Unlike classic DREADDs, this method is usually used in wild type animals, and these receptors are given to the targeted cells via injection of two viral vectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Animal Models ===
DREADDS have been used in many animal models (e.g., mice and other non-primate animals) to target and influence the activity of various cells . Chemogenetics used in animals assists with demonstrating human disease models such as [[Parkinson's disease]]. Having this information allows scientists understand whether viral expression of DREADD proteins, both in-vivo enhancers and inhibitors of neuronal function can be used to bidirectionally affect the behaviors and the activity of the involved neurons. Recent studies have shown that DREADDs were successfully used to treat the motor deficits of rats modeling Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pienaar IS, Gartside SE, Sharma P, De Paola V, Gretenkord S, Withers D, Elson JL, Dexter DT | title = Pharmacogenetic stimulation of cholinergic pedunculopontine neurons reverses motor deficits in a rat model of Parkinson's disease | journal = Molecular Neurodegeneration | volume = 10 | pages = 47 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26394842 | pmc = 4580350 | doi = 10.1186/s13024-015-0044-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have had successes linking the usage of DREADDs and influencing drug seeking and drug sensitization behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The progression of Chemogenetics from rodents to non-human primates has been slow due to increased demand in time and expense surrounding these projects.However, some recent studies in 2016 have been able to demonstrate successes showing that silencing the activity of neurons in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] along with the removal of [[Rhinal cortex]], restricted the reward task performance in macaques.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galvan A, Caiola MJ, Albaugh DL | title = Advances in optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to study brain circuits in non-human primates | journal = Journal of Neural Transmission | volume = 125 | issue = 3 | pages = 547–563 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 28238201 | pmc = 5572535 | doi = 10.1007/s00702-017-1697-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitation and future directions ==
Chemogenetics and usage of DREADDs have allowed researchers to advance in biomedical research areas including many [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] and psychiatric conditions. Chemogenetics have been used in these fields to induce specific and reversible brain lesions and therefore, study specific activities of neuron population. Although Chemogenetics offers specificity and high spatial resolution, it still faces some challenges when used in investigating [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders usually have a complex nature where lesions in the brain have not been identified as the main cause. Chemogenetics has been used to reverse some of the deficits revolving such conditions however, it hasn’t been able to identify the main cause of neuropsychiatric diseases and cure these conditions completely due to complex nature of these conditions. Nevertheless, chemogenetics has been used successfully in a preclinical model of drug-resistant [[Gene therapy for epilepsy|epilepsy]], where seizures arise from a discrete part of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kätzel D, Nicholson E, Schorge S, Walker MC, Kullmann DM | title = Chemical-genetic attenuation of focal neocortical seizures | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 5 | pages = 3847 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24866701 | pmc = 4050272 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms4847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) did considerable work over a period of years on the classification of sciences (including [[mathematics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See "Development of Peirce's classification of sciences - three stages: 1889, 1898, 1903" by Tommi Vehkavaara, 2003, {{cite web|url= http://www.uta.fi/~attove/peirce_syst.PDF |title=Eprint }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(19.4&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} and "The outline of Peirce's classification of sciences (1902-1911)" by Tommi Vehkavaara, 2001, {{cite web|url= http://www.uta.fi/~attove/peirce_systems3.PDF |title=Eprint }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(11.4&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; His classifications are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished [[polymath]]'s survey of research in his time. Peirce himself was well grounded and produced work in many research fields, including [[logic]], mathematics, [[statistics]], [[philosophy]], [[spectroscopy]], [[gravimetry]], [[geodesy]], [[chemistry]], and [[experimental psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2009), "Charles Sanders Peirce", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Eprint]. Also see Peirce's own list published 1906 in the entry "[[s:Peirce, C(harles) S|Peirce, C(harles) S]]" in v. 2, p. 248, ''American Men of Science'', J. McKern Cattell, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==

Philosophers have done little work on '''classification of the sciences''' and mathematics since Peirce's time. Noting Peirce's "important" contribution, [[Denmark]]'s [[Birger Hjørland]] commented: "There is not today (2005), to my knowledge, any organized research program about the classification of the sciences in any discipline or in any country".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Professor in knowledge orgnanization, library science. See faculty profile [http://www.iva.dk/omiva/medarbejdere/default.asp?cid=683&amp;tid=4 page] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Miksa (1998) writes, the "interest for this question largely died in the beginning of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;See Hjørland's comments [https://web.archive.org/web/20100324172907/http://www.db.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/classification_of_the_sciences.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether Hjørland includes the classification of mathematics in that characterization.

===Taxa===

In 1902 and 1903 Peirce elaborates classifications of the sciences in: 
*"A Detailed Classification of the Sciences" in ''Minute Logic'' (Feb.–Apr. 1902), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' (CP) v. 1, paragraphs 203–283&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textlog.de/4256.html Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 1902 application to the Carnegie institution (MS L75)&lt;ref&gt;''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"An Outline Classification of the Sciences (CP 1.180-202)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textlog.de/4257.html Eprint] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm  Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; in his "A Syllabus of Certain Topics in Logic" (1903), wherein his classifications of the sciences take more or less their final form

However, only in the "Detailed Classification" and the Carnegie application does he discuss the taxa which he used, which were inspired by the biological taxa of [[Louis Agassiz]].&lt;ref&gt;CP 1.229-230, (from the "Minute Logic", 1902), [http://www.textlog.de/4263.html Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| ''Class''&amp;nbsp;of science 
| Classes differ radically in observation. Observations in one class (say physical &amp; psychological sciences) cannot yield the kind of information which another class (say pure mathematics) requires of observation.

| ''Order''&amp;nbsp;of science 
| Two orders within one class or subclass may differ hierarchically, one more general, the other more specialized.&lt;ref name=CP1.238 /&gt; 
| Throughout an order, researchers pursue the ''same general kind of inquiry'' (but deal with different kinds of conceptions). 
| Peirce's 1902 example of various orders: General Physics. Biology. Geology. 
|-
| ''Family''&amp;nbsp;of science 
| Has special name, journal, society. Studies one group of facts. Researchers understand one another in a general way and naturally associate together. 
| Throughout a family, researchers have the ''same general conceptions'' (but differ in skills). 
| Peirce's 1902 example of various families: Astronomy. Geognosy.
|-
| ''Genus''&amp;nbsp;of science 
| rowspan=3 | "I can give no such definitions of genera and species, not having carried my classification of the sciences to these minutiae" (of ''definitions'' of taxa; he does use the genus taxon).

| Peirce's 1902 example of various genera: Optics. Electrics. 
|-
| ''Species''&amp;nbsp;of science 
| The species is the narrowest division still having societies and journals, each researcher is thoroughly well qualified in all parts of it. 
| Peirce's 1902 example of various species: Entomology. Ichthyology. 
|-
| ''Variety''&amp;nbsp;of science 
| Researchers devote lives to a variety of science, but not so numerously as to support distinct societies and journals.
| Peirce's 1902 example of various varieties: Study of Kant. Study of Spinoza.

===Sciences===

In 1902, he divided science into Theoretical and Practical.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), Manuscript L75.355, Application to the Carnegie Institute, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical Science consisted of Science of Discovery and Science of Review, the latter of which he also called "Synthetic Philosophy", a name taken from the title of the vast work, written over many years, by [[Herbert Spencer]]. Then, in 1903, he made it a three-way division: Science of Discovery, Science of Review, and Practical Science.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), CP 1.181, [http://www.textlog.de/4257.html Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he characterized Science of Review as:&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), CP 1.182 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm  Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...arranging the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science. Such is the nature of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s ''[[Alexander Von Humboldt#The .22Cosmos.22|Cosmos]]'', of [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s ''Philosophie positive'', and of [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s ''Synthetic Philosophy''. The classification of the sciences belongs to this department.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peirce had already for a while divided the Sciences of Discovery into:
:(1) Mathematics – draws necessary conclusions about hypothetical objects
:(2) Cenoscopy – philosophy about positive phenomena in general, such as confront a person at every waking moment, rather than special classes, and not settling theoretical issues by special experiences or experiments&lt;ref name=Bentham&gt;Peirce borrows the terms "cenoscopy" and "idioscopy" from [[Jeremy Bentham]]. See Peirce: (1902) CP 1.239-241; (1903) CP 1.183-187; (c. 1903) CP 6.6; and (1905) CP 8.199.&lt;/ref&gt;
:(3) Idioscopy – the special sciences, about special classes of positive phenomena, and settling theoretical issues by special experiences or experiments&lt;ref name=Bentham/&gt;
Thus Peirce ends up framing two fields each of which is philosophy in a sense: cenoscopic philosophy which precedes the special sciences, and synthetic philosophy (that is to say, science of review), which does take advantage of the results of all the sciences of discovery and develops, for instance, classifications of the sciences.

Peirce opens his 1903 classification (the "Syllabus" classification) with a concise statement of method and purpose:&lt;ref&gt;The ''Collected Peirce'' (CP), v. 1, paragraph 180 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm  Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This classification, which aims to base itself on the principal affinities of the objects classified, is concerned not with all possible sciences, nor with so many branches of knowledge, but with sciences in their present condition, as so many businesses of groups of living men. It borrows its idea from Comte's classification; namely, the idea that one science depends upon another for fundamental principles, but does not furnish such principles to that other. It turns out that in most cases the divisions are trichotomic; the First of the three members relating to universal elements or laws, the Second arranging classes of forms and seeking to bring them under universal laws, the Third going into the utmost detail, describing individual phenomena and endeavoring to explain them. But not all the divisions are of this character....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following table is based mostly on Peirce's 1903 classification, which was more or less the final form. But see after the table for discussion of his later remarks on the divisions of logic.

====Logic's divisions later====

In a piece which the ''Collected Papers'' editors called "Phaneroscopy" and dated as 1906, Peirce wrote (CP 4.9):&lt;ref&gt;A fuller version of the quote is at Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/stecheotic.html Stecheotic, Stoicheiology].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...I extend logic to embrace all the necessary principles of semeiotic, and I recognize a logic of icons, and a logic of indices, as well as a logic of symbols; and in this last I recognize three divisions: ''Stecheotic'' (or stoicheiology), which I formerly called Speculative Grammar; ''Critic'', which I formerly called Logic; and ''Methodeutic'', which I formerly called Speculative Rhetoric}}
Thus the three main 1903 departments of logic were now sub-departments of the study of the logic of symbols.

In a letter to J. H. Kehler, printed in ''The New Elements of Mathematics'' v.3, p.&amp;nbsp;207 and dated 1911,&lt;ref&gt;It can be viewed at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'' under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/analytic.html Analytic].&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote:
{{quote|I have now sketched my doctrine of Logical Critic, skipping a good deal. I recognize two other parts of Logic. One which may be called Analytic examines the nature of thought, not psychologically but simply to define what it is to doubt, to believe, to learn, etc., and then to base critic  on these definitions is my real method, though in this letter I have taken the third branch of logic, Methodeutic, which shows how to conduct an inquiry. This is what the greater part of my life has been devoted to, though I base it upon Critic.}}

|- valign=top 
|Peirce in 1902, 1903: &lt;br&gt;Logic (begins on general level &lt;br&gt;with presuppositions of reason, &lt;br&gt;logical conception of mind, &lt;br&gt;nature of belief &amp; doubt, etc.).&lt;br&gt;A. Stechiology &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; (classes of signs &amp; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; their combinations). &lt;br&gt;B. Critic &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; (modes of argument). &lt;br&gt;C. Methodeutic &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; (methods of inquiry). ||Peirce in 1906: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. Logic of icons. &lt;br&gt;B. Logic of indices. &lt;br&gt;C. Logic of symbols. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; C1. Stechiotic. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; C2. Critic. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; C3. Methodeutic. ||Peirce in 1911: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. Analytic &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; (what it is to doubt, &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; to believe, to learn). &lt;br&gt;B. Critic. &lt;br&gt;C. Methodeutic.
|}
There in 1911 Peirce does not mention the 1906 division into logics of icons, indices and symbols. Critic and Methodeutic appear, as in 1902 and 1903, as the second and third main departments of logic. Analytic is now the first department and the word "Stechiology" goes unused. He includes in Analytic the consideration of issues which, back in his 1902 Carnegie Institute application, he had discussed in sections on logic with headings such as "Presuppositions of Logic"&lt;ref&gt;Memoir 10. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; and "On the Logical Conception of Mind"&lt;ref&gt;Memoir 11. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; that he had placed before the sections on logic's departments (stechiology, critic, and methodeutic).&lt;ref&gt;Memoir 13. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m13 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of the relationship between Stechiology and the Analytic that seems to have replaced it, note that, in Draft D of Memoir 15 in his 1902 Carnegie Institute application, Peirce said that stechiology, also called ''{{lang|la|grammatica speculativa}}'', amounts to an ''{{lang|de|Erkenntnisslehre}}'', a theory of cognition, provided that that theory is stripped of matter irrelevant and inadmissible in philosophical logic, irrelevant matter such as all truths (for example, the association of ideas) established by psychologists, insofar as the special science of psychology depends on logic, not vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-06.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; In that same Carnegie Institute application as in many other places, Peirce treated belief and doubt as issues of philosophical logic apart from psychology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Coastal Observatory''' in Liverpool Bay is housed at the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] in Brownlow Street
[[Liverpool]], [[England]].

== Objectives ==
The objective of the Coastal Observatory is to study a typical coastal sea's response both to natural forces and to the effects of human activity. The Observatory integrates real-time data measurements with data from models into a "pre-operational coastal prediction system"&lt;sup&gt;[http://cobs.pol.ac.uk/cobsadmin/about.html]&lt;/sup&gt; whose results will be displayed on the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site].

The concept is founded on obtaining data in real time, using telemetry, sending the data from underwater to the sea surface, to land, to the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] to the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site], enabling what is often known as 'armchair oceanography'.

The aim of the Coastal Observatory is to build a time series of data. The Observatory has a particular interest in such areas as storm surges, seasonality, and variations in river discharge, with an emphasis on the River Mersey.

== Measurements ==
August 2007 marked five years of continuous running of the Coastal Observatory in Liverpool Bay, taking measurements such as:
*In situ time series of current, temperature and salinity profiles and of waves and weather. A second site, and measurements of turbidity and chlorophyll are now also operational.
*The [http://www.cefas.co.uk/Products/smartbuoy.htm CEFAS SmartBuoy] for surface properties including nutrients and chlorophyll.
*Instrumented ferries for near surface temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll and later, nutrient data. The first route was Liverpool to Douglas (Isle of Man), with the ferry travelling between Birkenhead (Liverpool) and Dublin (Ireland)
*Drifters, measuring surface currents and properties such as temperature and salinity.
*Tide gauges, with sensors for meteorological, waves, temperature and salinity data, where appropriate.
*Meteorological data from HF radar and tide gauge sites.
*Shore-base HF radar measuring waves and surface currents out to a range of 50&amp;nbsp;km.
*Satellite data - infra-red (for [[sea surface temperature]]) and visible (for chlorophyll and suspended sediment) spectra.

'''Dielectric loss''' quantifies a [[dielectric material]]'s inherent dissipation of electromagnetic energy (e.g. heat).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be parameterized in terms of either the '''loss angle''' ''δ'' or the corresponding '''loss tangent''' tan&amp;nbsp;''δ''.  Both refer to the [[phasor]] in the [[complex plane]] whose real and imaginary parts are the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] (lossy) component of an electromagnetic field and its [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] (lossless) counterpart.

==Electromagnetic field perspective==

For time varying electromagnetic fields, the electromagnetic energy is typically viewed as waves propagating either through free space, in a [[transmission line]], in a [[microstrip]] line, or through a [[waveguide]].  Dielectrics are often used in all of these environments to mechanically support electrical conductors and keep them at a fixed separation, or to provide a barrier between different gas pressures yet still transmit electromagnetic power.  [[Maxwell’s equations]] are solved for the electric and magnetic field components of the propagating waves that satisfy the boundary conditions of the specific environment's geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=S. |last1=Ramo |first2=J.R. |last2=Whinnery |first3=T. |last3=Van Duzer |title=Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |date=1994 |ISBN=0-471-58551-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such electromagnetic analyses, the parameters [[permittivity]] ''ε'', [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] ''μ'', and [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] ''σ'' represent the properties of the media through which the waves propagate.  The permittivity can have real and imaginary components (the latter excluding ''σ'' effects, see below) such that

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \varepsilon' - j \varepsilon'' &lt;/math&gt; .

If we assume that we have a wave function such that

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E = \mathbf E_{o}e^{j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;,

then Maxwell's curl equation for the magnetic field can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \mathbf H = j \omega \varepsilon' \mathbf E + ( \omega \varepsilon'' + \sigma )\mathbf E &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε′′'' is the imaginary component of permittivity attributed to ''bound'' charge and dipole relaxation phenomena, which gives rise to energy loss that is indistinguishable from the loss due to the ''free'' charge conduction that is quantified by ''σ''.  The component ''ε′'' represents the familiar lossless permittivity given by the product of the ''free space'' permittivity and the ''relative'' real/absolute permittivity, or ''ε′''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''ε′''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.  The '''loss tangent''' is then defined as the ratio (or angle in a complex plane) of the lossy reaction to the electric field '''E''' in the curl equation to the lossless reaction:

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \frac{\omega \varepsilon'' + \sigma} {\omega \varepsilon'} &lt;/math&gt; .

For dielectrics with small loss, this angle is ≪&amp;nbsp;1 and tan&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''δ''.  After some further calculations to obtain the solution for the fields of the electromagnetic wave, it turns out that the power decays with propagation distance ''z'' as
:&lt;math&gt;P = P_o e^{-\delta k z}&lt;/math&gt;, where:
:*''P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the initial power,
:*&lt;math&gt;k = \omega \sqrt{\mu \varepsilon'} = \tfrac {2 \pi} {\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;,
:*''ω'' is the angular frequency of the wave, and
:*''λ'' is the wavelength in the dielectric material.

There are often other contributions to power loss for electromagnetic waves that are not included in this expression, such as due to the wall currents of the conductors of a transmission line or waveguide. Also, a similar analysis could be applied to the magnetic permeability where

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \mu' - j \mu'' &lt;/math&gt; ,

with the subsequent definition of a '''magnetic loss tangent'''

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta_m = \frac{\mu''} {\mu'} &lt;/math&gt; .

The electric loss tangent can be similarly defined:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vmUdUXlBNIC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;f=false|first1= L. F. |last1=Chen |first2=C. K. |last2=Ong |first3=C. P. |last3=Neo |first4=V. V. |last4=Varadan |first5=Vijay K. |last5=Varadan|title=Microwave Electronics: Measurement and Materials Characterization|at=eq. (1.13)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta_e = \frac{\varepsilon''} {\varepsilon'} &lt;/math&gt;,

upon introduction of an effective dielectric conductivity (see [[relative permittivity#Lossy medium]]).

==Discrete circuit perspective==

For every discrete electrical circuit components, a [[capacitor]] is typically made of a dielectric placed between conductors.  The [[lumped element model]] of a capacitor includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR), as shown in the figure below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliablecapacitors.com/consider.htm |title=Considerations for a High Performance Capacitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESR represents losses in the capacitor.  In a low-loss capacitor the ESR is very small (the conduction is low leading to a high resistivity), and in a lossy capacitor the ESR can be large.  Note that the ESR is ''not'' simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an [[ohmmeter]].  The ESR is a derived quantity representing the loss due to both the dielectric's conduction electrons and the bound dipole relaxation phenomena mentioned above.  In a dielectric, one of the conduction electrons or the [[Dielectric spectroscopy#Dipole relaxation|dipole relaxation]] typically dominates loss in a particular dielectric and manufacturing method.  For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon' \omega^2 C} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the lossless capacitance.

[[Image:Loss tangent phasors 1.svg|frame|A real capacitor has a lumped element model of a lossless ideal capacitor in series with an equivalent series resistance (ESR). The loss tangent is defined by the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis.]]

When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a [[Complex number|complex]] plane, known as [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]], a capacitor's '''loss tangent''' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the adjacent diagram.  The loss tangent is then

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \frac {\mathrm{ESR}} {|X_{c}|} = \omega C \cdot \mathrm{ESR} = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon' \omega} &lt;/math&gt; .

Since the same [[alternating current|AC]] current flows through both ''ESR'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', the loss tangent is also the ratio of the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] power loss in the ESR to the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] power oscillating in the capacitor.  For this reason, a capacitor's loss tangent is sometimes stated as its ''[[dissipation factor]]'', or the reciprocal of its ''[[quality factor]] Q'', as follows

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \delta = \mathrm{DF} = \frac {1} {Q} &lt;/math&gt;  .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20872">{{Critical pedagogy}}
The '''ecopedagogy''' movement is an outgrowth of the theory and practice of [[critical pedagogy]], a body of educational praxis influenced by the philosopher and educator [[Paulo Freire]]. Ecopedagogy's mission is to develop a robust appreciation for the collective potentials of humanity and to foster social justice throughout the world. It does so as part of a future-oriented, ecological and political vision that radically opposes the globalization of ideologies such as [[neoliberalism]] and [[imperialism]], while also attempting to foment forms of critical [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of ecopedagogy's goals is the realization of culturally relevant forms of knowledge grounded in normative concepts such as [[sustainability]], planetarity (i.e. identifying as an earthling) and biophilia (i.e. love of all life).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Early history==
The ecopedagogy movement began in a Latin American educational context, growing out of discussions at the second [[Earth Summit]], held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators desired to present a theory and discourse about the interrelationship between society and the environment, a statement would eventually be ratified as the [[Earth Charter]] in 2000. &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. 2000. ''Pedagogia da Terra''. São Paulo, Brazil: Peiropolis.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the First International Symposium on the Earth Charter in the Perspective of Education was held by the [http://www.paulofreire.org/ Instituto Paulo Freire, Brasil] directed by Moacir Gadotti and in collaboration with the Earth Council and [[UNESCO]]. This was soon followed by the First International Forum on Ecopedagogy. As a result of these conferences, the Ecopedagogy Charter was also formed, launching the spread of ecopedagogy seminars and programs around the world. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Objectives and aims==

Ecopedagogy's primary goal is to create a "planetary consciousness" through revolutionary teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2004|title=Revitalizing the Commons or an Individualized Approach to Planetary Citizenship: The Choice Before Us|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=36:1|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement aims to create educational programs that interrogate the intersection of social, political, economic and environmental systems. As an outgrowth of critical pedagogy, ecopedagogy critiques [[environmental education]] and [[education for sustainable development]] as vain attempts by mainstream forms of pedagogy seeking to appear relevant regarding current issues of environmental degradation. &lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Richard. (2008). ''From Education for Sustainable Development to Ecopedagogy: Sustaining Capitalism or Sustaining Life?'' Green Theory &amp; Praxis: The Journal of Ecopedagogy. 4:1&lt;/ref&gt; It is critical of mainstream representations of nature that are potentially informed by racist, sexist, and classist values, &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and wary of the tendency of "[[greenwashing]]" of environmental terminology. &lt;ref&gt;Bowers, C.A. 2010. Educational Reforms that Foster Ecological Intelligence. ''Education and the Environment'' Vol. 37, No. 4, pp. 9–31&lt;/ref&gt; 

While members of the ecopedagogy movement recognize that environmental education can accomplish some positive change, they question the ways in which environmental education (especially within global north) is often reduced to forms of experiential pedagogy and [[outdoor education]] without questioning the mainstream experience of nature as pristine wilderness. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ecopedagogy points out that environmental education is often tethered to state and corporate-sponsored science and social studies standards or fails to articulate the political necessity for widespread understanding of the unsustainable nature of modern lifestyles'''.''' However, ecopedagogy has tried to utilize the ongoing United Nations Decade of Educational for Sustainable Development (2005–2015) to make strategic interventions on behalf of the oppressed, using it as an opportunity to unpack and clarify the concept of [[Sustainable development|sustainable development.]]

Ecopedagogy scholar Richard Kahn describes the three main goals of the ecopedagogy movement to be:

# Creating opportunities for the proliferation of ecoliteracy programs, both within schools and society.
# Bridging the gap of praxis between scholars and the public (especially activists) on ecopedagogical interests.
# Instigating dialogue and self-reflective solidarity across the many groups among educational left, particularly in light of the existing planetary crisis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Angela Antunes and Moacir Gadotti (2005) write:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecopedagogy is not just another pedagogy among many other pedagogies. It not only has meaning as an alternative project concerned with nature preservation (Natural Ecology) and the impact made by human societies on the natural environment (Social Ecology), but also as a new model for sustainable civilization from the ecological point of view (Integral Ecology), which implies making changes on economic, social, and cultural structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Social movement theory|social movement theorists]] Ron Ayerman and Andrew Jamison, there are three broad dimensions of environmentally related movements: cosmological, technological, and organizational.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ecopedagogy, these dimensions are outlined by Richard Kahn (2010) as the following:

* The cosmological dimension focuses on how [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy]], i.e. understanding the natural systems that sustain life, can transform people’s worldviews. For example, assumptions about society’s having the right to exploit nature can be transformed into understanding of the need for ecological balance to support society in the long term. The success of such ‘cosmological’ thinking transformations can be assessed by the degree to which such paradigm shifts are adopted by the public.
* The technological dimension is two-fold: critiquing the set of polluting technologies that have contributed to traditional development as well as some which are used or misused under the pretext of sustainable development; and promoting clean technologies that do not interfere with ecological and social balance.
* The organizational dimension emphasizes that knowledge should be of and for the people, thus academics should be in dialogue with public discourse and social movements. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Discussion of term in literature==

Ecopedagogy is not the collection of theories or practices developed by any particular set of individuals. Rather, akin to the [[World Social Forum]] and other related forms of contemporary popular education strategies, it is a worldwide association of critical educators, theorists, non-governmental and governmental organizations, grassroots activists and concerned citizens who engage in ongoing dialogue and political action. This process attempts to develop ecopedagogical praxis in relation to the needs of particular places, groups and time periods.

The earliest use of the term "ecopedagogy" may have been by de Haan (1984) in a now little known German text &lt;ref&gt;de Haan, G. 1984. Die Schwierigkeiten der Padagogik. In Beer &amp; de Haan (Eds.), ''Okopadagogik. Aufstehen gegen den Untergang der Natur''. Weinheim, Basel: Beltz: pp.&amp;nbsp;77–91.&lt;/ref&gt;. Shortly thereafter, in the first known English use of the term, Gronemeyer (1987) described ecopedagogy as the merging of environmentalist politics and adult education. &lt;ref&gt;Gronemeyer, M. 1987. Ecological Education a Failing Practice? Or: Is the Ecological Movement an Educational Movement? In W. Lierman &amp; J. Kulich (Eds.), Adult Education and the Challenge of the 1990s. London: Croom Helm.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecopedagogy has also been discussed by Ahlberg (1998) &lt;ref&gt;Ahlberg, M. 1998. Ecopedagogy and Ecodidactics: Education for Sustainable Development, Good Environment and Good Life. ''Bulletins of the Faculty of Education''. No: 69.University of Joensuu.&lt;/ref&gt; ; Jardine (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Jardine, D. W. 2000. ''“Under the Tough Old Stars”: Ecopedagogical Essays''. Brandon, Vermont: Solomon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;; Petrina (2000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrina|first1=S|year=2000|title=The Political Ecology of Design and Technology Education: An Inquiry into Methods|url=|journal=International Journal of Technology and Design Education|volume=10|issue=3|pages=207–237|doi=10.1023/a:1008955016067}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Yang &amp; Hung (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=S. K.|last2=Hung|first2=R.|year=2004|title=Towards Construction of an Ecopedagogy Based on the Philosophy of Ecocentrism|url=|journal=Journal of Taiwan Normal University|volume=49|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and Payne (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=P|year=2005|title=Growing Up Green|url=|journal=Journal of the HEIA|volume=12|issue=3|pages=2–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The work of Lummis (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lummis|first1=G|year=2002|title=Globalisation: Building a Partnership Ethic for an Ecopedagogy in Western Australia|url=|journal=The Australian Journal of Teacher Education|volume=27|issue=1|doi=10.14221/ajte.2002v27n1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; shares some sympathies, such as a critical theory approach.

Ironically, at the same time it was coined by Freire's friend-cum-critic [[Ivan Illich]] (1988) to describe an educational process in which educators and educands become inscribed in abstract pedagogical systems, resulting in pedagogy as an end and not a means.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. 1988. Ecopedagogia. ''Alternativas II''. Mexico: Joaquín Mortiz / Planeta.&lt;/ref&gt; As used by Illich, ecopedagogy is represented by forms of education that seek the total administration of life through mandatory pedagogical experiences of systemization. As such, he believed that the movements for lifelong education and the creation of global classrooms (Illich &amp; Verne, 1981) by bureaucratic educational institutions exemplified such approaches. However, he was also critical of popular environmentalist pedagogy attempting to mobilize people's sentiments for solutions to problems such as global warming, hunger, and rainforest destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. &amp; E. Verne. 1981. ''Imprisoned in the Global Classroom''. London: Writers &amp; Readers.&lt;/ref&gt; Illich's point was that such an ecopedagogy works on a problems/solutions axis that implies a global [[managerialism]] that is abhorrent to truly sustainable living in the world. This is a different idea from the way the term and concept is being defined and utilized in critical education circles today, though it is potentially of great importance for the future development of the ecopedagogy movement on the whole.

[[Paulo Freire]] was himself at work on a book of ecopedagogy upon his death in 1997, parts of which are included in his posthumous ''Pedagogy of Indignation'' (2004). &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. 2004. ''Pedagogy of Indignation''. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential books include: Francisco Gutierrez and Cruz Prado's ''Ecopedagogy and Planetary Citizenship'' (1999), &lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, F. &amp; C. Prado. 1999. ''Ecopedagogia e Cidadania Planetaria''. São Paulo, Brazil: Cortez.&lt;/ref&gt; Moacir Gadotti's ''Pedagogy of the Earth'' (2000), &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gadotti, M. 2003. Pedagogy of the Earth and the Culture of Sustainability. Paper presented at Lifelong Learning, Participatory Democracy and Social Change: Local and Global Perspectives conference, Toronto, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Kahn's ''Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement''. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kahn, Richard. Ecopedagogy: An Introduction. Counterpoints, Vol. 359, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: the Ecopedagogy Movement. (2010), pp. 1–33.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Criticisms ==
Both supporters and critics of ecopedagogy agree that historically, critical educators in the West have been largely unsuccessful at addressing environmental issues in their classrooms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaren and Houston|first=|date=2005|title=Revolutionary Ecologies: Ecosocialism and Critical Pedagogy|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=37:2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much disagreement still exists between critics and supporters of ecopedagogy on the ethics, theoretical approach, and methodology of this pedagogical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houston, D and McLaren, P.|first=|date=2005|title=The Nature of Political Amnesia: A Response to C.A. 'Chet' Bowers|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=196-214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic, C.A. Bowers, argues that if ecopedagogy (and the larger critical pedagogy of Freire and Gadotti) were universally adopted, it would contribute to the hegemonic spread of Western culture and systems, thereby choking out non-Western ways of thinking, viewing, and interacting with the human and built environments. Bowers further argues that adoption of Freirean ecopedagogy would hasten the existence of a world monoculture and would fail to address the systemic roots of the current ecological crisis and fail to protect the commons from further exploitation.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2005|title=How Peter McLaren and Donna Houston, and Other "Green" Marxists Contribute to the Globalization of the West's Industrial Culture|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=37:2|pages=185–195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, ecopedagogy is akin to an educational Trojan horse that is little more than a vehicle for transmitting Western culture and domination. 

Moderate critics of ecopedagogy argue that the critical lens of ecopedagogy can be useful, but that its adherents must be actively critical of ecopedagogy itself. They argue that without a constant focus on understanding and fostering diversity in thought, culture, and ecosystem, ecopedagogy is meaningless and could be counter-productive to its aims.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruenewald|first=David A.|date=2005|title=More than one profound truth: Making sense of divergent criticalities|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=206-214|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecopedagogy (and critical pedagogy) has also been heavily criticized for not being critical of the categories that underlie its work. Here, critics argue that in valuing individualism, ecopedagogy fails to attend to traditional eco-centered cultures' already deep connection to the non-human world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=C.A.|date=2012|title=Questioning the idea of the individual as an autonomous moral agent|url=|journal=Journal of Moral Education|volume=41:3|pages=301-310|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some scholars from the eco- and critical pedagogical traditions fail to recognize how the "primary categories in classical liberal thought may operate in the discourse of critical pedagogy".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martisewicz|first=Rebecca|date=2005|title=On Acknowledging Differences that Make a Difference: My Two Cents|url=|journal=Educational Studies|volume=|pages=215-224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecopedagogy in action ==
Ecopedagogy emphasizes the necessity of praxis alongside theory. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gaard, G. (2009). ''Children’s environmental literature: from ecocriticism to ecopedagogy.'' Neohelicon 36:321–334.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the specific ecopedagogy degree programs and Paulo Freire Institutes, there are many instances of ecological education that not only teach people the critical thinking of ecopedagogy but also engage them in learning through action. For example, a study conducted with 10-year-old children in West Scotland concluded that interactive dramatic education was successful in engaging students in ecological, social, and political dimensions of global problems such as solid waste and deforestation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;McNaughton, M.J. (2010). ''Educational drama in education for sustainable development: ecopedagogy in action.'' Pedagogy, Culture &amp; Society. 18:3, 289-308.&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic exercises required to make a decision or take a stance, thus strengthening their understanding and conviction of the issues. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; And ecopedagogy is not limited to formal students; in Turkey, for example, participatory action research showed that an outdoor community-based ecopedagogy program for university professors was successful in the "promotion of public participation, the engagement of students, teacher and parents in local environmental issues, and the development of social capital to achieve environmental sustainability. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By situating local knowledge within critical pedagogy and social activism, these projects can help universities to bridge the gap between academia and society."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Mustafa, Y.U. et al. (2010). A Participatory Action Research Study of Nature Education in Nature: Towards Community-based Eco-pedagogy. International Journal of Progressive Education. 6:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greta Gaard outlines the necessity for children's environmental literature to encompass the following core aspects of ecopedagogy:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* praxis
* teaching ABOUT the social and natural environment
* teaching IN the social and natural environment
* teaching THROUGH the social and natural environment
* teaching the connections of sustainability
* urgency &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The question of technology had become increasingly pertinent. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kahn, Richard. Technological Transformation as Ecopedagogy: Reconstructing Technoliteracy. Counterpoints, Vol. 359, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: the Ecopedagogy Movement. (2010), pp. 61–80&lt;/ref&gt; While the production and consumption of technology largely has a negative effect on the environment and certain aspects of society-environment relations, technology still provides certain new avenues in ecopedagogy. For example, more people have access to information and collaboration through the internet and thus can engage in informal ecological education faster and in wider spheres. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similarly, community projects to install solar panels or wind turbines or simple technology that help farms to transition to agroecology are examples of the uses of technology in ecopedagogy.

{{Literature}}
An '''epic poem''', '''epic''', '''epos''', or '''epopee'''  is a lengthy [[narrative poem]], ordinarily involving a time beyond living memory in which occurred the extraordinary doings of the extraordinary men and women who, in dealings with the gods or other superhuman forces, gave shape to the moral universe that their descendants, the poet and his audience, must understand to understand themselves as a people or nation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'' (Bedford: St. Martin's, 2005), 2128. {{ISBN|0312412428}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of epic poetry is [[epyllion]] (plural: epyllia), which is a brief narrative poem with a [[romanticism|romantic]] or [[Mythology|mythological]] [[Theme (literature)|theme]]. The term, which means "little [[:wikt:epic|epic]]", came into use in the nineteenth century. It refers primarily to the erudite, shorter hexameter poems of the [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic period]] and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the [[neoteric]]s; to a lesser degree, the term includes some poems of the [[English Renaissance]], particularly those influenced by [[Ovid]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] epyllion is perhaps [[Catullus 64]].

==Etymology==
The English word ''epic'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''epicus'', which itself comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|ἐπικός}} (''epikos''), from {{lang|grc|ἔπος}} (''epos''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | epic | id=63237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "word, story, poem".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epic Epic] Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originating before the invention of writing, primary epics were composed by bards who used complex rhetorical and metrical schemes by which they could memorize the epic as received in tradition and add to the epic in their performances. Hence aside from writers like Dante, Camões, and Milton, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in his ''[[Argonautica]]'' and Virgil in ''[[Aeneid]]'' adopted and adapted [[Homer]]'s [[Parallels between Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|style and subject matter]], but used devices available only to those who write, and in their works [[Nonnus|Nonnus' ''Dionysiaca'']] and [[Tulsidas]]' ''[[Sri Ramacharit Manas]]'' also used stylistic elements typical of epics.

The oldest epic recognized is the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa|2500–1300 BCE}}), which was recorded In ancient [[Sumer]] during the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The poem details the exploits of [[Gilgamesh]], the king of [[Uruk]]. Although recognized as a historical figure, Gilgamesh, as represented in the epic, is a largely legendary or mythical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lawall |editor1-first=Sarah N. |editor2-last=Mack |editor2-first=Maynard |date=1999 |title=Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces: The Western Tradition |volume=1 |edition=7 |url= |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton |pages=10–11 |isbn=978-0393972894 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest epic written is the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which consists of 100,000 [[śloka]]s or over 200,000 verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), as well as long prose passages, so that at about 1.8 million words it is about four times the length of the ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', and roughly ten times the length of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&amp;pg=PA399|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0823931798|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SharmaGaur2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.R.S.

Richard Mason. ''The World's History''. Pearson Education: 2006, New Jersey. 224, {{ISBN|0131773186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous examples of epic poetry include the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',  the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', the Tamil ''[[Silappatikaram]]'', the Persian ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the Ancient Greek ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'',  the Old English ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'',  the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'', the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the French ''[[Song of Roland]]'', the Spanish ''[[Cantar de mio Cid]]'', Camões' [[Os Lusíadas|Os ''Lusíadas'']], [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and Adam Mickiewicz's ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''.

==Oral epics==
The first epics were products of [[literacy|preliterate]] [[societies]] and [[oral history]] poetic traditions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Oral tradition]] was used alongside written scriptures to communicate and facilitate the spread culture.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0521337946 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these traditions, poetry is transmitted to the audience and from performer to performer by purely oral means. Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the [[Balkans]] by [[Milman Parry]] and Albert Lord demonstrated the [[Parataxis|paratactic]] model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of [[Homer]] was dictation from an oral performance.

[[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' and Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic poetry employs a meter called [[dactylic hexameter]] and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') or mental (as typified by Achilles in the ''[[Iliad]]'') or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to [[heroism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Composition and conventions===

In his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry, contrasted with [[lyric poetry]] and with drama in the form of tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle: Poetics'', translated with an introduction and notes by M. Heath, (Penguin) London 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Handbook to Literature'' (1999), Harmon and Holman define an epic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race. (Harmon and Holman)&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An attempt to delineate ten main characteristics of an epic:&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"&gt;Taken from William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman, A Handbook to Literature, 8th ed., Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Begins [[in medias res]].
# The setting is vast, covering many nations, the world or the universe.
# Begins with an invocation to a [[muse]] (epic invocation).
# Begins with a statement of the theme.
# Includes the use of [[epithets]].
# Contains long lists, called an [[epic catalogue]].
# Features long and formal speeches.
# Shows divine intervention on human affairs.
# Features heroes that embody the values of the civilization.
# Often features the tragic hero's descent into the [[underworld]] or [[hell]].

The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey and returns home significantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates [[Characteristics of Epic Heroes|traits]], performs deeds, and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from. Many epic heroes are [[recurring character]]s in the legends of their native culture.

Conventions of epics:{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''Proposition'': Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed "to justify the ways of God to men"); of a question (as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', which [[Homer]] initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles' anger); or of a situation (as in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Song of Roland]]'', with [[Charlemagne]] in Spain).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''[[Invocation]]'': Writer invokes a [[Muse]], one of the nine daughters of [[Zeus]]. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battles|first=Paul|date=2014|title=Toward a Theory of Old English Poetic Genres: Epic, Elegy, Wisdom Poetry, and the "Traditional Opening"|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy|volume=111,1|pages=1–34|doi=10.1353/sip.2014.0001|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This convention is restricted to cultures influenced by European Classical culture. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', for example, or the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' do not contain this element.)
# ''[[In medias res]]'': narrative opens "in the middle of things", with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.
# ''[[Enumeratio]]'': Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.
# ''[[Epithet]]'': Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., [[Epithets in Homer|Homer]]'s "rosy-fingered dawn" and "wine-dark sea".

== Form ==
Many verse forms have been used in epic poems through the ages, but each language's literature typically gravitates to one form, or at least to a very limited set. Ancient Sumerian epic poems did not use any kind of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] and [[Line (poetry)|lines]] did not have consistent lengths;&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"&gt;{{citation|last=Kramer|first=Samuel Noah|author-link=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0226452388|pages=184–185|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, Sumerian poems derived their rhythm solely through constant [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], with subtle variations between lines.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] epic poetry, by contrast, usually places strong emphasis on the importance of line consistency and poetic meter.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; Ancient Greek and Latin poems were written in dactylic [[hexameter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/hexameter Hexameter, poetry at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; Old English, German and Norse poems were written in [[alliterative verse]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/alliterative-verse Alliterative verse literature at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; usually without [[rhyme]]. Italian, Spanish and Portuguese long poems were usually written in [[terza rima]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/terza-rima Terza rima, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; or especially [[ottava rima]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/ottava-rima Ottava rima, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century English epic poems were written in [[heroic couplet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/heroic-couplet Heroic couplet, poetry at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rhyme royal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/rhyme-royal Rhyme royal, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; though in the 16th century the [[Spenserian stanza]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/Spenserian-stanza Spenserian stanza, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blank verse]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/blank-verse  Blank verse, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; were also introduced. The [[French alexandrine]] is currently the heroic line in French literature, though in earlier periods the [[decasyllable]] took precedence. In Polish literature, couplets of [[Polish alexandrine]]s (syllabic lines of 7+6 syllables) prevail.&lt;ref&gt;See: Trzynastozgłoskowiec, [in:] Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Kraków 2003 (in Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian, [[iambic tetrameter]] verse is the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;[Alexandra Smith, Montaging Pushkin: Pushkin and Visions of Modernity in Russian Twentieth Century Poetry, p. 184.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbian poetry, the decasyllable is the only form employed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pl/books?id=6qTpBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=serbian+decasyllable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MktD0VfvNW&amp;sig=E-2QFetJSwJHIDDl_ADj3mAK7i0&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidq_a-ztjQAhWBXCwKHd9HAJkQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=serbian%20decasyllable&amp;f=falseDavid Meyer, Early Tahitian Poetics.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebritic.com/?p=146369  Robert William Seton-Watson, The Spirit of the Serb.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astrophysics]], an '''extreme mass ratio inspiral''' ('''EMRI''') is the orbit of a relatively light object around a much heavier (by a factor 10,000 or more) object, that gradually decays due the emission of [[gravitational wave]]s. Such systems are likely to be found in the centers of [[galaxies]], where stellar mass [[compact object]]s, such as [[stellar black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s, may be found orbiting a [[supermassive black hole]].&lt;ref name=pau2007&gt;{{cite journal

The main reason for scientific interest in EMRIs is that they are one of the most promising sources for [[gravitational wave astronomy]] using future space-based detectors such as the [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (LISA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* ''The [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]] of the central object to an accuracy of 1 in 10,000.'' By gathering the statistics of the mass and angular momentum of a large number of supermassive black holes, it should be possible to answer questions about their formation. If the angular momentum of the supermassive black holes is large, then they probably acquired most of their mass by swallowing gas from their [[accretion disc]]. Moderate values of the angular momentum indicate that the object is most likely formed from the merger of several smaller objects with a similar mass, while low values indicate that the mass has grown by swallowing smaller objects coming in from random directions.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

==Formation==
It is currently thought that the centers of most (large) galaxies consist of a [[supermassive black hole]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) surrounded by a cluster of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; stars maybe 10 [[light-year]]s across, called the nucleus.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt; The orbits of the objects around the central supermassive black hole are continually perturbed by two-body interactions with other objects in the nucleus, changing the shape of the orbit. Occasionally, an object may pass close enough to the central supermassive black hole for its orbit to produce large amounts of [[gravitational wave]]s, significantly affecting the orbit. Under specific conditions such an orbit may become an EMRI.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt;

In order to become an EMRI, the back-reaction from the emission of gravitational waves must be the dominant correction to the orbit (compared to, for example, two-body interactions). This requires that the orbiting objects passes very close the central supermassive black hole. A consequence of this is that the inspiralling object cannot be a large heavy star, because it will be ripped apart by the [[tidal forces]].&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|authorlink=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|year=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the object passes too close to the central supermassive black hole, it will make a direct plunge across the [[event horizon]]. This will produce a brief violent burst of gravitational radiation which would be hard to detect with currently planned observatories.{{refn|LISA will only have a small chance of detecting such signals if it originates from our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;|group=nb}} Consequently, the creation of EMRI requires a fine balance between objects passing too close and too far from the central supermassive black hole. Currently, the best estimates are that a typical supermassive black hole of {{Solar mass|10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;|link=y}}, will capture an EMRI once every 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; years. This makes witnessing such an event in our Milky Way unlikely. However, a space based gravitational wave observatory like LISA will be able to detect EMRI events up to cosmological distances, leading to an expected detection rate somewhere between a few and a few thousand per year.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Extreme mass ratio inspirals created in this way tend to have very large [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] (''e''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.9999). The initial, high eccentricity orbits may also be a source of gravitational waves, emitting a short burst as the compact object passes through periapsis. These gravitational wave signals are known as extreme mass ratio bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When it has shrunk enough for the gravitational waves to become strong and frequent enough to be continuously detectable by LISA, the eccentricity will typically be around 0.7. Since the distribution of objects in the nucleus is expected to be approximately spherically symmetric, there is expected to be no correlation between the initial plane of the inspiral and the spin of the central supermassive black holes.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

There is a critical eccentricity, at each value of the semi-major axis, at which stars are "reflected" back to lower eccentricities. Barrier penetration can occur, but the rate of production of EMRIs is much lower than would be expected in the absence of the barrier.&lt;ref name=MAMW/&gt; Estimates of the EMRI rate made prior to 2011&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt; ignored this effect.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt;

Two years later, however, it was realised that the role of the spin of the central supermassive black hole in this matter may be crucial. For a long time it has been believed that any EMRI originating farther away than a certain critical radius of about a hundredth of a parsec would be either scattered away from the capture orbit or directly plunge into the supermassive black hole on an extremely radial orbit. These events would lead to one or a few bursts, but not to a coherent set of thousands of them. Indeed, when taking into account the spin,

proved that these capture orbits do not plunge, but accumulate thousands of cycles in the detector band. Since they are driven by two-body relaxation, which is chaotic in nature, they are ignorant of the Schwarzchild barrier and are not blocked. Moreover, since they originate in the bulk of the stellar distribution, the rates are larger. Additionally, due to their larger eccentricity, they are louder, which enhances the detection volume. It is therefore expected that EMRIs originate at these distances, and that they dominate the rates, contrary to EMRIs originating from within a hundredth of a parsec, which are blocked.

===Alternatives===
Several alternative processes for the production of extreme mass ratio inspirals are known. One possibility would be for the central supermassive black hole to capture a passing object that is not bound to it. However, the window where the object passes close enough to the central black hole to be captured, but far enough to avoid plunging directly into it is extremely small, making it unlikely that such event contribute significantly to the expected event rate.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Another possibility is present if the compact object occurs in a bound binary system with another object. If such a system passes close enough to the central supermassive black hole it is separated by the tidal forces, ejecting one of the objects from the nucleus at a high velocity while the other is captured by the central black hole with a relatively high probability of becoming an EMRI. If more than 1% of the compact objects in the nucleus is found in binaries this process may compete with the "standard" picture described above. EMRIs produced by this process typically have a low eccentricity, becoming very nearly circular by the time they are detectable by LISA.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

A third option is that a [[giant star]] passes close enough to the central massive black hole for the outer layers to be stripped away by tidal forces, after which the remaining core may become an EMRI. However, it is uncertain if the coupling between the core and outer layers of giant stars is strong enough for stripping to have a significant enough effect on the orbit of the core.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Finally, supermassive black holes are often accompanied by an [[accretion disc]] of matter spiraling towards the black hole. If this disc contains enough matter, instabilities can collapse to form new stars. If massive enough, these can collapse to form compact objects, which are automatically on a trajectory to become an EMRI. Extreme mass ratio inspirals created in this way are characterized by the fact their orbital plane is strongly correlated with the plane of the accretion disc and the spin of the supermassive black hole.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

===Intermediate mass ratio inspirals===
Besides [[stellar black hole]]s and [[supermassive black hole]]s, it is speculated that a third class of [[intermediate mass black hole]]s with masses between 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{Solar mass|link=y}} also exists.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt; One way that these may possibly form is through a runway series of collisions of stars in a young cluster of stars. If such a cluster forms within a thousand light years from the galactic nucleus, it will sink towards the center due to dynamical friction. Once close enough the stars are stripped away through tidal forces and the intermediate mass black hole may continue on an inspiral towards the central supermassive black hole. Such a system with a mass ratio around 1000 is known as an '''intermediate mass ratio inspiral''' (IMRI). There are many uncertainties in the expected frequency for such events, but some calculations suggest there may be up to several tens of these events detectable by LISA per year. If these events do occur, they will result in an extremely strong gravitational wave signal, that can easily be detected.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

Another possible way for an intermediate mass ratio inspiral is for an intermediate mass black hole in a [[globular cluster]] to capture a stellar mass compact object through one of the processes described above. Since the central object is much smaller, these systems will produce gravitational waves with a much higher frequency, opening the possibility of detecting them with the next generation of Earth-based observatories, such as [[Advanced LIGO]] and [[Advanced VIRGO]]. Although the event rates for these systems are extremely uncertain, some calculations suggest that Advanced LIGO may see several of them per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Modelling==
[[File:EMRIBinaryModelling.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Diagram showing the relationship between various approaches to modelling extreme mass ratio inspirals.]]

Although the strongest gravitational wave from EMRIs may easily be distinguished from the instrumental noise of the gravitational wave detector, most signals will be deeply buried in the instrumental noise. However, since an EMRI will go through many cycles of gravitational waves (~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) before making the plunge into the central supermassive black hole, it should still be possible to extract the signal using [[matched filter]]ing. In this process, the observed signal is compared with a template of the expected signal, amplifying components that are similar to the theoretical template. To be effective this requires accurate theoretical predictions for the wave forms of the gravitational waves produced by an extreme mass ratio inspiral. This, in turn, requires accurate modelling of the trajectory of the EMRI.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

The equations of motion in [[general relativity]] are notoriously hard to solve analytically. Consequently, one needs to use some sort of approximation scheme. Extreme mass ratio inspirals are well suited for this, as the mass of the compact object is much smaller than that of the central supermassive black hole. This allows it to be ignored or treated [[perturbation theory|perturbatively]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barack|first=Leor|title=Gravitational self-force in extreme mass-ratio inspirals|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 November 2009|volume=26|issue=21|pages=213001|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/26/21/213001|arxiv = 0908.1664 |bibcode = 2009CQGra..26u3001B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues with traditional binary modelling approaches===
====Post-Newtonian expansion====
{{main article|post-Newtonian expansion}}
One common approach is to expand the equations of motion for an object in terms of its [[velocity]] divided by the [[speed of light]], ''v''/''c''. This approximation is very effective if the velocity is very small, but becomes rather inaccurate if ''v''/''c'' becomes larger than about 0.3. For binary systems of comparable mass, this limit is not reached until the last few cycles of the orbit. EMRIs, however, spend their last thousand to a million cycles in this regime, making the post-Newtonian expansion an inappropriate tool.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

====Numerical relativity====
{{main article|numerical relativity}}
Another approach is to completely solve the equations of motion numerically. The non-linear nature of the theory makes this very challenging, but significant success has been achieved in numerically modelling the final phase of the inspiral of binaries of comparable mass. The large number of cycles of an EMRI make the purely numerical approach prohibitively expensive in terms of computing time.&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

===Gravitational self force===
The large value of the mass ratio in an EMRI opens another avenue for approximation: expansion in one over the mass ratio. To zeroth order, the path of the lighter object will be a [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]] in the [[Kerr metric|Kerr spacetime]] generated by the supermassive black hole. Corrections due to the finite mass of the lighter object can then be included, order-by-order in the mass ratio, as an effective force on the object. This effective force is known as the [[gravitational self force]].&lt;ref name=pau2007/&gt;

In the last decade or so, a lot of progress has been made in calculating the gravitational self force for EMRIs. Numerical codes are available to calculate the gravitational self force on any bound orbit around a non-rotating ([[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]]) black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Foam lines''' are accumulations of [[foam]], with trapped insects, [[exuvia]], etc. found on the surface of freshwater water courses or bodies.&lt;ref name=l&gt;[http://www.lovetheoutdoors.com/freshwater-fishing/Stream-Characteristics/Foam-Lines.html Love the Outdoors] Retrieved : 2013-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; Lines appear as individual islands of foam that accumulate against obstructions, shorelines, etc.&lt;ref name=w/&gt; Foam lines have some characteristics in common with [[sea foam]] from the marine environment which may form lines of spume as the tides rise and fall.

==Characteristics==
===Foam lines===
[[File:River Deveron - geograph.org.uk - 1721017.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ice sheet and 'ice pancakes' on the [[River Deveron]].]]
Most foam is very light, white to start with, often turning brown after a period of time if sediment builds up and forms discernible lines as individual mats accumulate.&lt;ref name=w/&gt; Foam lines are usually non-toxic.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Natural foam may have an earthy or fishy smell and is white, off-white, becoming brownish;&lt;ref name=w/&gt; characteristically it breaks apart with comparative ease when disturbed.&lt;ref name=w/&gt;

===Ice pancakes===
Dinner plate sized 'ice pancake' discs are sometimes seen in the winter and can reportedly have a thickness of up to 3.9 inches with a diameter of 12 inches to 9ft. It is thought that the foam lines on the water freeze at night with the current causing repeated collisions against each other to eventually become circular with a distinct rim. When the temperatures fall again fresh foam is added so that existing 'pancakes' enlarge and new ones form.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKvwzXfQM-4 Ice Pancakes on the River Dee, Scotland] Retrieved : 24-12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[Dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) compounds include natural organic surfactants which reduce the surface tension of water and permit the formation of foam bubbles. DOCs derived from decomposing algae and other plants in water courses are one important source, however DOCs derived from bogs and wetlands are very important. Brown-water streams with brown water contain high levels of DOC and much of the foam forms after snowmelt, after prolonged heavy rains and in autumn.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The foam decreases quickly when water flow reduces.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

Foam lines are found on stream and river surfaces and banks when water is strongly mixed with air at waterfalls and where rocky substrates have fast currents of water passing over them.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Loch or lake shores accumulate foam lines due to waves breaking against rocky substrates and outcrops.&lt;ref name=w/&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.arrialaska.org/foam-in-streams.html Aquatic Restoration &amp; Research Institute] Retrieved : 2013-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; As stated, decaying plants and animals release dissolved organic compounds and these compounds lessen the surface tension of water to create the bubbles that adhere together to form the foam.&lt;ref name=w&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/waterresearch/fieldguide/onthewater.htm#foam A Field Guide to Aquatic Phenomena] Retrieved : 2013-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with man made pollution the foam lines are found along long stretches as no one source exists.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

;Man made pollution
The reduction of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and the introduction of biodegradable detergents have greatly reduced the incidence of pollution-related foam, the presence of which can be ascertained by a fragrant or perfume-like smell.&lt;ref name=w/&gt; The foam lines are restricted to the part of the water course in the vicinity of the source of the pollution.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Biotic and abiotic effects==
Stillborn, emerging and drowned terrestrial insects progressively accumulate within foam lines in summer, trapped and held in place by the surface tension of the bubbles within. These dense foam lines restrict the penetration of sunlight.&lt;ref name=l/&gt;

The foam lines vary in thickness and this creates an overhead shelter that protects fish and insects from birds and other 'above surface' predators.&lt;ref name=l/&gt;

'''Friction sensitivity''' is an approximation of the amount of [[friction]] or rubbing a compound can withstand before prematurely exploding. For instance, [[nitroglycerin]] has an extremely high sensitivity to friction, meaning that very little rubbing against it could set off a violent explosion. There is no exact determining the amount of friction required to set off a compound, but is rather approximated by the amount of force applied and the amount of time before the compound explodes.

In [[architecture]], '''functionalism''' is the principle that buildings should be designed based solely on the purpose and function of the building. This principle is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].

The theoretical articulation of functionalism in buildings can be traced back to the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] triad, where 'utilitas' (variously translated as 'commodity', 'convenience', or 'utility') stands alongside 'venustas' (beauty) and 'firmitas' (firmness) as one of three classic goals of architecture. Functionalist views were typical of some [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic revival]] architects. In particular, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] wrote that ''"there should be no features about a building which are not necessary for convenience, construction, or propriety"'' and ''"all ornament should consist of enrichment of the essential construction of the building"''.&lt;ref&gt;A.W.N.Pugin, The true principles of pointed or Christian architecture : set forth in two lectures delivered at St. Marie's, Oscott.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about functionalism and [[aesthetics]] is often framed as a mutually exclusive choice, when in fact there are architects, like [[Will Bruder]], [[James Polshek]] and [[Ken Yeang]], who attempt to satisfy all three Vitruvian goals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In the wake of [[World War I]], an international functionalist architecture movement emerged as part of the wave of [[Modernism]]. The ideas were largely inspired by the need to build a new and better world for the people, as broadly and strongly expressed by the social and political movements of Europe after the extremely devastating world war. In this respect, functionalist architecture is often linked with the ideas of [[socialism]] and modern [[humanism]]. A new slight addition to this new wave of functionalism was that not only should buildings and houses be designed around the purpose of functionality, architecture should also be used as a means to physically create a better world and a better life for people in the broadest sense. This new functionalist architecture had the strongest impact in [[Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[USSR]] and the [[Netherlands]], and from the 1930s also in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Finland]].

== History of functionalism ==
{{expand section|reason=Needs to include the philosophical, social and political ideas in Functionalism, which are all very prominent and in many cases defining|date=January 2018}}
In 1896, Chicago architect Louis Sullivan coined the phrase 'form ever follows function', however this aphorism does not relate to a contemporary understanding of the term ‘function’ as utility or the satisfaction of user needs; it was instead based in metaphysics, as the expression of organic essence and could be paraphrased as meaning 'destiny'. &lt;ref&gt;Forty, A. ‘Words &amp; Buildings: Function’, pp 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1930s, functionalism began to be discussed as an aesthetic approach rather than a matter of design integrity (use). The idea of functionalism was conflated with lack of ornamentation, which is a different matter. It became a pejorative term associated with the most bald and brutal ways to cover space, like cheap commercial buildings and sheds, then finally used, for example in academic criticism of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes, simply as a synonym for 'gauche'.

For 70 years the influential American architect Philip Johnson held that the profession has no functional responsibility whatsoever, and this is one of the many views today. Johnson said, "Where form comes from I don’t know, but it has nothing at all to do with the functional or sociological aspects of our architecture".[2] The position of postmodern architect Peter Eisenman is based on a user-hostile theoretical basis and even more extreme: "I don't do function."{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Modernism ==
{{Main|Modern architecture}}
Popular notions of [[modern architecture]] are heavily influenced by the work of the Franco-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] and the German architect [[Mies van der Rohe]]. Both were functionalists at least to the extent that their buildings were radical simplifications of previous styles. In 1923 Mies van der Rohe was working in [[Weimar culture|Weimar]] Germany, and had begun his career of producing radically simplified, lovingly detailed structures that achieved Sullivan's goal of inherent architectural beauty.  [[Le Corbusier]] famously said "a house is a machine for living in"; his 1923 book ''[[Vers une architecture]]'' was, and still is, very influential, and his early built work such as the [[Villa Savoye]] in [[Poissy]], [[France]], is thought of as prototypically function.

== Czechoslovak Functionalism ==
[[File:Narodni Technicke Museum 2012 01.jpg|thumb|right|National Technical Museum (Prague) 1942 by Milan Babouska]]
Functionalism was a dominant architectonic style in former [[Czechoslovakia]] in the period of 1928-1970 (with an exception of the occupation and a [[Stalinist architecture]] in 1950s). It was a result of fascination first by industrial development and later by an effort "to create a new man and new society" during the period of the socialism (1948–89). Its "program" was formulated by the Club of architects in [[Prague]] in 1924. In 1930s and then in 1960s and 1970s the position of functionalism was dominant and almost exclusive.

== Nordic "funkis" ==
[[File:Kansankatu 47 Oulu 20100321.jpg|thumb|left|Typical railing, flat roof, stucco and colour detail in Nordic funkis (SOK warehouse and offices, Finland)]]
In Scandinavia (including Finland), the international movement and ideas of modernist architecture became widely known among architects at the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|1930 Stockholm Exhibition]], under the guidance of director and Swedish architect [[Gunnar Asplund]]. Enthusiastic architects collected their ideas and inspirations in the manifesto ''[[Acceptera|acceptera!]]'' and in the years thereafter, a functionalist architecture emerged throughout Scandinavia. The genre involves some peculiar features unique to Scandinavia and it is often referred to as "funkis", to distinguish it from functionalism in general. Some of the common features are flat roofing, [[stucco]]ed walls, [[Architectural glass|architectural glazing]] and well-lit rooms, an industrial expression and nautical inspired details, including round windows.&lt;ref&gt;William C Miller (2016): ''Nordic Modernism: Scandinavian Architecture 1890-2017'', The Crowood Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978 1 78500 237 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global stock market crisis and [[1929 economic crisis|economic meltdown in 1929]], instigated the needs to use affordable materials, such as brick and concrete, and to build quickly and efficiently. These needs became another signature of the Nordic version of functionalist architecture, in particular in buildings from the 1930s, and carried over into modernist architecture when industrial serial production became much more prevalent after World War II.&lt;ref name=Connah/&gt;

As most architectural styles, Nordic funkis was international in its scope and several architects designed Nordic funkis buildings throughout the region. Some of the most active architects working internationally with this style, includes [[Edvard Heiberg]], [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]. Nordic funkis features prominently in Scandinavian urban architecture, as the need for urban housing and new institutions for the growing [[welfare state]]s exploded after World War II. Funkis had its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, but functionalist architecture continued to be built long into the 1960s. These later structures, however, tends to be categorized as modernism in a Nordic context.

=== Denmark ===
[[Vilhelm Lauritzen]], [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[C.F. Møller]] were among the most active and influential Danish architects of the new functionalist ideas and Arne Jacobsen, [[Poul Kjærholm]], [[Kaare Klint]], and others, extended the new approach to design in general, most notably furniture which evolved to become [[Danish modern]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hollingsworth, [[Danish Modern]], 2008, Gibbs Smith, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Danish designers and artists who did not work as architects are sometimes also included in the Danish functionalist movement, such as [[Finn Juhl]], [[Louis Poulsen]] and [[Poul Henningsen]]. In Denmark, bricks were largely preferred over reinforced concrete as construction material, and this included funkis buildings. Apart from institutions and apartment blocks, more than 100,000 single-family funkis houses were built in the years 1925-1945. However, the truly dedicated funkis design was often approached with caution and many residential buildings only included some signature funkis elements such as round windows, corner windows or architectural glazing to signal modernity while not provoking conservative traditionalists too much. This branch of restrained approach to the funkis design created the Danish version of the [[bungalow]] building.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Brüel (2014): "''Funkishuset - en bevaringsguide''", {{da icon}} Bygningskultur Danmark&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Hage: [https://issuu.com/johanhage/docs/web_funkishuset Funkishuset] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine examples of Danish functionalist architecture are the now listed [[Kastrup Airport]] 1939 terminal by Vilhelm Lauritzen, [[Aarhus University]] (by C. F. Møller et al.) and [[Aarhus City Hall]] (by Arne Jacobsen et al.), all including furniture and lamps specially designed in the functionalist spirit. The largest functionalist complex in the Nordic countries is the 30,000 sq. m. residential compound of [[Hostrups Have]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;Niels-Ole Lund (2008): ''Nordic Architecture'', Arkitektens Forlag, {{ISBN|9788774072584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
Some of the most prolific and notable architects in Finland, working in the funkis style, includes Alvar Aalto and [[Erik Bryggman]] who were both engaged from the very start in the 1930s. The [[Turku]] region pioneered this new style and the journal ''[[Arkkitehti]]'' mediated and discussed functionalism in a Finnish context. Many of the first buildings in the funkis style were industrial structures, institutions and offices but spread to other kinds of structures such as residential buildings, individual housing and churches. The functionalist design also spread to interior designs and furnitures as exemplified by the iconic [[Paimio Sanatorium]], designed in 1929 and built in 1933.&lt;ref name=yit&gt;YIT: [https://www.yitgroup.com/en/news-repository/news/functionalism-is-a-finnish-thing Functionalism is a Finnish thing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connah&gt;{{cite book|title=Finland: Modern Architectures in History|author=Roger Connah|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Finnish Architecture and the Modernist Tradition|author=Malcolm Quantrill|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aalto introduced standardised, precast concrete elements as early as the late 1920s, when he designed residential buildings in Turku. This technique became a cornerstone of later developments in modernist architecture after World War II, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. He also introduced serial produced wooden housing.&lt;ref name=yit/&gt;

===Södra Ängby, Sweden===
The [[residential area]] of [[Södra Ängby]] in western [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], blended a functionalist or [[International style (architecture)|international]] style with [[Garden city movement|garden city]] ideals. Encompassing more than 500 buildings, it remains the largest coherent functionalistic [[villa]] area in Sweden and possibly the world, still well-preserved more than a half-century after its construction 1933–40 and protected as a [[listed buildings in Sweden|national cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;Detailed references listed in the article on [[Södra Ängby]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zlín, Czech Republic===
[[File:Zlin-Areal Svit.JPG|thumb|[[Zlín]] in Czech republic.]]

[[Zlín]] is a city in Czech republic which was in 1930s completely reconstructed on principles of functionalism. In that time the city was a headquarters of  [[Bata Shoes]] company and Tomáš Baťa initiated a complex reconstruction of the city which was inspired by functionalism and the [[Garden city movement]].

Zlín's distinctive architecture was guided by principles that were strictly observed during its whole inter-war development. Its central theme was the derivation of all architectural elements from the factory buildings. The central position of the industrial production in the life of all Zlín inhabitants was to be highlighted. Hence the same building materials (red bricks, glass, reinforced concrete) were used for the construction of all public (and most private) edifices. The common structural element of Zlín architecture is a square bay of 20x20 feet (6.15x6.15 m). Although modified by several variations, this high modernist style leads to a high degree of uniformity of all buildings. It highlights the central and unique idea of an industrial garden city at the same time. Architectural and urban functionalism was to serve the demands of a modern city. The simplicity of its buildings which also translated into its functional adaptability was to prescribe (and also react to) the needs of everyday life.

The urban plan of Zlín was the creation of [[František Lydie Gahura]], a student at Le Corbusier's atelier in Paris. Architectural highlights of the city are e.g. the Villa of Tomáš Baťa, Baťa’s Hospital, The Grand Cinema or [[Baťa's Skyscraper]].

===Khrushchyovka===

[[Image:Panel Khrushchev house in Tomsk.jpg|thumb|Panel khrushchovka in [[Tomsk]].]]

Khrushchyovka ({{lang-rus|хрущёвка|p=xrʊˈɕːɵfkə}}) is an unofficial name of type of low-cost, concrete-[[Panel building|paneled]] or brick three- to five-storied [[apartment building]] which was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] during the early 1960s, during the time its namesake [[Nikita Khrushchev]] directed the Soviet government. The apartment buildings also went by the name of "Khruschoba" (Хрущёв+трущоба, Khrushchev-slum).

==Functionalism in landscape architecture==

The development of functionalism in [[landscape architecture]] paralleled its development in building architecture. At the residential scale, designers like [[Christopher Tunnard]], [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], and [[Garrett Eckbo]] advocated a design philosophy based on the creation of spaces for outdoor living and the integration of house and garden.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Elizabeth Barlow.  ''Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History''.  New York: Abrams, 2001.  p.23, 454-5&lt;/ref&gt;  At a larger scale, the German landscape architect and planner [[Leberecht Migge]] advocated the use of edible gardens in social housing projects as a way to counteract hunger and increase self-sufficiency of families.  
At a larger scale, the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] advocated for urban design strategies based on human proportions and in support of four functions of human settlement: housing, work, play, and transport.

'''Girih''' ({{lang-fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, "knot") is a decorative [[Islamic geometric patterns|Islamic geometric artform]] used in [[architecture]] and handicraft objects, consisting of angled lines that form an [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] [[strapwork]] pattern. 

Girih decoration is believed to have been inspired by [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns from the 2nd century AD. The earliest girih dates from around 1000 AD, and the artform flourished until the 15th century. Girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways, including the traditional [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]; the construction of a grid of polygons; and the use of a set of [[girih tiles]] with lines drawn on them: the lines form the pattern. Patterns may be elaborated by the use of two levels of design, as at the 1453 [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine. Square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as [[stencil|templates]], and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way.

The 15th century [[Topkapı Scroll]] explicitly shows girih patterns together with the tilings used to create them. A set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic [[Penrose tiling]]s, though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times. Girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens, as at [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; plasterwork, as at [[mosque]]s and [[madrasa]]s such as Hunat Hatun, [[Kayseri]]; metal, as at [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hassan mosque, Cairo]]; and in wood, as at the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]].

The earliest form of girih on a book is seen in the frontispiece of a [[Koran]] manuscript from the year 1000, found in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Materials and Mediums | work=Pattern in Islamic Art  | accessdate=2012-02-08 |  url=http://www.patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/materials-and-mediums/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illuminated with interlacing octagons and [[thuluth]] calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The transformation of Islamic art during the Sunni revival | author=Tabbaa, Yasser | year=2002 | publisher=I.

In woodwork, one of the earliest surviving examples of Islamic geometric art is the 13th-century [[minbar]] (pulpit) of the [[Ibn Tulun Mosque]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jami' Ibn Tulun |url=http://archnet.org/sites/1522/media_contents/6256 |accessdate=25 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih patterns can be created in woodwork in two different ways. In one, a wooden grille with polygons and stars is created; the holes can be left as they are, or filled with some material. In the other, called ''gereh-chini''&lt;ref name="iranSociety"&gt;{{cite web| title=Pattern, Cognition and contemplation: Exploring the Geometric Art of Iran | author=Henry, Richard | year=2007 | publisher=Iran Society | url=http://www.iransociety.org/docs/journal_2007.pdf | accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; small wooden panels of geometric shapes are created individually, and combined to create an elaborate design.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

The term "girih" was used in Turkish for polygonal strap patterns in architecture as early as the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bir Belgeye Göre Amasya II. Bayezid Külliyesi | author=Dündar, A. | journal= Ankara Üniverstesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi | volume= 44 | issue=2 | pages= 131–172 | year=2003 | url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/727/9212.pdf | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, artisans compiled girih pattern books such as the [[Topkapı Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam | author=Katz, V.

While curvilinear precedents of girih were seen in the 10th century, fully developed girih patterns were not seen before the 11th century in Iran. It became a dominant design element in the 11th and 12th centuries, as in the carved [[stucco]] panels with interlaced girih of the [[Kharraqan towers]] (1067) near [[Qazvin Province|Qazvin, Iran]].&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture – iv.

After the [[Safavid]] period, the use of girih continued in the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ilkhanid]] periods. In the 14th century, girih became a minor element in the decorative arts; it was largely replaced by vegetal patterns during the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] era, but continued to be important in decorative arts in Central Asian monuments after that time.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

Girih consists of geometric designs, often of stars and polygons, which can be constructed in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Allen, Terry |year=2004| title=Islamic Art and the Argument from Academic Geometry | url=http://sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/academicgeometry.htm | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih star and polygon patterns with 5- and 10-fold rotational symmetry are known to have been made as early as the 13th century. Such figures can be drawn by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]. The first girih patterns were made by copying a pattern template on a [[Lattice graph|regular grid]]; the pattern was drawn with [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] and [[straightedge]]. Today, artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in the sun to make it brittle. Straight lines are drawn with a pencil and an unmarked straightedge.{{efn|Eric Broug's ''Islamic Geometric Patterns'' illustrates many such patterns, and (in the Appendix) gives detailed instructions for their construction using only compass and straightedge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=194–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="iranSociety"/&gt; Girih patterns made this way are based on [[tessellation]]s, tiling the plane with a unit cell and leaving no gaps.

===Polygons in contact===
One of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]], defined a "geometrical arabesque" as a pattern formed "with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact."&lt;ref name=Hankin&gt;{{cite book |last=Hankin |first=Ernest Hanbury |authorlink=Ernest Hanbury Hankin |title=The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art. Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 15 |date=1925 |publisher=Government of India Central Publication Branch |url=http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BAViewPDF.asp?ArticleID=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at [[Tomb of Akbar the Great|Akbar's tomb, Sikandra]] (1605–1613). Hankin considered the "skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons&amp;nbsp;... almost astounding."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt;

===Girih tiles===

{{main|Girih tiles}}

By the 15th century, some girih patterns were no longer periodic, and may have been constructed using [[girih tiles]]. This method is based on a set of five tiles with lines drawn on them; when used to tile the plane with no gaps, the lines on the tiles form a girih pattern. It is not yet known when girih tiles were first used for architectural decoration instead of compass and straightedge, but it was probably at the start of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peter J.

===Two-level design===
{{triple image|right|Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|125|Spandrel-large scale pattern.svg|125|Darbeimam subdivision rule.svg|125|Girih pattern on a [[spandrel]] from the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine, Isfahan, Iran|Reconstruction of the larger-scale thick line pattern with larger tiles, and a spandrel in yellow|Subdivision rule for the spandrel's pattern|||}}

The girih patterns on the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine built in 1453 at [[Isfahan]] had a much more complex pattern than any previously seen. The details of the pattern indicate that girih tiles, rather than compass and straightedge, were used for decorating the shrine. The patterns appear [[aperiodic]]; within the area on the wall where they are displayed, they do not form a regularly repeating pattern; and they are drawn at two different scales. A large-scale pattern is discernible when the building is viewed from a distance, and a smaller-scale pattern forming part of the larger one can be seen from closer up.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

Although there is evidence that some ancient girih tilings used a [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]] to draw a two-level pattern, there are no known historic examples that can be repeated an infinite level of times. For example, the pattern used in the spandrel of the Darb-i Imam shrine (see figure) consists only of decagons and bowties, while the subdivision rule uses an elongated hexagon tile alongside these two shapes. Therefore, this design lacks self-similarity between the two levels.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;{{-}}

====Aperiodicity====
A periodic tiling of the plane is the regular repetition of a "unit cell", in the manner of a wallpaper, without any gaps. Such tilings can be seen as a two-dimensional crystal, and because of the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], the unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. It is therefore impossible to tile the plane periodically with a figure that has five-fold rotational symmetry, such as a five-pointed star or a decagon. Patterns with infinite perfect quasi-periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes. These [[quasi-crystalline tiling]]s contain shapes with five-fold symmetry that repeat periodically, in between other shapes that do not repeat.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

One way to create quasi-periodic patterns is to create a [[Penrose tiling]]. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called "dart" and "kite", but there is no evidence that this approach was used by medieval artisans.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt; Another way to create quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would serve as evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce complex patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, no known patterns made with girih tiles have more than a two-level design. There would have been no practical need for a girih pattern with more than two levels of design, as a third level would be either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues,&lt;ref name=Makovicky&gt;{{cite web| author=Emil Makovicky| title=Comment on "Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture" |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5855/1383.1.full | accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely expandable quasiperiodic patterns. However, they understood and used to their advantage some of the local geometric properties of the quasi-crystalline patterns they constructed.&lt;ref name=Makovicky/&gt;}}

====The Topkapı Scroll====
{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Panel50.PNG|width1=100|caption1=A [[Topkapı Scroll]] panel; featuring a girih pattern in black with red tiles|image2=Panel29.JPG |width2=150 |caption2=Topkapı scroll panel with patterns at two scales and tiles used|image3=Panel28a.PNG|width3=150|caption3=Reconstruction of the small scale pattern (thick black lines) in left panel, using small tiles|image4=Panel28b.PNG|width4=150|caption4=Reconstruction of the large scale pattern (thick red lines) in left panel, using large tiles}}

The [[Topkapı Scroll]], from the late 15th century, documents the use of girih tiles to create girih patterns. The drawings in this pattern book show the girih lines superimposed on the tiles used to generate the pattern, making the construction fully evident.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

===Templates===
Once a repeating pattern has been constructed, regardless of the method used, the pattern can be recreated by copying a repeating unit of it, like the pattern of a wallpaper, as a paper [[stencil|template]]. The pattern can then simply be pricked through on to the surface to be decorated. The Topkapı Scroll grids may well have been meant for use as such templates.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p47--&gt; The ''Anonymous Compendium'' contains square repeat units for many girih patterns.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p42--&gt; Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari's ''Compendium of Science and Useful Practice in the Mechanical Arts'' contains explicit templates for special purposes such as cast bronze doors.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p44--&gt;

== Girih on varied surfaces ==

=== Girih on windows ===
[[File:Colorful window, Dowlat Abad Garden - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Colourful window of Dowlad Abad Garden]]
The girih has been widely applied on the architecture. The patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture, as the ornateness of windows indicated the social and economic status of the owner. A good example is Azad Koliji, a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects manage to demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer is the actual garden which people can see when they open the window. And the second layer is the artificial garden as the girih patterns are on the outside of the window is the carved pattern and a colorful glass is below it which creates an illusion of a beautiful garden. The multi-colour layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. The artificial layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window and gives the audience enough space of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koliji|first=Hooman|date=2015|title=Built on Light: The 'Crafty' Art of Geometric Patterned Windows|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&amp;issn=2045-5895&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=75|journal=International Journal of Islamic Architecture|volume=4|pages=75-108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Girih on domes ===
In addition to the plain platforms like the windows, the girih patterns on the domes are very popular as well. However, due to the curve shape, the domes need special techniques. The most important one is called “Dast-Garden” method. This method refers to the number of star polygons applied to the pattern are depending on the change of the dome curvature. Decreasing the curvature of a dome surface leads to the decreasing of the number of points on a star polygon. Thus, the shape of the girih pattern is heavily relying on the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohammad|first=Kasraei|date=2016|title=Girih for Domes: Analysis of Three Iranian Domes|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00004-015-0282-4|journal=Nexus Network Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Girih on walls ===
The girih patterns are very likely to be all over the walls in some Islamic architectures. The decorating lines connect to each other and form a continuous network across the entire tiling with edges combine together. The girih patterns vary a lot on the surface, with different geometric shapes including decagons, hexagons, bowties and rhombuses. Among all these patterns, a special technique is shared: "self-similar transformation". The mapping is completed by using this freedom to eliminate the edge difference of these patterns and reduce the edge mismatches to the lowest degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Peter|date=February 2017|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architectur|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1135491|journal=Science|volume=315|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|The [[Airbus A380]] glass cockpit featuring "pull out keyboards and two wide computer screens on the sides for pilots"&lt;ref name="Chui"/&gt;]]

A '''glass cockpit''' is an [[aircraft cockpit]] that features electronic (digital) [[flight instrument]] [[display device|display]]s, typically large [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] screens, rather than the traditional style of [[Analog device|analog]] dials and gauges. While a traditional cockpit (nicknamed a "steam cockpit" within aviation circles) relies on numerous mechanical gauges to display information, a glass cockpit uses several displays driven by [[flight management system]]s, that can be adjusted ([[multi-function display]]) to display flight information as needed. This simplifies aircraft operation and navigation and allows [[aviator|pilots]] to focus only on the most pertinent information. They are also popular with airline companies as they usually eliminate the need for a [[flight engineer]], saving costs. In recent years the technology has also become widely available in small aircraft.

As aircraft displays have modernized, the sensors that feed them have modernized as well. Traditional [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[flight instrument]]s have been replaced by electronic [[attitude and heading reference system]]s (AHRS) and [[air data computer]]s (ADCs), improving reliability and reducing cost and maintenance. [[GPS]] receivers are usually integrated into glass cockpits.

Early glass cockpits, found in the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]/[[McDonnell Douglas MD-90|90]], [[Boeing 737 Classic]], [[Boeing 757|757]] and [[Boeing 767|767-200/-300]], [[ATR 42]], [[ATR 72]] and in the Airbus [[Airbus A300|A300-600]] and [[Airbus A310|A310]], used [[Electronic Flight Instrument System]]s (EFIS) to display attitude and navigational information only, with traditional mechanical gauges retained for airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, and engine performance. Later glass cockpits, found in the Boeing [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737NG]], [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]], [[Boeing 767|767-400]], [[Boeing 777|777]], [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] and later Airbuses, [[Ilyushin Il-96]] and [[Tupolev Tu-204]] have completely replaced the mechanical gauges and warning lights in previous generations of aircraft. While glass cockpit-equipped aircraft throughout the late 20th century still retained analog [[altimeter]]s, [[Attitude indicator|attitude]], and [[airspeed indicator]]s as standby instruments in case the EFIS displays failed, more modern aircraft have been increasingly been using digital standby instruments as well, such as the [[Integrated standby instrument system]].

== History ==
{{Double image|right|C-5A Cockpit.jpg|220|C-5M Cockpit.jpg|220|Analog instrument panel of a [[C-5 Galaxy|C-5A]]|Upgraded "glass" [[C-5M]] instrument panel}}

Glass cockpits originated in military aircraft in the late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the Mark II avionics of the F-111D (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970–73), which featured a [[multi-function display]].

Prior to the 1970s, air transport operations were not considered sufficiently demanding to require advanced equipment like electronic flight displays. Also, computer technology was not at a level where sufficiently light and powerful [[electrical network|circuits]] were available. The increasing complexity of transport aircraft, the advent of digital systems and the growing air traffic congestion around [[airport]]s began to change that.

The [[Boeing 2707]] was one of the earliest commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit. Most cockpit instruments were still analog, but [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays were to be used for the [[Attitude indicator]] and [[Horizontal situation indicator|HSI]]. However, the 2707 was cancelled in 1971 after insurmountable technical difficulties and ultimately the end of project funding by the US government.

The average transport aircraft in the mid-1970s had more than one hundred cockpit instruments and controls, and the primary flight instruments were already crowded with indicators, crossbars, and symbols, and the growing number of cockpit elements were competing for cockpit space and pilot attention.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; As a result, [[NASA]] conducted research on displays that could process the raw aircraft system and flight data into an integrated, easily understood picture of the flight situation, culminating in a series of flights demonstrating a full glass cockpit system.

The success of the NASA-led glass cockpit work is reflected in the total acceptance of electronic flight displays beginning with the introduction of the [[MD-80]] in [[1979 in aviation|1979]]. Airlines and their passengers alike have benefited. The safety and efficiency of flights have been increased with improved pilot understanding of the aircraft's situation relative to its environment (or "[[situational awareness]]").

By the end of the 1990s, [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) panels were increasingly favored among aircraft manufacturers because of their efficiency, reliability and legibility. Earlier LCD panels suffered from poor legibility at some viewing angles and poor response times, making them unsuitable for aviation. Modern aircraft such as the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]], [[Boeing 777|777]], [[Boeing 717|717]], [[Boeing 747-400|747-400ER]], [[Boeing 747-8I|747-8F]] [[Boeing 767|767-400ER]], [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]], and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]], [[Airbus A320 family]] (later versions), [[Airbus A330|A330]] (later versions), [[Airbus A340|A340-500/600]], [[Airbus A340|A340-300]] (later versions), [[Airbus A380|A380]] and [[Airbus A350|A350]] are fitted with glass cockpits consisting of LCD units.&lt;ref name="A320"/&gt;

The glass cockpit has become standard equipment in [[airliner]]s, [[business jets]], and [[military aircraft]]. It was fitted into NASA's [[Space Shuttle]] orbiters [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']], [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']], [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']], and [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], and the current Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] TMA model spacecraft that was launched in 2002. By the end of the century glass cockpits began appearing in [[general aviation]] aircraft as well. In 2003, [[Cirrus Design]]'s [[Cirrus SR20|SR20]] and [[Cirrus SR22|SR22]] became the first [[light aircraft]] equipped with glass cockpits, which they made standard on all Cirrus aircraft. By [[2005 in aviation|2005]], even basic trainers like the [[Piper Cherokee]] and [[Cessna 172]] were shipping with glass cockpits as options (which nearly all customers chose), as well as many modern aircraft such as the [[Diamond DA42]] twin-engine travel and training aircraft. The [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] features a "panoramic cockpit display" touchscreen that replaces most of the switches and toggles found in an aircraft cockpit. The civilian [[Cirrus Vision SF50]] now has the same, which they call a "Perspective Touch" glass cockpit.

Unlike the previous era of glass cockpits—where designers merely copied the look and feel of conventional electromechanical instruments onto cathode ray tubes—the new displays represent a true departure. They look and behave very similarly to other computers, with windows and data that can be manipulated with point-and-click devices. They also add terrain, approach charts, weather, vertical displays, and 3D navigation images.

The improved concepts enable aircraft makers to customize cockpits to a greater degree than previously. All of the manufacturers involved have chosen to do so in one way or another—such as using a [[trackball]], thumb pad or [[joystick]] as a pilot-input device in a computer-style environment. Many of the modifications offered by the aircraft manufacturers improve situational awareness and customize the human-machine interface to increase safety.

Modern glass cockpits might include Synthetic Vision (SVS) or Enhanced Vision systems (EVS). Synthetic Vision systems display a realistic 3D depiction of the outside world (similar to a [[flight simulator]]), based on a database of terrain and geophysical features in conjunction with the attitude and position information gathered from the aircraft navigational systems. Enhanced Vision systems add real-time information from external sensors, such as an infrared camera.

All new airliners such as the [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]] and private jets such as [[Bombardier Global Express]] and [[Learjet]] use glass cockpits.

=== General aviation ===
[[File:Cessna T182T Cockpit - Garmin G1000.jpg|thumb|[[Garmin G1000]] displays in a [[Cessna 182]]. Note the three analog standby instruments near the bottom of the main instrument panel.]]

Many modern [[general aviation]] aircraft are available with glass cockpits. Systems such as the [[Garmin G1000]] are now available on many new [[general aviation|GA]] aircraft, including the classic [[Cessna 172]]. Many small aircraft can also be modified post-production to replace analogue instruments.

Glass cockpits are also popular as a retrofit for older private jets and turboprops such as [[Dassault Falcon]]s, [[Hawker Beechcraft#Products|Raytheon Hawkers]], [[Bombardier Challenger]]s, [[Cessna Citation family|Cessna Citations]], [[Gulfstream Aerospace#Products|Gulfstreams]], [[Beechcraft King Air|King Airs]], [[Learjet#Aircraft|Learjets]], [[IAI Astra|Astras]], and many others. Aviation service companies work closely with equipment manufacturers to address the needs of the owners of these aircraft.

=== Consumer, research, hobby &amp; recreational aviation ===

Today, smartphones and tablets use mini-applications, or "apps," to remotely control complex devices, by WiFi radio interface. They demonstrate how the "glass cockpit" idea is being applied to consumer devices. Applications include toy-grade [[UAV]]s which use the display and touch screen of a tablet or smartphone to employ every aspect of the "glass cockpit" for instrument display, and [[fly-by-wire]] for aircraft control.

=== NASA Space Shuttle program ===
[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle]] glass cockpit]]

The glass cockpit idea made news in 1980s trade magazines, like [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]], when NASA announced that it would be replacing most of the electro-mechanical flight instruments in the space shuttles with glass cockpit components. The articles mentioned how glass cockpit components had the added benefit of being a few hundred pounds lighter than the original flight instruments and support systems used in the space shuttles.

== Safety ==

As aircraft operation depends on glass cockpit systems, flight crews must be trained to deal with possible failures.&lt;ref name="planeandpilotmag1"/&gt; The [[Airbus A320 family]] has seen fifty incidents where several flight displays were lost.&lt;ref name="NTSB safety recommendation A08-53"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/A08_53_55.pdf |publisher= National Transportation Safety Board |title= Safety Recommendation A08-53 |date= July 22, 2008 |quote= According to Airbus, as of May 2007, 49 events similar to the United Airlines flight 731 and UK events had occurred in which the failure of electrical busses resulted in the loss of flight displays and various aircraft systems. |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2008 [[United Airlines]] Flight 731 experienced a serious glass-cockpit blackout, losing half of the [[Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor|ECAM]] displays as well as all radios, transponders, [[Traffic collision avoidance system|TCAS]], and attitude indicators.&lt;ref name="planeandpilotmag1"/&gt; The pilots were able to land at Newark Airport without radio contact in good weather and daylight conditions.

Airbus has offered an optional fix, which the US [[NTSB]] has suggested to the US [[FAA]] as mandatory, but the FAA has yet to make it a requirement.&lt;ref name="typepad1"/&gt; A preliminary NTSB factsheet is available.&lt;ref name="DCA08IA033"/&gt; Due to the possibility of a blackout, glass cockpit aircraft also have an [[integrated standby instrument system]] that includes (at a minimum) an [[artificial horizon]], [[altimeter]] and [[airspeed indicator]]. It is [[Electronics|electronically]] separate from the main instruments and can run for several hours on a backup battery.

In 2010, the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] published a study done on 8,000 general aviation light aircraft. The study found that, although aircraft equipped with glass cockpits had a lower overall accident rate, they also had a larger chance of being involved in a fatal accident.&lt;ref name="NTSB Safety"/&gt; The NTSB Chairman said in response to the study:
{{quote|Training is clearly one of the key components to reducing the accident rate of light planes equipped with glass cockpits, and this study clearly demonstrates the life and death importance of appropriate training on these complex systems... While the technological innovations and flight management tools that glass cockpit equipped airplanes bring to the general aviation community should reduce the number of fatal accidents, we have not—unfortunately—seen that happen.}}

The '''History of science''' is the study of the development of [[science]] and scientific knowledge, including both the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s. (The history of the arts and humanities is termed [[history of scholarship]].) [[Science]] is a body of [[empirical knowledge|empirical]], [[theory|theoretical]], and [[Procedural knowledge|practical]] knowledge about the [[Nature|natural world]], produced by scientists who emphasize the observation, [[scientific explanation|explanation]], and prediction of real world [[phenomenon|phenomena]]. [[Historiography of science]], in contrast, studies the methods employed by historians of science.

The English word ''scientist'' is relatively recent—first coined by [[William Whewell]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/sciencecomma/2015/04/09/whewell-and-the-coining-of-scientist-in-the-quarterly-review/|title=Whewell and the coining of 'scientist' in the Quarterly Review » Science Comma|website=blogs.kent.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, investigators of nature called themselves "[[natural philosophers]]". While [[empirical]] [[Discovery (observation)|investigations]] of the natural world have been described since [[classical antiquity]] (for example by [[Thales]] and [[Aristotle]]), and [[scientific method]] has been employed since the [[Middle Ages]] (for example, by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Roger Bacon]]), modern science began to develop in the [[early modern period]], and in particular in the [[scientific revolution]] of 16th- and 17th-century Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendrix|first=Scott E. |title=Natural Philosophy or Science in Premodern Epistemic Regimes? The Case of the Astrology of Albert the Great and Galileo Galilei|journal=Teorie Vědy / Theory of Science |year=2011 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=111–132 |url=http://teorievedy.flu.cas.cz/index.php/tv/issue/view/10 |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those earlier inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;"For our purpose, science may be defined as ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them." [[William Cecil Dampier|William C. Dampier-Whetham]], "Science", in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. (New York: 1911); "Science comprises, first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking." [[Marshall Clagett]], ''Greek Science in Antiquity'' (New York: Collier Books, 1955); "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed." [[David Pingree]], "Hellenophilia versus the History of Science", ''Isis'' '''83''', 559 (1982); [[Pat Munday]], entry "History of Science", ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (Charles Scribner's Sons, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

In prehistoric times, technique and knowledge were passed from generation to generation in an [[oral tradition]]. For example, the domestication of maize for agriculture has been dated to about 9,000 years ago in southern Mexico, before the development of [[writing system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Matsuoka | first=Yoshihiro | last2=Vigouroux  | first2=Yves | last3=Goodman | first3=Major M. | last4=Sanchez G. | first4=Jesus | last5=Buckler | first5=Edward | last6=Doebley | first6=John | title=A single domestication for maize shown by multilocus microsatellite genotyping | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=99 | issue=9 | pages=6080–6084 | date=30 April 2002 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/6080.long | pmid=11983901 | pmc=122905 | doi=10.1073/pnas.052125199 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Many ancient civilizations systematically collected astronomical observations. Rather than speculate on the material nature of the planets and stars, the ancients charted the relative positions of celestial bodies, often inferring their influence on human society. This demonstrates how ancient investigators generally employed a holistic  intuition, assuming the interconnectedness of all things, whereas modern science rejects such conceptual leaps.

Basic facts about human physiology were known in some places, and [[alchemy]] was practiced in several civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;See Homer's ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D219 4.227–232] '[The Egyptians] are of the race of [[Paean (god)|Paeeon]] [(physician to the gods)]'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Joseph Needham]] (1974, 1976, 1980, 1983) and his co-authors, ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', '''V''', Cambridge University Press, specifically:

These physicians, who could be either male or female, also dressed wounds, set limbs, and performed simple surgeries. The ancient Mesopotamians also practiced [[prophylaxis]] and took measures to prevent the spread of disease.&lt;ref name="McIntosh2005"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians had extensive knowledge about the chemical properties of clay, sand, metal ore, [[bitumen]], stone, and other natural materials, and applied this knowledge to practical use in manufacturing [[pottery]], [[faience]], glass, soap, metals, [[lime plaster]], and waterproofing. [[Metallurgy]] required scientific knowledge about the properties of metals. Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information and were far more interested in studying the manner in which the gods had ordered the universe. Biology of non-human organisms was generally only written about in the context of mainstream academic disciplines.

In [[Babylonian astronomy]], records of the motions of the [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[moon]] are left on thousands of [[clay tablet]]s created by [[scribe]]s. Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the [[solar year]] and the [[lunar month]]. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon.  Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of [[Kidinnu]], a [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was "the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena." According to the historian A. Aaboe, "all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity |author=Aaboe, A. |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |volume=276 |issue=1257|date=2 May 1974 |pages=21–42|ref=harv |doi=10.1098/rsta.1974.0007 |bibcode=1974RSPTA.276...21A |jstor=74272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3-4-5 [[right triangle]] and other rules of geometry were used to build rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt was also a center of [[Alchemy#History|alchemy]] research for much of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]. The [[Edwin Smith papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern [[neuroscience]]. However, while [[Egyptian medicine]] had some effective practices, it was often ineffective and sometimes harmful. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf Microsoft Word – Proceedings-2001.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it applied the following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Edwin-Smith-papyrus |title=Edwin Smith papyrus: Egyptian medical book |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which display strong parallels to the basic [[empirical method]] of science and, according to G.E.R. Lloyd,&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, G.E.R.  "The development of empirical research", in his ''Magic, Reason and Experience: Studies in the Origin and Development of Greek Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The [[Ebers papyrus]] (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional [[empiricism]].

{{Main|History of science in classical antiquity}}
[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato's Academy]]. 1st century [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]]]

In [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]], the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as [[natural philosophy]]. The ancient people who are considered the first ''[[scientists]]'' may have thought of themselves as ''natural philosophers'', as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).

The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the [[pre-Socratics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|pp=3,37}} called the pre-Socratics the transition from ''[[Mythology|mythos]]'' to ''[[logos]]''&lt;/ref&gt; provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbors: "How did the ordered [[cosmos]] in which we live come to be?"&lt;ref&gt;[[F.M. Cornford]], ''Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought'', (Gloucester, Massachusetts, Peter Smith, 1971), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Socratic philosopher [[Thales]] (640–546 BC), dubbed the "father of science", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. For example, that land floats on water and that earthquakes are caused by the agitation of the water upon which the land floats, rather than the god Poseidon.&lt;ref&gt;Arieti, James A. ''Philosophy in the ancient world: an introduction'', p. 45 [https://books.google.com/?id=L0w6kvdKJ8QC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=thales+earthquakes&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8nb_TqSrFuGmiQKq0siMCA&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=thales%20earthquakes&amp;f=false]. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. 386 pp. {{ISBN|978-0742533295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thales' student [[Pythagoras]] of [[Samos]] founded the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school]], which investigated mathematics for its own sake, and was the first to postulate that the Earth is spherical in shape.&lt;ref name="dicks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicks |first=D.R. |title=Early Greek Astronomy to Aristotle |pages=72–198 |year=1970 |isbn=978-0801405617 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leucippus]] (5th century BC) introduced [[atomism]], the theory that all matter is made of indivisible, imperishable units called [[atoms]].  This was greatly expanded on by his pupil [[Democritus]] and later [[Epicurus]].

Subsequently, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. Their development of [[deductive reasoning]] was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry.  Plato founded the [[Platonic Academy]] in 387 BC, whose motto was "Let none unversed in geometry enter here", and turned out many notable philosophers.  Plato's student Aristotle introduced [[empiricism]] and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=De Lacy |last=O'Leary |authorlink=De Lacy O'Leary |year=1949 |title=How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul  |isbn=978-0-7100-1903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle also produced [[Aristotle's biology|many biological writings]] that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life.

[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|upright=1.5&lt;!--fmt low-aspect image--&gt;|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi|π]].]]

The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in [[anatomy]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[mineralogy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.E.R. Lloyd]], ''Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle'', (New York: W.W. Norton, 1970), pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hellenistic age]] scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of [[mathematics]] and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1973), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]], to medieval [[Early Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophers]] and [[Islamic science|scientists]], to the European [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to the secular [[science]]s of the modern day.
Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks, but the [[Socratic method]] did, along with the idea of [[Substantial form|Forms]], great advances in [[geometry]], [[logic]], and the natural sciences. According to [[Benjamin Farrington]], former Professor of [[Classics]] at [[Swansea University]]:
:"Men were weighing for thousands of years before [[Archimedes]] worked out the laws of equilibrium; they must have had practical and intuitional knowledge of the principles involved. What Archimedes did was to sort out the theoretical implications of this practical knowledge and present the resulting body of knowledge as a logically coherent system."

and again:

:"With astonishment we find ourselves on the threshold of modern science. Nor should it be supposed that by some trick of translation the extracts have been given an air of modernity. Far from it. The vocabulary of these writings and their style are the source from which our own vocabulary and style have been derived."&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Science'', many editions, such as the paperback by Penguin Books.

[[File:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Schematic of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (150–100 BC).]]

The astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known person to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, while the geographer [[Eratosthenes]] accurately calculated the circumference of the Earth. [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190&amp;nbsp;– c. 120 BC) produced the first systematic [[Timeline of astronomical maps, catalogs, and surveys|star catalog]].  The level of achievement in Hellenistic [[astronomy]] and [[engineering]] is impressively shown by the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (150–100 BC), an [[analog computer]] for calculating the position of planets.  Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s appeared in Europe.&lt;ref name=insearchoflosttime&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Marchant | first1=Jo | year=2006 | title=In search of lost time | url=| journal=Nature | volume=444 | issue=7119| pages=534–538 | doi=10.1038/444534a | pmid=17136067 | bibcode=2006Natur.444..534M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 370 BC) and his followers were the first to describe many diseases and medical conditions and developed the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, still relevant and in use today. [[Herophilos]] (335–280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the [[nervous system]]. [[Galen]] (129&amp;nbsp;– c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye [[surgery|surgeries]]— that were not tried again for almost two millennia.

[[Theophrastus]] wrote some of the earliest descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and looking at minerals in terms of their properties such as [[hardness]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] produced what is one of the largest [[encyclopedia]]s of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus.  For example, he accurately describes the [[octahedral]] shape of the [[diamond]], and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by [[engraver]]s to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of [[crystal]] shape is a precursor to modern [[crystallography]], while mention of numerous other minerals presages [[mineralogy]]. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the [[crystal habit]] with the work of [[lapidaries]]. He was also the first to recognise that [[amber]] was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them.

They designed a ruler—the ''Mohenjo-daro ruler''—whose unit of length (approximately 1.32&amp;nbsp;inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts.  Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisht |first=R.S.|year=1982|chapter=Excavations at Banawali: 1974–77|editor=Possehl, Gregory L. |title=Harappan Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective|pages=113–124 |publisher=Oxford and IBH Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematics''': From the earliest the Chinese used a positional decimal system on counting boards in order to calculate. To express 10, a single rod is placed in the second box from the right. The spoken language uses a similar system to English: e.g. four thousand two hundred seven. No symbol was used for zero. By the 1st century BC, negative numbers and decimal fractions were in use and ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' included methods for extracting higher order roots by [[Horner's method]] and solving linear equations and by [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras' theorem]]. Cubic equations were solved in the [[Tang dynasty]] and solutions of equations of order higher than 3 appeared in print in 1245 AD by [[Ch'in Chiu-shao]]. [[Pascal's triangle]] for binomial coefficients was described around 1100 by [[Jia Xian]].

Although the first attempts at an axiomatisation of geometry appear in the [[Mohist]] canon in 330 BC, [[Liu Hui]] developed algebraic methods in geometry in the 3rd century AD and also calculated [[pi]] to 5 significant figures. In 480, [[Zu Chongzhi]] improved this by discovering the ratio &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{355}{113}&lt;/math&gt; which remained the most accurate value for 1200 years.

'''Astronomy''': Astronomical observations from China constitute the longest continuous sequence from any civilisation and include records of sunspots (112 records from 364 BC), supernovas (1054), lunar and solar eclipses. By the 12th century, they could reasonably accurately make predictions of eclipses, but the knowledge of this was lost during the Ming dynasty, so that the Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] gained much favour in 1601 by his predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Needham p422&lt;/ref&gt;
By 635 Chinese astronomers had observed that the tails of comets always point away from the sun.

From antiquity, the Chinese used an equatorial system for describing the skies and a star map from 940 was drawn using a cylindrical ([[Mercator projection|Mercator]]) projection. The use of an [[armillary sphere]] is recorded from the 4th century BC and a sphere permanently mounted in equatorial axis from 52 BC. In 125 AD [[Zhang Heng]] used water power to rotate the sphere in real time. This included rings for the meridian and ecliptic. By 1270 they had incorporated the principles of the Arab [[torquetum]].

'''Seismology''': To better prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a [[seismometer]] in 132 CE which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific [[Cardinal direction|cardinal or ordinal direction]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400&amp;nbsp;km (248&amp;nbsp;mi) to 500&amp;nbsp;km (310&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern [[Gansu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Minford &amp; Lau (2002), 307; Balchin (2003), 26–27; Needham (1986a), 627; Needham (1986c), 484; Krebs (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 626"&gt;Needham (1986a), 626.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Zhang Heng#Zhang's seismometer|Zhang's seismometer]] for further details.

There are many notable contributors to the field of Chinese science throughout the ages. One of the best examples would be [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), a [[polymath]] scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the [[magnetic]]-needle [[compass]] used for [[navigation]], discovered the concept of [[true north]], improved the design of the astronomical [[gnomon]], [[armillary sphere]], [[sight tube]], and [[water clock|clepsydra]], and described the use of [[drydock]]s to repair boats. After observing the natural process of the inundation of [[silt]] and the find of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fossil]]s in the [[Taihang Mountains]] (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation, or [[geomorphology]]. He also adopted a theory of gradual [[climate change]] in regions over time, after observing [[petrified]] [[bamboo]] found underground at [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] province. If not for Shen Kuo's writing,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shen Kuo]] 沈括 (1086, last supplement dated 1091), ''Meng Ch'i Pi Than (夢溪筆談, [[Dream Pool Essays]])'' as cited in {{harvnb|Needham|2004}} p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; the architectural works of [[Yu Hao]] would be little known, along with the inventor of [[movable type]] [[printing]], [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051). Shen's contemporary [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[metallurgy]], and had erected a large [[astronomical]] [[clocktower]] in [[Kaifeng]] city in 1088. To operate the crowning [[armillary sphere]], his clocktower featured an [[escapement]] mechanism and the world's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]].

The [[Jesuit China missions]] of the 16th and 17th centuries "learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture."&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Udías, ''Searching the Heavens and the Earth: The History of Jesuit Observatories''. (Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003). p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Western academic thought on the history of Chinese technology and science was galvanized by the work of [[Joseph Needham]] and the Needham Research Institute. Among the technological accomplishments of China were, according to the British scholar Needham, early [[seismometer|seismological]] detectors ([[Zhang Heng]] in the 2nd century), the [[hydraulics|water-powered]] [[celestial globe]] (Zhang Heng), [[match]]es, the independent invention of the [[decimal|decimal system]], [[dry dock#Graving|dry docks]], sliding [[calipers]], the double-action [[piston pump]], [[cast iron]], the [[blast furnace]], the [[iron]] [[plough]], the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the [[wheelbarrow]], the [[suspension bridge]], the [[winnowing machine]], the [[Mechanical fan|rotary fan]], the [[parachute]], [[natural gas]] as fuel, the [[raised-relief map]], the [[propeller]], the [[crossbow]], and a solid fuel [[rocket]], the [[multistage rocket]], the [[horse collar]], along with contributions in [[logic]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], and other fields.

However, cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what we might call "modern science".  According to Needham, it may have been the religious and philosophical framework of Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to accept the ideas of laws of nature:
{{quote|It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The [[Taoists]], indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1954}} 581.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the Middle Ages {{anchor|Science in the Middle Ages}}==
In the Middle Ages the classical learning continued in three major linguistic cultures and civilizations: Greek (the Byzantine Empire), Arabic (the Islamic world), and Latin (Western Europe).

Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the intellectual level in the western part of Europe declined [[Migration Period|in the 400s]]. In contrast, the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] or [[Byzantine Empire]] resisted the barbarian attacks, and preserved and improved the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Byzantine Empire]] still held learning centers such as [[Constantinople]], Alexandria and Antioch, Western Europe's knowledge was concentrated in [[Monastery|monasteries]] until the development of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] in the 12th centuries. The curriculum of monastic schools included the study of the few available ancient texts and of new works on practical subjects like medicine&lt;ref&gt;Linda E.

In the sixth century in the Byzantine Empire, Isidore of Miletus compiled Archimedes' mathematical works in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]], where all Archimedes' mathematical contributions were collected and studied.

[[John Philoponus]], another Byzantine scholar, was the first to question Aristotle's teaching of physics, introducing the [[theory of impetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Philoponus, John|editor=Craig, Edward|year=1998|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 7, Nihilism-Quantum mechanics|pages=371–377, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0zPyhAxhDz8C&amp;pg=PA373 373]|isbn=978-0415187121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lindberg, David C. |year=2007|title=The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450|edition=second|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=307–308|isbn=978-0226482057}} Link to [https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA307 p. 307] from Google's copy of 2008 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of impetus was an auxiliary or secondary theory of Aristotelian dynamics, put forth initially to explain projectile motion against gravity.

The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next recorded case of separating conjoined twins was several centuries later, in 1600s Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medievalists.net/2014/01/the-case-of-conjoined-twins-in-10th-century-byzantium/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://denysmontandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/conjoined-twins.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, a number of Greek scholars flee to North Italy in which they fueled the era later commonly known as "[[Renaissance]]” as they brought with them a great deal of classical learning including an understanding of botany, medicine, and zoology. Byzantium also gave the West important inputs: John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian physics, and the works of Dioscorides.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992). The Beginnings of Western Science.

In the [[Middle East]], [[Greek philosophy]] was able to find some support under the newly created [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]]. With the [[spread of Islam]] in the 7th and 8th centuries, a period of [[Muslim]] scholarship, known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], lasted until the 13th century. This scholarship was aided by several factors. The use of a single language, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], allowed communication without need of a translator. Access to [[Greek language|Greek]] texts from the [[Byzantine Empire]], along with [[History of India|Indian]] sources of learning, provided Muslim scholars a knowledge base to build upon.

[[Scientific method]] began developing in the Muslim world, where significant progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) on [[optics]] from c. 1000, in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hZvL5eYAAAAJ&amp;hl Sameen Ahmed Khan], Arab Origins of the Discovery of the Refraction of Light; Roshdi Hifni Rashed (Picture) Awarded the 2007 King Faisal International Prize, Optics &amp; Photonics News (OPN, Logo), Vol. 18, No. 10, pp. 22–23 (October 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally [[empiricism|empirical]] orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Some have also described Ibn al-Haytham as the "first scientist" for his development of the modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Al-Khalili |first=Jim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7810846.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], the mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] (c. 780–850) gave his name to the concept of the [[algorithm]], while the term [[algebra]] is derived from ''al-jabr'', the beginning of the title of one of his publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald J.

In [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]], [[Al-Battani]] (c. 858–929) improved the measurements of [[Hipparchus]], preserved in the translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Hè Megalè Syntaxis'' (''The great treatise'') translated as ''[[Almagest]]''.

By the eleventh century, most of Europe had become Christian; stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made, increasing the food supply and population. Classical Greek texts were translated from Arabic and Greek into Latin, stimulating scientific discussion in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''  University of Chicago Press. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

An intellectual revitalization of Western Europe started with the birth of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] in the 12th century. Contact with the Byzantine Empire,&lt;ref name=Lindberg1992p162/&gt; and with the Islamic world during the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Crusades]], allowed Latin Europe access to scientific [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] texts, including the works of [[Aristotle]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Isidore of Miletus]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwarizmi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. European scholars had access to the translation programs of [[Raymond of Toledo]], who sponsored the 12th century [[Toledo School of Translators]] from Arabic to Latin. Later translators like [[Michael Scotus]] would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially in the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation and propagation of these texts]] and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Toby. ''Rise of early modern science'' 2nd ed. pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that the "medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward.

In [[classical antiquity]], Greek and Roman taboos had meant that dissection was usually banned, but in the Middle Ages medical teachers and students at Bologna began to open human bodies, and [[Mondino de Luzzi]] (c. 1275–1326) produced the ﬁrst known anatomy textbook based on human dissection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057418 |last=Numbers |first=Ronald |title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion|pages=45|publisher= Harvard University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0674033276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/04/debunking-a-myth/ |title=Debunking a myth |date=7 April 2011 |publisher=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Pax Mongolica]], Europeans, such as [[Marco Polo]], began to venture further and further east. This led to the increased awareness of Indian and even Chinese culture and civilization within the European tradition. Technological advances were also made, such as the early flight of [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]] (who had studied Mathematics in 11th century England),&lt;ref name="Eilmer"&gt;[[William of Malmesbury]], ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]] / The history of the English kings'', ed. and trans.

At the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy in these texts began to be extended by [[Scholasticism|scholastics]] such as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his ''[[Opus Majus]]''.  [[Pierre Duhem]]'s thesis is that [[Stephen Tempier]] - the Bishop of Paris - [[Condemnation of 1277]] led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, "but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277".&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/condemnation/ |title=Condemnation of 1277 |author=Hans Thijssen |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=30 January 2003 |accessdate=14 September 2009 |publisher=[[University of Stanford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many scholars agree with Duhem's view that the Middle Ages saw important scientific developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/blog/rediscovering-the-science-of-the-middle-ages |title=Rediscovering the Science of the Middle Ages |publisher=BioLogos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icucourses.com/pages/023-a03-the-middle-ages-and-the-birth-of-science|title=023-A03: The Middle Ages and the Birth of Science – International Catholic University|work=International Catholic University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/history-a-medieval-multiverse-1.14837|title=History: A medieval multiverse|volume=507|issue=7491|pages=161–163|journal=Nature News &amp; Comment|doi=10.1038/507161a|year=2014|last1=McLeish|first1=Tom C.

The first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work, largely within the framework of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] commentaries on Aristotle's scientific writings.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 127–131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Ockham]] emphasised the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]]: natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities, so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', (Harvard Univ. Press, 1974), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and an intermediary "sensible species" is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of [[inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford Calculators]] began to mathematically analyze the [[kinematics]] of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 100–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1348, the [[Black Death]] and other disasters sealed a sudden end to philosophic and scientific development. Yet, the rediscovery of ancient texts was stimulated by the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, when many [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars sought refuge in the West. Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed ideas such as [[algebra]] to propagate more rapidly. These developments paved the way for the [[Scientific Revolution]], where scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black Death, resumed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The renewal of learning in Europe began with 12th century [[Scholasticism]]. The [[Northern Renaissance]] showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]]; the discovery of the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]]; the [[Fall of Constantinople]]; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] questioned religious doctrine. The works of [[Ptolemy]] (astronomy) and [[Galen]] (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by [[Vesalius]] on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Precise titles of these landmark books can be found in the collections of the [[Library of Congress]]. A list of these titles can be found in {{harvnb|Bruno|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] initiated [[classical mechanics]] in [[physics]].]]

The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The Scientific Revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543, when the books ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Workings of the Human Body'') by [[Andreas Vesalius]], and also ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'', by the astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], were first printed. The thesis of Copernicus' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun. The period culminated with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 by [[Isaac Newton]], representative of the unprecedented growth of [[antiquarian science book|scientific publications]] throughout Europe.

Other significant scientific advances were made during this time by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Edmond Halley]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]. In philosophy, major contributions were made by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], Sir [[Thomas Browne]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]. The scientific method was also better developed as the modern way of thinking emphasized experimentation and reason over traditional considerations.

===Age of Enlightenment===

[[File:Painting of Volta by Bertini (photo).jpeg|thumb|[[Alessandro Volta]] demonstrates the first [[Electrochemical cell|electrical cell]] to [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in 1801.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was a European affair. The 17th century brought decisive steps towards modern science, which accelerated during the 18th century. Directly based on the works&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], the way was now clear to the development of modern [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[technology]]
by the generation of [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790), [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783), [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711–1765) and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1717–1783). [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', published between 1751 and 1772 brought this new understanding to a wider audience. The impact of this process was not limited to science and technology, but affected [[history of philosophy|philosophy]] ([[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hume]]), [[history of religion|religion]] (the increasingly significant impact of [[Relationship between religion and science|science upon religion]]), and society and politics in general ([[Adam Smith]], [[Voltaire]]). The [[early modern period]] is seen as a flowering of the European Renaissance, in what is often known as the [[Scientific Revolution]], viewed as a foundation of [[#Modern science|modern science]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, pp. 741–744 of {{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism in science===
{{Main|Romanticism in science}}
The Romantic Movement of the early 19th century reshaped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the Enlightenment. Major breakthroughs came in biology, especially in [[Darwinism|Darwin's theory of evolution]], as well as physics (electromagnetism), mathematics (non-Euclidean geometry, group theory) and chemistry (organic chemistry).  The decline of Romanticism occurred because a new movement, [[Positivism]], began to take hold of the ideals of the intellectuals after 1840 and lasted until about 1880.

==Modern science==
The [[scientific revolution]] established science as a source for the growth of knowledge.{{clarify|reason=a source for the growth of knowledge? It is knowledge.|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741–743&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the practice of science became professionalized and institutionalized in ways that continued through the 20th century. As the role of scientific knowledge grew in society, it became incorporated with many aspects of the functioning of nation-states.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Physics====
{{Main|History of physics}}
[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Albert Einstein]] ]]
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell profile.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]

The scientific revolution is a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] revived the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system described by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]. This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by [[Johannes Kepler]] in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] ("''Father of Modern Physics''") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] did some of the earliest experiments with electricity and magnetism, establishing that the Earth itself is magnetic.

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], which led to classical mechanics; and [[gravity|Newton's Law of Gravitation]], which describes the fundamental force of gravity.

During the late 18th and early 19th century, the behavior of electricity and magnetism was studied by [[Luigi Galvani]], [[Giovanni Aldini]], [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]], and others. These studies led to the unification of the two phenomena into a single theory of [[electromagnetism]], by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (known as [[Maxwell's equations]]).

The beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]] and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of [[general relativity]], proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of [[spacetime]], on which both [[Newtonian mechanics]] and [[special relativity]] depended, could not exist. In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] formulated [[quantum mechanics]], which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the [[Big Bang]] theory by [[Georges Lemaître]].

[[File:Trinity Test Fireball 25ms.jpg|thumb|The [[atomic bomb]] ushered in "[[Big Science]]" in [[physics]].]]

In 1938 [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] discovered [[nuclear fission]] with radiochemical methods, and in 1939 [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]] wrote the first theoretical interpretation of the fission process, which was later improved by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John A. Wheeler]]. Further developments took place during World War II, which led to the practical application of [[radar]] and the development and use of the [[atomic bomb]]. Around this time, [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] was recruited by the [[Manhattan Project]] to help develop a process for separating uranium metal into U-235 and U-238 isotopes by [[Gaseous diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald K. Smeltzer. “Chien-Shiung Wu.” Atomic Heritage Foundation, https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/chien-shiung-wu. Accessed 26 Oct. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She was an expert experimentalist in beta decay and weak interaction physics.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;Biography.com Editors. “Chien-Shiung Wu.” Biography.com, 2 June 2016, https://www.biography.com/people/chien-shiung-wu-053116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garwin, Richard L., and Tsung-Dao Lee. “Chien‐Shiung Wu.” Physics Today, vol. 50, no. 10, 1997, p. 130. world, physicstoday.scitation.org, doi:10.1063/1.2806727.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu designed an experiment (see [[Wu experiment]]) that enabled theoretical physicists [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen-Ning Yang]] to disprove the law of parity experimentally, winning them a Nobel Prize in 1957.&lt;ref name="biography.com"/&gt;

Though the process had begun with the invention of the [[cyclotron]] by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]] in the 1930s, physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called "[[Big Science]]", requiring massive machines, budgets, and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers. The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the support of "basic" research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications.

Currently, general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other, and efforts are underway to unify the two.

====Chemistry====
{{Main|History of chemistry}}
[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]]]
Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |editor=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |editor2= Mauskopf, Seymour |editor3=Newman, William R. |title=Chemical Knowledge in the Early Modern World|journal= Osiris |volume= 29 |date=2014|pages=1–15|url=https://www.academia.edu/6629576|last1= Newman |first1= William R. |last2= Mauskopf |first2= Seymour H. |last3= Eddy |first3= Matthew Daniel |pmid= 26103744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A decisive moment came when 'chemistry' was distinguished from [[alchemy]] by [[Robert Boyle]] in his work ''The Sceptical Chymist'', in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work.  Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like [[William Cullen]], [[Joseph Black]], [[Torbern Bergman]] and [[Pierre Macquer]] and through the work of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] ([[Father or mother of something|''Father of Modern Chemistry'']]) on [[oxygen]] and the law of [[conservation of mass]], which refuted [[phlogiston theory]]. The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by [[John Dalton]] in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven. Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] composed his [[periodic table]] of elements on the basis of Dalton's discoveries.

The synthesis of [[urea]] by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] opened a new research field, [[organic chemistry]], and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from [[whaling]]. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in [[physiological chemistry]], the precursor to [[biochemistry]]. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. [[Linus Pauling]]'s book on ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce [[bond angle]]s in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of [[DNA]], ''the secret of life'' (in the words of [[Francis Crick]], 1953). In the same year, the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple [[amino acid]]s, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.

====Geology====
{{Main|History of geology}}
Geology existed as a cloud of isolated, disconnected ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. [[Theophrastus]]' work on rocks, ''Peri lithōn'', remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath [[Shen Kua]] (1031–1095) first formulated hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological [[stratum]] in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] of silt.

[[File:Wegener.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plate tectonics]]—[[seafloor spreading]] and [[continental drift]] illustrated on a relief globe]]

Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the [[Scientific Revolution]], but individual theorists made important contributions. [[Robert Hooke]], for example, formulated a theory of earthquakes, and [[Nicholas Steno]] developed the theory of [[Law of superposition|superposition]] and argued that [[fossils]] were the remains of once-living creatures. Beginning with [[Thomas Burnet]]'s ''Sacred Theory of the Earth'' in 1681, natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time. Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth's past in terms of events described in the Bible, but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history.

[[File:Hutton James portrait Raeburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Hutton]], the father of modern geology]]

Modern geology, like modern chemistry, gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries. [[Benoît de Maillet]] and the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars. [[Jean-Étienne Guettard]] and [[Nicolas Desmarest]] hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps.  Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such as Scotland's [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750–1800|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden's Torbern Bergman, and Germany's [[Abraham Werner]] created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals—a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century.  These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led [[James Hutton]], [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Alexandre Brongniart]], following in the steps of  [[Nicolas Steno|Steno]], to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of [[index fossil]]s became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the 19th century, geologists such as [[Charles Lyell]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Roderick Murchison]] applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades.

Midway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand ''how'' the surface of the Earth had changed. The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. [[Louis Agassiz]] and others established the reality of continent-covering [[ice age]]s, and "fluvialists" like [[Andrew Crombie Ramsay]] argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them. After the discovery of [[radioactivity]], [[radiometric dating]] methods were developed, starting in the 20th century. [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of "continental drift" was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate tectonics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has served as the unifying principle in geology.

Geologists' embrace of [[plate tectonics]] became part of a broadening of the field from a study of rocks into a study of the Earth as a planet. Other elements of this transformation include: geophysical studies of the interior of the Earth, the grouping of geology with [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]] as one of the "earth sciences", and comparisons of Earth and the solar system's other rocky planets.

====Astronomy====
{{Main|History of astronomy}}
[[Aristarchus of Samos]] published [[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|work]] on how to determine the sizes and distances of the Sun and the Moon, and [[Eratosthenes]] used this work to figure the size of the Earth. [[Hipparchus]] later discovered the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the Earth.

Advances in astronomy and in optical systems in the 19th century resulted in the first observation of an [[asteroid]] ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]]) in 1801, and the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846.

In 1925, [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] determined that stars were composed mostly of Hydrogen and Helium.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gregersen. “Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin | American Astronomer.” Encyclopædia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cecilia-Payne-Gaposchkin.&lt;/ref&gt; She was dissuaded by astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]] from publishing this finding in her Ph.D.thesis because of the widely held belief that stars had the same composition as the Earth.&lt;ref name="newn.cam.ac.uk"&gt;Rachael Padman. “Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (1900–1979).” Newnham College Biographies, 2004, http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies/.&lt;/ref&gt; However, four years later, in 1929, [[Henry Norris Russell]] came to the same conclusion through different reasoning and the discovery was eventually accepted.&lt;ref name="newn.cam.ac.uk"/&gt;

[[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]] had calculated that there should be evidence for a Big Bang in the background temperature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alpher | first1=Ralph A. | last2=Herman | first2= Robert| year =1948 | title=Evolution of the Universe| url=| journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=162  | issue=4124| pages=774–775 | doi=10.1038/162774b0 | bibcode=1948Natur.162..774A | ref=harv}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gamow | first1=G. | doi=10.1038/162680a0 | title=The Evolution of the Universe | pmid=18893719 | journal=Nature | year=1948 | volume=162 | issue=4122 | pages=680–682 | bibcode=1948Natur.162..680G | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1978/wilson-lecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wilson's 1978 Nobel lecture|website=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a 3&amp;nbsp;Kelvin background hiss in their [[Bell Labs]] [[radiotelescope]] (the [[Holmdel Horn Antenna]]), which was evidence for this hypothesis, and formed the basis for a number of results that helped determine the [[age of the universe]].

Supernova [[SN1987A]] was observed by astronomers on Earth both visually, and in a triumph for [[neutrino astronomy]], by the solar neutrino detectors at [[Kamiokande]]. But the solar neutrino flux was [[solar neutrino problem|a fraction of its theoretically expected value]]. This discrepancy forced a change in some values in the [[standard model]] for [[particle physics]].

In 1847, Hungarian physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis]] dramatically reduced the occurrency of [[puerperal fever]] by simply requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the [[germ theory of disease]]. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and handwashing came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], who in 1865 proved the principles of [[antisepsis]]. Lister's work was based on the important findings by French biologist [[Louis Pasteur]]. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in [[preventive medicine]], when in 1880 he produced a [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]]. Pasteur invented the process of [[pasteurization]], to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell | first1=Neil A. |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

Perhaps the most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] put forward by the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] in his book [[On the Origin of Species]] in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobzhansky | first1=Theodosius | year=1964 | title=Biology, Molecular and Organismic | url=http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | journal=American Zoologist | volume=4 | issue=4 | pages=443–452 | doi=10.1093/icb/4.4.443 | access-date=5 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220935/http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | archive-date=3 March 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both [[Social effect of evolutionary theory|opposition and support]] from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of "man's place in the universe". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the [[Moravia]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henig |first=Robin Marantz |title=The Monk in the Garden : The Lost and Found Genius of Gregor Mendel, the Father of Genetics |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2000 |isbn=978-0395977651 |oclc=43648512}}&lt;/ref&gt; monk [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of [[genetics]], which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]] clarified the basic structure of DNA, the [[genetic material]] for expressing life in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Watson and Francis H. Crick. "Letters to ''Nature'': Molecular structure of Nucleic Acid." ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''171''', 737–738 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the possibilities of [[genetic engineering]] became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human [[genome]] (the [[Human Genome Project]]).

====Ecology====
{{Main|History of ecology}}
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Earthrise]]'', the Earth from above the [[Moon]], [[Apollo 8]]. This 1968 [[NASA]] image by astronaut [[William Anders]] helped create awareness of the finiteness of Earth, and the limits of its [[natural resource]]s.]]
The discipline of [[ecology]] typically traces its origin to the synthesis of [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]] and [[Humboldtian science|Humboldtian]] [[biogeography]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Equally important in the rise of ecology, however, were [[microbiology]] and [[soil science]]—particularly the [[biogeochemical cycle|cycle of life]] concept, prominent in the work [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Ferdinand Cohn]]. The word ''ecology'' was coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930s, [[Arthur Tansley]] and others began developing the field of [[ecosystem ecology]], which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of [[natural history|field biology]].

===Social sciences===
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
Successful use of the scientific method in the physical sciences led to the same methodology being adapted to better understand the many fields of human endeavor. From this effort the social sciences have been developed.

====Political science====
{{Main|History of political science}}
Political science is a late arrival in terms of [[social sciences]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, the discipline has a clear set of antecedents such as [[moral philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[political economy]], history, and other fields concerned with [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] determinations of what ought to be and with [[Deductive reasoning|deducing]] the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of [[Forms of government|government]]. The roots of politics are in [[prehistory]]. In each historic period and in almost every geographic area, we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding.

In [[Western culture]], the study of politics is first found in [[Ancient Greece]]. The antecedents of European politics trace their roots back even earlier than [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], particularly in the works of [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], [[Thucydides]], [[Xenophon]], and [[Euripides]]. Later, Plato analyzed political systems, abstracted their analysis from more [[literary]]- and history- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to [[philosophy]]. Similarly, Aristotle built upon Plato's analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his analysis.

In this treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the State, the Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders, and Corporations are analysed and documented. [[Roger Boesche]] describes the ''Arthaśāstra'' as "a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Roger Boesche | last=Boesche | first=Roger | title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra | year=2002 | publisher=Lexington Books | isbn=978-0739104019 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rule of Rome, famous historians such as [[Polybius]], [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] documented the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], and the organization and histories of other nations, while [[Politician|statesmen]] like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome's empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments.

With the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of [[monotheism]] and, particularly for the Western tradition, [[Christianity]], brought to light a new space for politics and political action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of [[Christianity]], redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between [[Religion and politics|Church and State]] were clarified and contested in this period.

In the Middle East and later other [[Islam]]ic areas, works such as the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] and Epic of Kings by [[Ferdowsi]] provided evidence of political analysis, while the Islamic [[Aristotelians]] such as [[Avicenna]] and later [[Maimonides]] and [[Averroes]], continued [[Aristotle]]'s tradition of analysis and [[empiricism]], writing commentaries on Aristotle's works.

During the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] established the emphasis of modern political science on direct [[empirical]] [[observation]] of political [[institution]]s and actors. Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the [[the Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In particular, the study of [[statistics]], to study the subjects of the [[Sovereign state|state]], has been applied to [[Opinion poll|polling]] and [[voting]].

In the 20th century, the study of ideology, behaviouralism and international relations led to a multitude of 'pol-sci' subdisciplines including [[rational choice theory]], [[voting theory]], [[game theory]] (also used in economics), [[psephology]], [[political geography]]/[[geopolitics]], [[political psychology]]/[[political sociology]], [[political economy]], [[policy analysis]], [[public administration]], comparative political analysis and [[peace studies]]/conflict analysis.

====Linguistics====
{{Main|History of linguistics}}
[[Historical linguistics]] emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century. [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] proposed that [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and [[Celtic languages]] all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'' created the development of [[descriptive linguistics]]. Descriptive linguistics, and the related [[structuralism]] movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. [[Noam Chomsky]] further diversified linguistics with the development of [[generative linguistics]] in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid [[syntax]]. Additional specialties such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], and [[computational linguistics]] have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.

====Economics====
{{Main|History of economics}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|right|The [[supply and demand]] model]]
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adam Smith]] wrote ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', the first modern work of economics]]
The basis for [[classical economics]] forms [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776. Smith criticized [[mercantilism]], advocating a system of free trade with [[division of labour]]. He postulated an "[[invisible hand]]" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. [[Karl Marx]] developed an alternative economic theory, called [[Marxian economics]]. Marxian economics is based on the [[labor theory of value]] and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, [[capitalism]] was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The [[Austrian School]] responded to Marxian economics by viewing [[entrepreneurship]] as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of [[supply and demand]].

In the 1920s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] prompted a division between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]]. Under [[Keynesian economics]] macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote [[aggregate demand]] for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, [[Milton Friedman]] created the concept of [[monetarism]]. Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into [[supply-side economics]] which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.

Other modern schools of economic thought are [[New Classical economics]] and [[New Keynesian economics]]. New Classical economics was developed in the 1970s, emphasizing solid microeconomics as the basis for macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian economics was created partially in response to New Classical economics, and deals with how inefficiencies in the market create a need for control by a central bank or government.

The above "history of economics" reflects modern economic textbooks and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the culmination of its history ([[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]], 1962). The "[[invisible hand]]" mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the "[[Wealth of Nations]]", 1776, advances as Smith's central message.{{clarify|date=July 2015}} It is played down that this "invisible hand" acts only "frequently" and that it is "no part of his [the individual's] intentions" because competition leads to lower prices by imitating "his" invention. That this "invisible hand" prefers "the support of domestic to foreign industry" is cleansed—often without indication that part of the citation is truncated.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Smith's original phrase with [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] quotation of it. In brackets what Samuelson curtailed without indication and without giving a reference:
"[As] every individual … [therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed,] neither intends to promote the general [Smith said "public"] interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. [By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry,] he intends only his own security, [and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only] his own gain; and he is in this, [as in many other cases,] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. [Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.] By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" Samuelson, Paul A./Nordhaus, William D., 1989, [[Economics (textbook)|''Economics'']], 13th edition, New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 825; Smith, Adam, 1937, ''The Wealth of Nations'', N.Y.: Random House, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; The opening passage of the "Wealth" containing Smith's message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into modern theory: "Wealth" depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to [[Unproductive labor]].

====Psychology====
{{Main|History of psychology}}
The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in [[Leipzig]]). Other important early contributors to the field include [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (a pioneer in memory studies), [[Ivan Pavlov]] (who discovered [[classical conditioning]]), [[William James]], and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.

The 20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories as being too unscientific, and a reaction against [[Edward Titchener]]'s atomistic approach of the mind. This led to the formulation of [[behaviorism]] by [[John B. Watson]], which was popularized by [[B.F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism proposed [[epistemology|epistemologically]] limiting psychological study to overt behavior, since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge of the "mind" was considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to achieve.

The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as [[cognitive science]]. Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation, using the tools of [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], and [[neurobiology]]. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as [[PET scan]]s and [[CAT scan]]s, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as [[artificial intelligence]].

====Sociology====
{{Main|History of sociology}}
[[Ibn Khaldun]] can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammed Abdullah Enan, ''Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works'', The Other Press, 2007, pp. 104–105. {{ISBN|9839541536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern sociology emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., [[Émile Durkheim]]), the aim of sociology was in [[Structural functionalism|structuralism]], understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an "antidote" to social disintegration. [[Max Weber]] was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], which he believed would trap individuals in an "iron cage" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including [[Georg Simmel]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], utilized more [[microsociology|microsociological]], qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of [[George Herbert Mead]] and his student [[Herbert Blumer]] resulting in the creation of the [[symbolic interactionism]] approach to sociology.

In particular, just Auguste Comte, illustrated with his work the transition from a theological to a metaphysical stage and, from this, to a positive stage. Comte took care of the classification of the sciences as well as a transit of humanity towards a situation of progress attributable to a re-examination of nature according to the
affirmation of 'sociality' as the basis of the scientifically interpreted society (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Natura, cultura e induzione nell'età delle scienze. Fatti e idee del movimento scientifico in Francia e Inghilterra'', Roma, Nuova Cultura, 2015, pp. 79–, {{ISBN|978-8868124977}}).

American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by [[Talcott Parsons]], who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore "functional". This [[structural functionalism]] approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, [[conflict theory]] was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of [[Karl Marx]]. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. [[Erving Goffman]] saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing "backstage" and attempting to control their audience through [[impression management]]. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including [[feminist theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[rational choice theory]], and [[postmodernism]].

====Anthropology====
{{Main|History of anthropology}}
Anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behaviour. Traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part.

At the same time, the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the [[culture]] concept which is central to the discipline. Traditionally, much of the history of the subject was based on [[Colonialism|colonial]] encounters between Western Europe and the rest of the world, and much of 18th- and 19th-century anthropology is now classed as [[scientific racism]].

During the late 19th-century, battles over the "study of man" took place between those of an "anthropological" persuasion (relying on [[anthropometry|anthropometrical]] techniques) and those of an "[[ethnology|ethnological]]" persuasion (looking at cultures and traditions), and these distinctions became part of the later divide between [[physical anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]], the latter ushered in by the students of [[Franz Boas]].

In the mid-20th century, much of the methodologies of earlier anthropological and ethnographical study were reevaluated with an eye towards research ethics, while at the same time the scope of investigation has broadened far beyond the traditional study of "primitive cultures" (scientific practice itself is often an arena of anthropological study).

The emergence of [[paleoanthropology]], a scientific discipline which draws on the [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[paleontology]], [[physical anthropology]] and [[ethology]], among other disciplines, and increasing in scope and momentum from the mid-20th century, continues to yield further insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage, and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well.

===Emerging disciplines===
During the 20th century, a number of interdisciplinary scientific fields have emerged. Examples include:

[[Communication studies]] combines [[animal communication]], [[information theory]], [[marketing]], [[public relations]], [[telecommunication]]s and other forms of communication.

[[Computer science]], built upon a foundation of [[theoretical linguistics]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[electrical engineering]], studies the nature and limits of computation. Subfields include [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability]], [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[database]] design, [[computer networking]], [[artificial intelligence]], and the design of [[computer hardware]]. One area in which advances in computing have contributed to more general scientific development is by facilitating large-scale [[Scientific data archiving|archiving of scientific data]]. Contemporary computer science typically distinguishes
itself by emphasising mathematical 'theory' in contrast to the practical emphasis of [[software engineering]].

[[Environmental science]] is an interdisciplinary field. It draws upon the disciplines of biology, chemistry, [[earth sciences]], ecology, geography, mathematics, and physics.

[[Materials science]] has its roots in [[metallurgy]], [[mineralogy]], and [[crystallography]]. It combines chemistry, physics, and several engineering disciplines. The field studies metals, [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]], [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[composite material]]s.

[[Neuroscience]] is a multidisciplinary branch of science that combines [[Neurophysiology|physiology]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[Molecular neuroscience|molecular biology]], [[Development of the nervous system|developmental biology]], [[cellular neuroscience|cytology]], [[Theoretical neuroscience|mathematical modeling]] and [[psychology]] to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of [[neuron]]s, [[glia]], [[nervous system]]s and [[Biological neural network|neural circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Neural Science, Fifth Edition|last=Kandel|first=Eric R.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2012|isbn=978-0071390118|location=|chapter=I. Overall perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
{{Main|History of science and technology}}
As an academic field, [[history of science and technology]] began with the publication of [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (first published in 1837). A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]]'s publications, ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a [[Whig history#In the history of science|Whiggish]] belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0007087400023268 | last1=Reingold | first1=Nathan | year=1986 | title=History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920–1940 | url=| journal=British Journal for the History of Science | volume=19 | issue=3| pages=243–262 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dauben | first1=Joseph W. |name-list-format=vanc| last2=Gleason | first2=ML| year=2009 | last3=Smith | first3=GE | title=Seven Decades of History of Science | url=| journal=Isis | volume=100 | issue=1| pages=4–35 | pmid=19554868 | doi=10.1086/597575 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[history of mathematics]], [[history of technology]], and [[history of philosophy]] are distinct areas of research and are covered in other articles. Mathematics is closely related to but distinct from natural science (at least in the modern conception). Technology is likewise closely related to but clearly differs from the search for empirical truth.

History of science is an academic discipline, with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the [[History of Science Society]], the [[British Society for the History of Science]], and the [[European Society for the History of Science]].

===Theories and sociology of the history of science===
{{Main|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}
Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science ''is'', how it ''functions'', and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Dp1f03arcbYC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=What+is+science | title=What is this thing called science? | isbn=978-0872204522 | year=1999 | publisher=Hackett Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sociology of science]] in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they "produce" and "construct" scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend in [[science studies]] (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the "human component" of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=I_3i18x5BqcC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=sociology+of+science |title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations |first1=Robert |last1=King Merton |isbn=978-0226520926 |year=1979 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of [[Science and Technology Studies]], an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods.

[[Humboldtian science]] refers to the early 19th century approach of combining scientific field work with the age of [[Romanticism]] sensitivity, ethics and aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Böhme, Hartmut: Ästhetische Wissenschaft, in: Matices, Nr. 23, 1999, S. 37–41&lt;/ref&gt; It helped to install [[natural history]] as a separate field, gave base for [[ecology]] and was based on the role model of scientist, naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The later 19th century [[positivism]] asserted that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;[[Jorge Larrain]] (1979) ''The Concept of Ideology'' [https://books.google.com/?id=9ocOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 p. 197], quotation: {{quotation|one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major subject of concern and controversy in the [[philosophy of science]] has been the nature of ''theory change'' in science. [[Karl Popper]] argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; [[Thomas Kuhn]], that scientific knowledge moves through "[[paradigm shift]]s" and is not necessarily progressive; and [[Paul Feyerabend]], that scientific knowledge is not cumulative or progressive and that there can be no [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] in terms of method between science and any other form of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qnwzRqh5jFMC&amp;pg=RA1-PR11&amp;dq=philosophy+of+science |title=Science Teaching: The Role of History and Philosophy of Science | first1= Michael Robert |last1=Matthews |isbn=978-0415908993 |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of [[sociology of scientific knowledge|science in a social context]], starting from Thomas Kuhn's ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;ref name=kuhn&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies, e.g. [[Jerome Ravetz]] 1971 ''Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems'' referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="isbn0195197216 "&gt;{{cite book |author=Ravetz, Jerome R. |title=Scientific knowledge and its social problems |publisher=Oxford University Press  |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=978-0195197211}}{{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Science wars]] of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while [[scientism]], a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lears|first=T.J. Jackson|title=Get Happy!!|journal=The Nation|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/177016/get-happy?page=full#|accessdate=21 December 2013|quote=...scientism is a revival of the nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified "science" has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life.

[[Bruno Latour]] noted that "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.  Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Latour | first1=B | year=2004 | title=Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?

=== Plight of many scientific innovators ===
One recurring observation in the history of science involves the struggle for recognition of  first-rate scientists working on the periphery of the scientific establishment.  For instance, the great physicist  [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] looked back (cited [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|here]]) on [[John James Waterston]]'s  seminal paper on the kinetic theory of gases.  The history of the neglect of Waterston's path-breaking article, Rayleigh felt, suggests that "a young author who believes himself capable of great things would usually do well to secure favourable recognition of the scientific world . . . before embarking upon higher flights."

[[William Harvey]]'s experiences led him to an even more pessimistic view:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silencing Scientists and Scholars in Other Fields: Power, Paradigm Controls, Peer Review, and Scholarly Communication |last=Moran|first=Gordon |publisher=Ablex |year=1998 |isbn=978-1567503432 |pages=(cited on page) 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth wont and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In more general terms, Robert K. Merton remarks that "the history of science abounds in instances of basic papers having been written by comparatively unknown scientists, only to be rejected or neglected for years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Science |last=Merton |first=Robert K. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1973 |isbn= |pages=456–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani |first=Moti |date=1995|title=The Plight of the Obscure Innovator in Science: A Few Reflections on Campanario's Note |url=http://sss.sagepub.com/content/25/1/165.short|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=25 |doi=10.1177/030631295025001008 |pages=165–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].

Homeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes.  Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for.  Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

It is intended to give an alert (light and sound) or disconnect the power supply when the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] between the two conductors drops below a set value, usually 50 k[[Ohm|Ω]] (sample of IEC standard for medical applications). The main advantage is that the ungrounded or floating system allows a continuous operation of important consumers such as medical, chemical, military, etc. 

Some manufacturers of monitors for these systems are capable of handling VFDs (Variable Frequency (Speed) Drives). Most, however are not due to issues with the DC-portions of the VFDs.

Most monitors work by injecting low level dc on the line and detecting. Some manufacturers use a patented AMP-monitoring principle (Adapted Measuring Pulse){{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Image:Singes Sosen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Monkeys'' by [[Mori Sosen]]]]

The '''Kyoto school''' (京都派 ''-ha'') was a collection of several styles and schools of [[Japanese painting]] of the late [[Edo period]]. Though there are many broad similarities between the styles within the school, these styles display key differences that separate them. Many were in fact reactions to one another, an artist or group of artists seeking to express themselves differently from those around them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideals of the East: The Spirit of Japanese Art|last=Okakura|first=Kakuzo|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=978-0-486-44024-8|location=Mineola, New York|pages=87-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those subscribers of the Kyoto school found themselves at odds with the state sanctioned Kanō school, thus contributing to the vague nature of the former. 

[[Okakura Kakuzō|Kakuzo Okakura]], predominant Japanese art historian of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, traced the origins of the Kyoto school to the schools of both [[Qing dynasty|Manchu-shin]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties in China. The two latter schools focused on the power of the artist as a lay person or scholar, as opposed to a professional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Okakura is swift with a critique of the Kyoto school's attempts to repurpose the Japanese tradition of copying works from other (predominantly Chinese) cultures, a technique known as ''[[utsushi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kameda-Madar|first=Kazuko|date=2014-09-01|title=Copying and Theory in Edo-Period Japan (1615–1868)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8365.12111/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=708–727|doi=10.1111/1467-8365.12111|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more prominent schools under the Kyoto school umbrella was the [[Shijo school|Shijō school]], named after the street where many of the artists had their studios. ''Shijō'' (四条) literally translates to 'fourth avenue.' This school sought to produce a synthesis of the more realistic style of [[Maruyama Okyo|Maruyama Ōkyo]] with that of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' or Southern School styles. [[Mori Sosen]] was one of the more prominent painters in the Shijō school.

The ''nanga'' or Southern School, meanwhile, rebelled against the realism of Ōkyo and the Shijō artists, seeking to return to the inspiration and style of [[Chinese painting|China's]] [[Southern School]].

[[Image:Potato - Amyloplasts.jpg|thumb|250px|Leucoplasts, specifically, [[amyloplast]]s]]
'''Leucoplasts''' (λευκός leukós "white", πλαστός plastós "formed, molded") are a category of [[plastid]] and as such are [[organelle]]s found in [[plant cell]]s. They are non-pigmented, in contrast to other plastids such as the chloroplast.

Lacking [[photosynthetic pigment]]s, leucoplasts are not green and are located in non-photosynthetic tissues of plants, such as [[root]]s, [[bulbs]] and [[seed]]s. They may be specialized for bulk storage of [[starch]], [[lipid]] or [[protein]] and are then known as [[amyloplast]]s, [[elaioplast]]s, or [[proteinoplast]]s (also called aleuroplasts) respectively. However, in many cell types, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function and are present to provide a wide range of essential biosynthetic functions, including the synthesis of fatty acids such as [[palmitic acid]], many amino acids, and tetrapyrrole compounds such as [[heme]]. In general, leucoplasts are much smaller than [[chloroplast]]s and have a variable morphology, often described as amoeboid. Extensive networks of [[stromule]]s interconnecting leucoplasts have been observed in epidermal cells of [[root]]s, [[hypocotyl]]s, and [[petal]]s, and in [[callus]] and suspension culture cells of tobacco. In some cell types at certain stages of development, leucoplasts are clustered around the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] with stromules extending to the cell periphery, as observed for proplastids in the root meristem.

[[Etioplast]]s, which are pre-granal, immature [[chloroplast]]s but can also be chloroplasts that have been deprived of light, lack active pigment and can be considered leucoplasts. After several minutes exposure to light, etioplasts begin to transform into functioning chloroplasts and cease being leucoplasts.
Amyloplasts are of large size and store starch.
[[Proteinoplast]]s store proteins and are found in seeds (pulses).
Elaioplasts store fats and oils and are found in seeds. They are also called oleosomes. [castor, groundnut]
Etioplasts are plastids without pigments and store food and lamellar structures. These plastids occur in etiolated plants due to the absence of light.

[[Lichens]] are a [[symbiotic relationship]] between a [[fungus]] and an [[algae]]. They are well adapted to survive in harsh conditions. One of the many places they can be found is the [[Namib Desert|Namibian Desert]]. [[Fog]] in the coastal parts of the desert provides the necessary moisture for the organisms' survival. In the Namib they grow on shrubs, rocks and pebbles of the gravel plains. These small organisms can densely cover large areas, forming lichen fields.

The desert hosts 120 lichen [[species]]. Most of them are rare and a significant number of them occur only there. "Many are [[endemism|endemic]] to this region and others show affinities between the Namib lichen [[biota (ecology)|biota]] and other fog deserts of the world, such as the [[Antacama]] in South America and [[Baja California]] in Mexico and California".&lt;ref name="wirth2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wirth|first=Volkmar|title=Lichens of the Namib Desert a guide to their identification|year=2010|publisher=Hess|location=Göttingen|isbn=978-3-933117-08-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological functions ==
* Soil stabilizers
* [[Plant succession]]
* [[Bioaccumulator]]s that contribute to [[nutrient cycling]] in the forestry of [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg biosphere]]
* Food and habitat for other organisms

== Threats ==
Lichen vegetation is very vulnerable to pollution and mechanical damage. Lichen fields in the Namib are at risk from off-road driving and mining.&lt;ref name="wirth2010"/&gt;

However, the [[Wlotzkasbaken]] lichen field north of [[Swakopmund]] was considered for protection after an [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] was done before the development of a [[desalination]] plant serving Trekopje uranium mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-595/areva-resources-namibia-training-and-mining-projects.html |title=Resources Namibia: training and mining projects |publisher=AREVA |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen kilometers of fencing was erected around the northeastern side of the field to protect them from damage caused by vehicles taking shortcuts through the desert. Signs were set up by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism to announce the site location and vulnerability, including several colorful information boards on lichens. The mine also put up an information stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman|first=Adam|title=Vulnerable lichens safe with Areva|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=83271&amp;no_cache=1|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marjorie J. ("Maggie") Clarke''', [[Ph.D.]], is an [[environmental scientist]] who specializes in recycling participation, waste prevention methods, [[waste-to-energy]]/incinerator emissions controls, environmental impacts of the [[Health effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center fires and collapse]], and community botanical gardening. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] she has focused on increasing participation in New York City's waste prevention and recycling programs.  She is a native of Miami [[Florida]], Born July 14, 1953.

==Education==

A 1975 graduate, with B. A. in Geology of [[Smith College]], a year of which was spent at Dartmouth College on exchange program in the environmental studies program in 1973-1974, she received M.S. in [[environmental science]]s from Johns Hopkins University in 1978, M.S. in energy technology (applied sciences) from New York University in 1982, and a Ph.D. in earth &amp; environmental sciences in 2000 — City University of New York.

==Professional==
Clarke was the Department of Sanitation's specialist on [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] from [[incinerator]]s from 1984 to 1988, the author of a book&lt;ref&gt;Burning Garbage in the US—Practice vs. State-of-the-art, INFORM, New York, NY 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of publications on the subject of minimizing emissions. She also served on a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] committee on Health Effects of Waste Incineration, co-authoring the [[United States National Research Council|NRC]] publication by that name. Clarke also served on the [[New Jersey]] Standard-Setting [[Task Force]] on Mercury emissions from incinerators in the early 1990s.

From 2002-2004, she was a Scientist-in-Residence and adjunct assistant professor at [[Lehman College]], and an [[adjunct professor]] at [[Hunter College]], [[City University of New York]] from 1996 - 2005.

==Notable contributions==
Best known as a persistent questioner of [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s claims about the safety of the [[World Trade Center site]],&lt;ref&gt;Public Lives: Keeping a Wary Eye on the E.P.A. at Ground Zero, Robin Finn, for New York Times, June 14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Clarke has underscored the importance of understanding [[toxicity]], synergy of chemicals acting together, and the precautionary principle, and has provided testimony to many government committees and panels, including the [[U.S. Senate]] down to the New York City Council, and has been a guest speaker in academic settings, conferences, down to local eldercare centers. Dr. Clarke laid the groundwork for the later work of such area politicians as Congressman [[Jerrold Nadler]] and Senator [[Hillary Clinton]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

She also conceived and garnered support for a New York City local law to eliminate 2200 apartment building incinerators which was signed into law in 1989.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==NGO participation==
Clarke has been chair or vice chair of the ''Manhattan Citizens' Solid Waste Advisory Board'' for 8 of the years since its inception in 1990, a steering committee member of the ''New York City Recycling Advisory Board'' since its inception in 1990, and was a founding member of the NYC Waste Prevention Coalition. These are connected to efforts to clean up lower [[Manhattan]] from the effects of [[9/11]] and others to solid waste prevention and recycling. She has chaired and currently vice chairs the ''Municipal and Medical Waste Division of the Air &amp; Waste Management Association''. She co-founded and has been president of the ''Riverside-Inwood Neighborhood Garden (RING)'', a volunteer botanical garden in Upper Manhattan, since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finn|first1=Robin|title=Pilfered Peppers in City Gardens; Tomatoes, Too|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/nyregion/community-gardens-find-theft-is-a-fact-of-life.html?_r=0|website=Ny York Times|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Clem|title=Inwood's Dyckman St. is battleground between residents and businesses over noise|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/inwood-dyckman-st-battleground-residents-businesses-noise-article-1.118097|website=Ny Daily News|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music''' is an art form and [[culture|cultural]] activity whose medium is sound organized in time. In general [[definitions of music]] will include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muse]]s").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[glossary of musical terminology]].

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the [[harmony of the spheres]]" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the [[Hip Hop Movement]]''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and [[sheet music]] and scores to customers.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muses]]").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''musica'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'')." This is derived from the "...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]]."&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''.

Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album "Hubardo" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music "score"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "[[big band]]s." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as "common practice" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought… |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d.

==Elements==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate [[musical notation]]s" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the elements of music" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the "rudimentary elements of music" and the "perceptual elements of music".

===Rudimentary elements===
In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Clementi, M. (1974). Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte: Da Capo Pr. Cohen, D., &amp; Dubnov, S. (1997). [[Gestalt phenomena]] in musical texture: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niecks, F. (1884). A concise dictionary of musical terms. The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, 25(498), 473. doi: 10.2307/3357513&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella &lt;ref&gt;Estrella, E. (2015). The Elements of music. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2015, 2015, from http://musiced.about.com/od/beginnerstheory/a/musicelements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: "the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."&lt;ref&gt;Element. (n.d.). In Dictionary.com unabridged.   Retrieved 10 Jun 2015, from  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the "inter-related dimensions of music" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four "psychological attributes of sound". These were: "pitch, loudness, time, and timbre" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the "elements of music" but referred to them as "elemental components" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: "Pitch" and "timbre" match exactly, "loudness" links with dynamics and "time" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase "the elements of music" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: "a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods"&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.

Although writers of lists of "rudimentary elements of music" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]"  {{audio|Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|Play}}]]

A [[melody]] (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the "[[white notes]]" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the "white notes" and "black notes" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] ("keys"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the "home note" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or "home note" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:
* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or "tune") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.
* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a "thicker" or "denser" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).

====Timbre or "tone color"====
Timbre, sometimes called "color" or "tone color" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. "Articulation." ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey "an indication of mood, spirit, character etc." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life. ASME XXth National Conference Proceeding. Australian Society for Music Education. |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.

====Form====

In music, [[Musical form|form]] describes how  the overall structure or plan of a song or piece of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt-Jones |first=Catherine |title=Form in Music |url=http://cnx.org/content/m10842/2.14/ |website=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandt |first=Anthony |title=Musical Form |url=http://cnx.org/content/m11629/1.13/ |publisher=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs and [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]] songs were often in [[AABA form|AABA]] [[32 bar form]], in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody and the B section provided a contrasting melody and/or harmony for 8 bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] ("refrain") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].
Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as "sectional, developmental, or variational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keil |first=Charles |title=Urban blues |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wennerstrom |first=Mary |editor=Wittlich, Gary |title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music |year=1975 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-049346-0 |chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music |ref=CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
This form is defined by its "unrelieved repetition" ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of "unrelieved variation": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.

;Binary form
[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, "simple binary" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.
b
;Ternary form
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. "repeat from the top") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the "middle eight". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called "episodes". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a "development" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only "section" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] – a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].
This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|Sep2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the "A" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the "B" part (the [[musical development|development]]) – thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe," the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text," writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul."&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Allegory of Music, by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]
[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented.

The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument.

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th and 21st century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}

In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things |show=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]] of electric bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s and digital ones and computers since the 1990s. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form," it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody."

==Performance==
{{Main|Performance}}
[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]
[[File:Assyrianfolk.jpg|Assyrian folk music|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] playing ''[[zurna]]'' and ''[[Davul]]'', instruments that go back thousands of years.]]
Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)—which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song "[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional" or as a "folk song". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

===Ornamentation===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
[[File:Trill example ornaments.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|In a score or on a performer's music part, this sign indicates that the musician should perform a [[trill (music)|trill]]—a rapid alternation between two notes. {{audio|Trill example ornaments.mid|Play}}]]
In music, an "ornament" is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]].

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by Boldini of a woman playing the piano]]
Philosophy of music is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:
* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''the Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

==Psychology==
{{Main|Music psychology}}
Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], skill, [[intelligence]], creativity, and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]
Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

===Cognitive musicology===
{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}
Cognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laske |first=Otto |title=Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O.

Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[speech]] and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]].

===Evolutionary musicology===

Evolutionary musicology concerns the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology."

===Culture in music cognition===
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Ethnomusicology}}

An individual's culture or [[ethnicity]] plays a role in their [[music cognition]], including their [[Psychology of music preference|preferences]], [[Music and emotion|emotional reaction]], and [[music-related memory|musical memory]].

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. "The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene." in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball (2010). [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]
Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s pop-music scene, "[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:...

Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "...to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=2016-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recorded artists is [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
The music that composers make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room or [[theatre music|theatre]]. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played "live." Recording, even of essentially live styles such as rock, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings that may be considered "better" than the actual performance.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ "Canned Music on Trial"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] or watching a music video, became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a "[[prosumer]]" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[File:Concerto music store, Utrechtsestraat 64, Amsterdam 5.jpg|350px|thumb|right|A music store selling various singles and albums]]
{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are "[[independent record label|independent]]," while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

===Intellectual property laws===
{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}
In spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.

====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

====Ethnomusicology====
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]
In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures ("[[world music]]" or the field of "ethnomusicology"), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic "[[melting pot]]" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872–950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, "Music a Remedy"&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it "a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy." He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to "make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout."&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are

[[Albert Einstein]] had a lifelong love of music (particularly the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/einstein&amp;music.pdf |title=Einstein and his love of music |last=Foster |first=Brian |magazine=Physics World |date=2005 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; once stating that life without playing music would be inconceivable to him. In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that "whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties." Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', "would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, "as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made.

'''''Natura naturans''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] tag coined during the Middle Ages, meaning "Nature naturing", or more loosely, "nature doing what nature does".  The Latin, ''naturans'', is the present active [[participle]] of ''naturo'', indicated by the suffix "''-ans''" which is akin to the English suffix "''-ing''". ''Naturata'' is the perfect passive participle.  These terms are most commonly associated with the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]].  For Spinoza, ''natura naturans'' refers to the self-causing activity of nature, while ''natura naturata'', meaning "nature natured", refers to nature considered as a passive product of an infinite causal chain. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] defined it as "Nature in the active sense" as opposed to ''[[natura naturata]]''.

The distinction is expressed in Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]y ''Natura naturans'' we must understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''or'' such attributes of substance as express an eternal and infinite essence, that is … God, insofar as he is considered as a free cause. &lt;br&gt; But by ''Natura naturata'' I understand whatever follows from the necessity of God's nature, ''or'' from God's attributes, that is, all the modes of God's attributes insofar as they are considered as things which are in God, and can neither be nor be conceived without God.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Prop. 29, Scholium. Trans: Edwin Curley.  London: Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Spinoza, Nature and God were the same (see ''[[Deus sive Natura]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25996">'''Nearest neighbor search''' ('''NNS'''), as a form of proximity search,  is the [[optimization problem]] of finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point. Closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function: the less similar the objects, the larger the function values. Formally, the nearest-neighbor (NN) search problem is defined as follows: given a set ''S'' of points in a space ''M'' and a query point ''q''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'', find the closest point in ''S'' to ''q''. [[Donald Knuth]] in vol. 3 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' (1973) called it the '''post-office problem''', referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office. A direct generalization of this problem is a ''k''-NN search, where we need to find the ''k'' closest points.

Most commonly ''M'' is a  [[metric space]] and dissimilarity is expressed as a [[distance metric]], which is symmetric and satisfies the [[triangle inequality]]. Even more common, ''M'' is taken to be the ''d''-dimensional [[vector space]] where dissimilarity is measured using the [[Euclidean distance]], [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]] or other [[Statistical distance|distance metric]]. However, the dissimilarity function can be arbitrary. One example are asymmetric [[Bregman divergence]]s, for which the triangle inequality does not hold.&lt;ref name=Cayton2008&gt;{{Cite journal

==Methods==

Various solutions to the NNS problem have been proposed.  The quality and usefulness of the algorithms are determined by the time complexity of queries as well as the space complexity of any search data structures that must be maintained. The informal observation usually referred to as the [[curse of dimensionality]] states that there is no general-purpose exact solution for NNS in high-dimensional Euclidean space using polynomial preprocessing and polylogarithmic search time.

=== Exact methods ===

====Linear search====
The simplest solution to the NNS problem is to compute the distance from the query point to every other point in the database, keeping track of the "best so far".  This algorithm, sometimes referred to as the naive approach, has a [[running time]] of ''O''(''dN'') where ''N'' is the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' and ''d'' is the dimensionality of ''M''.  There are no search data structures to maintain, so linear search has no space complexity beyond the storage of the database. Naive search can, on average, outperform space partitioning approaches on higher dimensional spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A quantitative analysis and performance study for similarity search methods in high dimensional spaces|last1=Weber|first1=Roger|last2=Schek|first2=Hans-J.|last3=Blott|first3=Stephen | url=http://www.vldb.org/conf/1998/p194.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space partitioning====
Since the 1970s, [[branch and bound]] methodology has been applied to the problem. In the case of Euclidean space this approach is known as [[spatial index]] or spatial access methods. Several [[Space partitioning|space-partitioning]] methods have been developed for solving the NNS problem.  Perhaps the simplest is the [[k-d tree]], which iteratively bisects the search space into two regions containing half of the points of the parent region.  Queries are performed via traversal of the tree from the root to a leaf by evaluating the query point at each split. Depending on the distance specified in the query, neighboring branches that might contain hits may also need to be evaluated. For constant dimension query time, average complexity is ''O''(log&amp;nbsp;''N'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An introductory tutorial on KD trees|author=Andrew Moore | url=http://www.autonlab.com/autonweb/14665/version/2/part/5/data/moore-tutorial.pdf?branch=main&amp;language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of randomly distributed points, worst case complexity is ''O''(''kN''^(1-1/''k''))&lt;ref name=Lee1977&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively the [[R-tree]] data structure was designed to support nearest neighbor search in dynamic context, as it has efficient algorithms for insertions and deletions such as the [[R* tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/223784.223794| chapter = Nearest neighbor queries| title = Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  – SIGMOD '95| pages = 71| year = 1995| last1 = Roussopoulos | first1 = N. | last2 = Kelley | first2 = S. | last3 = Vincent | first3 = F. D. R. | isbn = 0897917316}}&lt;/ref&gt; R-trees can yield nearest neighbors not only for Euclidean distance, but can also be used with other distances.

In case of general metric space branch and bound approach is known under the name of [[metric trees]]. Particular examples include [[vp-tree]] and [[BK-tree]].

Using a set of points taken from a 3-dimensional space and put into a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]], and given a query point taken from the same space, a possible solution to the problem of finding the nearest point-cloud point to the query point is given in the following description of an algorithm.  (Strictly speaking, no such point may exist, because it may not be unique.  But in practice, usually we only care about finding any one of the subset of all point-cloud points that exist at the shortest distance to a given query point.)  The idea is, for each branching of the tree, guess that the closest point in the cloud resides in the half-space containing the query point.  This may not be the case, but it is a good heuristic.  After having recursively gone through all the trouble of solving the problem for the guessed half-space, now compare the distance returned by this result with the shortest distance from the query point to the partitioning plane.  This latter distance is that between the query point and the closest possible point that could exist in the half-space not searched.  If this distance is greater than that returned in the earlier result, then clearly there is no need to search the other half-space.  If there is such a need, then you must go through the trouble of solving the problem for the other half space, and then compare its result to the former result, and then return the proper result.  The performance of this algorithm is nearer to logarithmic time than linear time when the query point is near the cloud, because as the distance between the query point and the closest point-cloud point nears zero, the algorithm needs only perform a look-up using the query point as a key to get the correct result.

=== Approximation methods ===
An approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm is allowed to return points, whose distance from the query is at most &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; times the distance from the query to its nearest points. The appeal of this approach is that, in many cases, an approximate nearest neighbor is almost as good as the exact one. In particular, if the distance measure accurately captures the notion of user quality, then small differences in the distance should not matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Andoni|first=A.|last2=Indyk|first2=P.|date=2006-10-01|title=Near-Optimal Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor in High Dimensions|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4031381/|journal=2006 47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'06)|pages=459–468|doi=10.1109/FOCS.2006.49|isbn=978-0-7695-2720-8|citeseerx=10.1.1.142.3471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greedy search in proximity neighborhood graphs====
Proximity graph methods (such as HNSW&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Malkov|first=Yury|last2=Yashunin|first2=Dmitry|date=2016|title=Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs|eprint=1603.09320|class=cs.DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are considered the current state-of-the-art for the approximate nearest neighbors search.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://erikbern.com/2018/06/17/new-approximate-nearest-neighbor-benchmarks.html|title=New approximate nearest neighbor benchmarks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benfrederickson.com/approximate-nearest-neighbours-for-recommender-systems/|title=Approximate Nearest Neighbours for Recommender Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods are based on greedy traversing in proximity neighborhood graphs &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;in which every point &lt;math&gt;x_i \in S &lt;/math&gt; is uniquely associated with vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i \in V &lt;/math&gt;. The search for the nearest neighbors to a query ''q'' in the set ''S'' takes the form of searching for the vertex in the graph &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;.
The basic algorithm - greedy search, works as follows: search starts from an enter-point vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i \in V &lt;/math&gt; by computing the distances from the query q to each vertex of its the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;\{v_j:(v_i,v_j) \in E\}&lt;/math&gt;, and then finds a vertex with the minimal distance value. If the distance value between the query and the selected vertex is smaller than the one between the query and the current element, then the algorithm moves to the selected vertex, and it becomes new enter-point. The algorithm stops when it reaches a local minimum: a vertex whose neighborhood does not contain a vertex that is closer to the query than the vertex itself.

The idea of proximity neighborhood graphs was exploited in multiple publications, including the seminal paper by Arya and Mount,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arya|first1=Sunil|last2=Mount|first2=David|date=1993|title=Approximate Nearest Neighbor Queries in Fixed Dimensions|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth Annual {ACM/SIGACT-SIAM} Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 25–27 January 1993, Austin, Texas.|pages=271–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the VoroNet system for the plane,&lt;ref name="voroNet"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Olivier|first1=Beaumont|last2=Kermarrec|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Marchal|first3=Loris|last4=Rivière|first4=Etienne|year=2006|title=VoroNet: A scalable object network based on Voronoi tessellations|journal=INRIA|volume=RR-5833|issue=1|pages=23–29|doi=10.1007/BF00263763|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the RayNet system for the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^n&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="rayNet"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Olivier|first1=Beaumont|last2=Kermarrec|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Rivière|first3=Etienne|year=2007|title=Peer to Peer Multidimensional Overlays: Approximating Complex Structures|journal=Principles of Distributed Systems|volume=4878|issue=|pages=315–328|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-77096-1_23|isbn=978-3-540-77095-4|postscript=.|citeseerx=10.1.1.626.2980}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Metrized Small World&lt;ref name="msw2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Malkov|first1=Yury|last2=Ponomarenko|first2=Alexander|last3=Krylov|first3=Vladimir|last4=Logvinov|first4=Andrey|year=2014|title=Approximate nearest neighbor algorithm based on navigable small world graphs|journal=Information Systems|volume=45|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.is.2013.10.006|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and HNSW&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; algorithms for the general case of spaces with a distance function. These works were preceded by a pioneering paper by Toussaint, where he introduced a concept of a ''relative neighborhood'' graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toussaint|first1=Godfried|date=1980|title=The relative neighbourhood graph of a finite planar set|journal=Pattern Recognition|volume=12|issue=4|pages=261–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Locality sensitive hashing====

[[Locality sensitive hashing]] (LSH) is a technique for grouping points in space into 'buckets' based on some distance metric operating on the points. Points that are close to each other under the chosen metric are mapped to the same bucket with high probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=A. Rajaraman  |author2=J. Ullman |lastauthoramp=yes | url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html |title=Mining of Massive Datasets, Ch. 3 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nearest neighbor search in spaces with small intrinsic dimension====

The [[cover tree]] has a theoretical bound that is based on the dataset's [[doubling constant]]. The bound on search time is ''O''(''c''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') where ''c''  is the [[Expansivity constant|expansion constant]] of the dataset.

====Projected radial search====

In the special case where the data is a dense 3D map of geometric points, the projection geometry of the sensing technique can be used to dramatically simplify the search problem.
This approach requires that the 3D data is organized by a projection to a two dimensional grid and assumes that the data is spatially smooth across neighboring grid cells with the exception of object boundaries.
These assumptions are valid when dealing with 3D sensor data in applications such as surveying, robotics and stereo vision but may not hold for unorganized data in general.
In practice this technique has an average search time of ''O''(''1'')  or ''O''(''K'')  for the ''k''-nearest neighbor problem when applied to real world stereo vision data.
&lt;ref name=panSearch/&gt;

====Vector approximation files====

In high dimensional spaces, tree indexing structures become useless because an increasing percentage of the nodes need to be examined anyway. To speed up linear search, a compressed version of the feature vectors stored in RAM is used to prefilter the datasets in a first run. The final candidates are determined in a second stage using the uncompressed data from the disk for distance calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Approximation-Based Data Structure for Similarity Search|last1=Weber|first1=Roger|last2=Blott|first2=Stephen|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/83e4/e3281411ffef40654a4b5d29dae48130aefb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compression/clustering based search====
The VA-file approach is a special case of a compression based search, where each feature component is compressed uniformly and independently. The optimal compression technique in multidimensional spaces is [[Vector Quantization]] (VQ), implemented through clustering. The database is clustered and the most "promising" clusters are retrieved. Huge gains over VA-File, tree-based indexes and sequential scan have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for similarity search in image databases|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Sharadh|last2=Rose|first2=Kenneth|journal=ICIP|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for high-dimensional indexing|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Sharadh|last2=Rose|first2=Kenneth|journal=TKDE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also note the parallels between clustering and LSH.

==Variants==

There are numerous variants of the NNS problem and the two most well-known are the [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbor search]] and the [[ε-approximate nearest neighbor search]].

===&lt;span id="K-nearest neighbor"&gt; ''k''-nearest neighbors &lt;/span&gt;===

[[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbor search]] identifies the top ''k'' nearest neighbors to the query.  This technique is commonly used in predictive analytics to estimate or classify a point based on the consensus of its neighbors. ''k''-nearest neighbor graphs are graphs in which every point is connected to its ''k'' nearest neighbors.

===Approximate nearest neighbor===
In some applications it may be acceptable to retrieve a "good guess" of the nearest neighbor. In those cases, we can use an algorithm which doesn't guarantee to return the actual nearest neighbor in every case, in return for improved speed or memory savings. Often such an algorithm will find the nearest neighbor in a majority of cases, but this depends strongly on the dataset being queried.

Algorithms that support the approximate nearest neighbor search include [[Locality-sensitive hashing#LSH algorithm for nearest neighbor search|locality-sensitive hashing]], [[best bin first]] and [[balanced box-decomposition tree]] based search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S.|last1=Arya|author2-link=David Mount|first2=D. M.|last2=Mount|author3-link=Nathan Netanyahu|first3=N. S.|last3=Netanyahu|first4=R.|last4=Silverman|first5=A.|last5=Wu|title=An optimal algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searching|journal= Journal of the ACM|volume=45|number=6|pages=891–923|date=1998|url=http://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/arya/pub/JACM.pdf|doi=10.1145/293347.293348|citeseerx=10.1.1.15.3125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nearest neighbor distance ratio===

[[Nearest neighbor distance ratio]] do not apply the threshold on the direct distance from the original point to the challenger neighbor but on a ratio of it depending on the distance to the previous neighbor. It is used in [[Content-based image retrieval|CBIR]] to retrieve pictures through a "query by example" using the similarity between local features. More generally it is involved in several [[Pattern matching|matching]] problems.

===Fixed-radius near neighbors===

[[Fixed-radius near neighbors]] is the problem where one wants to efficiently find all points given in [[Euclidean space]] within a given fixed distance from a specified point. The data structure should work on a distance which is fixed however the query point is arbitrary.

===All nearest neighbors===

For some applications (e.g. [[entropy estimation]]), we may have ''N'' data-points and wish to know which is the nearest neighbor ''for every one of those N points''. This could of course be achieved by running a nearest-neighbor search once for every point, but an improved strategy would be an algorithm that exploits the information redundancy between these ''N'' queries to produce a more efficient search. As a simple example: when we find the distance from point ''X'' to point ''Y'', that also tells us the distance from point ''Y'' to point ''X'', so the same calculation can be reused in two different queries.

Given a fixed dimension, a semi-definite positive norm (thereby including every  [[lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; norm]]), and ''n'' points in this space, the nearest neighbour of every point can be found in ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time and the ''m'' nearest neighbours of every point can be found in ''O''(''mn''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Nutrient management''' is the science and practice directed to link [[soil]], [[crop]], [[weather]], and [[hydrologic]] factors with cultural, [[irrigation]], and [[soil conservation|soil]] and [[water conservation]] practices to achieve optimal nutrient use efficiency, [[crop yield]]s, crop quality, and [[economic returns]], while reducing off-site transport of [[soil nutrient|nutrients]] ([[fertilizer]]) that may [[environmental impact of agriculture|impact the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=627Qopsj7bsC&amp;pg=PA1157 Delgado and Lemunyon. “Nutrient Management.” In Encyclopedia of Soil Science (Vol 2). Ed. Rattan Lal. CRC Press, 2006. pp 1157 – 1160.]&lt;/ref&gt; It involves matching a specific field soil, climate, and crop management conditions to rate, source, timing, and place (commonly known as the '''4R nutrient stewardship''') of nutrient application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nutrientstewardship.com/ 4R Nutrient Stewardship]&lt;/ref&gt;

Important factors that need to be considered when managing nutrients include (a) the application of nutrients considering the achievable optimum yields and, in some cases, crop quality; (b) the management, application, and timing of nutrients using a budget based on all sources and sinks active at the site; and (c) the management of soil, water, and crop to minimize the off-site transport of nutrients from nutrient leaching out of the root zone, [[surface runoff]], and volatilization (or other gas exchanges).

There can be potential interactions because of differences in nutrient pathways and dynamics. For instance, practices that reduce the off-site surface transport of a given nutrient may increase the leaching losses of other nutrients. These complex dynamics present nutrient managers the difficult task of achieve the best balance for [[profit maximization|maximizing profit]] while contributing to the conservation of our [[biosphere]].

==Nutrient management plan==
[[Image:Epandeur de Fumier Rolland.JPG|right|thumb|[[Manure spreader]]]]
A crop '''nutrient management plan''' is a tool that [[farmer]]s can use to increase the efficiency of all the nutrient sources a crop uses while reducing production and [[environmental risk]], ultimately increasing [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It is generally agreed that there are ten fundamental components of a Crop Nutrient Management Plan. Each component is critical to helping analyze each field and improve nutrient efficiency for the crops grown. These components include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.psu.edu/plants/nutrient-management/educational/nutrient-management-general/nutrient-management-planning-an-overview Nutrient Management Planning: An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Field map]]: The map, including general reference points (such as streams, residences, wellheads etc.), number of acres, and soil types is the base for the rest of the plan.
;[[Soil test]]:  How much of each nutrient (N-P-K and other critical elements such as pH and organic matter) is in the soil profile? The soil test is a key component needed for developing the nutrient rate recommendation.
;[[Crop sequence]]:  Did the crop that grew in the field last year (and in many cases two or more years ago) fix nitrogen for use in the following years? Has long-term no-till increased organic matter? Did the end-of-season stalk test show a [[Plant nutrition#Nutrient deficiency|nutrient deficiency]]? These factors also need to be factored into the plan.
;Estimated yield:  Factors that affect yield are numerous and complex. A field’s soils, [[drainage]], insect, [[weed]] and [[plant disease|crop disease]] pressure, rotation and many other factors differentiate one field from another. This is why using historic yields is important in developing yield estimates for next year. Accurate yield estimates can improve nutrient use efficiency.
;Sources and forms:  The sources and forms of available nutrients can vary from farm-to-farm and even field-to-field. For instance, [[manure]] fertility analysis, storage practices and other factors will need to be included in a nutrient management plan. Manure nutrient tests/analysis are one way to determine the fertility of it. [[Nitrogen fixation|Nitrogen fixed]] from a previous year’s [[legume]] crop and residual affects of manure also effects rate recommendations. Many other nutrient sources should also be factored into this plan. 
;Sensitive areas:  What’s out of the ordinary about a field’s plan? Is it irrigated? Next to a stream or lake? Especially sandy in one area? Steep slope or low area? Manure applied in one area for generations due to proximity of dairy barn? Extremely productive—or unproductive—in a portion of the field? Are there buffers that protect streams, drainage ditches, wellheads, and other [[water collection]] points? How far away are the neighbors? What’s the general wind direction? This is the place to note these and other special conditions that need to be considered.
;Recommended rates: Here’s the place where science, technology, and art meet. Given everything you’ve noted, what is the optimum rate of N, P, K, lime and any other nutrients? While science tells us that a crop has changing nutrient requirements during the growing season, a combination of technology and farmer’s management skills assure optimum nutrient availability at all stages of growth. No-till corn generally requires starter [[fertilizer]] to give the seedling a healthy start.
;Recommended timing: When does the soil temperature drop below 50 degrees? Will a N stabilizer be used? What’s the tillage practice? Strip-till corn and no-till often require different timing approaches than seed planted into a field that’s been tilled once with a field cultivator. Will a starter fertilizer be used to give the seedling a healthy start? How many acres can be covered with available labor (custom or hired) and equipment? Does manure application in a farm depend on a custom applicator’s schedule? What agreements have been worked out with neighbors for manure use on their fields? Is a neighbor hosting a special event? All these factors and more will likely figure into the recommended timing.
;Recommended methods: Surface or injected? While injection is clearly preferred, there may be situations where injection is not feasible (i.e. pasture, grassland). Slope, rainfall patterns, soil type, crop rotation and many other factors determine which method is best for optimizing nutrient efficiency (availability and loss) in farms. The combination that’s right in one field may differ in another field even with the same crop.
;Annual review and update: Even the best managers are forced to deviate from their plans. What rate was actually applied? Where? Using which method? Did an unusually mild winter or wet spring reduce soil nitrate? Did a dry summer, disease, or some other unusual factor increase nutrient carryover? These and other factors should be noted. It’s easier to make notes throughout the year than to remember back six to 10 months.

When such a plan is designed for [[animal feeding operations]] (AFO), it may be termed a "manure management plan." In the United States, some regulatory agencies recommend or require that farms implement these plans in order to prevent [[water pollution]]. The U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS) has published guidance documents on preparing a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP) for AFOs.&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. Beltsville, MD. [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/afo/pdf/CNMPFactSheet.pdf "Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans."] Fact Sheet. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/afo/cnmp_guide_index.html "National Planning Procedures Handbook: Draft Comprehensive Nutrient Management Planning Technical Guidance."] Subpart E, Parts 600.50-600.54 and Subpart F, Part 600.75. December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Plant Nutrition Institute has published a 4R [[plant nutrition]] manual for improving the management of plant nutrition. The manual outlines the scientific principles behind each of the four R’s or “rights” (right source of nutrient, right application rate, right time, right place) and discusses the adoption of 4R practices on the farm, approaches to nutrient management planning, and measurement of sustainability performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipni.net/article/IPNI-3255 4R Plant Nutrition Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nitrogen management==
Of the 16 essential plant nutrients, nitrogen is usually the most difficult to manage in field crop systems. This is because the quantity of plant-available nitrogen can change rapidly in response to changes in soil water status. Nitrogen can be lost from the plant-soil system by one or more of the following processes: [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]]; [[surface runoff]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[Ammonia volatilization from urea|ammonia volatilization]]; and [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name=Davis2007&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=John|title=Nitrogen Efficiency and Management|url=https://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/OpenNonWebContent.aspx?content=18563.wba|publisher=USDA NRCS|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen Management Practices that Improve Nitrogen Efficiency===

Nitrogen management aims to maximize the efficiency with which crops use applied N. Improvements in N use efficiency are associated with decreases in N loss from the soil. Although losses cannot be avoided completely, significant improvements can be realized by applying one or more of the following management practices in the cropping system.&lt;ref name=Davis2007/&gt;

====Reduction of N loss in runoff water and eroded soil====
* [[No-till]], [[conservation tillage]] and other [[surface runoff|runoff]] control measures reduce N loss in surface runoff and [[Soil erosion|eroded soil material]].
* The use of daily estimates of [[Water content|soil moisture]] and crop needs to [[Irrigation scheduling|schedule irrigation]] reduces the risk of [[surface runoff]] and [[soil erosion]].

====Reduction of the [[volatilization]] of N as ammonia gas====
* Incorporation and/or injection of urea and ammonium-containing fertilizers decreases ammonia volatilization because good soil contact buffers pH and slows the generation of [[ammonia]] gas from [[ammonium]] ions.
* [[Urease]] inhibitors temporarily block the function of the urease enzyme, maintaining urea-based fertilizers in the non-volatile urea form, reducing [[Ammonia volatilization from urea|volatilization]] losses when these fertilizers are surface applied; these losses can be meaningful in high-residue, conservation tillage systems.

====Prevention of the build-up of high soil nitrate concentrations====
Nitrate is the form of nitrogen that is most susceptible to loss from the soil, through [[denitrification]] and [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]]. The amount of N lost via these processes can be limited by restricting soil nitrate concentrations, especially at times of high risk. This can be done in many ways, although these are not always cost-effective.

=====''Nitrogen Rates''=====
Rates of N application should be high enough to maximize profits in the long term and minimize residual (unused) nitrate in the soil after harvest.
* The use of local research to determine recommended nitrogen application rates should result in appropriate N rates.
* Recommended N application rates often rely on an assessment of yield expectations - these should be realistic, and preferably based on accurate yield records.
* Fertilizer N rates should be corrected for N that is likely to be [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]] from [[soil organic matter]] and crop residues (especially legume residues).
* Fertilizer N rates should allow for N applied in manure, in irrigation water, and from atmospheric deposition.
* Where feasible, appropriate [[soil test]]s can be used to determine residual soil N.

=====''Soil Testing for N''=====
* Preplant soil tests provide information on the soil’s N-supply power.
* Late spring or pre-side-dress N tests can determine if and how much additional N is needed.
* New soil test and sampling procedures, such as amino sugar tests, grid mapping, and real-time sensors can refine N requirements.
* Post-harvest soil tests determine if N management the previous season was appropriate.

=====''Crop Testing for N''=====
* Plant tissue tests can identify N deficiencies.
* Sensing variations in plant chlorophyll content facilitates variable rate N applications in-season.
* Post-black-layer corn stalk nitrate tests help to determine if N rates were low, optimal, or excessive in the previous crop, so that management changes can be made in following crops.

=====''[[Precision agriculture]]''=====
* Variable rate applicators, combined with intensive soil or crop sampling, allow more precise and responsive application rates.&lt;ref name="Basso2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basso|first1=Bruno|last2=Dumont|first2=Benjamin|last3=Cammarano|first3=Davide|last4=Pezzuolo|first4=Andrea|last5=Marinello|first5=Francesco|last6=Sartori|first6=Luigi|title=Environmental and economic benefits of variable rate nitrogen fertilization in a nitrate vulnerable zone|journal=Science of the Total Environment|date=March 2016|volume=545-546|pages=227–235|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Timing of N Applications''=====
* Apply N close to the time when crops can utilize it.
* Make side-dress N applications close to the time of most rapid N uptake.
* Split applications, involving more than one application, allow efficient use of applied N and reduce the risk of N loss to the environment.

=====''N Forms, including Slow or Controlled Release Fertilizers and Inhibitors''=====
* Slow or controlled release fertilizer delays the availability of nitrogen to the plant until a time that is more appropriate for plant uptake - the risk of N loss through denitrification and leaching is reduced by limiting nitrate concentrations in the soil.
* Nitrification inhibitors maintain applied N in the ammonium form for a longer period of time, thereby reducing leaching and denitrification losses.

=====''N capture''=====
* Particular crop varieties are able to more efficiently extract N from the soil and improve N use efficiency. Breeding of crops for efficient N uptake is in progress.
* Rotation with deep-rooted crops helps capture nitrates deeper in the soil profile.
* Cover crops capture residual nitrogen after crop harvest and recycle it as plant biomass.
* Elimination of restrictions to [[subsoil]] root development; subsoil [[soil compaction|compaction]] and subsoil acidity prevent root penetration in many subsoils worldwide, promoting build-up of subsoil nitrate concentrations which are susceptible to denitrification and leaching when conditions are suitable.
* Good agronomic practice, including appropriate plant populations and spacing and good weed and pest management, allows crops to produce large root systems to optimse N capture and crop yield.

====Water management====
=====''Conservation tillage''=====
* Conservation tillage optimizes soil moisture conditions that improve water use efficiency; in water-stressed conditions, this improves crop yield per unit N applied.

=====''N Fertilizer Application Method and Placement''=====
* In ridged crops, placing N fertilizers in a band in ridges makes N less susceptible to leaching.
* Row fertilizer applicators, such as injectors, which form a compacted soil layer and surface ridge, can reduce N losses by diverting water flow.

=====''Good [[irrigation]] management can dramatically improve N-use efficiency''=====
* Scheduled irrigation based on soil moisture estimates and daily crop needs will improve both water-use and N-use efficiency.
* Sprinkler irrigation systems apply water more uniformly and in lower amounts than furrow or basin irrigation systems.
* Furrow irrigation efficiency can be improved by adjusting set time, stream size, furrow length, watering every other row, or the use of surge valves.
* Alternate row irrigation and fertilization minimizes water contact with nutrients.
* Application of N fertilizer through irrigation systems ([[fertigation]]) facilitates N supply when crop demand is greatest.
* [[Polyacrylamide]] (PAM) treatment during furrow irrigation reduces sediment and N losses.

=====''Drainage Systems''=====
* Some [[subirrigation]] systems recycle nitrate leached from the soil profile and reduce nitrate lost in drainage water.
* Excessive drainage can lead to rapid through-flow of water and N [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], but restricted or insufficient drainage favors [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions and [[denitrification]].

====Use of simulation models====
Short-term changes in the plant-available N status make accurate seasonal predictions of crop N requirement difficult in most situations. However, models (such as NLEAP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient Management -- Nitrogen {{!}} NRCS|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/technical/ecoscience/mnm/?cid=stelprdb1044740|website=www.nrcs.usda.gov|accessdate=19 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adapt-N]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sela|first1=Shai|last2=van Es|first2=Harold M.|last3=Moebius-Clune|first3=Bianca N.|last4=Marjerison|first4=Rebecca|last5=Moebius-Clune|first5=Daniel|last6=Schindelbeck|first6=Robert|last7=Severson|first7=Keith|last8=Young|first8=Eric|title=Dynamic Model Improves Agronomic and Environmental Outcomes for Maize Nitrogen Management over Static Approach|journal=Journal of Environment Quality|date=2017|volume=46|issue=2|page=311|doi=10.2134/jeq2016.05.0182}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that use soil, weather, crop, and field management data can be updated with day-to-day changes and thereby improve predictions of the fate of applied N. They allows farmers to make adaptive management decisions that can improve N-use efficiency and minimize N losses and environmental impact while maximizing profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saol|first1=T.

===Additional measures to minimize environmental impact===

====Conservation Buffers====
* Buffers trap sediment containing ammonia and organic N.
* Nitrate in subsurface flow is reduced through denitrification enhanced by carbon energy sources contained in the soil associated with buffer vegetation.
* Buffer vegetation takes up nitrogen, other nutrients, and reduces loss to water.

====Constructed Wetlands====
* Constructed wetlands located strategically on the landscape to process drainage effluent reduces sediment and nitrate loads to surface water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10066">In applied mathematics – specifically in [[fuzzy logic]] – the '''ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators''' provide a [[parameter]]ized class of mean type aggregation operators. They were introduced by [[Ronald R. Yager]]. Many notable mean operators such as the max, [[arithmetic average]], median and min, are members of this class. They have been widely used in [[computational intelligence]] because of their ability to model linguistically expressed aggregation instructions.

== Definition ==

Formally an '''OWA''' operator of dimension &lt;math&gt; \ n &lt;/math&gt; is a mapping &lt;math&gt; F: R_n \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt; that has an associated collection of weights &lt;math&gt; \  W = [w_1, \ldots, w_n] &lt;/math&gt; lying in the unit interval and summing to one and with 		

:&lt;math&gt; F(a_1, \ldots , a_n) =  \sum_{j=1}^n  w_j b_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; b_j &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest of the &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt;.

By choosing different ''W'' one can implement different aggregation operators. The OWA operator is a non-linear operator as a result of the process of determining the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Properties ==

The OWA operator is a mean operator. It is [[Bounded operator|bounded]], [[monotonic]], [[symmetric operator|symmetric]], and [[idempotent]], as defined below.

{|class="wikitable"
|[[Bounded operator|Bounded]]
|&lt;math&gt;   \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[Monotonic]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \ge F(g_1, \ldots, g_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; a_i \ge g_i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\ i = 1,2,\ldots,n &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[symmetric operator|Symmetric]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  = F(a_\boldsymbol{\pi(1)}, \ldots, a_\boldsymbol{\pi(n)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\pi} &lt;/math&gt; is a permutation map
|-
|[[Idempotent]]
|&lt;math&gt;  \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  =  a &lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt; \ a_i = a &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Notable OWA operators ==
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne n &lt;/math&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \mathrm{average}(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = \frac{1}{n} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; j \in [1, n] &lt;/math&gt;

== Characterizing features ==

Two features have been used to characterize the OWA operators. The first is the attitudinal character(orness).

This is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;A-C(W)= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j=1}^n (n - j) w_j. &lt;/math&gt;

It is known that &lt;math&gt; A-C(W) \in [0, 1] &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''C''(max) = 1, A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(ave) = A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(med) = 0.5 and A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(min) = 0. Thus the A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C goes from 1 to 0 as we go from Max to Min aggregation. The attitudinal character characterizes the similarity of aggregation to OR operation(OR is defined as the Max).

The second feature is the dispersion. This defined as

:&lt;math&gt;H(W) = -\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \ln (w_j).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative definition is &lt;math&gt;E(W) = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 .&lt;/math&gt; The dispersion characterizes how uniformly the arguments are being used

== A literature survey: OWA (1988-2014)==
The historical reconstruction of scientific development of the OWA field, the identification of the dominant direction of knowledge accumulation that emerged since the publication of the first OWA paper, and to discover the most active lines of research has recently been published, (see: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full). The results suggest, as expected, that Yager's paper[1] (IEEE Trans. Systems Man Cybernet, 18(1), 183–190, 1988) is the most influential paper and the starting point of all other research using OWA. Starting from his contribution, other lines of research developed and we describe them. Full list of papers published in OWA is also available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full)

== Type-1 OWA aggregation operators ==

The above Yager's OWA operators are used to aggregate the crisp values. Can we aggregate fuzzy sets in the OWA mechanism ? The
'''[[Type-1 OWA operators]]''' have been proposed for this purpose. So the '''[[type-1 OWA operators]]''' provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA operator]]''' is defined according to the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets as follows:

Given the ''n'' linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, then for each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operator with &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W_\alpha ^i } \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; to aggregate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {A^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; is given as

: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right) =\left\{ {\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} } }{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\left| {w_i \in W_\alpha ^i ,\;a_i } \right. \in A_\alpha ^i ,\;i = 1, \ldots ,n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha ^i= \{w| \mu_{W_i }(w) \geq \alpha \}, A_\alpha ^i=\{ x| \mu _{A_i }(x)\geq \alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\} \to \{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \ge a_{\sigma (i + 1)} ,\;\forall \;i = 1, \ldots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th largest
element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \ldots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The computation of the '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA]]''' output is implemented by computing the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals &lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_ {+},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\alpha ^i=[A_{\alpha-}^i, A_{\alpha+}^i], W_\alpha ^i=[W_{\alpha-}^i, W_{\alpha+}^i]&lt;/math&gt;. Then membership function of resulting aggregation fuzzy set is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \mathop \vee _{\alpha :x \in \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots
,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_\alpha } \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} = \min\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots , A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{+} = \max\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i  A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i =
1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.191 This paper] has presented a fast method to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently.

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also cites that precycling is the preferred method of integrated [[solid waste management]] because it cuts waste at its source and therefore trash is eliminated before it is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|pages=1382–1390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the EPA, precycling is also characterized as a decision-making process on the behalf of the consumer because it involves making informed judgments regarding a product’s waste implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=5|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications that are taken into consideration by the consumer include: whether a product is [[Reuse|reusable]], [[durable]], or [[repairable]]; made from renewable or [[non-renewable resource]]s; [[over-packaged]]; and whether or not the container is reusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=6|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Precycling has the ability to build industrial, social, environmental, and economic circumstances that allow for old products to be converted into new resources &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Industrial: increasing the independence from accumulative substances, such as heavy metals, fossil fuels, synthetics, etc.
*Economic: create a [[circular economy]]
*Ecological/environmental: allowance for more extensive and diverse [[natural habitat]]s where the resources are returned to nature
*Societal: extend the capacity of precycling to meet everyone’s needs
The concept of ‘precycling’ was coined in 1988 by [[social marketing]] executive Maureen O’Rorke in a public waste education campaign for the City of Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=DiChristina|first1=Mariette|title=How We Can Win The War Against Garbage|magazine=Popular Science|year=1990|volume=237|issue=4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The application of precycling is not limited to large corporations, but can be administered on smaller scales in local communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The reason precycling is effective on large scales and on small scales stems from the idea that it shares a common language between experts and non-experts, buyers and sellers, economists and environmentalists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, it is important to consider that waste prevention systems, such as precycling, require the collaborative effort from several working parts.  These parts include prevention targets, producer responsibility, householder charging, funding for pilot projects, public involvement, engagement of private and third sectors, and public campaigns that spread awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|pages=193–219|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration of waste management==
The original three-pronged push for [[waste management]] is "[[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle]]." Precycling emphasizes "reducing and reusing", while harnessing and questioning the momentum and popularity of the term "recycle." In addition to this strategy, precycling incorporates four supplementary R’s: [[Repair]], Recondition, [[Remanufacturing|Remanufacture]] and Refuse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|pages=257–267|url= http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/ |doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste is a resource that can be reused, recycled, recovered, or treated.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1646|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precycling differs from other singular forms of waste prevention because it encompasses not one behavior, but many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=212|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduce is a form of precycling that allows for the preservation of [[natural resources]] and also saves money on behalf of the manufacturer, the consumer, and the waste manager.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, effective source reduction slows the [[resource depletion|depletion of environmental resources]], prolongs the life of waste management facilities, and makes combustion and [[landfill]]s safer by removing [[toxic waste]] components.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Reuse===
[[Reuse]] is a form of precycling that reinvents items after their initial life and avoids creating additional waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushnell|first1=Kristen|last2=Harpster|first2=Amy|last3=Simchuk|first3=Sarah|last4=Manckia|first4=Jen|last5=Stevens|first5=Cathy|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle|date=2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recycle===
Although precycling harnesses the familiarity of the term recycling, it is still important to note the difference between recycling and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since precycling focuses on the prevention of waste production, this entails that measures are taken before a substance, material, or product has become waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas recycling is a type of precycling that involves taking action before existing waste is abandoned to nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Recycling is a process where discarded materials are collected, sorted, processed, and used in the production of new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=263|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every time a person engages in the act of recycling, they help increase the market and bring the cost down.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt; However, current research from the American Plastics Council states that only 25% of the nation’s recycling capabilities are being utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krug|first1=Donna|last2=County Agency|first2=Barton|title=It's Easy to be Green|date=2009|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally [[recycling]] requires large amounts of energy to "melt down" and then re-manufacture items. While this may cut down on the amount of trash that is going into [[landfill]]s, it is not sustainable unless the underlying energy supply is sustainable. In addition, recycling often means [[downcycling]] and always involves at least some loss of the original material, so primary extraction is still required to make up the difference. Precycling reduces these problems by using less material in the first place, so less has to be recycled.

===Repairing===
[[Repair]] is a type of precycling that corrects specified faults in a product, however the quality of a repaired product is inferior to reconditioned or remanufactured items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found that 68% of the respondents believed repairing was not cost efficient and sought alternative methods such as reconditioning or remanufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconditioning===
[[Reconditioning]] is a type of precycling that requires the rebuilding of major components to restore a product’s working condition, which is expected to be inferior to the original product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remanufacturing===
[[Remanufacturing]] is another type of precycling that involves the greatest degree of work content, which results in superior quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to remanufacture a product, it requires a total dismantling of the product and the subsequent restoration and replacement of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remanufacturing is a preferred method of waste reduction compared to repairing and reconditioning because it preserves the [[embodied energy]] that has been used to shape the components of a product for their first life and it only requires 20-25% of the initial energy used in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refuse===
Refusal to buy certain products due to detrimental impacts on the environment or wasteful packaging is another type of precycling because the rejection of such items paves the way for products that can be reduced, reused, or recycled.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt;

==Zero-waste strategy==
A [[zero waste]] approach aims to prevent rather than just reduce accumulated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-waste goes beyond recycling to include the whole system, which includes the flow of resources and waste through human society.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This “design principle” works to maximize recycling, minimize waste, reduce consumption and ensures that products are reused, repaired or recycled back into nature or the market.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This preventative approach is more manageable and effective than incremental approaches that focus on gradually reducing the amount of impact because it is less complex and contains less information, which permits wider public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In regards to sustainability, the term itself is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of the status quo rather than growth and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the implementation of a zero-waste management strategy, sustainable practices can push the status quo in order to create a society that is capable of development, technically and culturally advanced, dynamic in population and production, thoughtful with the use of non-renewable resources, and diverse, democratic, and challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
Increased waste production is often negatively associated with increased [[economic growth]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; However, a zero-waste management strategy allows for economic growth that works cohesively with sustainability rather than against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of a zero-waste strategy is part of an economic goal-set that aims to create a circular economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circular economy refers to a closed-loop socio-economic system that focuses on minimizing wastes while simultaneously maximizing stocks of resources for the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closed-loop design diverts linear (open-loop) waste disposal streams into new raw material streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=259|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a circular economy, one way to minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for a full range of financed waste prevention opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions concerning waste prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=204|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental effects===
According to the “Extended Producer Responsibility” principle,  impacts are substantially determined at the point of design where key decisions are made on materials, production process, and how products are used and disposed of at the end of life-cycle, which falls on the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=258|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a circular economy there is the recognition that nature’s capacity needs to be maximized through the reprocess of biodegradable wastes produced by industries and human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is accomplished through the procurement and funding of precycling insurance premiums that invest in systematic preservation of endangered habitats, careful harvesting of biological resources and expansions of productive ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in terms of climate change, precycling insurance offers a flexible alternative to the binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions and international taxation on mineral fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[waste management]] systems, the environment benefits from the reparation of products to the greatest degree because less energy is required and the majority of the original material is kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=265|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal effects===
The social structure operating under a circular economy is referred to as a circular society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a circular society is to create a cooperative culture by means of problem-prevention, resource-availability and fuller participation, with reference to precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One critique of this approach, in terms of waste management, is that it is difficult to maintain a cooperative culture within a society because it is constantly evolving and changing.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt;

==Raising awareness==
There is an increasing [[public awareness]] on the need for [[sustainable production]] and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jefferson|last2=Dvorak|first2=Robert|last3=Kosior|first3=Edward|title=Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2009|volume=364|issue=1526|page=2124|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|pmid=19528059|pmc=2873020}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign that aimed at raising awareness of precycling focused on whether people’s self-reported behaviors were affected by exposure to precycling advertisements on the radio, television, or in-store flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the most effective results stemmed from the inclusion of social rewards that invoke an intrinsic motivation to engage in precycling behaviors.&lt;ref name=gillian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to raise awareness is through statistics that highlight the potential impacts that can be achieved through waste prevention. For instance, if 70 million Americans bought a half-gallon [[plastic-coated carton]] container of milk each week (instead of two quarts), then 41.6 million pounds of paper discards and 5.7 pounds of plastic discards would be reduced annually.  This transition from two quarts to a half-gallon would save $145.6 million on packaging each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In order to effectively implement precycling practices and behaviors, the public needs to feel "enabled", "engaged", "encouraged", and "exemplified" in their efforts to partake in precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=196|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the average consumer practice precycling, but industries can also participate. Purchasing from parts suppliers, reuse of chemicals, and reduction of unnecessary packaging are some methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Precycling|work=Environmental Encyclopedia|publisher=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some companies and countries that have taken it upon themselves to implement more sustainable practices that align with precycling principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1647|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Fonterra]] reduced its packaging through the implementation of bulking, reuse and redesign.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt; Further, [[Waste in New Zealand|Waste Management New Zealand]] created Recycle New Zealand, which provided a subsidiary focusing on the collection of materials that could be diverted and sorted prior to the operations of reducing, recycling, or recovering.  Moving forward, free-trade organizations can further implement precycling practices by exploring this strategy as a new way to reduce regulations and to promote greater industrial freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the individual consumer can develop precycling habits by engaging in the following practices and behaviors:

==="Enviro-shopping"===
Enviro-shopping is considered shopping with the environment and implements a precycling strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Bringing one's own grocery bag or bring old ones back to the store 
*Buying packages with the least amount of packaging 
*Buying in bulk, but not buying more than one will use
*Looking for products with reusable dishes

===Product selection===
Products to choose from in accordance with precycling principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plastic milk jugs or glass milk containers (no cartons)
*Fresh fruit and vegetables
*Concentrated products that involves less packaging
*Recycled products
*[[Rechargeable battery|Rechargeable batteries]]

===Behaviors===
In addition to shopping practices that implement precycling principles, there are also behaviors that can be undertaken to prevent waste:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=200|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Home [[compost]]ing
*Avoid [[Advertising mail|junk mail]]
*Buy [[used good|second-hand]]
*One way to participate in precycling is to carry a "precycling kit". Include a [[Tupperware]] or non-[[disposable]] container, [[silver (household)|silverware]] set, a [[napkin|cloth napkin]] or [[handkerchief]], and a [[thermos]] or water-bottle within a [[cloth]] bag that can double as a [[grocery bag|grocery/shopping bag]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16830">'''Predispositioning theory''', in the field of [[decision theory]] and [[systems theory]], is a theory focusing on the stages between a complete order and a complete disorder.

Predispositioning theory was founded by [[Aron Katsenelinboigen]] (1927–2005), a professor in the [[Wharton School]] who dealt with indeterministic [[systems]] such as [[chess]], [[business]], [[economics]], and other fields of knowledge and also made an essential step forward in elaboration of [[styles and methods of decision-making]].

==Predispositioning theory==
Predispositioning theory is focused on the intermediate stage between a complete order and a complete disorder. According to Katsenelinboigen, the system develops gradually, going through several stages, starting with incomplete and [[inconsistent]] linkages between its elements and ending with complete and consistent ones. 

“''Mess''. The zero phase can be called a mess because it contains no linkages between the system's elements. Such a definition of mess as ‘a disorderly, un-tidy, or dirty state of things’ we find in Webster's New World Dictionary. (…)&lt;br /&gt;
''Chaos''. Mess should not be confused with the next phase, chaos, as this term is understood today. Arguably, chaos is the first phase of indeterminism that displays sufficient order to talk of the general problem of system development. 
The chaos phase is characterized by some ordering of accumulated statistical data and the emergence of the basic rules of interactions of inputs and outputs (not counting boundary conditions). Even such a seemingly limited ordering makes it possible to fix systemic regularities of the sort shown by [[Feigenbaum number]]s and [[strange attractors]]. &lt;br /&gt;
(…) Different types of orderings in the chaos phase may be brought together under the notion of directing, for they point to a possible general direction of system development and even its extreme states. 
But even if a general path is known, enormous difficulties remain in linking algorithmically the present state with the final one and in operationalizing the algorithms. These objectives are realized in the next two large phases that I call predispositioning and programming. (…)
''Programming''. When linkages between states are established through reactive procedures, either by table functions or analytically, it is often assumed that each state is represented only by essentials. For instance, the production function in economics ties together inputs and outputs in physical terms. When a system is represented as an equilibrium or an optimization model, the original and conjugated parameters are stated explicitly; in economics, they are products (resources) and prices, respectively.9 Deterministic economic models have been extensively formalized; they assume full knowledge of inputs, outputs, and existing technologies. 
(…) Predispositioning (…) exhibits less complete linkages between system's elements than programming but more complete than chaos.” &lt;ref name="Concept of Indeterminism"&gt;Katsenelinboigen, Aron. The Concept of Indeterminism and Its Applications: Economics, Social Systems, Ethics, Artificial Intelligence, and Aesthetics Praeger: Westport, Connecticut, 1997, p.p.19-20)&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods like programming and randomness are well-known and developed while the methodology for the intermediate stages lying between complete chaos and complete order as well as their philosophical conceptualization have never been discussed explicitly and no methods of their measurements were elaborated. 
According to Katsenelinboigen, operative sub-methods of dealing with the system are programming, predispositioning, and randomness. They correspond to three stages of systems development.
Programming is a formation of complete and consistent linkages between all the stages of the systems' development.
Predispositioning is a formation of semi-efficient linkages between the stages of the system's development. In other words, predispositioning is a method responsible for creation of a predisposition.

Randomness is a formation of inconsistent linkages between the stages of the system's development. In this context, for instance, [[Darwinism]] emphasizes the exclusive role of chance occurrences in the system's development since it gives top priority to randomness as a method. Conversely, [[creationism]] states that the system develops in a comprehensive fashion, i.e. that programming is the only method involved in the development of the system. As Aron Katsenelinboigen notices, both schools neglect the fact that the process of the system's development includes a variety of methods which govern different stages, depending on the systems’ goals and conditions. 

Unfortunately, predispositioning as a method as well as a predisposition as an intermediate stage have never been discussed by scholars, though there were some interesting intuitive attempts to deal with the formation of a predisposition. The game of chess, at this point, was one of the most productive fields in the study of predispositioning as a method. Owing to chess’ focus on the positional style, it elaborated a host of innovative strategies and tactics that Katsenelinboigen analyzed and systematized and made them a basis for his theory.
To sum up, the main focus of predispositioning theory is on the intermediate stage of systems development, the stage that Katsenelinboigen proposed to call a "predisposition". This stage is distinguished by semi-complete and semi-consistent linkages between its elements. 
The most vital question when dealing with semi-complete and semi-consistent stages of the system is the question of its evaluation. To this end, Katsenelinboigen elaborated his structure of values, using the game of chess as a model.

==Structure of values==

According to Katsenelinboigen’s predispositioning theory, in the chess game pieces are evaluated from two basic points of view – their weight in a given position on the chessboard and their weight independent to any particular position. 
Based on the degree of conditionality, the values are:
*	Fully unconditional
*	Unconditional
*	Semi-conditional
*	Conditional

According to Katsenelinboigen, game pieces in chess are evaluated from two basic points of view: their weight with regard to a certain situation on the chessboard and their weight without regard to any particular situation, only to the position of the pieces. The latter are defined by Katsenelinboigen as semi-unconditional values, formed by the sole condition of the rules of piece interaction. The semiunconditional values of the pieces (such as queen 9, rook 5, bishop 3, knight 3, and pawn 1) appear as a result of the rules of interaction of a piece with the opponent’s king. All other conditions, such as starting conditions, final goal, and a program that links the initial condition to the final state, are not taken into account. The degree of conditionality is increased by applying preconditions, and the presence of all four preconditions fully forms conditional values.

Katsenelinboigen outlines two extreme cases of the spectrum of values—fully conditional and fully unconditional—and says that, in actuality, they are ineffectual in evaluating the material and so are sometimes replaced by semiconditional or semiunconditional valuations, which are distinguished by their differing degrees of conditionality. He defines fully conditional values as those based on complete and consistent linkages among all four preconditions.” &lt;ref name="Dramatic Genre "&gt;V. Ulea, The Concept of Dramatic Genre and The Comedy of A New Type. Chess, Literature, and Film. Southern Illinois University Press, 2002, pp144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditional values are formed by the four basic conditions:

* starting conditions 
* final goal 
* a program that links the initial conditions with the final state
* rules of interaction

The degree of unconditionality is predicated by the necessity to evaluate things under uncertainty (when the future is unknown) and conditions cannot be specified.

Applying his concept of values to social systems, Katsenelinboigen shows how the degree of unconditionality forms morality and law. According to him, the moral values represented in the [[Torah]] as the [[Ten Commandments]] are analogous to semi-unconditional values in a chess game, for they are based exclusively on the rules of interactions. 

“The difference between these two approaches is clearly manifested in the various translations of the Torah. For instance, The Holy Scriptures (1955), a new translation based on the masoretic text  (a vast body of the textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible), translates the commandment as ‘Thou shalt not commit murder.’ In The Holy Bible, commonly known as the authorized ([[King James Version of the Bible|King James]]) version (The Gideons International, 1983), this commandment is translated as ‘''Thou shalt not kill''.’
(…) The difference between unconditional and semi-unconditional evaluations will become more prominent if we use the same example of ‘Thou shalt not kill and ‘Thou shalt not murder’ to illustrate the conduct of man in accordance with his precepts.
In an extreme case, one who follows ‘Thou shalt not kill’ will allow himself to be killed before he kills another. These views are held by one of the [[Hindu sects]] in Sri Lanka (the former Ceylon). To the best of my knowledge, the former prime minister of Ceylon, [[Solomon Bandaranaike]] (1899-1959), belonged to this sect. He did not allow himself to kill an attacker and was murdered. As he lay bleeding to death, he did crawl over to the murderer and knock the pistol from his hand before it could be used against his wife, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She later became the prime minister of Ceylon-Sri Lanka.” &lt;ref name="Concept of Indeterminism"&gt; 135-36&lt;/ref&gt;

But how does one ascribe weights to certain parameters, establishes the degree of conditionality, etc.? How does the evaluative process go in indeterministic systems?

==The role of subjectivity==

Katsenelinboigen states that the evaluative category for indeterministic systems is based on subjectivity.
''"This pioneering approach to the evaluative process is the subject of Katsenelinboigen’s work on indeterministic systems. The roots of one’s subjective evaluation lie in the fact that the executor cannot be separated from the evaluator, who evaluates the system in accordance with his or her own particular ability to develop it. This can be observed in chess, in which the same position is evaluated differently by different chess players, or in literature with regard to hermeneutics."'' &lt;ref name="Dramatic Genre "&gt;p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Katsenelinboigen writes:
:''The subjective element arises not because the set of positional parameters and their valuations are formed based on a player’s intuition. Rather, the choice of relevant parameters depends on the actual executor of the position, that is, the particular strengths and weaknesses of a given player. The role of the executor becomes vital because the actual realization of the position is not known beforehand, so future moves will have to be made based on the contingent situation at hand.'' &lt;ref&gt;Indeterministic Economics. Praeger Publishers, 1992, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Katsenelinboigen clearly explains why subjectivity of the managerial decision is inevitable:
:“The original subjective evaluation of the situation by the decision-maker is critical in the creative strategic management. Subjectivity of the managerial decisions is inevitable due to the intrinsically indeterministic nature of the strategic management, meaning that the subjectivity arises not just because of the lack of scientific foundation in business management. The effective approach to the strategic decision-making, as demonstrated in the game of chess, presupposes that each player has a unique, individual vision of his strategic position. To make it more systematic, one should not substitute the player’s intuition with some objective laws that relate essential and positional parameters, but rather complement the intuition with the statistical analysis.” &lt;ref name="Concept of Indeterminism"&gt;p. 164 &lt;/ref&gt;

To sum up, subjectivity becomes an important factor in evaluating a predisposition. The roots of one's subjective evaluation lie in the fact that the executor cannot be separated from the evaluator who evaluates the system in accordance with his own particular ability to develop it.

The structure of values plays an essential part in calculus of predisposition.

==Calculus of predispositions==

[[Calculus of predispositions]], a basic part of predispositioning theory, belongs to the indeterministic procedures. 
“The key component of any indeterministic procedure is the evaluation of a position. Since it is impossible to devise a deterministic chain linking the inter-mediate state with the outcome of the game, the most complex component of any indeterministic method is assessing these intermediate stages. It is precisely the function of predispositions to assess the impact of an intermediate state upon the future course of development.” &lt;ref name="Concept of Indeterminism"&gt;p.33&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Katsenelinboigen, calculus of predispositions is another method of computing probability. Both methods may lead to the same results and, thus, can be interchangeable. However, it is not always possible to interchange them since computing via frequencies requires availability of statistics, possibility to gather the data as well as having the knowledge of the extent to which one can interlink the system’s constituent elements. Also, no statistics can be obtained on unique events and, naturally, in such cases the calculus of predispositions becomes the only option.
The procedure of calculating predispositions is linked to two steps – dissection of the system on its constituent elements and integration of the analyzed parts in a new whole.  According to Katsenelinboigen, the system is structured by two basic types of parameters – material and positional. The material parameters constitute the skeleton of the system. Relationships between them form positional parameters. The calculus of predispositions primarily deals with 
* analyzing the system’s material and positional parameters as [[dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] and
* measuring them in unconditional valuations.  

In order to quantify the evaluation of a position we need new techniques, which I have grouped under the heading of calculus of predispositions. This calculus is based on a weight function, which represents a variation on the well-known criterion of optimality for local extremum. This criterion incorporates material parameters and their conditional valuations. 
The following key elements distinguish the modified weight function from the criterion of optimality:

* First and foremost, the weight function includes not only material parameters as independent (controlling) variables, but also positional (relational) parameters. 
* The valuations of material and positional parameters composing the weight function are, to a certain extent, unconditional; that is, they are independent of the specific conditions, but do take into account the rules of the game and statistics (experience).” &lt;ref name="Concept of Indeterminism"&gt; 35&lt;/ref&gt;

To conclude, there are some basic differences between frequency-based and predispositions-based methods of computing [[probability]].

* The [[frequency probability|frequency-based method]] is grounded in statistics and frequencies of events. 
* The predispositions-based method approaches a system from the point of view of its predisposition. It is used when no statistics is available. 
* The predispositions-based method is used for the novel and unique situations.

According to Katsenelinboigen, the two methods of computing probability may complement each other if, for instance, they are applied to a multilevel system with an increasing complexity of its composition at higher levels.

'''Quantum statistical mechanics''' is [[statistical mechanics]] applied to [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical systems]]. In quantum mechanics a [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] (probability distribution over possible [[quantum state]]s) is described by a [[density matrix|density operator]] ''S'', which is a non-negative, [[self-adjoint]], [[trace-class]] operator of trace 1 on the [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' describing the quantum system.  This can be shown under various [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics]].  One such formalism is provided by [[quantum logic]].

== Expectation ==

From classical probability theory, we know that the [[expected value|expectation]] of a [[random variable]] ''X'' is defined by its [[Probability distribution|distribution]] D&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{E}(X) = \int_\mathbb{R} \lambda \, d \, \operatorname{D}_X(\lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
assuming, of course, that the random variable is [[integrable]] or that the random variable is non-negative. Similarly, let ''A'' be an [[observable]] of a quantum mechanical system. ''A'' is given by a densely defined self-adjoint operator on ''H''.  The [[spectral measure]] of ''A'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}_A(U) = \int_U \lambda d \operatorname{E}(\lambda), &lt;/math&gt;

uniquely determines ''A'' and conversely, is uniquely determined by ''A''.  E&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;  is a boolean homomorphism from the Borel subsets of '''R''' into the lattice ''Q'' of self-adjoint projections of ''H''. In analogy with probability theory, given a state ''S'', we introduce the ''distribution'' of ''A''  under ''S'' which is the probability measure defined on the Borel subsets of '''R''' by
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{D}_A(U) = \operatorname{Tr}(\operatorname{E}_A(U) S). &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the expected value of ''A'' is defined in terms of the probability distribution D&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{E}(A) = \int_\mathbb{R} \lambda \, d \, \operatorname{D}_A(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this expectation is relative to the  mixed state ''S'' which is used in the definition of D&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Remark'''.  For technical reasons, one needs to consider separately the positive and negative parts of ''A'' defined by the [[Borel functional calculus]] for unbounded operators.

One can easily show:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{E}(A)  = \operatorname{Tr}(A S) = \operatorname{Tr}(S A). &lt;/math&gt;

Note that if ''S'' is a [[pure state]] corresponding to the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] &amp;psi;, then:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{E}(A) = \langle \psi | A | \psi \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

The trace of an operator A is written as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr}(A) = \sum_{m} \langle m  |  A |  m \rangle  . &lt;/math&gt;

== Von Neumann entropy ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Physical information]] --&gt;

{{main|Von Neumann entropy}}

Of particular significance for describing randomness of a state is the von Neumann entropy of ''S'' ''formally'' defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{H}(S) = -\operatorname{Tr}(S \log_2 S) &lt;/math&gt;.  
Actually, the operator  ''S'' log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''S'' is not necessarily trace-class. However, if ''S'' is a non-negative self-adjoint operator not of trace class we define Tr(''S'') = +&amp;infin;.  Also note that any density operator ''S'' can be diagonalized, that it can be represented in some orthonormal basis by a (possibly infinite) matrix of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots \\ 0 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp;  \lambda_n &amp; \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
and we define
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{H}(S) = - \sum_i \lambda_i \log_2 \lambda_i. &lt;/math&gt;
The convention is that &lt;math&gt; \; 0 \log_2 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, since an event with probability zero should not contribute to the entropy. This value is an extended real number (that is in [0, &amp;infin;]) and this is clearly a unitary invariant of ''S''.

'''Remark'''. It is indeed possible that H(''S'') = +&amp;infin; for some density operator ''S''. In fact ''T'' be the diagonal matrix
:&lt;math&gt; T = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2 (\log_2  2)^2 }&amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1}{3 (\log_2  3)^2 } &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp;  \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp;  \frac{1}{n (\log_2  n)^2 } &amp; \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
''T'' is non-negative trace class and one can show ''T'' log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''T'' is not trace-class.

'''Theorem'''.  Entropy is a unitary invariant.

In analogy with [[Shannon entropy#Formal definitions|classical entropy]] (notice the similarity in the definitions), H(''S'') measures the amount of randomness in the state ''S''. The more dispersed the eigenvalues are, the larger the system entropy. For a system in which the space ''H'' is finite-dimensional, entropy is maximized for the states ''S'' which in diagonal form have the representation
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{n} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1}{n} &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp;  \frac{1}{n} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
For such an ''S'', H(''S'') = log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''. The state ''S'' is called the maximally mixed state.

Recall that a [[pure state]] is one of the form 
:&lt;math&gt; S = | \psi \rangle \langle \psi |, &lt;/math&gt;
for &amp;psi; a vector of norm 1.

'''Theorem'''.  H(''S'') = 0 if and only if ''S'' is a pure state.

For ''S'' is a pure state if and only if its diagonal form has exactly one non-zero entry which is a 1.

Entropy can be used as a measure of [[quantum entanglement]].

== Gibbs canonical ensemble ==

{{main|canonical ensemble}}

Consider an ensemble of systems described by a Hamiltonian ''H'' with average energy ''E''.  If ''H'' has pure-point spectrum and the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' go to +&amp;infin; sufficiently fast, e&lt;sup&gt;−''r H''&lt;/sup&gt; will be a non-negative trace-class operator for every positive ''r''.

The ''[[Gibbs canonical ensemble]]'' is described by the state 
:&lt;math&gt; S= \frac{\mathrm{e}^{- \beta H}}{\operatorname{Tr}(\mathrm{e}^{- \beta H})}. &lt;/math&gt;
Where &amp;beta; is such that the ensemble average of energy satisfies  
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr}(S H) = E &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\mathrm{e}^{- \beta H}) = \sum_n \mathrm{e}^{- \beta E_n} = Z(\beta) &lt;/math&gt;

This is called the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]; it is the quantum mechanical version of the [[canonical partition function]] of classical statistical mechanics. The probability that a system chosen at random from the ensemble will be in a state corresponding to energy eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;E_m&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(E_m) = \frac{\mathrm{e}^{- \beta E_m}}{\sum_n \mathrm{e}^{- \beta E_n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under certain conditions, the Gibbs canonical ensemble maximizes the von Neumann entropy of the state subject to the energy conservation requirement.{{clarify|reason = How so? This ensemble spans over many energies, so what does 'energy conservation' refer to?|date=September 2013}}

== Grand canonical ensemble ==

{{main|grand canonical ensemble}}

For open systems where the energy and numbers of particles may fluctuate, the system is described by the [[grand canonical ensemble]], described by the density matrix
:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{\mathrm{e}^{\beta (\sum_i \mu_iN_i - H)}}{\operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathrm{e}^{- \beta (H + \sum_i \mu_iN_i)}\right)}. &lt;/math&gt;
where the ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are the particle number operators for the different species of particles that are exchanged with the reservoir. Note that this is a density matrix including many more states (of varying N) compared to the canonical ensemble.

The grand partition function is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z(\beta, \mu_1, \mu_2, \cdots) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathrm{e}^{\beta (\sum_i \mu_iN_i - H)}) &lt;/math&gt;

Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of religious coping==
[[Kenneth Pargament]] is the author of the book ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping]]'' and a leading researcher in religious coping. Along with developing the "RCOPE" questionnaire to measure religious coping strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = Kenneth I. | last2 = Koenig | first2 = Harold G. | last3 = Perez | first3 = Lisa M. | year = 2000 | title = The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 519–543 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 | pmid = 10775045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pargament and his colleagues designated three basic styles of coping with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Joseph Kennell, William Hathaway, Nancy Grevengoed, Jon Newman &amp; Wendy Jones (1988). Religion and the problem-solving process: Three styles of coping. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, v27 n1, pp90-104. ISSN 0021-8294&lt;/ref&gt; In Pargament's article "Religion and the Problem-Solving Process: Three Styles of Coping", he identifies the collaborative, self-directed, and deferring coping styles. The collaborative style of religious coping involves an active and internalized personal exchange with God. The deferring coping style is when individuals rely heavily on God and delegate their stress without taking personal responsibility for the situation. The self-directed style of religious coping emphasizes the free will given by God that allows for the individual to solve the problem on their own. The collaborative style of coping has been found to produce the most advantages in clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = III | last2 = Lynn | first2 = Q.

In a meta-analysis of 49 studies reviewing religion as a coping method, several mechanisms of positive coping were identified. Several are listed below.
* religious purification/forgiveness
* religious direction/conversion
* seeking support from clergy members
* spiritual connection
In the same study, negative coping strategies were also pinpointed. Some of them are listed below.
* spiritual discontent
* punishing God reappraisal
* reappraisal of God's powers
* pleading for direct intercession
The study then identified forms of positive psychological adjustment, like those listed below.
* acceptance
* happiness
* optimism
* purpose in life
A similar list of negative psychological adjustments was compiled.
* anxiety
* burden
* negative mood
* callousness
Positive religious coping methods correlated more strongly with positive psychological adjustment than negative psychological adjustment. Similarly, negative religious coping methods correlated with negative psychological adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–80|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific traumatic events==

===September 11 attacks===
The [[September 11 attacks]] have been widely studied among psychologists. Research has shown that 90% of Americans coped with the stress of September 11 (2001) by "turning to religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Harold G|title=Research on Religion, Spirituality, and Mental Health: A Review|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=54|issue=5|pages=283–291|doi=10.1177/070674370905400502|pmid=19497160|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-two percent of a sample of undergraduate and graduate students reported praying to cope with the stress that followed the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = BD | last2 = Elliott | first2 = MN | last3 = Jaycox | first3 = LH | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = A national longitudinal study of the psychological consequences of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: reactions, impairment, and help-seeking | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 105–117 | doi=10.1521/psyc.67.2.105.35964| pmid = 15262576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis showed that searching for spiritual meaning was associated with less anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Cascio | first2 = T | last3 = Santangelo | first3 = LK | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Hope, meaning, and growth following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks | url = | journal = J Interpers Violence | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 523–548 | doi=10.1177/0886260504272896| pmid = 15788553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists also examined the types of coping used and how they affected mental health outcomes. Research shows that people who used positive religious coping displayed greater optimism, less anxiety, and higher levels of positive emotion three months after the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Tice | first2 = TN | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Prayers, spiritual support, and positive attitudes in coping with the September 11 national crisis | url = | journal = J Pers | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 763–791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00328.x| pmid = 15854013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who used positive religious coping were found to have significantly more positive outcomes (closeness with God, relationships with family and friends) than those who used negative religious coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = KI | last2 = Ishler | first2 = K | last3 = Dubow | first3 = EF | display-authors = etal | year = 1994 | title = Methods of religious coping with the Gulf War: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses | url = | journal = J Sci Study Relig | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 347–361 | doi=10.2307/1386494| jstor = 1386494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Muslims were another highly studied group after the attacks. Results in this area align with previous research, showing that positive religious coping is associated with posttraumatic growth, while negative religious coping predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abu-Raiya | first1 = H. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | last3 = Mahoney | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks | url = | journal = Psychology of Religion and Spirituality | volume = 3| issue = | pages = 1–14| doi = 10.1037/a0020034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of a loved one===

Individuals deal with the death of significant people in their lives in a variety of ways. One of the most common ways that Americans deal with the death of a loved one is by turning to religion. Although most psychologists would argue that religious coping leads to positive outcomes, some research identifies that coping using religious can lead to greater amounts of distress, especially in dealing with the loss of a family member due to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Vardaman | first2 = P. J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of religion in coping with the loss of a family member to homicide | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 44–51 | doi = 10.2307/1387881 | jstor = 1387881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research recognized that the role of attachment to God is very important in determining how successful religious coping will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ungureanu | first1 = I. | last2 = Sandberg | first2 = J. G. | year = 2010 | title = Broken together": Spirituality and religion as coping strategies for couples dealing with the death of a child: A literature review with clinical implications | url = | journal = Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 302–319 | doi = 10.1007/s10591-010-9120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that secure attachment to God and a positive religious coping style is positively correlated with stress related growth, positive religious outcomes, and a developed sense of meaning. Anxious and avoidant attachments to God and negative religious coping styles were positively correlated with depression, traumatic distress, and separation distress. Furthermore, attachment to God was strongly more correlated to positive outcomes than attachment to others.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M. M. (2003, April). Bereavement and grief related to a significant death: A psychological and theological study of attachment styles and religious coping. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 63,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-death experiences===

[[Near-death experiences]] (NDEs) provide a unique opportunity for psychologists to study the way in which people cope with their own death. NDEs generally trigger an out-of-body experience into a realm populated with spiritual beings and have the potential to shape American attitudes toward death in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwilecki | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Religion and Coping: A Contribution from Religious Studies | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 477–489 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that five percent of Americans have a NDE, which presents a limited field to study.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L. W. and J. Yates. (1996.) Introduction. In the near-death experience: A reader, edited by L. W. Bailey and J. Yates, pp. 1–23. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, people who have NDEs report positive outcomes including reduced anxiety, increased capacity to love, and a higher sense of meaning and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, P. M. H. (1994). Beyond the light: The mysteries and revelations of near-death experiences. New York: Avon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have NDEs often fall into Pargament's category of transformative coping. In these cases, the person is transformed into a whole new way of life and way of thinking by one supernatural experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using religious coping in school and work ==

=== MindUP Initiative ===
Twelve years ago Goldie Hawn founded MindUP: a mindfulness based initiative to help students in schools deal with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, E. (2015, Feb 17). Can 'mindfulness' help students do better in school? advocates say the meditation technique raises focus and lowers stress. critics see religion in disguise. Wall Street Journal (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; The program has since been implemented in schools in 28 states, and has locations in Canada, China, Serbia, Australia, and Venezuela. The program invites students to participate in 15 lessons based on neuroscience. Kimberly Schonert-Reichl an employee of MindsUP and of the University of British Columbia evaluated the effectiveness of MindUP on students grades 4 through 5. Her findings are shown below:

* 82% of children reported having a more positive outlook
* 81% of children learned to make themselves happy
* 58% of children tried to help others more often

Even though MindUP has had very positive effects skeptics call it religion in disguise. They claim that the mindfulness exercises such as "belly breaths" are [[Buddhist]] practices as a different name. In some states MindUP has been removed from schools because schools are supposed to be secular and non-religious.

===Religion as buffer in the workplace===
A study was conducted by Dr Roxane Gervais, a senior psychologist at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Stockport.&lt;ref&gt;Religion forms buffer against work stress. (2014, Jan 09). Telegraph.Co.Uk&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people who were more actively religious were more likely to report low levels of anxiety, depression and fatigue and also felt a higher presence of meaning in life. These people also took less sick days. She concluded that employers should accommodate time for employees to engage in religious beliefs while at work in order to improve performance.

==Religious coping in clinical settings==
Despite the problems encountered when studying religion as a coping mechanism, much research suggests that using it in intervention settings when applicable may be beneficial. For example, according to a study be Wachholtz and Pargament, when identified religious people suffering from splitting migraines were exposed to meditations with religious or non-religious content, they reported less pain after the religious meditations. Such "psychospiritual" methods have been utilized for a while, although their applications are limited and specific from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion vs. spirituality==
Research in the psychology of religion often reveals different outcomes between [[religion]] and [[spirituality]]. A person's religion is a collection of belief systems and moral values, often established by a governing institution. Religion is generally more traditional, organized, and sociological. Religion is considered to be more formal and upheld than spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality, on the other hand, is a measure of one's intrinsic relationship with their God. Spirituality is viewed and studied as being more free-formed and psychological. Also, spirituality is considered to be a private experience that promotes a process of growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychology of coping with trauma, religion and spirituality can play very different roles. Some research shows that religion, but not spirituality can help with coping,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Tomas. (2012). Religion, but not spirituality, helps protect against post-earthquake trauma. Epiphenom.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other shows that intrinsic spirituality can be a very effective style of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vespa | first1 = A. | last2 = Jacobsen | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Spazzafumo | first3 = L. | last4 = Balducci | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Evaluation of intrapsychic factors, coping styles, and spirituality of patients affected by tumors | url = | journal = Psycho-Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 5–11 | doi = 10.1002/pon.1719 | pmid = 20336646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences found between religious and spiritual coping may be further evidence of the role of attachment styles and types of coping used. Through religious and spiritual coping, individuals can derive support from a divine being, from other members of a religious congregation, and from making meaning of distressing events, which can lead to the promotion of resilience, healing, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with studying religious coping==
Studying religion as a coping mechanism has proved a difficult task for psychologists. Religion seems to be an integral part of some people's lives but not of others, so specialists cannot be certain whether religion is the variable to study or if there is something about religious people that makes them religious that is worth studying. Many studies only measure the frequency of certain "religious" activities including prayer or religious service attendance; however, just because a person exhibits religious behavior does not mean that he or she uses his or her religion to cope or even adheres to the set of beliefs that constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–480|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research done on religion and coping has been isolated to Christianity. Studies are being conducted to accommodate for the diversity of religions and their differences among cultures.

Many studies on the subject show contrary results. For example, some psychologists conclude that religiosity has no positive or negative outcomes at all and others cite that any form of religious coping has ultimately negative effects. These results may be a product of the inconsistencies in the ways that religion is studied as a coping mechanism or could reflect biases of researchers toward a certain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{software development process}}

In [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]], '''requirements analysis''' encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product or project, taking account of the possibly conflicting [[requirement]]s of the various [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], ''analyzing, documenting, validating and managing'' software or system requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Kotonya, G. and Sommerville, I. 1998. ''Requirements Engineering: Processes and Techniques'' Chichester, UK: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements analysis is critical to the success or failure of a systems or software project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design.

== Overview ==
Conceptually, requirements analysis includes three types of activities:{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
*[[Requirements elicitation|Eliciting requirements]]: (e.g. the project charter or definition), business process documentation, and stakeholder interviews. This is sometimes also called requirements gathering or requirements discovery.
*Analyzing requirements: determining whether the stated requirements are clear, complete, consistent and unambiguous, and resolving any apparent conflicts.
*Recording requirements: Requirements may be documented in various forms, usually including a summary list and may include natural-language documents, [[use case]]s, [[User story|user stories]], process specifications and a variety of models including data models.

Requirements analysis can be a long and tiring process during which many delicate psychological skills are involved. Large systems may confront analysts with hundreds or thousands of system requirements.&lt;ref name="bec1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/systems-methods-analyzing-requirements/|author=Beck, A., Boeing, G., &amp; Shannon, D.|title=Systems and Methods for Analyzing Requirements. US Patent 8650186|date=2014|accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; New systems change the environment and relationships between people, so it is important to identify all the stakeholders, take into account all their needs and ensure they understand the implications of the new systems. Analysts can employ several techniques to elicit the requirements from the customer. These may include the development of scenarios (represented as [[User story|user stories]] in [[Agile software development|agile methods]]), the identification of [[use case]]s, the use of workplace observation or [[ethnography]],  holding [[interview]]s, or [[focus group]]s (more aptly named in this context as requirements workshops, or requirements review sessions) and creating requirements lists. [[Prototyping]] may be used to develop an example system that can be demonstrated to stakeholders.  Where necessary, the analyst will employ a combination of these methods to establish the exact requirements of the stakeholders, so that a system that meets the business needs is produced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Requirements quality can be improved through these and other methods
* Visualization. Using tools that promote better understanding of the desired end-product such as visualization and simulation.
* Consistent use of templates. Producing a consistent set of models and templates to document the requirements.
* Documenting dependencies. Documenting dependencies and interrelationships among requirements, as well as any assumptions and congregations.

== Requirements analysis topics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}

=== Stakeholder identification ===
See [[Stakeholder analysis]] for a discussion of people or organizations (legal entities such as companies, standards bodies) that have a valid interest in the system. They may be affected by it either directly or indirectly.
A major new emphasis in the 1990s was a focus on the identification of ''stakeholders''. It is increasingly recognized that stakeholders are not limited to the organization employing the analyst. Other stakeholders will include:
* anyone who operates the system (normal and maintenance operators)
* anyone who benefits from the system (functional, political, financial and social beneficiaries)
* anyone involved in purchasing or procuring the system. In a mass-market product organization, product management, marketing and sometimes sales act as surrogate consumers (mass-market customers) to guide development of the product.
* organizations which regulate aspects of the system (financial, safety, and other regulators)
* people or organizations opposed to the system (negative stakeholders; see also [[Misuse case]])
* organizations responsible for systems which interface with the system under design.
* those organizations who [[horizontal integration|integrate horizontally]] with the organization for whom the analyst is designing the system.

=== Joint Requirements Development (JRD) Sessions ===
Requirements often have cross-functional implications that are unknown to individual stakeholders and often missed or incompletely defined during stakeholder interviews. These cross-functional implications can be elicited by conducting JRD sessions in a controlled environment, facilitated by a trained [[facilitator]] (Business Analyst), wherein stakeholders participate in discussions to elicit requirements, analyze their details and uncover cross-functional implications. A dedicated scribe should be present to document the discussion, freeing up the Business Analyst to lead the discussion in a direction that generates appropriate requirements which meet the session objective.

JRD Sessions are analogous to [[Joint application design|Joint Application Design]] Sessions. In the former, the sessions elicit requirements that guide design, whereas the latter elicit the specific design features to be implemented in satisfaction of elicited requirements.

=== Contract-style requirement lists ===
One traditional way of documenting requirements has been contract style requirement lists. In a complex system such requirements lists can run to hundreds of pages long.

An appropriate metaphor would be an extremely long shopping list. Such lists are very much out of favour in modern analysis; as they have proved spectacularly unsuccessful at achieving their aims; but they are still seen to this day.

====Strengths====

* Provides a checklist of requirements.
* Provide a contract between the project sponsor(s) and developers.
* For a large system can provide a high level description from which lower-level requirements can be derived.

====Weaknesses====

* Such lists can run to hundreds of pages. They are not intended to serve as a reader-friendly description of the desired application.
* Such requirements lists abstract all the requirements and so there is little context.  The Business Analyst may include context for requirements in accompanying design documentation.
** '''This abstraction is not intended to describe how the requirements fit or work together.
** The list may not reflect relationships and dependencies between requirements. While a list does make it easy to prioritize each individual item, removing one item out of context can render an entire use case or business requirement useless.
** The list '''doesn't supplant '''the need to review requirements carefully with stakeholders in order to gain a better shared understanding of the implications for the design of the desired system / application.
* Simply creating a list does not guarantee its completeness. The Business Analyst must make a good faith effort to discover and collect a substantially comprehensive list, and rely on stakeholders to point out missing requirements.
* These lists can create a false sense of mutual understanding between the stakeholders and developers; Business Analysts are critical to the translation process.
* It is almost impossible to uncover all the functional requirements before the process of development and testing begins. If these lists are treated '''as an immutable contract, then requirements that emerge in the Development process may generate a controversial change request.'''

====Alternative to requirement lists====

As an alternative to requirement lists, [[Agile software development|Agile Software Development]] uses [[User stories]] to suggest requirements in everyday language.

=== Measurable goals ===
{{main|Goal modeling}}
Best practices take the composed list of requirements merely as clues and repeatedly ask "why?" until the actual business purposes are discovered. Stakeholders and developers can then devise tests to measure what level of each goal has been achieved thus far.  Such goals change more slowly than the long list of specific but unmeasured requirements. Once a small set of critical, measured goals has been established, [[Software prototyping#Throwaway prototyping|rapid prototyping]] and short iterative development phases may proceed to deliver actual stakeholder value long before the project is half over.

===Prototypes===

{{main|Software prototyping}}

A prototype is a computer program that exhibits a part of the properties of another computer program, allowing users to visualize an application that has not yet been constructed. A popular form of prototype is a [[mockup]], which helps future users and other stakeholders to get an idea of what the system will look like. Prototypes make it easier to make design decisions, because aspects of the application can be seen and shared before the application is built. Major improvements in communication between users and developers were often seen with the introduction of prototypes. Early views of applications led to fewer changes later and hence reduced overall costs considerably. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Prototypes can be flat diagrams (often referred to as [[Wire-frame model|wireframes]]) or working applications using synthesized functionality. Wireframes are made in a variety of graphic design documents, and often remove all color from the design (i.e. use a greyscale color palette) in instances where the final software is expected to have [[graphic design]] applied to it. This helps to prevent confusion as to whether the prototype represents the final visual look and feel of the application. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Use cases===
{{main|Use case}}
A use case is a structure for documenting the functional requirements for a system, usually involving software, whether that is new or being changed.  Each use case provides a set of ''scenarios'' that convey how the system should interact with a human user or another system, to achieve a specific business goal.  Use cases typically avoid technical jargon, preferring instead the language of the [[end-user]] or ''[[domain expert]]''.  Use cases are often co-authored by requirements engineers and stakeholders.

Use cases are deceptively simple tools for describing the behavior of software or systems. A use case contains a textual description of the ways in which users are intended to work with the software or system. Use cases should not describe internal workings of the system, nor should they explain how that system will be implemented. Instead, they show the steps needed to perform a task without sequential assumptions.

===[[Software requirements specification|Requirements specification]]===
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}

== Types of requirements ==
{{cleanup|section|date=February 2011}}
[[Requirement]]s are [[Categorization|categorized]] in several ways. The following are common categorizations of requirements that relate to technical management:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;

;Customer requirements
: Statements of fact and assumptions that define the expectations of the system in terms of mission objectives, environment, constraints, and measures of effectiveness and suitability (MOE/MOS). The customers are those that perform the eight primary functions of systems engineering, with special emphasis on the operator as the key customer. Operational requirements will define the basic need and, at a minimum, answer the questions posed in the following listing:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
:*''Operational distribution or deployment'': Where will the system be used?
:*''Mission profile or scenario'': How will the system accomplish its mission objective?
:*''Performance and related parameters'': What are the critical system parameters to accomplish the mission?
:*''Utilization environments'': How are the various system components to be used?
:*''Effectiveness requirements'': How effective or efficient must the system be in performing its mission?
:*''Operational life cycle'': How long will the system be in use by the user?
:*''Environment'': What environments will the system be expected to operate in an effective manner?
;Architectural requirements: Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary [[systems architecture]] of a [[system]].
;Structural requirements: Structural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary [[structure]] of a system.
;Behavioral requirements: Behavioral requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary [[behavior]] of a system.
;Functional requirements: [[Functional requirement]]s explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary task, action or activity that must be accomplished. Functional requirements analysis will be used as the toplevel functions for functional analysis.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Non-functional requirements: [[Non-functional requirement]]s are requirements that specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.
;Performance requirements: The extent to which a mission or function must be executed; generally measured in terms of quantity, quality, coverage, timeliness or readiness. During requirements analysis, performance (how well does it have to be done) requirements will be interactively developed across all identified functions based on system life cycle factors; and characterized in terms of the degree of certainty in their estimate, the degree of criticality to system success, and their relationship to other requirements.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Design requirements: The "build to", "code to", and "buy to" requirements for products and "how to execute" requirements for processes expressed in technical data packages and technical manuals.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Derived requirements: Requirements that are implied or transformed from higher-level requirement. For example, a requirement for long range or high speed may result in a design requirement for low weight.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
;Allocated requirements: A requirement that is established by dividing or otherwise allocating a high-level requirement into multiple lower-level requirements. Example: A 100-pound item that consists of two subsystems might result in weight requirements of 70 pounds and 30 pounds for the two lower-level items.&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;

Well-known requirements categorization models include [[FURPS]] and FURPS+, developed at [[Hewlett-Packard]].

==Requirements analysis issues==

===Stakeholder issues===
Steve McConnell, in his book ''Rapid Development'', details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:
* Users do not understand what they want or users don't have a clear idea of their requirements
* Users will not commit to a set of written requirements
* Users insist on new requirements after the cost and schedule have been fixed
* Communication with users is slow
* Users often do not participate in reviews or are incapable of doing so
* Users are technically unsophisticated
* Users do not understand the development process
* Users do not know about present technology
This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.

===Engineer/developer issues===
Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:
* A natural inclination towards writing code can lead to implementation beginning before the requirements analysis is complete, potentially resulting in inelegant refactoring to meet actual requirements once they are known.
* Technical personnel and end-users may have different vocabularies. Consequently, they may wrongly believe they are in perfect agreement until the finished product is supplied.
* Engineers and developers may try to make the requirements fit an existing system or model, rather than develop a system specific to the needs of the client.

===Attempted solutions===
One attempted solution to communications problems has been to employ specialists in business or system analysis.

Techniques introduced in the 1990s like [[Software prototyping|prototyping]], [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[use case]]s, and [[agile software development]] are also intended as solutions to problems encountered with previous methods.

Also, a new class of [[Application Simulation Software|application simulation]] or application definition tools have entered the market. These tools are designed to bridge the communication gap between business users and the IT organization — and also to allow applications to be 'test marketed' before any code is produced. The best of these tools offer:
* [[electronic whiteboard]]s to sketch application flows and test alternatives
* ability to capture business logic and data needs
* ability to generate high fidelity prototypes that closely imitate the final application
* interactivity
* capability to add contextual requirements and other comments
* ability for remote and distributed users to run and interact with the simulation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32910">In our modern society, computerized or digital [[control system]]s have been used to reliably automate many of the industrial operations that we take for granted, from the power plant to the automobiles we drive. However, the complexity of these systems and how the designers integrate them, the roles and responsibilities of the humans that interact with the systems, and the [[cyber security]] of these highly networked systems has led to a new paradigm in research philosophy for next generation control systems. '''Resilient Control Systems''' consider all of these elements and those disciplines that contribute to a more effective design, such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[computer science]], and [[control engineering]] to develop interdisciplinary solutions. These solutions consider such things such as how to tailor the control system operating displays to best enable the user to make an accurate and reproducible response, how to design in cyber security protections such that the system defends itself from attack by changing its behaviors, and how to better integrate widely distributed computer control systems to prevent cascading failures that result in disruptions to critical industrial operations. In the context of [[Cyber-physical system|cyber-physical]] systems, resilient control systems are an aspect that focuses on the unique interdependencies of a control system, as compared to [[information technology]] computer systems and networks, due to its importance in operating our critical industrial operations.

==Introduction==
Originally intended to provide a more efficient mechanism for controlling industrial operations, the development of [[digital control]] systems allowed for flexibility in integrating distributed sensors and operating logic while maintaining a centralized interface for human monitoring and interaction.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gopal, "Digital Control And State Variable Method," Tata McGraw-Hill, pp. 3-12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This ease of readily adding sensors and logic through software, which was once done with relays and isolated analog instruments, has led to wide acceptance and integration of these systems in all industries. However, these digital control systems have often been integrated in phases to cover different aspects of an industrial operation, connected over a network, and leading to a complex interconnected and interdependent system.{{sfn|Rinaldi|Peerenboom|Kelly|2001|pp=11–25}} While the [[control theory]] applied is often nothing more than a digital version of their analog counterparts, the dependence of digital control systems upon the communications networks, has precipitated the need for [[cybersecurity]] due to potential effects on [[Information security|confidentiality, integrity and availability]] of the information.{{sfn|DHS staff|2005}} To achieve [[System resilience|resilience]] in the next generation of [[control systems]], therefore, addressing the [[Networked control system|complex control system]] interdependencies, including the human systems interaction and cyber security, will be a recognized challenge.{{sfn|Rieger|Gertman|McQueen|2009}}

==Defining resilience==
Research in [[System resilience|resilience]] engineering over the last decade has focused in two areas, organizational and [[information technology]]. [[Organizational resilience]] considers the ability of an organization to adapt and survive in the face of threats, including the prevention or mitigation of unsafe, hazardous or compromising conditions that threaten its very existence.{{sfn|Hollnagel|Woods|Leveson|2006|loc={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }} [[Information technology]] [[System resilience|resilience]] has been considered from a number of standpoints .{{sfn|Trivedi|Dong|Ghosh| 2009|pp=74-77}} Networking [[System resilience|resilience]] has been considered as [[quality of service]].{{sfn|Cholda|Tapolcai|Cinkler|Wajda|2009|pp=11-19}} Computing has considered such issues as dependability and performance in the face of unanticipated changes .{{sfn|Meyer|2009}} However, based upon the application of control dynamics to industrial processes, functionality and determinism are primary considerations that are not captured by the traditional objectives of information technology. .{{sfn|Wang|Liu|2008|loc={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }}

Considering the paradigm of control systems, one definition has been suggested that "Resilient control systems are those that tolerate fluctuations via their structure, design parameters, [[Control flow|control structure]] and control parameters".{{sfn|Mitchell|Mannan|2006|pp=39-45}} However, this definition is taken from the perspective of control theory application to a control system. The consideration of the malicious actor and cyber security are not directly considered, which might suggest the definition, "an effective reconstitution of control under attack from intelligent adversaries," which was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems |url=https://secure.inl.gov/isrcs2008/default.aspx |location=Idaho Falls, ID |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this definition focuses only on [[System resilience|resilience]] in response to a malicious actor. To consider the cyber-physical aspects of control system, a definition for [[System resilience|resilience]] considers both benign and malicious human interaction, in addition to the complex interdependencies of the control system application .{{sfn|Rieger|2010|pp=64-71}}

The use of the term “recovery” has been used in the context of [[System resilience|resilience]], paralleling the response of a rubber ball to stay intact when a force is exerted on it and recover its original dimensions after the force is removed.&lt;ref&gt;S. Jackson, ''Architecting Resilient Systems: Accident Avoidance and Survival and Recovery from Disruptions'', John Wiley, Hoboken, November, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the rubber ball in terms of a system, [[System resilience|resilience]] could then be defined as its ability to maintain a desired level of performance or normalcy without irrecoverable consequences. While [[System resilience|resilience]] in this context is based upon the [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of the ball, control systems require an interaction with the environment, namely the sensors, valves, pumps that make up the industrial operation. To be reactive to this environment, control systems require an awareness of its state to make corrective changes to the industrial process to maintain normalcy.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Luyben, ''Process Modelling, Simulation and Control for Chemical Engineers'', McGraw-Hill, August, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, in consideration of the discussed cyber-physical aspects of human systems integration and cyber security, as well as other definitions for [[System resilience|resilience]] at a broader critical infrastructure level,&lt;ref&gt;''Critical Infrastructure Resilience: Final Report and Recommendations'', National Infrastructure Advisory Council, [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis of Prototypical Jurisdiction &amp; Infrastructure Critical Facility Resiliencies'', Advanced Research Institute Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Arlington, Virginia, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the following can be deduced as a definition of a resilient control system:
:'''"A resilient control system is one that maintains state awareness and an accepted level of operational normalcy in response to disturbances, including threats of an unexpected and malicious nature"{{sfn|Rieger|Gertman|McQueen|2009}}'''

[[Image:RCS Architecture 09-50368.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Fig. 1. Resilient Control System Framework.]]

Considering the flow of a digital [[control system]] as a basis, a resilient control system framework can be designed. Referring to the left side of Fig. 1, a resilient control system holistically considers the measures of performance or normalcy for the [[State space (controls)|state space]]. At the center, an understanding of performance and priority provide the basis for an appropriate response by a combination of human and automation, embedded within a [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent]], semi-autonomous framework. Finally, to the right, information must be tailored to the consumer to address the need and position a desirable response. Several examples or scenarios of how [[System resilience|resilience]] differs and provides benefit to control system design are available in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;HTGR Resilient Control System Strategy, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rieger|2010|pp=64-71}}

==Areas Of resilience==
Some primary tenets of [[System resilience|resilience]], as contrasted to traditional reliability, have presented themselves in considering an integrated approach to resilient control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems, 2008-2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lin|Sedigh|Hurson|2011|pp=93-103}}&lt;ref&gt;''High-Confidence Medical Devices: Cyber-Physical Systems for 21st Century Health Care'', Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These cyber-physical tenants complement the fundamental concept of dependable or reliable computing by characterizing [[System resilience|resilience]] in regard to control system concerns, including design considerations that provide a level of understanding and assurance in the safe and secure operation of an industrial facility. These tenants are discussed individually below to summarize some of the challenges to address in order to achieve [[System resilience|resilience]].

===Human systems===
The benign human has an ability to quickly understand novel solutions, and provide the ability to adapt to unexpected conditions. This behavior can provide additional [[System resilience|resilience]] to a control system,&lt;ref&gt;E. Hollnagel, J. Pariès, D. Woods and J. Wreathall, ''Resilience Engineering in Practice'', Ashgate, London, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but reproducibly predicting [[human behavior]] is a continuing challenge. The ability to capture historic human preferences can be applied to [[bayesian inference]] and [[Bayesian network|bayesian belief networks]], but ideally a solution would consider direct understanding of human state using sensors such as an [[Electroencephalography|EEG]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Schrauf, M. Simon, E. Schmidt and W. Kincses, ''Assessing Drivers' Fatigue State under Real Traffic Conditions using EEG Alpha Spindles'', Sixth International Driving Symposium on Human Factors in Driver Assessment, Training and Vehicle Design, June, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. E. Kerick, K. Mcdowell, '’Understanding Brain, Cognition, and Behavior in Complex Dynamic Environments'',5th International Conference on Foundations of Augmented Cognition, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Considering control system design and interaction, the goal would be to tailor the amount of automation necessary to achieve some level of optimal [[System resilience|resilience]] for this mixed initiative response.&lt;ref&gt;N. Adam, ''DHS Workshop on Future Directions in Cyber-Physical Systems Security: Final Report'', January, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Presented to the human would be that actionable information that provides the basis for a targeted, reproducible response.&lt;ref&gt;E. Blasch, M. Pribilski, B. Daughtery, B. Roscoe, and J. Gunsett, “Fusion Metrics for Dynamic Situation Analysis,” Proc. SPIE 5429, April, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyber security===
In contrast to the challenges of prediction and integration of the benign human with control systems, the abilities of the malicious actor (or hacker) to undermine desired control system behavior also create a significant challenge to control system [[System resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Verissimo, ''Challenges of Architecting Resilient Critical Information Infrastructures'', presentation at ENISA-FORTH Summer School on Network and Information Security, September, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Application of dynamic [[Probabilistic risk assessment|probabilistic risk analysis]] used in [[human reliability]] can provide some basis for the benign actor.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Boring, ''Reconciling resilience with reliability: The complementary nature of resilience engineering and human reliability analysis'', 53rd Annual Meeting of the [[Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]], pp. 1589-1593, October, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decidedly malicious intentions of an adversarial individual, organization or nation make the modeling of the human variable in both objectives and motives.&lt;ref&gt;S. Redwine, ''Introduction to Modeling Tools for Software Security'', DHS [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US-CERT]] Build Security In Website, February, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, in defining a control system response to such intentions, the malicious actor looks forward to some level of recognized behavior to gain an advantage and provide a pathway to undermining the system. Whether performed separately in preparation for a [[Cyberwarfare|cyber attack]], or on the system itself, these behaviors can provide opportunity for a successful attack without detection. Therefore, in considering resilient control system architecture, atypical designs that imbed active and passively implemented randomization of attributes, would be suggested to reduce this advantage.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Goldman, ''Building Secure, Resilient Architectures for Cyber Mission Assurance'', MITRE, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. A. McQueen, W. F. Boyer, ''Deception used for Cyber Defense of Control Systems'', 2nd IEEE Conference on Human System Interaction, Catania, Italy, May, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex networks and networked control systems===
While much of the current critical infrastructure is controlled by a web of interconnected control systems, either architecture termed as distributed control systems ([[Distributed control system|DCS]]) or supervisory control and data acquisition ([[SCADA]]), the application of control is moving toward a more decentralized state. In moving to a smart grid, the complex interconnected nature of individual homes, commercial facilities and diverse power generation and storage creates an opportunity and a challenge to ensuring that the resulting system is more resilient to threats.&lt;ref&gt;V. Vyatkin, G. Zhabelova and M. Ulieru, ''Toward Digital Ecologies:Intelligent Agent Networks Controlling Interdependent Infrastructures'', 1st IEEE Conference on Smart Grid Communications, October, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alderson and Doyle, ‘’Contrasting views of Complexity and their Implications for Network-Centric Infrastructures’’,Transactions of IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Special Issue on Cyber-Physical Ecosystems, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to operate these systems to achieve a global optimum for multiple considerations, such as overall efficiency, stability and security, will require mechanisms to holistically design complex [[networked control system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Meyn, ''Control Techniques for Complex Networks'', [[Cambridge University Press]], [[New York City|New York, NY]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Cardenas, S. Amin, and S. S. Sastry, ‘’ Secure control: Towards survivable cyber-physical systems’’, 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, pp. 495-500, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-agent methods suggest a mechanism to tie a global objective to distributed assets, allowing for management and coordination of assets for optimal benefit and semi-autonomous, but constrained controllers that can react rapidly to maintain [[System resilience|resilience]] for rapidly changing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;S. D. J. McArthur et al., “Multi-Agent Systems for Power Engineering Applications—Part I: Concepts, Approaches, and Technical Challenges,” IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, pp. 1743-1752, November, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. D. J. McArthur et al., “Multi-Agent Systems for Power Engineering Applications—Part II: Technologies, Standards, and Tools for Building Multi-agent Systems,” IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, pp. 1753- 1759, November, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base Metrics for Resilient Control Systems==
Establishing a metric that can capture the [[System resilience|resilience]] attributes can be complex, at least if considered based upon differences between the interactions or interdependencies. Evaluating the control, cyber and cognitive disturbances, especially if considered from a disciplinary standpoint, leads to measures that already had been established. However, if the metric were instead based upon a normalizing dynamic attribute, such a performance characteristic that can be impacted by degradation, an alternative is suggested. Specifically, applications of base metrics to [[System resilience|resilience]] characteristics are given as follows for type of disturbance:
*Physical Disturbances:
**Time Latency Affecting Stability
**Data Integrity Affecting Stability
*Cyber Disturbances: 
**Time Latency 
**Data Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
*Cognitive Disturbances:
**Time Latency in Response
**Data Digression from Desired Response 
Such performance characteristics exist with both time and data integrity. Time, both in terms of delay of mission and communications latency, and data, in terms of corruption or modification, are normalizing factors. In general, the idea is to base the metric on “what is expected” and not necessarily the actual initiator to the degradation. Considering time as a metrics basis, resilient and un-resilient systems can be observed in Fig. 2.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Rieger, "Resilient control systems Practical metrics basis for defining mission impact," 7th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Resilience Graphic r9a.tif|thumb|400x400px|Fig. 2. Resilience Base Metrics.]]
Dependent upon the abscissa metrics chosen, Fig. 2 reflects a generalization of the resiliency of a system. Several common terms are represented on this graphic, including robustness, agility, adaptive capacity, adaptive insufficiency, resiliency and brittleness. To overview the definitions of these terms, the following explanations of each is provided below: 
*Agility: The derivative of the disturbance curve. This average defines the ability of the system to resist degradation on the downward slope, but also to recover on the upward. Primarily considered a time based term that indicates impact to mission. Considers both short term system and longer term human responder actions.
*Adaptive Capacity: The ability of the system to adapt or transform from impact and maintain minimum normalcy. Considered a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is fully operational and 0 is the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold. 
*Adaptive Insufficiency: The inability of the system to adapt or transform from impact, indicating an unacceptable performance loss due to the disturbance. Considered a value between 0 and -1, where 0 is the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold and -1 is total loss of operation.
*Brittleness: The area under the disturbance curve as intersected by the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold.  This indicates the impact from the loss of operational normalcy.
*Phases of Resilient  Control System Preparation and Disturbance Response:  
**Recon: Maintaining proactive state awareness of system conditions and degradation  
**Resist: System response to recognized conditions, both to mitigate and counter  
**Respond: System degradation has been stopped and returning system performance  
**Restore: Longer term performance restoration, which includes equipment replacement
*Resiliency: The converse of brittleness, which for a [[System resilience|resilience]] system is “zero” loss of minimum normalcy. 
*Robustness: A positive or negative number associated with the area between the disturbance curve and the [[System resilience|resilience]] threshold, indicating either the capacity or insufficiency, respectively.
On the abscissa of Fig. 2, it can be recognized that cyber and cognitive influences can affect both the data and the time, which underscores the relative importance of recognizing these forms of degradation in resilient control designs. For cybersecurity, a single cyberattack can degrade a control system in multiple ways. Additionally, control impacts can be characterized as indicated. While these terms are fundamental and seem of little value for those correlating impact in terms like cost, the development of use cases provide a means by which this relevance can be codified. For example, given the impact to system dynamics or data, the performance of the control loop can be directly ascertained and show approach to instability and operational impact.

==Resilience Manifold for Design and Operation==
[[File:MDS Asset Aggegation.tif|thumb|Resilience Manifold from Aggregated Power Asset Contributions|thumb|300x300px|Fig. 3. Resilience Manifold for MDS.]] The very nature of control systems implies a starting point for the development of resilience metrics. That is, the control of a physical process if based upon quantifiable performance and measures, including first principles and stochastic. The ability to provide this measurement, which is the basis for correlating operational performance and adaptation, then also becomes the starting point for correlation of the data and time variations that can come from the cognitive, cyber-physical sources. Effective understanding is based upon developing a manifold of adaptive capacity that correlates the design (and operational) buffer. For a power system, this manifold is based upon the real and reactive power assets, the controllable having the latitude to maneuver, and the impact of disturbances over time. For a modern distribution system (MDS), these assets can be aggregated from the individual contributions as shown in Fig. 3 &lt;ref&gt;T. R. McJunkin and C. G. Rieger, "Electricity distribution system resilient control system metrics," 2017 Resilience Week (RWS), Wilmington, DE, 2017, pp. 103-112.&lt;/ref&gt;. For this figure, these assets include: a) a battery, b) an alternate tie line source, c) an asymmetric P/Q-conjectured source, d) a distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM), and e) low latency, four quadrant source with no energy limit.

==Examples of Resilient Control System Developments==
1) When considering the current digital control system designs, the cyber security of these systems is dependent upon what is considered border protections, i.e., firewalls, passwords, etc. If a malicious actor compromised the digital control system for an industrial operation by a man-in-the-middle attack, data can be corrupted with the control system. The industrial facility operator would have no way of knowing the data has been compromised, until someone such as a security engineer recognized the attack was occurring. As operators are trained to provide a prompt, appropriate response to stabilize the industrial facility, there is a likelihood that the corrupt data would lead to the operator reacting to the situation and lead to a plant upset. In a resilient control system, as per Fig. 1, cyber and physical data is fused to recognize anomalous situations and warn the operator.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wijayasekara, O. Linda, M. Manic, C. Rieger, “FN-DFE: Fuzzy-Neural Data Fusion Engine for Enhanced Resilient State-Awareness of Hybrid Energy Systems,” Special Issue on Resilient Architectures and Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

2) As our society becomes more automated for a variety of drivers, including energy efficiency, the need to implement ever more effective control algorithms naturally follow. However, advanced control algorithms are dependent upon data from multiple sensors to predict the behaviors of the industrial operation and make corrective responses. This type of system can become very brittle, insofar as any unrecognized degradation in the sensor itself can lead to incorrect responses by the control algorithm and potentially a worsened condition relative to the desired operation for the industrial facility. Therefore, implementation of advanced control algorithms in a resilient control system also requires the implementation of diagnostic and prognostic architectures to recognize sensor degradation, as well as failures with industrial process equipment associated with the control algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Kun Ji, Yan Lu, Linxia Liao, Zhen Song, and Dong Wei, "Prognostics Enabled Resilient Control for Model-based Building Automation Systems," Proceedings of Building Simulation 2011, 12th Conference of International Building Performance Simulation Association, Sydney, November, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Garcia, W. Lin and S. M. Meerkov, "A Resilience Assessment Monitoring System," in Proc. IEEE Symposium on Resilience Control Systems (ISRCS 2012), Salt Lake City, Utah, August 14–16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Pajic, N. Bezzo, J. Weimer, R. Alur, R. Mangharam, N. Michael, G. J. Pappas, O. Sokolsky, P. Tabuada, S. Weirich, and I. Lee, "Towards synthesis of platform-aware attack-resilient control systems: extended abstract," 2nd ACM international conference on High confidence networked systems, Philadelphia, PA, April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resilient Control System Solutions and the Need for Interdisciplinary Education==
In our world of advancing automation, our dependence upon these advancing technologies and the skill sets needed to keep the United States at the forefront of innovation. The challenges may appear rooted in design of better means to better control our infrastructures for greater safety and efficiency in generation and use of energy. However, the evolution of the technologies developed to achieve the current design of automation has achieved a complex environment where a cyber-attack, human error in design or operation, or a damaging storm can wreak havoc on the infrastructure we depend as a Nation. The next generation of systems will need to consider the broader picture to ensure as a path forward, failures do not lead to ever greater catastrophic events. As a critical resource are the students of tomorrow who will be expected to advance these designs, and require both a perspective on the challenges and the contributions of others to fulfill the need. Addressing this need, courses have been developed to provide the perspectives and relevant examples to overview the issues and provide opportunity to create resilient solutions at such universities as [http://cip.gmu.edu/education-programs/critical-infrastructure-higher-education-initiative/cisr-stand-alone-courses/ George Mason University] and [http://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/programs/security-resilience-studies/#masters Northeastern]. The tie to critical infrastructure operations is an important aspect of these courses.

Through the development of technologies designed to set the stage for next generation automation, it has become evident that effective teams are comprised several disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;T.R.

[http://today-archive.colostate.edu/story.aspx?id=10376 Team competition] at venues such as [http://www.resilienceweek.com Resilience Week] will be a natural outcome of developing such an environment, allowing interdisciplinary participation and providing an exciting challenge to motivate students to pursue a [[STEM fields|STEM]] education.

==Standardizing Resilience and Resilient Control System Principles==
Standards and policy that define [[System resilience|resilience]] nomenclature and metrics are needed to establish a value proposition for investment, which includes government, academia and industry.  The [[IEEE]] [[IEEE Industrial Electronics Society|Industrial Electronics Society]] has taken the lead in forming a [http://ieee-ies.org/index.php/resia-home technical committee] toward this end. The purpose of this committee will be to establish metrics and standards associated with codifying promising technologies that promote [[System resilience|resilience]] in automation. This effort is distinct from more supply chain community focus on [[System resilience|resilience]] and security, such as the efforts of [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=5259148 ISO] and [https://www.nist.gov/el/resilience/ NIST]

{{Violence against women}}
'''Sexual violence by intimate partners''' deals with the incidence by country of [[physical abuse]], forced sex, or [[marital rape]] within the context of domestic violence. 

==Domestic violence and sexual abuse==
Domestic [[sexual violence]], such as forced sex or marital rape, may follow or be part of physical abuse, but is not always the case. In [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], studies estimate that 40–52% of women experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner have also been sexually coerced by that partner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell JC, Soeken KL. Forced sex and intimate partner violence: effects on women’s risk and women’s health. Violence Against Women, 1999, 5:1017–1035.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granados Shiroma M.Salud reproductiva y violencia contra la mujer: un ana lisis desde la perspectiva de género.

Yogyakarta, Gadjah Mada University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in a representative sample of over 6000 men, 7% reported having sexually and physically abused their wives, 22% reported using sexual violence without physical violence and 17% reported that they had used physical violence alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin SL et al. Sexual behaviour and reproductive health outcomes: associations with wife abuse in India. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1999, 282:1967–1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence by country==
Studies indicate that sexual assault by an intimate partner is neither rare nor unique to any particular region of the world. For instance, 23% of women in North [[London]], [[England]], reported having been the victim of either an attempted or completed rape by a partner in their lifetime. Similar figures have been reported for [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (23.0%), [[León, Nicaragua]], (21.7%), [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (22.5%), and for the [[Midlands Province]] in [[Zimbabwe]] (25.0%). The prevalence of women sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime (including attempted assaults) has also been estimated in a few national surveys (for example, [[Canada]] 8.0%, [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] (combined) 14.2%, [[Finland]] 5.9%, [[Switzerland]] 11.6% and the [[United States]] 7.7%).

The table below summarizes some available data on the prevalence of sexual coercion by intimate partners.

A '''triangle strip''' is a series of connected [[triangles]], sharing [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]], allowing for more efficient memory usage for [[computer graphics]]. They are more efficient than triangle lists without indexing, but usually equally fast or slower than indexed triangle lists.&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hacksoflife.blogspot.com/2010/01/to-strip-or-not-to-strip.html&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason to use triangle strips is to reduce the amount of data needed to create a series of triangles. The number of vertices stored in memory is reduced from ''3N'' to ''N+2'', where ''N'' is the number of triangles to be drawn.  This allows for less use of disk space, as well as making them faster to load into [[RAM]].

For example, the four triangles in the diagram, without using triangle strips, would have to be stored and interpreted as four separate triangles: ABC, CBD, CDE, and EDF. However, using a triangle strip, they can be stored simply as a sequence of vertices ABCDEF. This sequence  would be decoded as a set of triangles ABC, BCD, CDE and DEF then every even-numbered (with counting starting from one) triangle would be reversed resulting in the original triangles.

==OpenGL implementation==
[[Image:Triangle Strip In OpenGL.svg|frame|Model of two triangles drawn in OpenGL using triangle strips.]]
[[OpenGL]] has built-in support for triangle strips. Fixed function OpenGL (deprecated in OpenGL 3.0) has support for triangle strips using immediate mode and the ''glBegin()'', ''glVertex*()'', and ''glEnd()'' functions. Newer versions support triangle strips using ''glDrawElements'' and ''glDrawArrays''.

To draw a triangle strip using immediate mode OpenGL, ''glBegin()'' must be passed the argument ''GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP'', which notifies OpenGL a triangle strip is about to be drawn. The ''glVertex*()'' family of functions specify the coordinates for each vertex in the triangle strip. For more information, consult The OpenGL Redbook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glprogramming.com/red/ The OpenGL Redbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

To draw the triangle strip in the diagram using immediate mode OpenGL, the code is as follows:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 //Vertices below are in Clockwise orientation
 //Default setting for glFrontFace is Counter-clockwise
 glFrontFace(GL_CW);

 glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP);	
 glVertex3f( 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f ); //vertex 1
 glVertex3f( 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f ); //vertex 2
 glVertex3f( 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f ); //vertex 3
 glVertex3f( 1.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f ); //vertex 4
 glEnd();
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that only one additional vertex is needed to draw the second triangle.
In OpenGL, the order in which the vertices are specified is important so that [[surface normal]]s are consistent.

Quoting directly from the [[OpenGL#Documentation|OpenGL Programming Guide]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
Draws a series of triangles (three-sided polygons) using vertices v0, v1, v2, then v2, v1, v3 (note the order), then v2, v3, v4, and so on. The ordering is to ensure that the triangles are all drawn with the same orientation so that the strip can correctly form part of a surface.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's even clearer within the manual pages:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glBegin.xml]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Draws a connected group of triangles.  One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. For odd n, vertices n, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. For even n, vertices n+1, n, and n+2 define triangle n. N-2 triangles are drawn.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above code sample and diagram demonstrate triangles drawn in a clockwise orientation.  For those to be considered front-facing, a preceding call to ''glFrontFace(GL_CW)'' is necessary, which otherwise has an initial value of ''GL_CCW'' (meaning that triangles drawn counter-clockwise are front-facing by default).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glFrontFace.xml glFrontFace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is significant if ''glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE)'' and ''glCullFace(GL_BACK)'' are already active (''GL_BACK'' by default&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glCullFace.xml glCullFace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), because back-facing triangles will be culled, so will not be drawn and will not appear on-screen at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/clipping.htm#0090 OpenGL FAQ / 10 Clipping, Culling, and Visibility Testing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and construction==
It follows from definition that a subsequence of vertices of a triangle strip also represents a triangle strip. However, if this substrip starts at an even (with 1-based counting) vertex, then the resulting triangles will change their orientation. For example a substrip BCDEF would represent triangles: BCD,CED,DEF.

Similarly, reversal of strips’ vertices will result in the same set of triangles if the strip has an even number of vertices. (e.g. strip FEDCBA will represent the same triangles FED,ECD,DCB,CAB as the original strip). However, if a strip has an odd number of vertices then the reversed strip will represent triangles with opposite orientation. For example, reversal of a strip ABCDE will result in strip EDCBA which represents triangles EDC, DBC, CBA).

Converting a general [[polygon mesh]] to a single long strip was until recently generally not possible. Usually the triangle strips are analogous to a set of [[edge loops]], and [[Pole (geometry)|poles]] on the model are represented by [[triangle fan]]s. Tools such as [[Stripe (software)|Stripe]]&lt;ref&gt;Azanli, Elvir. [http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~stripe/ Stripe], retrieved on March 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[FTSG]]&lt;ref&gt;Xiang, Xinyu. [https://web.archive.org/web/20020203141635/http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~xxiang/strip.html FTSG], retrieved on January 21, 2011. (link is no longer valid)&lt;/ref&gt; represent the model as several strips. Optimally grouping a set of triangles into sequential strips has been proven [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;Regina Estkowski, Joseph S. B. Mitchell, Xinyu Xiang. Optimal decomposition of polygonal models into triangle strips. In Proceedings of Symposium on Computational Geometry'2002. pp.254~263 url=http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~jsbm/papers/p151-mitchell.pdf url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=513431&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a complete object can be described as a '''degenerate strip''', which contains zero-area triangles that the processing software or hardware will discard. The [[Glossary of computer graphics#Degenerate triangles|degenerate triangles]] effectively introduce discontinuities or "jumps" to the strip. For example, the mesh in the diagram could also be represented as ABCDDFFEDC, which would be interpreted as triangles ABC CBD ''CDD DDF DFF FFE'' FED DEC (degenerate triangles marked with italics). Notice how this strip first builds two triangles from the left, then restarts and builds the remaining two from the right.

While discontinuities in triangle strips can always be implemented by resending vertices, APIs sometimes explicitly support this feature. [[IRIS GL]] supported Swaps (flipping two subsequent vertices in a strip), a feature relied on by early algorithms such as the [[SGI algorithm]]. Recently OpenGL/DirectX can render multiple triangle strips without degenerated triangles using Primitive Restart feature.

A '''trijet''' is a [[jet aircraft]] powered by three [[jet engine]]s. In general, [[passenger airline]] trijets are considered to be second-generation [[jet airliner]]s, due to their innovative engine locations, in addition to the advancement of [[turbofan]] technology.

Other variations of three-engine designs are [[trimotor]]s, which are aircraft with three [[piston engines]].

==Design==
[[File:HS-Trident-516.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] featured an [[S-duct]].]]
[[File:Eastern Air Lines L-1011-1 N319EA MIA 1989-7-4.png|thumb|The [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] and DC-10 share a similar configuration, however the biggest difference is the mounting of the tail engine. The Tristar's tail-mounted engine, as with the 727, is located in the rear fuselage and fed through an [[S-duct]].]]
[[File:FedEx MD-10 N306FE.JPG|thumb|right|The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] does not use an S-duct; instead, its tail engine is mounted above the fuselage in a "straight" layout.]]

One issue with trijets is positioning the central engine. This is mostly accomplished by placing the engine along the centerline, but this still poses difficulties. 

The most common configuration is having the central engine located in the rear fuselage and supplied with air by an [[S-duct|S-shaped duct]]; this is used on the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]], [[Boeing 727]], [[Tupolev Tu-154]], [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]], and, more recently, the [[Dassault Falcon 7X]]. The S-duct has low drag, and since the third engine is mounted closer to the centerline, the aircraft will normally be easy to handle in the event of an engine failure. However, S-duct designs are extremely complex and costly. Furthermore, the central engine bay would require structural changes in the event of a major re-engining. For example, the 727's central bay was only wide enough to fit a low-bypass turbofan and not the newer high-bypass turbofans which were quieter and more powerful. Boeing decided that a redesign was too expensive and ended its production instead of pursuing further development. The Lockheed Tristar's tail section was too short to fit an existing two-spool engine as it was designed only to accommodate the new three-spool [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] engine, and delays in the RB211's development in turn pushed back the TriStar's entry into service which affected sales.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.airlinereporter.com/2015/09/requiem-trijet-masterpiece-lockheed-l-1011-tristar/ REQUIEM FOR A TRIJET MASTERPIECE – THE LOCKHEED L-1011]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] and related MD-11 use an alternative "straight" layout, which allows for easier engine installation, modification, and access. It also has the additional benefit of being much easier to re-engine. However, this sacrifices aerodynamics compared to the S-duct. Also, as the engine is located much higher up than the wing-mounted engines, an engine failure will produce a greater pitching moment, making it more difficult to control. 

Placement of the remaining two engines varies. Most smaller aircraft, like the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]], the [[Boeing 727]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-154]] have two side-mount engine pylons in a [[T-tail]] configuration. The larger widebody Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and DC-10/[[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]] mount an engine underneath each wing.  Preliminary studies were done on the TriStar to reuse the fuselage and wing for a twinjet design though these never materialized due to Lockheed's lack of funds, while in the late 1990s Boeing which had taken over McDonnell Douglas had considered removing the tail engine from the MD-11 to make it a twinjet but ending up instead ending its production altogether, as the 767 and 777 would have cannibalised it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Advantages and drawbacks==
One major advantage of the trijet design is that the wings can be located further aft on the fuselage, compared to twinjets and [[Quadjet|quad-jets]] with all wing-mounted engines, allowing main cabin exit and entry doors to be more centrally located for quicker boarding and deplaning, ensuring shorter turnaround times. The rear-mounted engine and wings shift the aircraft's [[center of gravity]] rearwards, improving fuel efficiency, although this will also make the plane slightly less stable and more difficult to handle during takeoff and landing. (The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] twinjet and its derivatives, whose engines are mounted on pylons near the rear [[empennage]], have similar advantages/disadvantages of the trijet design, such as the wings located further aft and a more rearward center of gravity.)

Trijets are more efficient and cheaper than four-engine aircraft, as the engines are the most expensive part of the plane and having more engines consumes more fuel, particularly if [[Quadjet|quadjets]] and trijets share engines of similar power, making the trijet configuration more suited to a mid-size airliner compared to larger [[Quadjet|quadjets]]. However, higher purchase prices, primarily due to the difficulty and complexity of mounting the third engine through the tail, will somewhat negate this advantage.

Due to their added thrust, trijets will have slightly improved takeoff performance compared to twinjets if an engine fails. Because takeoff performance for aircraft is usually calculated to include an extra margin to account for a possible engine failure, trijets are better-able to takeoff from [[hot and high]] airports or those where terrain clearance near the runway is an issue.

Unlike twinjets, trijets are not required to land immediately at the nearest suitable airport if one engine fails (this advantage is also shared with [[Quadjet|quad-jets]]).&lt;ref name="Engine Inop CFR"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/121.565]&lt;/ref&gt; This is advantageous if the aircraft is not near one of the operator's maintenance bases, as the pilots may then continue the flight and land at an airport where it is more suitable to perform repairs. Additionally, for trijets on the ground with one engine inoperative, approval can be granted to perform two-engine ferry flights.

Prior to the introduction of ETOPS, only trijets and [[Quadjet|quad-jets]] were able to perform long international flights over areas without any diversion airports. However, this advantage has been largely negated in recent years as ETOPS-certified twin-engined aircraft have been able to do so.

The biggest obstacle trijets face today is operating costs, primarily fuel efficiency, as a three-engine design can very easily consume more fuel than a comparable two-engine design. This also greatly increases the difficulty of marketing a new trijet aircraft today, especially for passenger service. However this was worth the trade off between 1970 and the 1990s when trijets and twinjets shared engines of similar output, such as when the DC-10, MD-11, and Airbus's A300 and A330 were all powered by the [[General Electric CF6]], and the additional power from the third engine gave the DC-10/MD-11 advantages in longer range and/or heavier payload over the A300/A330 twinjet. Since the 1990s, with further advancements in high-bypass turbofan technology, large twinjets have been equipped with purpose-designed engines like the [[Boeing 777]]'s [[General Electric GE90]], allowing twinjets to perform the same tasks as most trijets and even many [[Quadjet|quadjets]] but more efficiently.

==History==
[[File:FedEx Express McDonnell Douglas MD-11BCF N598FE (Kate).jpg|thumb|right|The [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]], a stretched and redesigned successor to the DC-10, is the most recent trijet design produced for commercial aviation service.]]

[[File:080513 Dassault Falcon 900EX M-FALC (at MUC).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dassault Falcon 900]] business jet]]

The first trijet design to fly was the [[Tupolev Tu-73]] bomber prototype, first flown in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fOC7Ii5SgZUC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=tupolev+tu-73&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EyA7z0BLb1&amp;sig=-k5fDH5TYotvGToN5CtZkTFwtQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8lYOwnbbTAhUJ6CYKHfPKAvMQ6AEIWzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=tupolev%20tu-73&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial trijets were the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] (1962) and the [[Boeing 727]] (1963). Both were compromises to meet airline requirements; in the case of the Trident, it was to meet BEA's changing needs, while the 727 had to be acceptable for three different airlines. Although collaboration between the manufacturers was considered, it did not come about.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;{{cite episode |title= Commercial Jets |series= [[Modern Marvels]] |airdate= January 16, 2001 |season= A149 |minutes= approx. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early American [[twinjet]] designs were limited by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s [[ETOPS|60-minute rule]], whereby the flight path of twin-engine jetliners was restricted to within 60 minutes' flying time from a suitable airport, in case of engine failure. In 1964, this rule was lifted for trijet designs, as they had a greater safety margin.

For second-generation jet airliners, with the innovations of the high-bypass turbofan for greater efficiency and reduced noise, and the [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body (twin-aisle)]] for greater passenger/cargo capacity, the trijet design was seen as the optimal configuration for the medium wide-body jet airliner, sitting in terms of size, range, and cost between quadjets (four-engine aircraft) and twinjets, and this led to a flurry of trijet designs. The four-engine Boeing 747 was popular for transoceanic flights due to its long-range and large size, but it was expensive and not all routes were able to fill its seating capacity, while the original models of the Airbus A300 twinjet were limited to short- to medium-range distances. During this period, different jet airliners shared engines of similar output, such as when the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, Airbus A300, and Boeing 767 were powered by the [[General Electric CF6]], the additional power from the third engine gave the DC-10 advantages in longer range and/or heavier payload over the A300 and 767 twinjets. Thus trijet designs such as the DC-10 and L-1011 TriStar represented the best compromise with medium- to long-range and medium size that US airlines sought for their domestic and transatlantic routes. As a result of these trijet wide-bodies, as well as the popularity of the Boeing 727, in their heyday of the 1980s trijets made up a majority of all such US jet airliners.

From 1985 to 2003 the number of such planes in service had sunk from 1488 to 602. The number of twinjets, on the other hand, had more than quadrupled in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/2006/html/table_01_13.html Table 1-13: Active U.S. Air Carrier and General Aviation Fleet by Type of Aircraft] Bureau of Transportation Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas were financially weakened competing in the widebody market, which led to Lockheed ending production of the L-1011 in 1984 after producing only half the units needed to break even, while a number of fatal DC-10 crashes also slowed its sales.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1984 Boeing ended production of the 727, as its central engine bay would require an extremely expensive redesign to accommodate quieter high-bypass turbofans, and it was soon supplanted by Airbus with their [[Airbus 320|A320]] and Boeing with their [[Boeing 737|737]] and [[Boeing 757|757]]. Further advancements in high-bypass turbofan technology and a subsequent relaxation in airline safety rules made the trijet and even the quadjet nearly obsolete for passenger services, as their range and payload could be covered more efficiently with large twinjets powered with purpose-designed engines such as the [[Boeing 777]]'s [[General Electric GE90]].

During the 1980s, [[McDonnell Douglas]] was the only manufacturer to continue development of the trijet design with an update to the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]], the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]], which initially held a range and payload advantage over its closest medium wide-body competitors which were twinjets, the in-production [[Boeing 767]] and upcoming [[Airbus A330]]. [[McDonnell Douglas]] had planned a new trijet called the MD-XX, which were lengthened versions of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]]. The MD-XX Long Range aircraft would have been capable of travelling distances up to 8,320 [[nautical mile]]s and had a wingspan of 213 feet. The project was cancelled in 1996, one year before McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing. Boeing ended production of the MD-11 after filling remaining customer orders since the MD-11 would have competed with the 767 and 777. A study to remove the MD-11's tail-mounted engine (which would have made it a twinjet) never came to fruition as it would have been very expensive, and the MD-11 had very little in common in terms of design or [[type rating]] with other Boeing airliners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2005/12/20/203709/clipped-wings.html&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to McDonnell Douglas sticking with their existing trijet configuration, Airbus (which never produced a trijet aircraft) and Boeing worked on new widebody twinjet designs that would become the A330 and 777, respectively. The MD-11's long range advantage was brief as it soon was threatened by the A330's four-engine derivative, the [[Airbus A340|A340]], and the 777.

With the exception of the [[Dassault Falcon 7X]], [[Dassault Falcon 7X|Falcon 8x]], and [[Dassault Falcon 900|Falcon 900]], no manufacturer now produces three-engine airliners. 

===Current status===
Modern engines have extremely low failure rates and can generate much higher shaft power and thrust than early types. This makes twinjets more suitable than they were before for long-haul trans-oceanic operations, resulting in eased [[ETOPS]] restrictions; modern wide-body twin-engine jets usually have an ETOPS 180 or even (in the case of the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]]) ETOPS 330 rating. As such, having more than two engines is no longer considered necessary, except for very large or heavy aircraft such as the [[Boeing 747]], [[Airbus A380]] (over 400 seats in a mixed-class configuration), [[Antonov An-124]], and [[Antonov An-225|An-225]], or for flights through the Southern Hemisphere, primarily to and from Australia (which has not yet adopted the ETOPS 330 standard), where the most direct route for some flights is over [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/most-international-flights-will-soon-have-two-fewer-enginesbut-thats-ok]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today,{{when|date=April 2017}} both [[narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] and [[wide body aircraft|wide-body]] trijet production has ceased for almost all commercial aircraft, being replaced by [[twinjet]]s. As of 2016, the Falcon 7X, 8X, and 900 business jets, all of which use [[S-duct]]s, are the only trijets in production. Some old models, such as the [[Boeing 727|727]], [[Tupolev Tu-154|Tu-154]], DC-10, and MD-11, have found second careers as cargo aircraft, as well as limited charter, governmental, and military service. The most widely used trijets are the DC-10 and the MD-11, mostly operated by [[UPS Airlines]] and [[FedEx Express]] in cargo service. 

For private and corporate operators, where fuel efficiency is often less important than for airlines, trijets may still be of interest due to their immunity from ETOPS and ability to take off from shorter runways. As a result, a sizeable number of trijets, such as 727s and newly-built [[Dassault Falcon]]s, are in use by private operators and corporate flight departments.

===Future of trijets===

Airbus filed a patent in 2008 for a new, [[twin-tail]] trijet design, whose tail engine appears to use a "straight" layout similar to the MD-11, but it is unknown when or if this will be developed or produced.&lt;ref name="2008airbus-twintail"&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-files-patent-for-new-trijet-design-223089/ Airbus files patent for new trijet design], FlightGlobal.com, Retrieved 2008-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposed [[Boeing X-48]] [[blended wing body]] design, Lockheed's N+2 design study, and [[Aerion AS2]] supersonic business jet also have three engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/features/2014/getting-up-to-speed.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gizmag.com/aerion-as2-supersonic-business-jet/32149/&lt;/ref&gt; The AS2 is currently taking orders and a wooden mockup has been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-11-17/flexjet-boosts-supersonic-bizjet-plan-aerion-as2-order&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blueskynews.aero/issue_345/Aerion_and_Airbus_announce_new_agreement-expanded_collaboration.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boom Technology]]'s planned Boom [[supersonic transport]] (SST) airliner is planned to use three engines, with the third engine installed in the tail with a Y-shaped duct and air intakes on both sides of the rear.

'''Universology''' literally means "the science of the [[universe]]." Popularizing universologic science was a life's work for 19th century intellectual [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a [[futurology|futurist]] [[utopia]]n. The word can be used synonymously with [[consilience]], a term [[Edward Osborne Wilson]] has popularized with his writings elucidating the apparent unity of all knowledge.

In recent years, Dr. [[Mamoru Mohri]], [[Japan]]'s first [[astronaut]] and Director of Japan's [[Miraikan|National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation]], has popularized and expanded on universology. For Mohri the universological worldview was an epiphany after seeing the planet from space on two missions in the 1990s, and he has become the chief proponent of universology today. "Everything in this universe is part of an uninterrupted sequence of events" Mohri has said.

In 1872 [[Stephen Pearl Andrews|Andrews]] published "The Basic Outline of Universology" which was subtitled "An introduction to the newly discovered science of the universe, its elementary principles, and the first stages of their development in the special sciences."

[[Ilya Romanovich Prigogine]] (born on January 25, 1917) was a Belgian and American physicist and chemist who was born in Russia and became a Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry. In the book "Order Out of Chaos: Man's New Dialogue With Nature", which he co-wrote with [[Isabelle Stengers]], another professor at Prigogine's group in the University of Brussels, Prigogine states:

"Altogether, we tend to accept the idea propelled by Dialectical Materialism, regarding the necessity of overcoming the antithesis of humane, historical realm and the material world, perceived as atemporal. We do believe, that the setting rapprochement of these opposites will have to be enhanced, as there will be new approaches which will outline the internally evolving Universe, which we are part of." A central aspect of the ways of "outlining the internally evolving Universe", that is what Universology is all about.

A '''vine''' ([[Latin]] ''vīnea'' "grapevine", "vineyard", from ''vīnum'' "wine") is any [[plant]] with a growth [[Habit (biology)|habit]] of trailing or [[wikt:scandent|scandent]] (that is, climbing) stems, [[liana]]s or runners. The word ''vine'' can also refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance, when used in [[wicker]] work.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson; Benjamin; Daydon (1928).

Putz|title=The Biology of Vines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_w8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR13 |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39250-1|pages=xiii |quote=Using 'vines' to denote all climbing plants may initially confuse some readers from lands where, with due respect for wine, 'the vine' is used solely in reference to grapes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term "climber" is used for all climbing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary, 6th ed.|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0199206872|pages=3804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth forms ==

Certain plants always grow as vines, while a few grow as vines only part of the time. For instance, [[poison ivy]] and [[Solanum dulcamara|bittersweet]] can grow as low [[shrubs]] when support is not available, but will become vines when support is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creepers|url=http://www.mannuthynursery.com/creepers.php|publisher=mannuthynursery|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vine displays a growth form based on long [[Plant stem|stems]]. This has two purposes. A vine may use rock exposures, other plants, or other supports for growth rather than investing energy in a lot of supportive tissue, enabling the plant to reach sunlight with a minimum investment of energy. This has been a highly successful growth form for plants such as [[kudzu]] and [[Japanese honeysuckle]], both of which are [[invasive exotic]]s in parts of [[North America]]. There are some tropical vines that develop skototropism, and grow away from the light, a type of negative [[phototropism]]. Growth away from light allows the vine to reach a tree trunk, which it can then climb to brighter regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Janice |last1=Glimn-Lacy |first2=Peter B. |last2=Kaufman |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w3107p |title=Botany Illustrated |publisher=Springer |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vine growth form may also enable plants to colonize large areas quickly, even without climbing high. This is the case with [[Vinca|periwinkle]] and [[ground ivy]].  It is also an adaptation to life in areas where small patches of fertile soil are adjacent to exposed areas with more sunlight but little or no soil.  A vine can root in the soil but have most of its leaves in the brighter, exposed area, getting the best of both environments.

The evolution of a climbing habit has been implicated as a key innovation associated with the evolutionary success and diversification of a number of taxonomic groups of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2827 |pmc=1691831 |last=Gianoli |first=Ernesto |title=Evolution of a climbing habit promotes diversification in flowering plants |year=2004 |volume=271 |issue=1552 |pages=2011–2015 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |pmid=15451690 |jstor=4142967}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved independently in several plant families, using many different climbing methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.info/vines.htm |title=Vine Ecology |first=Francis E. |last=Putz |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
* twining the stem around a support (e.g., morning glories, ''[[Ipomoea]]'' species)
* by way of adventitious, clinging roots (e.g., ivy, ''[[Hedera]]'' species)
* with twining petioles (e.g., ''[[Clematis]]'' species)
* using [[tendril]]s, which can be specialized shoots ([[Vitaceae]]), leaves ([[Bignoniaceae]]), or even inflorescences (''[[Passiflora]]'')
* using tendrils which also produce adhesive pads at the end that attach themselves quite strongly to the support (''[[Parthenocissus]]'')
* using thorns (e.g. climbing [[rose]]) or other hooked structures, such as hooked branches (e.g. ''[[Artabotrys hexapetalus]]'')

The [[climbing fetterbush]] (''[[Pieris phillyreifolia]]'') is a woody shrub-vine which climbs without clinging roots, tendrils, or thorns. It directs its stem into a crevice in the bark of fibrous barked trees (such as [[bald cypress]]) where the stem adopts a flattened profile and grows up the tree underneath the host tree's outer bark.  The fetterbush then sends out branches that emerge near the top of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weakley |first=Alan |url=http://www.herbarium.unc.edu/WeakleyFlora2010Mar.pdf |title=Flora of the Southern and Mid-Atlantic States |year=2010 |page=661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most vines are flowering plants. These may be divided into woody vines or [[liana]]s, such as [[wisteria]], [[kiwifruit]], and [[Hedera|common ivy]], and herbaceous (nonwoody) vines, such as [[morning glory]].

One odd group of vining plants is the fern genus ''Lygodium'', called [[climbing fern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese climbing fern|url=http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/node/639|publisher=Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stem does not climb, but rather the fronds (leaves) do. The fronds unroll from the tip, and theoretically never stop growing; they can form thickets as they unroll over other plants, rockfaces, and fences.

A twining vine, also known as a '''bine''', is one that climbs by its shoots growing in a [[helix]], in contrast to vines that climb using [[tendril]]s or suckers. Many bines have rough stems or downward-pointing bristles to aid their grip. [[Humulus|Hops]] (used in flavoring beer) are a commercially important example of a bine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bine ''bine''] at [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-25406-cone-heads.html Cone Heads] at ''[[Willamette Week]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction of rotation of the shoot tip during climbing is autonomous and does not (as sometimes imagined) derive from the shoot's following the sun around the sky – the direction of twist does not therefore depend upon which side of the [[equator]] the plant is growing on.  This is shown by the fact that some bines always twine [[clockwise]], including runner bean (''[[Phaseolus coccineus]]'') and bindweed (''[[Convolvulus]]'' species), while others twine anticlockwise, including French bean (''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]'') and climbing honeysuckles (''[[Lonicera]]'' species). The contrasting rotations of bindweed and honeysuckle was the theme of the satirical song "Misalliance",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flashlyrics.com/lyrics/flanders-and-swann/misalliance-72 Misalliance]&lt;/ref&gt; written and sung by [[Flanders and Swann|Michael Flanders and Donald Swann]].

== Horticultural climbing plants ==
The term "vine" also applies to [[cucurbitaceae]] like [[cucumber]]s where botanists refer to creeping vines; in commercial [[agriculture]] the natural tendency of coiling [[tendril]]s to attach themselves to pre-existing structures or [[espalier]]s is optimized by the installation of [[Horticulture Netting or Vegetable Support Net|trellis netting]].

[[Gardener]]s can use the tendency of climbing plants to grow quickly. If a plant display is wanted quickly, a climber can achieve this. Climbers can be trained over [[wall]]s, [[pergola]]s, [[fence]]s, etc. Climbers can be grown over other plants to provide additional attraction. Artificial support can also be provided. Some climbers climb by themselves; others need work, such as tying them in and training them.

==Scientific description==
{{Expert needed|plants|section|talk=|reason=It is the work of a student editor, it needs verification, and may be overly technical for this article|date=May 2018}}
Vines widely differ in size, form and evolutionary origin. Darwin classified climbing groups based on their climbing method. He classified five classes of vines – twining plants, leaf climbers, tendril bearers, root climbers and hook climbers.

Vines are unique in that they have multiple evolutionary origins and a wide range of phenotypic plasticity. They usually reside in tropical locations and have the unique ability to climb. Vines are able to grow in both deep shade and full sun due to their wide range of phenotypic plasticity. This climbing action prevents shading by neighbors and allows the vine to grow out of reach of herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gianoli|first1=Ernesto|last2=Molina-Montenegro|first2=Marco A.|title=Leaf Damage Induces Twining in a Climbing Plant|date=2005|journal=The New Phytologist|volume=167|issue=2|pages=385–90|jstor=3694507|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01484.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment where a vine can grow successfully is determined by the climbing mechanism of a vine and how far it can spread across supports. There are many theories supporting the idea that photosynthetic responses are closely related to climbing mechanisms.
[[Image:Bigvine.jpg|thumb|right|A large [[Apios]] vine on the street in [[Sochi]], Russia]]
Temperate twining vines, which twist tightly around supports, are typically poorly adapted for climbing beneath closed canopies due to their smaller support diameter and shade intolerance. In contrast, tendril vines usually grow on the forest floor and onto trees until they reach the surface of the canopy, suggesting that they have greater physiological plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter |first1=Gregory A.|last2=Teramura|first2=Alan H.|title=Vine Photosynthesis and Relationships to Climbing Mechanisms in a Forest Understory|journal=American Journal of Botany|date=1988|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1101|doi=10.2307/2443769|jstor=2443769}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that twining vines revolving growth is mediated by changes in turgor pressure mediated by volume changes in the epidermal cells of the bending zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millet|first1=B.|last2=Melin|first2=D.|last3=Badot|first3=P.-M. |title=Circumnutation in Phaseolus vulgaris. I. Growth, osmotic potential and cell ultrastructure in the free moving part of the shoot|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|date=1988|volume=72|pages=133–138|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1988.tb06634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climbing vines possess many unique characteristics in response to changes in their environments. Climbing vines can induce chemical defenses and modify their biomass allocation in response to herbivores. In particular, the twisting vine ''C. arvensis'' increases its twining in response to herbivore-associated leaf damage, which may lead to reduced future herbivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molina-Montenegro|first1=Marco A.|last2=Gianoli|first2=Ernesto|last3=Becerra|first3=José|title=Interactive Effects of Leaf Damage, Light Intensity and Support Availability on Chemical Defenses and Morphology of a Twining Vine|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=95–103|doi=10.1007/s10886-006-9215-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the tendrils of perennial vine ''Cayratia japonica'' are more like to coil around nearby non-self plants than nearby self-plants in natural and experimental settings. This demonstrates the vine's ability to self-discriminate, which has only been previously documented in roots.

In tendrilled vines, the tendrils are highly sensitive to touch and the coiling action is mediated by the hormones octadecanoids, jasmonates and indole-3-acetic acid. The touch stimulus and hormones may interact via volatile compounds or internal oscillation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fukano|first1=Yuya|last2=Yamawo|first2=Akira|title=Self-discrimination in the tendrils of the vine is mediated by physiological connection|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=26 August 2015|volume=282|issue=1814|doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.1379|pmid=26311669|pmc=4571702|page=20151379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found the presence of ion translocating ATPases in the Bryonia dioica species of plants, which has implications for a possible ion mediation tendril curling mechanism. In response to a touch stimulus, vanadate sensitive K+, Mg2+ ATPase and a Ca2+ translocating ATPase both rapidly increase in their activity. This increases transmembrane ion fluxes that appear to be involved in the early stages of tendril coiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liß|first1=H.|last2=Weiler|first2=E. W.|title=Ion-translocating ATPases in tendrils of ''Bryonia dioica'' Jacq.|journal=Planta|date=July 1994|volume=194|issue=2|pages=169–180|doi=10.1007/BF00196385|jstor=23383001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yohkoh''' (ようこう, ''Sunbeam'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), known before launch as '''Solar-A''', was a [[Sun|Solar]] observatory spacecraft of the  [[JAXA|Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]]  ([[Japan]]), in collaboration with space agencies in the [[NASA|United States]] and the [[PPARC|United Kingdom]]. It was launched into [[Earth]] [[low earth orbit|orbit]] on August&amp;nbsp;30, 1991 by the [[Mu (rocket)|M-3S-5]] rocket from [[Kagoshima Space Center]]. It took its first soft X-ray image on September 13, 1991 21:53:40,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1992PASJ...44L..41O | title=The status of YOHKOH in orbit - an introduction to the initial scientific results | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan | volume=44 | page=L41 | year=1992 | authors=Ogawara, Yoshiaki; Acton, Loren W.; Bentley, Robert D.; Bruner, Marilyn E.; Culhane, J. Leonard; Hiei, Eijiro; Hirayama, Tadashi; Hudson, Hugh S.; Kosugi, Takeo; Lemen, James R.; Strong, Keith T.; Tsuneta, Saku; Uchida, Yutaka; Watanabe, Tetsuya; Yoshimori, Masato}}&lt;/ref&gt; and movie representations of the X-ray corona over 1991-2001 are available at the [http://ylstone.physics.montana.edu/ylegacy/ Yohkoh Legacy site].

==Description==
The satellite was three-axis stabilized and in a near-circular orbit. It carried four instruments: a Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), a Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT), a Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), and a Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS). About 50 [[megabyte|MB]] were generated each day and stored on board by a 10.5 MB [[bubble memory]] recorder.

Because SXT utilized a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) as its readout device, perhaps being the first X-ray astronomical telescope to do so, its "data cube" of images was both extensive and convenient, and it revealed much interesting detail about the behavior of the solar corona. 
Previous solar soft X-ray observations, such as those of [[Skylab]], had been restricted to film as a readout device. 
Yohkoh therefore returned many novel scientific results, especially regarding solar flares and other forms of magnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solar.physics.montana.edu/nuggets/ Yohkoh Science Nuggets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission ended after more than ten years of successful observation when it went into its "safehold" mode during an annular eclipse on December 14, 2001 20:58:33 and the spacecraft lost lock on the sun. Operational mistakes and other flaws combined in such a way that its solar panels could no longer charge the batteries, which drained irreversibly; several other solar eclipses had successfully been observed.

On September 12, 2005 the spacecraft burned up during reentry over South Asia.  The time of reentry, as provided by the [[US space surveillance network|U.S. Space Surveillance Network]], was 6:16 pm [[Japan Standard Time]] (JST).

==Instruments==
''Yohkoh'' carried four instruments&amp;nbsp;:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darts.isas.ac.jp/solar/yohkoh/analysis.html ''Yohkoh'' Analysis Guide version 2.9x / Instrument Manual.] Eds. M.D.Morrison, R.D.Bentley. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Soft X-ray Telescope''' (SXT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1991SoPh..136...37T | title=The Soft X-ray Telescope for the SOLAR-A Mission | journal=Solar Physics | volume=136 | page=37 | year=1991 | authors=Tsuneta, S.; Acton, L.; Bruner, M.; Lemen, J.; Brown, W.; Caravalho, R.; Catura, R.; Freeland, S.; Jurcevich, B.; Morrison, M.; Ogawara, Y.; Hirayama, T.; Owens, J.|doi = 10.1007/BF00151694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an X-ray telescope with glancing incidence X-ray mirror and a CCD sensor. There was also a co-aligned optical telescope using the same CCD, but after the failure of the entrance filter in November 1992 it became unusable.

The CCD was 1024×1024 pixels with pixel angular size of 2.45″×2.45″, a point-spread function (core width FWHM) of about 1.5 pixels (i.e. 3.7″), a field of view of 42′×42′, which was a little larger than the whole solar disk. Typical time resolution was 2&amp;nbsp;s in flare mode and 8&amp;nbsp;s in quiet (no flare) mode, the maximum time resolution in 0.5&amp;nbsp;s.

For spectral discrimination, STX employed wide-band filters installed on a filter wheel. There were five usable filter positions: '''1265&amp;nbsp;Å'''-thick '''Al''' filter (2.5&amp;nbsp;Å–36&amp;nbsp;Å pass band), '''Al/Mg/Mn''' filter (2.4&amp;nbsp;Å–32&amp;nbsp;Å), '''2.52&amp;nbsp;μm Mg''' filter (2.4&amp;nbsp;Å–23&amp;nbsp;Å), '''11.6&amp;nbsp;μm Al''' filter (2.4&amp;nbsp;Å–13&amp;nbsp;Å), '''119&amp;nbsp;μm Be''' filter (2.3&amp;nbsp;Å–10&amp;nbsp;Å). Before the entrance filter failure in November 1992 three more filter positions were available: no analysis filter (2.5&amp;nbsp;Å–46&amp;nbsp;Å), Wide band optical filter (4600&amp;nbsp;Å–4800&amp;nbsp;Å), Narrow band optical filter (4290&amp;nbsp;Å–4320&amp;nbsp;Å).
* The '''Hard X-ray Telescope''' (HXT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1991SoPh..136...17K | title=The Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) for the SOLAR-A Mission | journal=Solar Physics | volume=136 | page=17 | year=1991 | authors=Kosugi, T.; Makishima, K.; Murakami, T.; Sakao, T.; Dotani, T.; Inda, M.; Kai, K.; Masuda, S.; Nakajima, H.; Ogawara, Y.; Sawa, M.; Shibasaki, K.|doi = 10.1007/BF00151693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Fourier-synthesis X-ray imager with 64 bigrid collimators sparsely sampling the (u,v) plane and feeding individual scintillation-counter detectors. HXT was sensitive to photons with energies from 14&amp;nbsp;keV to 93&amp;nbsp;keV, this range was divided into four energy bands (called L, M1, M2,&amp;nbsp;H). The angular resolution was about 5″, image synthesis field of view is 2′×2′, maximum time resolution was 0.5&amp;nbsp;s.
* '''Bragg Crystal Spectrometer''' (BCS) was two bent crystal [[spectrometer]]s sensitive in four spectral lines: the line of ion Fe&amp;nbsp;XXVI (1.76&amp;nbsp;Å–1.81&amp;nbsp;Å), ion Fe&amp;nbsp;XXV (1.83&amp;nbsp;Å–1.90&amp;nbsp;Å), ion Ca&amp;nbsp;XIX (3.16&amp;nbsp;Å–3.19&amp;nbsp;Å), and ion S&amp;nbsp;XV (5.02&amp;nbsp;Å–5.11&amp;nbsp;Å). Spectral resolution varied in the range of λ/Δλ=3000–8000, typical time resolution in flare mode was 8&amp;nbsp;s, maximum is 0.125&amp;nbsp;s. BCS integrates radiation over the whole solar disc.
* '''Wide Band Spectrometer''' (WBS) had spectroscopic capabilities in a wide energy band from 3&amp;nbsp;keV to 100&amp;nbsp;MeV. WBS was a set of four subinstruments, eаch of them outputs Pulse Count (PC) corresponding to intensity integrated over a band, and Pulse Height (PH) profile which corresponded to spectrum. Time resolution for PC (0.125&amp;nbsp;s–4&amp;nbsp;s for different subinstruments and modes) was 8–16 times better than for PH (1&amp;nbsp;s–32&amp;nbsp;s). WBS integrated radiation over the whole Sun and did not resolve source position.
** Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) consisted of two [[Proportional counter|proportional gas counters]] with nominal energy band 5&amp;nbsp;keV–40&amp;nbsp;keV, which was divided into two PC channels and 128 PH channels. It was found after the launch that PH to energy relationship was distorted. No energy calibration for WBS PH data was available in 1999.
** Hard X-ray Spectrometer (HXS) was a NaI(Tl) [[Scintillation counter|scintillator]]. The energy band after June 1992 was 24&amp;nbsp;keV–830&amp;nbsp;keV. It was divided into 2 PC channels and 32 PH channels.
** Gamma-ray Spectrometer (GRS) consisted of two identical bismuth germanate oxide scintillators. It covered energy range 0.3&amp;nbsp;MeV–100&amp;nbsp;MeV, which was divided into 6 PC channels and 128+16 PH channels.
** Radiation Belt Monitor (RBM) unlike the other three was not aimed at solar flare observations and served to sound the alarm for [[radiation belt]] passage.
