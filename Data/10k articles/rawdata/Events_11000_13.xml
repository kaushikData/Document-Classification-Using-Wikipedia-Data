'''''12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief''''' was a [[benefit concert]] that took place on December 12, 2012, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. 

The concert was held in response to [[Hurricane Sandy]], which devastated portions of the [[Northeastern United States]], the Caribbean and the Mid-Atlantic in late October 2012 and cost an estimated $60 billion in damage in the United States. The concert was broadcast live via television, radio, movie theaters and the Internet, and released on DVD and CD. A [[12-12-12|documentary film]] was also made about the concert. Proceeds from the event were collected by the [[Robin Hood Foundation|Robin Hood Relief Fund]] to benefit victims of the hurricane in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]]. 

Many famous performers took part in the charity event, including [[The Who]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Billy Joel]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Michael Stipe]], [[Kanye West]], [[Eddie Vedder]], and, for the first time in eighteen years, the surviving members of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] ([[Dave Grohl]], [[Krist Novoselic]] and touring member [[Pat Smear]]) who performed together in a collaboration with [[Paul McCartney]] during his show-closing set.&lt;ref name="nirvana-reunion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul McCartney to Front Nirvana Reunion at 12-12-12 Concert|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/paul-mccartney-to-perform-with-dave-grohl-and-friends-at-12-12-12-20121212|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccartney-sound-city&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Andy|title=Nirvana-Paul McCartney Song Stems From Dave Grohl's 'Sound City' Documentary|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvana-paul-mccartney-song-stems-from-dave-grohls-sound-city-documentary-20121213|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The benefit concert was first announced in mid-November 2012 and that the producers behind 2001's ''[[The Concert for New York City]]'' would also produce the Hurricane Sandy benefit which quickly attracted many big names from the music industry. The venue and on sale date for tickets were announced in early December. Madison Square Garden had originally been reserved on December 12 for a [[New York Rangers]] game against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] that was among the many canceled due to the [[2012 NHL lockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Staff | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/a-look-at-the-88th-day-of-the-nhl-lockout/2012/12/12/bce19626-44c2-11e2-8c8f-fbebf7ccab4e_story.html|title=A Look at the 88th Day of the NHL Lockout|date=December 12, 2012|publisher=Associated Press (via ''[[The Washington Post]]'') |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeds from the event went to the [[Robin Hood Foundation|Robin Hood Relief Fund]] and benefit victims of the hurricane in areas most impacted, especially [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="pollstar"&gt;Staff (December 4, 2012).

[[Associated Press]] (via ''[[Pollstar]]'').  Retrieved December 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More than $30 million was raised through ticket sales alone.&lt;ref name=huff1 /&gt;

==Tickets==
Tickets for the event went on sale through [[Ticketmaster]] on December 3, 2012, at noon though Chase Bank customers were allowed to buy tickets at 9 a.m. Tickets quickly sold out in minutes.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | date = December 12, 2012 | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/12/watch-live-the-12-12-12-sandy-relief-concert-starring-springsteen-mccartney-and-the-stones/ | title=Watch Live: The 12-12-12 Sandy Relief Concert Starring Springsteen, McCartney and the Stones | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face-value of tickets ranged from $150 to $2,500,&lt;ref name="pollstar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huff1"&gt;{{cite web | author = Bauder, David | date = December 12, 2012 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/12-12-12-concert-hurricane-sandy_n_2286723.html | title=12-12-12 Concert For Hurricane Sandy Victims Includes Music Royalty | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with organizers saying all proceeds would go to the [[Robin Hood Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Brown, Stephen Rex | date = December 12, 2012 | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/scalpers-making-concert-article-1.1218497| work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |title=Ticket Scalpers Making Big Bucks Off 12/12/12 Concert to Benefit Hurricane Sandy Victims –  Online Ticket Resale Sites Are Busy with $10,000 Seats | accessdate = December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most concerts with high demands for tickets, scalpers were able to buy up tickets and within minutes of the concert selling out were already available for re-sale at much higher prices on various sites, including [[StubHub]]. By December 7, 2012, tickets for the floor in front of the stage were listed for as much as $48,000 while those in the upper level were going for $525 to $3,000.  

Producers of the event urged people to not buy from these secondary websites because the money no longer goes to charity. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Charles E. Schumer]] sent a letter to StubHub and three other major online ticket exchanges, urging them to not allow sellers to profit from the demand for the concert stating that "Every dollar spent for these concert tickets should go to help the victims of Superstorm Sandy, not to line the pockets of unscrupulous scalpers”. A spokesman for StubHub, Glenn Lehrman, said it did not have the technology to require sellers to give their profits to charity. StubHub gave its commissions of more than $500,000 to the charity.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

Jacqueline Peterson, a spokeswoman for Ticketmaster, which handled the initial ticket sales, said her company had evidence that scalpers had used computer programs to snap up large numbers of tickets for resale. She said Ticketmaster had blocked thousands of sales to buyers that it identified as using these programs. Among the recipients of Schumer's letter were TicketMaster's in-house resale marketplaces, [[TicketsNow]] and [[TicketExchange]]; however, Peterson said that 12-12-12 tickets were not being allowed on those sites. [[TicketLiquidator]], another secondary re-sale website, also said that it had declined to carry tickets for the concert.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[[James C. McKinley, Jr.|McKinliney, Jr., James C.]] (December 7, 2012).

''[[The New York Times]]''.  Retrieved December 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WPSG]] (Channel 57) carried the show locally in [[Philadelphia]].

Event producers [[James L. Dolan|James Dolan]], [[John Sykes]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] issued on December 3, 2012, the following joint statement: "The fact that so many major media companies are joining forces to distribute and stream this important event to homes worldwide will enable us to create a tremendous and unprecedented fundraising effort on a global scale to benefit the victims of this devastating storm."&lt;ref&gt;Joint press release (December 3, 2012).

While every major U.S. media company aired the benefit on at least one of their networks, none of the major over-the-air television networks including [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[NBC]] aired it, and neither did the major cable-news networks of [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]] and the [[Fox News Channel]].

The '''1966 FIFA World Cup Final''' was the final match in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], the eighth [[association football|football]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/england1966/index.html "Hurst the hero for England in the home of football"].

England won 4–2 [[extra time|after extra time]] to win the [[Jules Rimet Trophy]]. The England team became known as the "wingless wonders", on account of their then-unconventional narrow attacking formation, described at the time as a 4–4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2007/m=4/news=alf-ramsey-england-anonymous-hero-510253.html |title=Alf Ramsey&amp;nbsp;– England's Anonymous Hero |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match is remembered for England's only World Cup trophy, [[Geoff Hurst]]'s [[hat-trick]]&amp;nbsp;– the first, and to date, only one ever scored in a FIFA World Cup Final&amp;nbsp;– and the controversial third goal awarded to England by referee [[Gottfried Dienst]]  and linesman [[Tofiq Bahramov]].

Both teams were strong throughout the tournament. Each won two and drew one of their three matches in the group stages. England did not concede a goal until their semi-final against Portugal.

===Summary===

====Normal time====
England, managed by [[Alf Ramsey]] and captained by [[Bobby Moore]], won the toss and elected to kick off. After 12 minutes, [[Sigfried Held]] sent a cross into the English penalty area which [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]] misheaded to [[Helmut Haller]], who got his shot on target. [[Jack Charlton]] and goalkeeper [[Gordon Banks]] failed to deal with the shot which went in making it 1–0 to West Germany.

[[File:Old Wembley Stadium (external view).jpg|thumbnail|right|The original Wembley Stadium with its twin towers.]]

In the 19th minute, [[Wolfgang Overath]] conceded a free kick, which Moore took immediately, floating a cross into the West German area, where [[Geoff Hurst]] rose unchallenged and levelled the scores with a downward glancing header. The teams were level at half-time, and after 77&amp;nbsp;minutes England won a corner. [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]] delivered the ball to Geoff Hurst whose deflected shot from the edge of the area found [[Martin Peters]]. He produced the final shot, beating the West German keeper from eight yards to make the score 2–1 to England.&lt;ref name="guardian_live"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Rob |last1=Smyth |first2=Scott |last2=Murray |title=World Cup final 1966: England v West Germany – live! |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/30/world-cup-final-1966-england-west-germany-live |publisher=theguardian.com (Guardian News and Media) |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany pressed for an equaliser in the closing moments, and in the 89th minute [[Jack Charlton]] conceded a free kick for climbing on [[Uwe Seeler]] as they both went up for a header.&lt;ref name="guardian_live"/&gt; The kick was taken by [[Lothar Emmerich]], who struck it into [[George Cohen]] in the wall; the rebound fell to Held, who shot across the face of goal and into the body of [[Karl-Heinz Schnellinger]]. The ball deflected across the England six-yard box, wrong-footing the England defence and allowing [[Wolfgang Weber]] to level the score at 2–2 and force the match into extra time. Banks protested that the ball had struck Schnellinger on the arm, and reiterated the claim in his 2002 autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banks |first=Gordon |title=Banksy |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7181-4582-8 |page=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but replays showed that it actually struck Schnellinger on the back.&lt;ref name="guardian_live"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glanville |first1=Brian |title=The Story of the World Cup |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |year=2010 |origyear=1973 |isbn=978-0-571-23605-3 |page=154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extra time====
[[File:Ghost Goal World Cup 1966.jpg|thumb|Geoff Hurst's "[[Ghost goal|Wembley Goal]]"]]
England pressed forward and created several chances. In particular, with five minutes gone, Bobby Charlton struck the post and sent another shot just wide. With 11 minutes of extra time gone, Alan Ball put in a cross and Geoff Hurst swivelled and shot from close range. The ball hit the underside of the crossbar, bounced down and was cleared. The referee Gottfried Dienst was uncertain if it had been a goal and consulted his linesman, [[Tofiq Bahramov]] from Azerbaijan in the USSR, who indicated that it was, and the Swiss referee awarded the goal to the home team. The crowd and the audience of 400&amp;nbsp;million television viewers were left arguing whether the goal should have been given or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&amp;dat=19660801&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en |title=Team Spirit Gains England the cup |date=1 August 1966 |work=Glasgow Herald (Page 4) |accessdate=30 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

England's [[Ghost goal#1966 World Cup Final|third goal has remained controversial]] ever since the match. According to the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] the definition of a [[Scoring in association football|goal]] is when "the whole of the ball passes over the goal line".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws10_01.htm {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523172940/http://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws10_01.htm |date=23 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; English supporters cited the good position of the linesman and the statement of Roger Hunt, the nearest England player to the ball, who claimed it was a goal and that was why he wheeled away in celebration rather than attempting to tap the rebounding ball in.

Modern studies using film analysis and computer simulation have shown that the ball never crossed the line – both Duncan Gillies of the Visual Information Processing Group at [[Imperial College London]] and Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman of the Department of Engineering Science at [[University of Oxford]] have stated that the ball would have needed to travel a further 2.5–6.0&amp;nbsp;cm to fully cross the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Reid |first1=Ian |last2=Zisserman |first2=Andrew |year=1996 |title=Goal-directed Video Metrology |journal=[[European Conference on Computer Vision|Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Computer Vision]] |volume=II |pages=647–658 |location=New York City |publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]] |editor1-last=Cipolla |editor1-first=R. |editor2-last=Buxton |editor2-first=B. |id=[[LNCS]] 1065 |accessdate=19 May 2012 |url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/reid96.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67mC9unyd?url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/reid96.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2012 |deadurl=no |format=PDF  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Germans cited possible bias of the Soviet linesman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ken Jones |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-it-is-possible-to-forget-that-englands-overall-world-cup-record-is-nothing-much-to-shout-about-1286782.html |title=Football: It is possible to forget that England's overall World Cup record is nothing much to shout about |work=[[The Independent]] |date=4 December 1997 |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially as the USSR had just been defeated in the semi-finals by West Germany.&lt;ref name="chant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/67/world-cup/2010/06/26/1996411/two-world-wars-one-world-cup-and-the-achtung-chaos-the |title=Two World Wars, One World Cup And The 'Achtung!' Chaos&amp;nbsp;– The Complex And Violent History Of England Vs Germany |publisher=Goal.com |first=Graham |last=Lister |date=26 June 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahramov later stated in his memoirs that he believed the ball had bounced back not from the crossbar but from the net, and that he was not able to observe the rest of the scene, so it did not matter where the ball hit the ground anyway.

One minute before the end of play, the West Germans sent their defenders forward in a desperate attempt to score a last-minute equaliser. Winning the ball, Bobby Moore picked out the unmarked Geoff Hurst with a long pass, which Hurst carried forward while some spectators began streaming onto the field and Hurst scored moments later. Hurst later admitted that his blistering shot was as much intended to send the ball as far into the Wembley stands as possible should it miss, in order to kill time on the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cg/eng_frg_1966.html |title=1966: England&amp;nbsp;– Federal Republic of Germany |accessdate=7 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208113916/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cg/eng_frg_1966.html |archivedate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final goal gave rise to one of the most famous calls in English football history, when [[BBC]] commentator [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]] described the situation as follows: ''"And here comes Hurst. He's got... [[Pitch invasion|some people are on the pitch]], [[they think it's all over]]. It is now! It's four!"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3020805/Class-of-66-pay-tribute-to-voice-of-football.html |title=Class of '66 pay tribute to voice of football |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the balls from the final is on display in the [[National Football Museum]] in [[Manchester]].

One of the enduring images of the celebrations in Wembley immediately after the game was the picture of the captain [[Bobby Moore]] holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft, on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters. In recognition of Moore and other [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] players' contribution to the win, the club and Newham Borough Council jointly commissioned a statue of this scene. On 28 April 2003 [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] as president of [[The Football Association]], duly unveiled the ''[[World Cup Sculpture]]'' (also called ''The Champions'') in a prominent place near West Ham's ground, at the time, the [[Boleyn Ground]], at the junction of [[A124|Barking Road]] and [[Green Street, London|Green Street]]. The {{convert|4|metre|feet|adj=on}}-high bronze piece was sculpted by [[Philip Jackson (sculptor)|Philip Jackson]] and weighed 4 tonnes.&lt;ref name=BBC28Apr2003&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2982419.stm |title=World Cup tribute unveiled |publisher=BBC News |date=28 April 2003 |accessdate=5 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203095221/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2982419.stm |archivedate=3 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4metre"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newham.com/live/attractions/champions_sculpture/33,10,0,0.html | title=Champions Sculpture | work=www.newham.com | accessdate=15 August 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610214546/http://www.newham.com/live/attractions/champions_sculpture/33,10,0,0.html | archive-date=10 June 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Close-up of the ball from the 1966 World Cup Final (3302542219).jpg|thumb|Ball used in the final, located in the [[National Football Museum]], Manchester]]
The final is the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts#Most watched special events|most watched event ever on British television]], as of July 2018, attracting 32.30&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="record television"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16671101 "Tracking 30 years of TV's most watched programmes"]. BBC. Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, a goal resulting from a shot bouncing off the crossbar and hitting the line is called a ''Wembley-Tor'' (Wembley Goal) due to the controversial nature of Hurst's second goal. This goal has been parodied a large number of times. Some of the most notable include:

* England's third goal was referenced in a 2006 [[Adidas]] advertisement, where English midfielder [[Frank Lampard]] takes a shot at German keeper [[Oliver Kahn]], and a similar event happens. On 27 June 2010 at [[2010 World Cup|that year's World Cup]] a similar goal by Lampard was wrongly disallowed (TV replays showed the ball landing past the goal line before bouncing away) which would have levelled the second-round game against Germany 2–2 (Germany won 4–1).
* [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]]'s commentary on the third goal that bounced on the line, "It's a goal!" was used (along with the sound of breaking glass) in the tape-looped coda of an early version of [[The Beatles]] song "[[Glass Onion]]", available on the album ''[[Anthology 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pcsp729.html Anthology 3 – The Beatles]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1966 a [[England Winners stamp|special 4d stamp]] marked &lt;small&gt;ENGLAND WINNERS&lt;/small&gt; was issued by the [[Royal Mail]] to celebrate the victory and which soared in value to up to 15 shillings each on the back of public enthusiasm for the victory before falling back in value when the public realised it was not rare.

The 1991 [[BBC]] miniseries ''[[Sleepers (TV series)|Sleepers]]'', about a pair of deep-cover [[KGB]] agents placed in England in the mid-1960s and then forgotten includes a subplot about an archive film of the match recorded by Soviet agents and then placed in archives.  A KGB officer who sees the film in the early 1990s is excited to discover it includes footage of the disputed goal and attempts to sell it to a contact at a television network (pointedly described as not the BBC). ''Sleepers'' is coy about what the film depicts and in the course of the story, the film is destroyed.

Marking the 50th anniversary of England's World Cup victory in July 2016, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast ''1966 – A Nation Remembers'', which was narrated by the actor [[Terence Stamp]] who attended every England game at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1966 – A Nation Remembers|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week31/1966-nation-remembers|agency=ITV|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Cup win features in the song "[[Three Lions]]" (known by its chorus "Football's Coming Home"), the unofficial anthem of the England football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/05/its-coming-home-england-meme-world-cup|title='It's coming home': England are winning the meme World Cup|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 July 2018|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; England's win in the final also helped fans to create the "[[Two World Wars and One World Cup]]" chant.&lt;ref name="chant"/&gt;

==2009 receipt of winners medals==
The players and staff of England's winning squad who did not get medals in 1966 received them on 10 June 2009 after a ceremony at 10 Downing Street in London. Initially, only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the match received medals, but [[FIFA]] later awarded medals to every non-playing squad and staff member from every [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]-winning country from [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] to [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8093891.stm |title=World Cup 1966 winners honoured |date=10 June 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=10 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612032102/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8093891.stm |archivedate=12 June 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Hajj stampede''' resulted in the deaths of at least 364 pilgrims on  12 January 2006 during the [[Hajj]] in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite web|title=Hajj stampede: At least 310 killed in Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34346449|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
{{main|Hajj}}
The Hajj is an annual pilgrimage in [[Mecca]] undertaken by able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime. It consists of a series of rites including the [[Stoning of the Devil]] ({{lang-ar|{{large|رمي الجمرات|}}}} ''{{transl|ar|ramī aj-jamarāt}}'', {{abbr|lit.|literally}} "[[Rajm|stoning]] of the ''{{transl|ar|jamarāt}}'' [place of pebbles]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Richard Francis|authorlink=Richard Francis Burton|title=Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El Medinah and Meccah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA226|year=1857|page=226 |quote=The word ''jamrah'' is applied to the place of stoning, as well as to the stones.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Abū Dāʼūd]] |title=Sunan Abu Dawud: Chapters 519–1337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwvYAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Sh. M. Ashraf|quote=1204. ''Jamrah'' originally means a pebble. It is applied to the heap of stones or a pillar.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]], a district of [[Mecca]]. The stoning ritual is the last major ritual and is often regarded as the most dangerous part of the Hajj, with [[Incidents during the Hajj#Stampedes and failures of crowd control|stampedes]] occurring in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Satan stoned – most dangerous hajj rite|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Satan-stoned-most-dangerous-hajj-rite-20111106|accessdate=24 September 2015|agency=News24|date=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a history of fatal stampedes at The Hajj – including a stampede which killed 244 in 2004&lt;ref name="markoliver"/&gt; – authorities in Mecca had taken steps in the hopes of reducing chances of another stampede, including the issuing of a fatwa extending the permitted hours of the ritual.

==Incident==
[[File:Mina's tents.JPG|thumb|Mina camp sites, 2011.]]
The stampede occurred when pilgrims fell over luggage that had been discarded in the rush to take part in the stoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/mecca-crane-collapse-saudi-arabia-king-sanctions-binladin-group | work = The Guardian| publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | title = Mecca crane collapse: Saudi king sanctions Binladin group | agency=Agence France-Presse| date = 15 September 2015 | accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year '''580 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 174 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 580 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15431">The '''anti-Jewish violence in Central and Eastern Europe''' following the retreat of [[Nazi German]] occupational forces and the victorious arrival of the Soviet [[Red Army]] – during the latter stages of World War II – was linked in part to postwar anarchy and economic chaos exacerbated by the [[Stalinism#Stalinist policies|Stalinist policies]] imposed across the territories of expanded [[Soviet republics]] and new satellite countries. The anti-semitic attacks have become frequent in Soviet towns ravaged by war; at the marketplaces, in depleted stores, in schools, and even at state enterprises.&lt;ref name="W-H-S"&gt;{{cite book |title=War, Holocaust and Stalinism: A Documented Study of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the USSR |authors=Shimon Redlich, Kirill Mikhaĭlovich Anderson, I.

==History==
The Soviet authorities failed to address the years of Hitler's anti-Jewish propaganda, wrote Colonel [[David Dragunsky]]; anti-Semitic elements from among the former [[Russian collaborationism with the Axis powers|Nazi collaborators in the Soviet Union]] were often put in charge of state enterprises.&lt;ref name="W-H-S"/&gt; [[Solomon Mikhoels|Solomon Mikhailovich Mikhoels]], Chairman of JAFC murdered in Minsk in January 1948 wrote that Jewish homes were not being returned. In [[Berdichev]], [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Mogilev-Podolsk]] [[Balta, Ukraine|Balta]], [[Zhmerinka]], [[Vinnitsa]], [[Khmelnik]], [[Stara Rafalivka|Old Rafalovka]] and many other towns, Jews were forced to remain in the areas of former [[Nazi ghetto]]s for their own safety.&lt;ref name="W-H-S"/&gt; The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAFC) was targeted by Soviet authorities directly in the so-called [[rootless cosmopolitan]] campaign of the second half of the 1940s and in the [[Night of the Murdered Poets]].&lt;ref name=Medvedev&gt;{{cite book |last=Medvedev |first=Zhores |authorlink=Zhores Medvedev |title=Сталин и еврейская проблема: новый анализ |trans-title=Stalin and the Jewish Question: New Analysis |publisher=Prava Cheloveka |location=Moscow |year=2003 |isbn=5-7712-0251-7 |url=http://scepsis.net/library/id_1473.html |ref=harv |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinkus&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinkus |first=Benjamin |title=The Soviet Government and the Jews 1948-1967: A Documented Study |year=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-24713-6 |pages=183–184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7g8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|JAFC Presidium]] met in late August, 1944, with a commander of a Jewish partisan unit from Belorussia. Answering a question concerning attitudes of the non-Jewish population towards Jews in [[Minsk]], he stated: "... the attitude wasn't good. There have been numerous anti-semitic incidents ... a battle for apartments has started ... there are difficulties concerning employment.&lt;ref name="W-H-S"/&gt;}}

Several months after the Mikhoels assassination, other Jewish figures were arrested. His death signalled the beginning of the country-wide repressions of the Jews accused of espionage and economic crimes. A campaign against Zionism was launched in the fall of 1948. By the end of the decade Jews disappeared from the upper echelons of the party in the republics.&lt;ref name="ZYGi"&gt;{{cite book |work=A Century of Ambivalence: The Jews of Russia and the Soviet Union, 1881 to the Present |author=Zvi Y.

The '''Budapest Opera Ball''' (''Budapesti Operabál'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], ''Budapester Opernball'' in [[German language|German]]) is an annual [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[upper class|society]] event taking place in the building of the [[Budapest Opera]] (''Operaház'') on the last Saturday of the carnival season, usually late February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operabal.com/eng/operabal_tortenete.html |title=普通のデリヘルに飽きてしまった方は日本橋ヘルスの扉を叩け！ |accessdate=2014-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106193421/http://www.operabal.com/eng/operabal_tortenete.html |archivedate=2013-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion the stage and the auditorium of the Opera is transformed into a huge ballroom. The dress code is [[White tie|evening dress]]: white tie and tailcoat for men, floor-length [[gown]]s for women. The ball is opened by more than a hundred [[debutante]] dancers after a show consisting of selected [[aria]]s, followed by the ''Alles [[Waltz|Walzer]]'' with people dancing until dawn.  Recent international guests include [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Ornella Muti]], [[Yevgeny Nesterenko]], [[Walter Berry (bass-baritone)|Walter Berry]], [[Heinz Zednik]], [[Katia Ricciarelli]], [[Patrizio Buanne]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Katarina Witt]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Daryl Hannah]], and [[Guy de Rothschild]].  Besides such guests as these, the balls are highlighted by the best-known Hungarian [[opera singers]].

The Opera Ball was first organised on March 2, 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jagellobusinesshotel.hu/en/Programmes_in_Budapest/Opera_Ball.html |title=Budapesti Háromcsillagos Szálloda: Jagelló Business Hotel Budapest |accessdate=2010-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721110120/http://www.jagellobusinesshotel.hu/en/Programmes_in_Budapest/Opera_Ball.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspended in 1934, it was not revived until 1996.  Representing a tradition rooted in [[Austrian-Hungarian]] culture of the 1880s, the [[revival (theatre)|revival]] has become the most prestigious meeting point of the participants of the Hungarian public life, fully covered by national media.

In 2011, a charity Gala Concert was substituted for the Opera Ball with as a gesture "of contribution to the work of the Government, the leading institutions and the citizens" to help those Hungarians afflicted by the ongoing financial crisis and the various natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/kultur/2011/01/06/elmarad_az_operabal/|title=Elmarad az Operabál|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2017|date=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Eat, Pray, Queef'''" is the fourth episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 185th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 1, 2009. In the episode, the men and boys of South Park become infuriated when the [[fart]]-joke oriented ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'' show is replaced with the ''Queef Sisters'', a show devoted to [[Vaginal flatulence|queef]] jokes. The women and girls of South Park accuse them of holding a [[sexism|sexist]] [[double standard]] when it comes to women queefing and men farting.

The episode was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[Television content rating systems#United States|TV-MA L]] in the United States. Parker and [[Matt Stone]] originally considered doing a full-length ''Queef Sisters'' episode in the style of the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] premiere "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]", but they decided against it based on the negative fan reaction to that episode.

The episode received generally positive reviews and, according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], was seen by more than three million households in its original airing, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The title is a reference to the [[Elizabeth Gilbert]] book ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]''; the episode also included references to [[Martha Stewart]] and the film ''[[Mad Max 2|The Road Warrior]]''. The episode ends with the South Park men recording "Queef Free", a charity song in the style of "[[We Are The World]]" mixed with lyrics from "[[I Am Woman]]". "Eat, Pray, Queef" was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray]] along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010.

==Plot==
The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously awaiting the night's episode of ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an [[April Fools' Day]] joke, the channel is airing a new show called the ''Queef Sisters'', about [[Canadians|Canadian]] sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They are very similar to Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make [[Vaginal flatulence|queef]] jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.

Meanwhile, Terrance and Phillip are furious their show got replaced with ''The Queef Sisters'', sharing the American Men's disgust of queef jokes.  When the producer asks why they think fart jokes are funny, but are revolted by queef jokes, Terrance says it's "because babies come from there."

As a joke mirroring Cartman's, one of the girls at school queefs on [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' face, causing him to run screaming and crying out of the school building. The other boys are shocked and their fathers, outraged, go to the [[Colorado General Assembly]] and demand a law banning queefing, much to the anger of the town's women. Meanwhile, the Queef Sisters appear on ''[[Regis and Kelly]]'' to promote their book ''Eat, Pray, Queef'', and Terrance and Philip's show gets canceled due to the rising popularity of the Queef Sisters. Terrance and Philip attempt to kill the Queef Sisters, but the plan backfires when they end up becoming attracted to them after the Queef Sisters mention that Terrence and Phillip are the sisters' idols. They pair off into couples and travel the [[Canadian wine|Canadian Wine Country]] together. Meanwhile, after [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s mother [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] queefs, she and Stan's sister, [[List of South Park families#Shelley Marsh|Shelley]], start laughing at the dinner table, causing Stan and his father [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] to leave.

Feeling sorry for Butters, the South Park boys testify in the case in the [[Colorado Senate|Colorado State Senate]] about the girl who queefed on Butters. A debate on the senate floor culminates with a female senator queefing almost exact lines of dialogue from ''[[Mad Max 2|The Road Warrior]]'' film. The next day, the newspapers announce that, partly due to the senator's stunt the previous day, the queefing ban has passed. As Stan and his father Randy celebrate, Sharon and Shelley are hurt and insulted by the decision, describing it as an example of [[sexism]] that still pervades society, and finally sarcastically congratulate the men for "getting their own way... again." Stan and Randy finally understand the issue was not simply about queefing, but a larger point about women's rights. The two get all the South Park men together and record an inspirational song called "Queef Free", declaring women should have the right to queef, while photographs of women working various careers are displayed on a television screen. Terrance and Philip, despite a continued disgust with the constant queefing, attempt to marry the two Queef Sisters. The vicar leaves the ceremony in disgust as the couples repeatedly fart and queef on him, pronouncing them "Farts and Queefs" as he leaves.

"Eat, Pray, Queef" was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]]. It first aired on April 1, 2009 in the United States on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewinski |first=John Scott |title=Creative Chaos Keeps ''South Park'' Timely, Tack-Sharp |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2009-03-31 |url=http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2009/03/stone-unveils-s.html |accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Parker and fellow co-creator [[Matt Stone]] acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, "I seriously never laughed as hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, sitting there in the editing room laughing."&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]| date=November 2010 |title=South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season: "Eat, Pray, Queef" |format=Audio commentary |medium= Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive. They reportedly claimed vaginal flatulence would not bloom into a proud women's movement as it did in the episode, but Parker and Stone insisted that was what made the concept even funnier.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]| date=November 2010 |title=South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season: "Eat, Pray, Queef" |format=Audio commentary |medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt;

Originally, Parker and Stone considered making a full-length episode of ''The Queef Sisters''.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The duo had pulled a similar stunt with the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] premiere. Instead of the expected follow-up to "[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut]]", in which the identity of Cartman's father was to be revealed, Parker and [[Matt Stone]] showed the episode "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]", a Terrance and Phillip-centered episode as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank.&lt;ref name="Examiner"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lynch |first=Kelvin |title=Laugh of the day: Martha Stewart does a good thing for spring |date=2009-04-02 |work=The Philadelphia Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since "Eat, Pray, Queef" was coincidentally also set to air on April Fools' Day, they considered a similar joke revolving around Katherine and Katie. However, since "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" infuriated ''South Park'' fans at the time, they decided not to do it and wrote a full script for "Eat, Pray, Queef" instead.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The original prank is referenced in the episode, when [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|The Canada Channel]] announces that it will not air a much-anticipated part two episode of Terrance and Phillip, and instead will show the ''Queef Sisters'' as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank.&lt;ref name="Examiner" /&gt; The angry reaction from the boys mirrors the real-life fan reaction to the ''South Park'' second season premiere.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt;

The episode uses the characters' conflicting responses to the comedic value of farts and queefs to demonstrate a double standard between rights of men and women, even in the 21st century, as both genders hold unfair opinions toward the other sex, and the episode suggests men and women are, and should be, equals.&lt;ref name="Payne0402"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Payne |first=Niki |title=Queefing vs. Farting |date=2009-04-02 |work=The Philadelphia Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="If0402"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Delgado |first=Carlos |title=TV Review: South Park – Season 13 – "Eat, Pray, Queef" |work=iF Magazine |date=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after "Eat, Pray, Queef" was originally broadcast, the site also featured T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode. One featured Katherine and Katie [[queefing]] and saying, "Babies come from there!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=southpark: Babies Come From There! |work=[[Zazzle]] |date=2009-04-02 |url=http://www.zazzle.com/southpark/gifts?cg=196865231560843231 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the episode, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|The Canada Channel]] announces that, as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank, it will be airing the new Queef Sisters show instead of the much-anticipated part two episode of Terrance and Phillip. This is a reference to the ''South Park'' second season premiere. Instead of the expected follow-up to "[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut]]", in which the identity of Cartman's father was to be revealed, Parker and [[Matt Stone]] showed the episode "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]", a Terrance and Phillip-centered episode as an April Fools' Day prank. The move infuriated ''South Park'' fans.&lt;ref name="Examiner"/&gt;

==Reception==
A preview clip of the episode listed on South Park Studios, the official ''South Park'' website, during the week before the episode's broadcast was viewed more than 50,000 times.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; In its original American broadcast, "Eat, Pray, Queef" was watched by three million households overall, according to the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. It had over one million more household viewers than the second most watched Comedy Central show that week, the April 1 episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=''Damages'' season finale draws few, ''WWE RAW'', ''NCIS'' lead cable viewing |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=2009-04-07 |work=TV by the Numbers |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/04/07/damages-season-finale-draws-few-wwe-raw-ncis-lead-cable-viewing/16141#more-16141 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u1hd99Jv?url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/04/07/damages-season-finale-draws-few-wwe-raw-ncis-lead-cable-viewing/16141 |archivedate=2010-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niki Payne of the ''Philadelphia Examiner'' said "Eat, Pray, Queef" was "probably one of my all-time favorite episodes of ''South Park'' right now" because it was so on point concerning the double standards between men and women. She particularly praised the scene in which Stan and Randy are disgusted and uncomfortable when Stan's mom and sister started queefing at the dinner table.&lt;ref name="Payne0402" /&gt;  Carlos Delgado of ''If Magazine'' said the episode was "shocking, disgusting and obscenely funny" and demonstrated ''South Park''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ability to tackle any type of issue "in a uniquely ''South Park'' manner". He particularly enjoyed the Martha Stewart segment, which he described as "just haunting".&lt;ref name="If0402" /&gt; Josh Modell of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B grade. Modell said the Katie and Katherine cartoon was particularly funny, but queefing was referred to in so many jokes that it became a bit tired by the end.&lt;ref name="AVC0402" /&gt;

Some reviewers were less laudatory. Travis Fickett of [[IGN]] said the episode was "a textbook example of a disappointing ''South Park''". He said the jokes were predictable, lazy, boring, and that Terrance and Phillip are not funny enough to carry large portions of an episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fickett |first=Travis |title=South Park: "Eat, Pray, Queef" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2009-04-02 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/969/969056p1.html |accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edema''', also spelled '''oedema''' or '''œdema''', is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the [[interstitium]], located beneath the skin and in the cavities of the body, which can cause severe pain. Clinically, edema manifests as [[swelling (medical)|swelling]]. The amount of interstitial fluid is determined by the balance of fluid [[homeostasis]] and the increased secretion of fluid into the interstitium. The word is from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἴδημα}} ''oídēma'' meaning "swelling".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Doi%29%2Fdhma οἴδημα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is also known (mostly archaic) as '''dropsy'''.

==Classifications==
Cutaneous edema is referred to as "pitting" when, after pressure is applied to a small area, the indentation persists after the release of the pressure. [[Peripheral edema|Peripheral]] pitting edema, as shown in the illustration, is the more common type, resulting from water retention. It can be caused by systemic diseases, pregnancy in some women, either directly or as a result of [[heart failure]], or local conditions such as [[varicose veins]],  [[thrombophlebitis]], insect bites, and [[dermatitis]].

Non-pitting edema is observed when the indentation does not persist.  It is associated with such conditions as [[lymphedema]], [[lipedema]], and [[myxedema]].

Edema caused by malnutrition defines [[kwashiorkor]], an acute form of childhood protein-energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, anorexia, ulcerating dermatoses, and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates.

A rise in [[hydrostatic pressure]] occurs in [[cardiac failure]]. A fall in osmotic pressure occurs in [[nephrotic syndrome]] and [[liver failure]].&lt;ref name="pmid8790586"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Renkin EM | title = Cellular aspects of transvascular exchange: a 40-year perspective | journal = Microcirculation | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 157–67 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8790586 | doi = 10.3109/10739689409148270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes of edema which are generalized to the whole body can cause edema in multiple organs and peripherally. For example, severe heart failure can cause [[pulmonary edema]], pleural effusions, [[ascites]] and [[peripheral edema]]. Such severe systemic edema is called [[anasarca]]. In rare cases, a [[Parvovirus B19]] infection may cause generalized edemas.&lt;ref name="pmid23472922"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wiggli B, Imhof E, Meier CA, Laifer G | title = Water, water, everywhere. Acute parvovirus B19 infection | journal = Lancet | volume = 381 | issue = 9868 | pages = 776 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23472922 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61894-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a low plasma [[oncotic pressure]] is widely cited for the edema of nephrotic syndrome, most physicians note that the edema may occur before there is any significant protein in the urine ([[proteinuria]]) or fall in plasma protein level. Most forms of nephrotic syndrome are due to biochemical and structural changes in the basement membrane of capillaries in the kidney glomeruli, and these changes occur, if to a lesser degree, in the vessels of most other tissues of the body. Thus the resulting increase in permeability that leads to protein in the urine can explain the edema if all other vessels are more permeable as well.&lt;ref name="pmid9185099"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Palmer BF, Alpern RJ | title = Pathogenesis of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome | journal = Kidney Int. Suppl. | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = S21–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9185099 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the previously mentioned conditions, edemas often occur during the late stages of pregnancy in some women. This is more common with those of a history of pulmonary problems or poor circulation also being intensified if arthritis is already present in that particular woman. Women that already have arthritic problems most often have to seek medical help for pain caused from over-reactive swelling. Edemas that occur during pregnancy are usually found in the lower part of the leg, usually from the calf down.

=== Organ-specific===

An edema will occur in specific organs as part of inflammations, [[tendonitis]] or pancreatitis, for instance. Certain organs develop edema through tissue specific mechanisms.

Examples of edema in specific organs:

:* Pedal edema (dependent edema of legs) is extracellular fluid accumulation in the legs. This can occur in otherwise healthy people due to hypervolemia or maintaining a standing or seated posture for an extended period of time. It can occur due to diminished venous return of blood to the heart due to congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. It can also occur in patients with increased hydrostatic venous pressure or decreased oncotic venous pressure, due to obstruction of lymphatic or venous vessels draining the lower extremity. Certain drugs (for example, amolodipine) can cause pedal edema. 

:* [[Cerebral edema]] is extracellular fluid accumulation in the brain. It can occur in toxic or abnormal metabolic states and conditions such as systemic lupus or reduced oxygen at high altitudes. It causes drowsiness or loss of consciousness, leading to [[brain herniation]] and death.

:* [[Pulmonary edema]] occurs when the pressure in blood vessels in the lung is raised because of obstruction to the removal of blood via the pulmonary veins. This is usually due to failure of the left ventricle of the heart. It can also occur in altitude sickness or on inhalation of toxic chemicals. Pulmonary edema produces shortness of breath. [[Pleural effusion]]s may occur when fluid also accumulates in the [[pleural]] cavity.

:* Edema may also be found in the cornea of the eye with glaucoma, severe conjunctivitis or keratitis or after  surgery. Sufferers may perceive coloured haloes around bright lights.

:* Edema surrounding the eyes is called ''periorbital edema'' or [[eye puffiness]]. The periorbital tissues are most noticeably swollen immediately after waking, perhaps as a result of the gravitational redistribution of fluid in the horizontal position.

:* Common appearances of [[cutaneous]] edema are observed with [[mosquito]] bites, [[spider]] bites, bee stings ([[wheal and flare]]), and skin contact with certain plants such as [[Poison Ivy]] or [[Western Poison Oak]],&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 "Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |date=July 21, 2009 }}, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Strömberg&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which are termed ''[[contact dermatitis|contact dermatitides]]''.

:* Another cutaneous form of edema is [[myxedema]], which is caused by increased deposition of [[connective tissue]]. In myxedema (and a variety of other rarer conditions) edema is caused by an increased tendency of the tissue to hold water within its extracellular space. In myxedema this is because of an increase in hydrophilic carbohydrate-rich molecules (perhaps mostly [[hyaluronin]]) deposited in the tissue matrix. Edema forms more easily in dependent areas in the elderly (sitting in chairs at home or on aeroplanes) and this is not well understood. Estrogens alter body weight in part through changes in tissue water content. There may be a variety of poorly understood situations in which transfer of water from tissue matrix to lymphatics is impaired because of changes in the hydrophilicity of the tissue or failure of the 'wicking' function of terminal lymphatic capillaries.

:* In [[lymphedema]] abnormal removal of interstitial fluid is caused by failure of the [[lymphatic system]]. This may be due to obstruction from, for example, pressure from a [[cancer]] or enlarged [[lymph nodes]], destruction of lymph vessels by [[radiotherapy]], or infiltration of the lymphatics by infection (such as [[Podoconiosis|elephantiasis]]). It is most commonly due to a failure of the pumping action of muscles due to immobility, most strikingly in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, or paraplegia. It has been suggested that the edema that occurs in some people following use of aspirin-like cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as ibuprofen or indomethacin may be due to inhibition of lymph heart action.

:* [[Hydrops fetalis]] is a condition of the fetus characterized by an accumulation of fluid, or edema, in at least two fetal compartments.

== Mechanism ==
Six factors can contribute to the formation of edema:

# increased [[hydrostatic pressure]];
# reduced colloidal or [[oncotic pressure]] within blood vessels; 
# increased tissue colloidal or  oncotic pressure;
# increased blood vessel wall permeability (e.g., [[inflammation]]);
# obstruction of fluid clearance in the [[lymphatic system]];
# changes in the water retaining properties of the tissues themselves. Raised hydrostatic pressure often reflects retention of water and sodium by the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kumar|author2=Abbas|author3=Fausto |title=Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |year=1999 |pages=122 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generation of interstitial fluid is regulated by the forces of the [[Starling equation]].&lt;ref&gt;Boron W.F., Boulpaep E.L. (2012.) Medical Physiology: A Cellular and Molecular Approach, 2e. Saunders/Elsevier, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrostatic pressure within blood vessels tends to cause water to filter out into the tissue. This leads to a difference in protein concentration between blood plasma and tissue. As a result, the colloidal or [[oncotic pressure]] of the higher level of protein in the plasma tends to draw water back into the blood vessels from the tissue. Starling's equation states that the rate of leakage of fluid is determined by the difference between the two forces and also by the permeability of the vessel wall to water, which determines the rate of flow for a given force imbalance. Most water leakage occurs in capillaries or post capillary [[venule]]s, which have a [[semi-permeable membrane]] wall that allows water to pass more freely than protein. (The protein is said to be reflected and the efficiency of reflection is given by a reflection constant of up to 1.) If the gaps between the cells of the vessel wall open up then permeability to water is increased first, but as the gaps increase in size permeability to protein also increases with a fall in reflection coefficient.

Changes in the variables in Starling's equation can contribute to the formation of edemas either by an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the blood vessel, a decrease in the oncotic pressure within the blood vessel or an increase in vessel wall permeability. The latter has two effects. It allows water to flow more freely and it reduces the colloidal or oncotic pressure difference by allowing protein to leave the vessel more easily.

When possible, treatment involves resolving the underlying cause.

Treatment may also involve positioning the affected body parts to improve drainage.  For example, swelling in feet or ankles may be reduced by having the person lie down in bed or sit with the feet propped up on cushions. [[Intermittent pneumatic compression]] can be used to pressurize tissue in a limb, forcing fluids – both blood and [[lymph]] – to flow out of the pressurized area.  Treatment of persistent edemas, such as [[idiopathy|idiopathic]] [[Anatomical terms of location#Medial and lateral|bilateral]] [[lymphedema]], may also use [[manual lymphatic drainage]], a low-pressure massage technique designed to pump lymphatic fluid by a similar mechanism.

'''Final Burning in Budokan''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event promoted by [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], which took place on May 11, 2013, at [[Nippon Budokan]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan. Headlined by the retirement match of [[Kenta Kobashi]], all in all, the event featured seven matches and wrestlers from not only Noah, but also [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), [[Diamond Ring (professional wrestling)|Diamond Ring]], [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) and [[Tenryu Project]].&lt;ref name=FinalBurninginBudokan/&gt; Due to Kobashi's high-profile status in the history of Japanese professional wrestling, the event gained mainstream attention in the country. [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' called the event the "end of an era in Japanese pro wrestling", drawing parallels to [[Pelé]]'s 1977 retirement from [[soccer]].&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

===Background===
[[File:LEGEND....jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Kenta Kobashi]] in November 2007]]
On December 3, 2012, the ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' newspaper reported that [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] had decided to terminate the contract of veteran wrestler [[Kenta Kobashi]] due to financial issues.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = May 21, 2013 | title = May 21 2013 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: Kenta Kobashi retirement and career history, Budokan Hall history, WWE annual directory, tons more, second issue of the week | magazine = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/60055/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121210174908/http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/60055/ | script-title=ja:ノア激震！小橋解雇、秋山ら退団 | archivedate=December 10, 2012 | date=December 4, 2012 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobashi had been with Noah since its inception in 2000 and had been the reigning [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion]], when he left AJPW to follow [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] to the newly-created promotion.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; Kobashi then became the catalyst in a period, where Noah enjoyed great success with [[Nippon Budokan]] sellouts and classic matches.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; At a time when [[mixed martial arts]] was doing strong business in Japan and professional wrestling was seen as the "old fake version", Kobashi's drawing power kept Noah the most popular professional wrestling promotion in the country.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; However, while the promotion had once been considered one of the best in the world, it had recently fallen on hard times.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; First Kobashi started suffering from various injuries, which quickly took a toll on Noah's popularity.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; Kobashi's hard hitting style meant that by the age of 24, his knees were described as being "thrashed" and by the age of 33, he had had more than a dozen operations. Kobashi also battled [[kidney cancer]], which sidelined him for 17 months in early 2006.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; None of the wrestlers designed to replace Kobashi at the top of Noah had his charisma or drawing power and eventually the promotion lost its network television contract.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; Following Misawa's death in the ring in 2009, the promotion started to unravel with financial issues and dissension in the front office.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; Despite not having wrestled in almost a year, Kobashi was the highest paid worker in Noah and by December 2012 the company simply could no longer afford him.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

[[File:Jun Akiyama.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jun Akiyama]] was one of five wrestlers to resign from Noah after the company decided to terminate Kobashi's contract]]
Noah's decision to cut Kobashi led to an immediate backlash from wrestlers loyal to him with [[Atsushi Aoki]], [[Go Shiozaki]], [[Jun Akiyama]], [[Kotaro Suzuki]] and [[Yoshinobu Kanemaru]] announcing their resignation from the promotion.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/60607/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130611051029/http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/60607/ | script-title=ja:主力大量離脱ノアの今後 | archivedate=June 11, 2013 | date=December 7, 2012 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five ended up joining AJPW after their contracts with Noah expired at the end of the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20121219-1061517.html | script-title=ja:秋山らノア退団正式決定 | date=December 19, 2012 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20130127-1077224.html | script-title=ja:ノア退団の秋山ら５人が参戦へ／全日本 | date=January 27, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a new version of the [[Burning (professional wrestling)|Burning]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stable|stable]], which had originally been formed by Kobashi and Akiyama in 1998.&lt;ref name=Burning/&gt;

On December 9, 2012, Kobashi appeared at Noah's [[Ryōgoku Kokugikan]] event, announcing his retirement from professional wrestling, having deemed it impossible to fully recover from the accumulation of his injuries.

Despite Noah's recent difficulties, it was considered a "given" that the promotion could sell out Nippon Budokan for the show, while [[Tokyo Dome]] was deemed "too big of a risk".&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; Kobashi also had significant history with Nippon Budokan.

Kobashi's retirement event received significant coverage in mainstream media in Japan.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; Several magazines ran special editions dedicated entirely to Kobashi.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; The event was streamed into movie theaters across Japan. Every theater in [[Tokyo]] was sold out, most well ahead of time.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; Japan's former prime minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]], who had stated that Kobashi was his favorite wrestler, announced that he would attend the event.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20130509-1124409.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130516233534/http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20130509-1124409.html | script-title=ja:小橋「ありがたい」野田前首相の来場 | archivedate=May 16, 2013 | date=May 9, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
The show was opened by an appearance by [[Hayabusa (wrestler)|Hayabusa]], who had been paralyzed in the ring in 2001. With help from crutches, he walked to the ring and talked about taking a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|lariat]] from Kobashi in Nippon Budokan.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

In the opening match of the show, [[Masanobu Fuchi]] defeated [[Hitoshi Kumano]] with the [[Suplex#Belly-to-back suplex|backdrop]].&lt;ref name=FinalBurninginBudokan/&gt; Fuchi was one of Kobashi's original trainers and the match was designed to show him now, a generation later, training the recently debuted Kumano.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

In the second match, [[Atsushi Kotoge]] and [[Taiji Ishimori]] took on [[Genba Hirayanagi]] and [[Takahiro Suwa|Suwa]]. During the match, former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, who was seated in the front row, took part in a spot, where Hirayanagi recreated a spit spot made famous by [[Haruka Eigen]]. During the match, Suwa suffered a spinal injury and was stretchered out of the arena, after Ishimori pinned Hirayanagi with the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#450° splash|450° splash]] to end the match.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

The third match featured Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki facing [[Kentaro Shiga]] and [[Tamon Honda]]. Aoki and Suzuki had quit Noah in protest over Kobashi's treatment and were now representing AJPW. Honda was Kobashi's training partner for years and at one point his regular tag team partner.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt; The match was billed as "Burning vs. Burning", with Aoki and Suzuki being part of the new Burning stable in AJPW, while Shiga and Honda had been part of the earlier version of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://live.sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/live/fight/all/2013051101/detail/5 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130627162541/http://live.sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/live/fight/all/2013051101/detail/5 | script-title=ja:Final Burning in Budokan 小橋建太引退記念試合 | archivedate=June 27, 2013 | date=May 11, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=Sports Navi | publisher=[[Yahoo!]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aoki and Suzuki won the match with Suzuki pinning Shiga for the win with the ''Endless Waltz''.&lt;ref name=FinalBurninginBudokan/&gt;

After the third match, Kobashi came out to the ring for his retirement ceremony, which was also attended by wrestlers [[Akira Taue]], [[Hiroshi Hase]], [[Masahiro Chono]], [[Masanobu Fuchi]], [[Mitsuo Momota]], [[Takeshi Rikio]] and [[Toshiaki Kawada]] as well as [[Asuka Kuramochi]] from [[AKB48]] and Yoshihiko Noda among others.

The fourth match of the show saw [[Genichiro Tenryu]] and [[Yoshinari Ogawa]] defeat [[Masao Inoue]] and [[Takeshi Morishima]].&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

The fifth match featured the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) trio of [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], [[Satoshi Kojima]] and [[Yuji Nagata]] taking on the Noah trio of [[Akitoshi Saito]], [[Muhammad Yone]] and [[Takashi Sugiura]]. The NJPW wrestlers, Tanahashi in particular, were booed by the Noah crowd. Tanahashi won the match for his team by pinning Saito with the ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|High Fly Flow]]''.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

The sixth match featured the reunion of [[No Fear (professional wrestling)|No Fear]] as [[Takao Omori]] and [[Yoshihiro Takayama]], who had teamed together in both AJPW and Noah, took on [[Minoru Suzuki]] and [[Naomichi Marufuji]]. No Fear won the match with Takayama pinning Marufuji with the ''[[Suplex#German suplex|Everest German Suplex Hold]]''.&lt;ref name=FinalBurninginBudokan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/142225/ | script-title=ja:ノーフィアー２年ぶり復活「チャンスをくれたのは小橋」 | date=May 12, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main event of the show was the retirement match of Kenta Kobashi, where he teamed with Jun Akiyama, Keiji Mutoh and Kensuke Sasaki to take on Go Shiozaki, Kenta, Maybach Taniguchi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. Kobashi came to the ring wearing an old version of the GHC Heavyweight Championship belt. He had not actually held the title since 2005, but was considered both the greatest champion in the title's history as well as the man most synonymous with the title, nicknamed the {{nihongo|"Absolute Champion"|絶対王者|zettai ōja}}. The match featured Kobashi doing several of his signature moves, including the ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Abdominal stretch|Cobra Twist]]'', [[Suplex#Half nelson suplex|half nelson suplex]], [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Cradle|rolling cradle]] and 187 [[Professional wrestling attacks#Backhand chop|chops]]. At the end, he hit Kanemaru with a [[Suplex#Superplex|superplex]] and a lariat, but his pin attempt was broken up by Kanemaru's partners. Akiyama then hit Taniguchi with an [[Suplex#Exploder suplex|exploder suplex]] and Sasaki hit a German suplex on Kenta, while Mutoh hit a [[backbreaker]] and a [[moonsault]] on Kanemaru. Akiyama, Mutoh and Sasaki then all signaled for Kobashi, who hit a [[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]] on Kanemaru and then climbed the ropes for the final moonsault of his career, which won the match for his team.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/142086/ | script-title=ja:プロレスラー小橋建太｢ラストマッチ｣で奇跡の月面水爆 | date=May 12, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20130512-1125965.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130607202751/http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20130512-1125965.html | script-title=ja:小橋“魂の187発”で現役に別れ／ノア | archivedate=June 7, 2013 | date=May 12, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conclusion of the match, the ring and ringside area were filled with wrestlers. Kobashi's wife and mother also came to the ring for his retirement speech. After a [[ten-bell salute]] to signal the end of Kobashi's career, his greatest accomplishments were read out loud after which the event concluded with his theme song "Grand Sword" being played in Nippon Budokan.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://battle-news.com/battle/2013/05/001811.php | script-title=ja:やはり小橋は最後まで"鉄人"だった！まさかの月面水爆で引退試合を締めくくった小橋「プロレスは自分の青春でした」 | date=May 11, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=Battle News | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In June 2014, Kobashi started producing his own independent events under the banner of "Fortune Dream". In addition to putting together the cards, featuring wrestlers from multiple promotions, Kobashi would participate in the shows in sit-down interview segments with fellow veteran wrestlers, including Genichiro Tenryu and [[Riki Choshu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/275452/ | script-title=ja:初プロデュース興行成功の小橋が秋山に協力約束 | date=June 9, 2014 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/344314/ | script-title=ja:＜小橋興行＞天龍の復帰要請に鉄人たじたじ | date=December 11, 2014 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/553182/ | script-title=ja:三沢さんの命日翌日にプロデュース興行 小橋の思い | date=June 15, 2016 | accessdate=September 20, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HLR-FOAM-PARTY-02.JPG|thumb| Dancing at a foam party; the blue object on the ceiling is a foam generator.]]

A '''foam party''' is a social event at which participants dance to music on a dance floor covered in several feet of suds or bubbles, dispensed from a foam machine.

== History ==
Foam parties can be dated back to ''A Rhapsody in Black and Blue'', a 1932 short film directed by [[Aubrey Scotto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|23393|A Rhapsody in Black and Blue}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[Louis Armstrong]] dances, sings, and plays his trumpet in a large area of soap suds. Songs performed in the foam are "I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You" and "Shine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=A Rhapsody in Blue|title=Plot Summary|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023393/plotsummary|date=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another film featuring foam parties is ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foam-party.co.uk/about_foam_parties.php|title=Foam Party - How to organise a foam party and information on running foam parties|website=www.foam-party.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring [[Peter Sellers]].

Modern foam parties were developed in the early 1990s by club promoters in [[Ibiza]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Generally, machines were large, ceiling mounted foam generators, that created a large volume of foam that fell from the ceiling onto clubbers. The large water usage and subsequent cleanup required made this impractical many venues.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

As Ibiza foam parties became more popular the craze spread, and the foam cannon was developed by Roy Barlow from The Entertainment Biz and Robin Wincup from Galaxy. In 1992, this was introduced into the UK, where these were the first machines to meet with all UK health and safety requirements.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

In the 1990s, the foam parties were performed weekly at [[Amnesia_(nightclub)|Amnesia]] in Ibiza.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

== Safety ==
Lisa Flam, writing for ''TODAY'', catalogued numerous hazards associated with foam parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=TODAY|title=HEALTH: 'Foam parties' bubble over with hidden hazards|date=June 6, 2012|author=Flam, Lisa|url=http://www.today.com/health/foam-parties-bubble-over-hidden-hazards-816140}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Yael Levi, writing for Ynet News, reported: in 2008, three people were electrocuted and two others injured at a foam party at the Venezia Palace Hotel in [[Antalya]], Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''G-A-Y''' is a long-running gay [[nightclub]], based at [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] in [[Charing Cross]], [[London]]. It originally started in 1976, and for many years was based at the [[London Astoria]].

==History==
G-A-Y originally began in 1976 in the Sundown club in the basement of the [[London Astoria]] (later LA2) as a Monday night event called ''Bang!''. It was started by club promoters Norman Scott, Damien Tony and Jerry Collins, who worked as a DJ under the name Gary London. During the 1980s, ''Bang!'' (which had by then also expanded to Saturday night) and ''Propaganda'' (Thursday night) were run by gay club promoter and DJ Colin Peters (Peter Daubeney), whose brother Jamie continued as promoter for a period following his death. In the early 1990s, ''Bang!'' was acquired by DJ and promoter Jeremy Joseph who was formerly employed by Peters, who oversaw its change of name to ''G-A-Y''. At this point, G-A-Y expanded further from two nights a week to four - hosting at the LA2 on Mondays and Thursdays and the London Astoria on Fridays and Saturdays.

It operated from the [[London Astoria]] music venue for 15 years until July 2008. The [[Boston Globe]] described it as "London's largest gay-themed club night",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/2004/04/28/london_has_hot_tickets_big_hair_and_a_club_night_for_every_taste/ | title=
London has hot tickets, big hair, and a club night for every taste|date=28 April 2004|work=Boston Globe online}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' reported that it "attracts 6,000 clubbers each week",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/all-saints/3606 |title=Sing If You'Re Glad To Be at G.A.Y.  |work=NME |date=19 June 2000 |accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]]'' described it as "the one London gig that really matters" for "today's pop stars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/why-theyre-all-glad-to-be-gay-584844.html |title=Why they're all glad to be G-A-Y |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 October 2003 |accessdate=3 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

G-A-Y is associated with ''G-A-Y Bar'' and ''G-A-Y Late''. A major stake in the brand was bought on 13 August 2007 by the [[MAMA Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/08/13/music-group-buys-into-g-a-y-bars/ |title=Music group buys into G-A-Y bars |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday 3 October 2008, G-A-Y moved to famous gay venue [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]], which MAMA Group has acquired a few weeks earlier on 22 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/09/25/mama-group-delighted-at-acquisition-of-heaven/ | title =MAMA Group “delighted” at acquisition of Heaven | date= 25 September 2008 | work= PinkNews.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The G-A-Y Album==
{{Main|G-A-Y (album)}}
In 2000, a 40 track compilation album was released, featuring songs from some of the artists who had appeared at G-A-Y. A promotional campaign took place in the weeks leading up to release, including television and radio advertisements, a nationwide poster campaign and magazine advertisements in both the gay and teen press{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

On Saturday 1 July 2000, a show was held at G-A-Y to promote the release of the album. Seven acts who appeared on the album performed. These acts were [[Shola Ama]], [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]], [[Bananarama]], [[Dina Carroll]], [[Billie Piper]], [[Honeyz]] and [[Louise Redknapp|Louise]]. Each act performed only one song, apart from [[Louise Redknapp|Louise]], who also performed her new single "2 Faced".

The G-A-Y album was released on Monday 3 July 2000 and peaked at number 18 in the UK compilations chart{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

==G-A-Y Brand==
The G-A-Y brand has expanded to two other bars in the area. G-A-Y Late (located near the former Astoria site) and G-A-Y bar (located nearby in [[Soho (London)|Soho's]] [[Old Compton Street]]). In April 2011, the G-A-Y brand arrived on Manchester's iconic [[Canal Street (Manchester)|Canal Street]] with a G-A-Y bar opening in the former venue of Spirit Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAY Website|url=http://www.g-a-y.co.uk/Manchester/index.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804025130/http://www.g-a-y.co.uk/Manchester/index.htm|archivedate=4 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is now 100% owned by Jeremy Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;

This is a list of scholarly and international legal definitions of [[genocide]],&lt;ref&gt;Based on a list by Adam Jones {{harv|Jones|2006|pp=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a word coined with ''genos'' (Greek: birth, kind, race) and an English suffix ''-cide'' by Raphael Lemkin in 1944.&lt;ref name=OED-Genocide-1944&gt;Oxford English Dictionary "Genocide" citing Raphael Lemkin ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'' ix. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The precise etymology of the word however, is a compound of the ancient Greek word ''γένος'' (birth, genus, kind) or Latin word ''gēns'' (tribe, clan) and the Latin word ''caedō'' (cut, kill). While there are various definitions of the term, almost all international bodies of law officially adjudicate the crime of genocide pursuant to the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (CPPCG).{{sfn|Dunoff|Ratner|Wippman|2006|pp=615–621}} This and other definitions are generally regarded by the majority of genocide scholars to have an "intent to destroy" as a requirement for any act to be labelled genocide; there is also growing agreement on the inclusion of the physical destruction criterion.{{sfn|Jones|2006|pp=20–21,&amp;nbsp;24}}&lt;!--"There is something of a consensus that group “destruction” must involve physical liquidation"--&gt; Writing in 1998 Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson stated that the CPPCG was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise. As such the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool, and although it is used for this purpose, as it has an international legal credibility that others lack, other definitions have also been postulated. Jonassohn and Björnson go on to say that for various reasons, none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support.{{sfn|Jonassohn|Björnson|1998|pp=133–135}}

|1944||[[Raphael Lemkin]], Polish Jewish [[jurist]]{{sfn|Chalk|1997|p=47}}
|By "genocide" we mean the destruction of an [[ethnic group]]…. Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups….

|The crime of genocide should be recognized therein as a conspiracy to exterminate national, religious or racial groups. The overt acts of such a conspiracy may consist of attacks against life, liberty or property of members of such groups merely because of their affiliation with such groups. The formulation of the crime may be as follows: "Whoever, while participating in a conspiracy to destroy a national, racial or religious group, undertakes an attack against life, liberty or property of members of such groups is guilty of the crime of genocide.

|1975||[[Vahakn Dadrian]], Armenian sociologist
|Genocide is the successful attempt by a dominant group, vested with formal authority and/or with preponderant access to the overall resources of power, to reduce by coercion or lethal violence the number of a minority group whose ultimate extermination is held desirable and useful and whose respective vulnerability is a major factor contributing to the decision for genocide.

|-
|1976||[[Irving Louis Horowitz]], sociologist{{sfn|Chalk|1997|p=48}}
|[Genocide is] a structural and systematic destruction of innocent people by a state bureaucratic apparatus. …Genocide represents a systematic effort over time to liquidate a national population, usually a minority…[and] functions as a fundamental political policy to assure conformity and participation of the citizenry.

|1981||[[Leo Kuper]], genocide scholar{{sfn|Charny|1997|p=64}}
|I shall follow the definition of genocide given in the [UN] Convention. This is not to say that I agree with the definition. On the contrary, I believe a major omission to be in the exclusion of political groups from the list of groups protected. In the contemporary world, political differences are at the very least as significant a basis for massacre and annihilation as racial, national, ethnic or religious differences. Then too, the genocides against racial, national, ethnic or religious groups are generally a consequence of, or intimately related to, political conflict. However, I do not think it helpful to create new definitions of genocide, when there is an internationally recognized definition and a Genocide Convention which might become the basis for some effective action, however limited the underlying conception. But since it would vitiate the analysis to exclude political groups, I shall refer freely…to liquidating or exterminatory actions against them.

|Genocide is the deliberate destruction, in whole or in part, by a government or its agents, of a racial, sexual, religious, tribal or political minority.

|1984||[[Yehuda Bauer]], Israeli historian and Holocaust scholar
|[Genocide is] the planned destruction, since the mid-nineteenth century, of a racial, national, or ethnic group as such, by the following means: (a) selective mass murder of elites or parts of the population; (b) elimination of national (racial, ethnic) culture and religious life with the intent of "denationalization"; (c) enslavement, with the same intent; (d) destruction of national (racial, ethnic) economic life, with the same intent; (e) biological decimation through the kidnapping of children, or the prevention of normal family life, with the same intent…. [Holocaust is] the planned physical annihilation, for ideological or pseudo-religious reasons, of all the members of a national, ethnic, or racial group.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;Adam Jones notes that Bauer distinguishes between "genocide" and "holocaust" {{harv|Jones|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|1987||Tony Barta, historian
|My conception of a genocidal society—as distinct from a genocidal state—is one in which the bureaucratic apparatus might officially be directed to protect innocent people but in which a whole race is nevertheless subject to remorseless pressures of destruction inherent in the very nature of the society.

|-
|1988||[[Helen Fein]], sociologist
|Genocide is a series of purposeful actions by a perpetrator(s) to destroy a collectivity through mass or selective murders of group members and suppressing the biological and social reproduction of the collectivity. This can be accomplished through the imposed proscription or restriction of reproduction of group members, increasing infant mortality, and breaking the linkage between reproduction and socialization of children in the family or group of origin. The perpetrator may represent the state of the victim, another state, or another collectivity. (''Genocide: A Sociological Perspective'', London){{sfn|Kieser|Schaller|2001}}{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=17}}

|1990||John L. P. Thompson and Gail A. Quets
|In short, given the problems which arise from restrictions, we define genocide as the destruction of a group by purposive action.

|2005||Mark Levene, historian
|Genocide occurs when a state, perceiving the integrity of its agenda to be threatened by an aggregate population—defined by the state as an organic collectivity, or series of collectivities—seeks to remedy the situation by the systematic, ''en masse'' physical elimination of that aggregate, ''in toto'', or until it is no longer perceived to represent a threat.{{sfn|Levene|2005|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=96}}

|2016||John Cox, historian
|Genocide is the attempt to destroy any recognized, stable, and permanent group as it is defined by the perpetrator: [It] is a concerted effort to eliminate its individual members and to destroy the group’s ability to maintain its social and cultural cohesion and, thus, its existence as a group. The perpetrators’ genocidal goals -- i.e., intent, which is central to the 1948 UN definition but is often analyzed too legalistically and narrowly -- can be uncovered by examining policies, actions, and outcomes.{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=17}}

The '''Jisha murder case''' was a rape and murder crime that shook the Indian state of [[Kerala]] during April 2016 and it went on to become the most publicized crime case during the Kerala Legislative elections on May 2016.

==Victim background==
'''Jisha''', a 29-year-old law student at the Government Law College, Ernakulam, was found murdered on 28 April 2016 at her home near a canal in Perumbavoor in Ernakulam. She was found dead at her house on 28 April 8.30 pm by her mother Rajeswari. She was living with her mother who works as a casual labourer. Her father, Pappu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2017/11/09/jisha-father-found-dead-at-home-perumbavoor.html|title=Jisha's father found dead at home|work=OnManorama|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, separated from the family was staying alone and found dead on 9 November 2017 due to natural causes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/news/latest-news/2017/11/09/jisha-s-father-pappu-passed-away.html|title=കൊല്ലപ്പെട്ട ജിഷയുടെ പിതാവ് പാപ്പുവിനെ വീട്ടിൽ മരിച്ചനിലയിൽ കണ്ടെത്തി|work=ManoramaOnline|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Police was puzzled in the initial stage with the paranoid mother, a daily wage worker and the dysfunctional family, they also had no close contacts/cordial relationship with the neighbors or relatives, this affected the case's progress initially among other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Jishas-Rape-and-Murder-was-Pre-planned-Say-Police/2016/05/07/article3419593.ece |title=Jisha's Rape and Murder was Pre-planned, Say Police |newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=2016-05-07 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/jishas-killer-was-caught-her-neighbourhood-remained-unmoved-45002 |title=As Jisha’s killer was caught, her neighbourhood remained unmoved |publisher=The News Minute |date=2016-06-17 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
The police found the body mutilated and disturbingly sliced. Forensics concluded the body injuries showed violence, possible torture and presence of alcohol. The report also noted that the culprit had used a sharp weapon to [[disembowel]] her. Jisha was stabbed over 30 times. Her chest was pierced with a dagger. The postmortem conducted at Allappuzha Medical college states that, severe infliction on the neck led to her death.
According to forensic officials, samples of blood and saliva recovered have been sent for examination, and DNA is recorded for matching.  Upon preliminary investigation, the police revealed that Jisha would have been murdered when she resisted the rape attempt. The investigators also probed into migrant workers in the area for any clue on the murder.

==Case impact==
The crime took place in the backdrop of the Kerala Legislative elections, and hence gained momentum and focus from political parties. As a Dalit woman brutally murdered in her home in [[Perumbavoor]], Justice for Jisha was the hashtag (#JusticeForJisha)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/justice-for-jisha-kerala-rape-horror-law-student-perumbavoor-rape-murder.html/ |title=#JusticeForJisha: who are the culprits behind the brutal rape that shocked Kerala?|website=english.manoramaonline.com |date=2016-05-03 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the social media during April 2016 to quicken efforts for justice to Jisha by politicians and largely by people. The film industry also joined forces in demanding justice for Jisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/mollywood-unites-demanding-justice-for-jisha-news-malayalam-qferawahihjdj.html|title=Mollywood unites demanding justice for Jisha|website=Sify|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has declared to offer a [[Solatium|financial consolation]] of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Jisha and a home will be provided for her parents. Also many artists and humanitarians pledged support to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/govt-announces-rs-10-lakh-to-jisha-s-family-english-news-1.1037776 | title = Govt announces Rs 10 lakh for jish's family|website=English.mathrubhumi.com | date = 2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest of murderer==
Through continuous search of the police and involvement of people, the Jisha murder case came through a breakthrough. A citizen hailing from Assam informed his doubts about a worker he knew to the Kerala police; following the lead they picked up the Assamese labourer, and learnt that 24-year-old Ameer-ul-Islam was the culprit and was arrested from Kancheepuram&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/just-in/jisha-murder-case-neighbour-identifies-ameerul-islam.html |title=Jisha murder case: Neighbour identifies Ameerul Islam |website=English.manoramaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tamil Nadu. He admitted committing the gruesome murder of the woman in Perumbavoor. Police found that the crime was motivated by previous grudge and revenge and committed under the influence of alcohol. The alcoholic assailant observed Jisha's routine and waited to sexually assault her; in that effort and rage he killed her and when she asked for water moments before death he gave her alcohol that he had with him. DNA tests conducted, matched and the police also recovered the knife used by the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url =http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/UPDATE-Jisha-murder-suspect-captured-in-Tamil-Nadu/2016/06/16/article3485349.ece | title = Murder Suspected Captured|website=Newindianexpress.com | date = 2016-06-16|accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url =http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/just-in/jisha-murder-suspected-killer-nabbed-kerala-police.html | title = Murder Suspected nabbed |website=English.manoramaonline.com| date = 2016-06-16|accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also suspect Anarul Islam's involvement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/just-in/ameerul-islam-anarul-islam-jisha-kerala-police-murder.html |title=Jisha murder: Kerala police question Ameerul's friend Anarul in Assam |website=English.manoramaonline.com |date=2016-06-20 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a friend of Ameerul Islam who have fled after the murder news. He allegedly escaped from Assam before the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/just-in/jisha-murder-case-ameeruls-friend-anarul-flees-from-assam.html |title=Jisha murder case: Ameerul's friend Anarul flees from Assam |website=English.manoramaonline.com |date=2016-06-20 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing and aftermath==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}For premeditated murders, rape, and the use of disabling violent force, the verdict is usually [[life imprisonment]] or [[death sentence]].

The case also has motivated the government to structure a policy to halt differentiating people overly as men and women, which creates stereotyped societal divide and asked media to regulate depictions of gender-negative stereotypes to cultivate [[gender equity]], lessen the crimes as a long-term plan to a certain extent and to regulate [[yellow journalism]] in forms of discussions and unnecessary probings through media, primarily to minimize the impact of trauma. This case also made the government to actively saddle on the implementation of alcohol prohibition in a phased manner.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2017/12/13/beastly-brutality-on-jisha-s-body-led-cops-to-migrant-laborer-am.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Ernakulam principal district and sessions court on Thursday 14 December 2017 life term imprisonment was awarded to Muhammed Ameer ul-Islam, an Assam native, in the sensational Jisha rape and murder case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2017/12/13/jisha-rape-and-murder-ameer-ul-islam-kochi-court-kerala.html Jisha Murder Case Verdict]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kerry Babies''' case was a 1984 investigation by the  [[Garda Síochána]] in [[County Kerry]], Ireland, into the killing of one newborn baby and the alleged killing of another. The mother who [[concealing birth|concealed]] the second baby, Joanne Hayes, was arrested and charged with the [[murder]] of the first baby, of which she was erroneously thought to be the mother. The Gardaí were forced to drop the charges four years later and a [[Public inquiries in the Republic of Ireland|tribunal of inquiry]] (the "Kerry Babies Tribunal") was launched. Its report was critical of the Garda conduct of the investigations, and also concluded that Hayes had precipitated the death of her baby. Hayes has disputed this finding, and no charges were pressed. The parents and killer of the first baby have never been identified.

==Events==
On 14 April 1984, a newborn baby boy was found dead of 28 stab wounds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36814502|title=Cosmic trigger. Volume II, Down to earth|last=1932-2007.|first=Wilson, Robert Anton,|date=1996|publisher=New Falcon Publications|isbn=1561840114|edition=(Rev. 2nd ed.)|location=Scottsdale, AZ, U.S.A.|oclc=36814502}}&lt;/ref&gt; on White Strand beach at [[Caherciveen]], [[County Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryman.ie/news/grim-discovery-one-of-three-in-seven-years-829076.html|title=Grim discovery one of three in seven years|publisher=Kerryman.ie|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman, Joanne Hayes from [[Abbeydorney]], approximately 80 kilometres away, was known to have been pregnant, was arrested and she and her family confessed to the murder of the baby. However, they later withdrew their confessions and admitted instead that Hayes' baby had been born on the family farm, had died shortly after birth, and had been wrapped in a plastic bag and buried on the farm in secret. Tests showed that the baby whose body was found on the farm had the same blood type – O – as Hayes and its (married) father, Jeremiah Locke. However, the baby on the beach had blood group A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerry babies recap|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/kerry-babies-recap-explained-3799984-Jan2018/|publisher=The Journal|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/kerry-babies-case-to-be-reviewed-based-on-new-evidence-1.3357151|title=‘Kerry babies’ case to be reviewed based on new evidence|last=Roche|first=Barry|date=16 January 2018|work=Irish Times|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gardaí nevertheless insisted that Hayes had become pregnant simultaneously by two different men (through [[heteropaternal superfecundation]]) and had given birth to both children, killing the one found on the beach. Another theory put forward was that the baby's blood type had changed due to decomposition.&lt;ref name="ThisGreatLittleNation"&gt;Gene Kerrigan and Pat Brennan (1999). ''This Great Little Nation''. Gill &amp; Macmillan, pp. 177-178. {{ISBN|0-7171-2937-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayes was charged with murder but the charge was thrown out by a judge, and the Kerry Babies Tribunal, headed by Mr Justice Kevin Lynch, was set up to investigate the behaviour of the Gardaí in the case. Judge Lynch found that Joanne Hayes killed the baby on the farm by choking it to stop it crying, in spite of state [[pathologist]] Dr John Harbison being unable to determine the cause of death.&lt;ref name="ThisGreatLittleNation"/&gt; Judge Lynch rejected claims by the Hayes family that they had been assaulted by Gardaí, or that the [[Confession (law)|confession]]s were obtained through coercion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/views/kerry-babies-judging-wrongs-of-horror-ordeal-823363.html&lt;/ref&gt; Joanne Hayes had claimed that Gardaí slapped, threatened, and coerced her into making a [[false confession]], and other family members had alleged that Gardaí used harassment and physical intimidation to get false confessions.&lt;ref name="Maguire"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://idesweb.bc.edu/isr/system/files/Maguire_ChangingFace.pdf |format=PDF |title= The changing face of Catholic Ireland: Conservatism and liberalism in the Ann Lovett and Kerry Babies scandals |last=Maguire |first=Moira J |journal=Feminist Studies |publisher=University of Maryland |location=College Park |volume=27 |number=2 |date=Summer 2001 |pages=335–358 |accessdate=15 February 2013 |quote=The day after the charges were dropped, the Hayes family lodged complaints against gardai involved in the investigation.

==Repercussions==
The case raised serious questions about the culture of the [[Garda Síochána]], and the treatment of unmarried mothers in Irish society. Journalist [[Nell McCafferty]]'s book about the case was titled ''A Woman to Blame''. Joanne Hayes co-wrote a book with John Barrett about the episode called ''My Story''. Four gardaí on the case took legal action against the authors and publishers of the book, as well as shops that sold it. They received out-of-court settlements totalling over €127,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=529554&amp;issue_id=5421 "Detective calls for DNA analysis to settle Kerry Babies case"]. ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', 28 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2005/06/03/story57830747.asp "Senior officer was linked to all tribunals into garda behaviour"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310230518/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2005/06/03/story57830747.asp |date=10 March 2007 }}. ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', 3 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the case the murder squad was disbanded, and the four gardaí assigned to desk duties, in what was seen as a demotion. In 2004, Joanne Hayes offered to undergo a [[DNA]] test to establish that she was not the mother of the baby on the beach. However, one of the officers on the case, Gerry O'Carroll, also sought such a test, saying that he believed the tests will prove the superfecundation theory correct. 

The parents or killer of the baby on the beach, later named "Baby John", have never been identified. The gravesite has been repeatedly vandalised, but no suspect has ever been identified for this either.&lt;ref name="Gravesite vandalism"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh hope for solving thirty year old mystery of Kerry Babies|url=http://evoke.ie/news/irish-news/fresh-hope-for-solving-thirty-year-old-mystery-of-kerry-babies|newspaper=Evoke.ie|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case Review ==
A Garda review of the DNA evidence, announced on 16 January 2018, confirmed that Joanne Hayes was not the mother of the infant found at White Strand.&lt;ref name="Case"/&gt; Irish national media reported that Acting [[Garda Commissioner]] Dónall Ó Cualáin offered a full verbal and written apology to Joanne Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/garda-apologise-to-joanne-hayes-for-stress-and-pain-of-kerry-babies-investigation-36494480.html|title=Gardaí apologise to Joanne Hayes for 'stress and pain' of Kerry Babies investigation|last=O'Sullivan|first=Majella|date=16 January 2018|work=Irish Independent|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an apology from the [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]], [[Charles Flanagan|Charlie Flanagan]] and the [[Taoiseach]], [[Leo Varadkar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/kerry-babies-taoiseach-tanaiste-and-minister-for-justice-apologise-to-joanne-hayes-823234.html|title=Kerry Babies: Taoiseach apologises to Joanne Hayes and is open to discussing compensation with her|last=O'Cionnaith|first=Fiachra|date=17 January 2018|work=Irish Examiner|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A new investigation into the circumstances of Baby John's death was also launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/garda-to-seek-dna-samples-from-locals-in-hunt-for-kerry-baby-killer-36497087.html|title=Gardaí to seek DNA samples from locals in hunt for Kerry baby killer|last=O'Sullivan|first=Majella|date=17 January 2018|work=Irish Independent|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/murder-inquiry-launched-into-death-of-baby-john-in-kerry-in-1984-1.3358121|title=Murder inquiry launched into death of ‘Baby John’ in Kerry in 1984|last=Roche|first=Barry|date=17 January 2018|work=Irish Times|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2018 it was reported that Gardaí were following up on aspects of the original investigation and engaged in house-to-house inquiries on Valentia Island (the island opposite the beach on which Baby John was discovered), as “part of the general investigation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/kerry-babies-garda%C3%AD-start-house-to-house-enquiries-on-valentia-1.3639467|title=Kerry Babies: gardaí start house-to-house enquiries on Valentia|last=Lucey|first=Anne|date=24 September 2018|website=Irish Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8204">'''Korean textbook controversy''' refers to controversial content in [[Government of South Korea|government]]-approved [[history]] textbooks used in the [[secondary education]] (high schools) in [[South Korea]]. The controversies primarily concern portrayal of [[North Korea]] and the description of the regime of the South Korean president and dictator [[Park Chung-hee]].

==Historical context==
The controversy's origins can be traced at least to 2013, when the South Korea's [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]] instructed publishers to revise their history textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Korea's History Textbook Controversy|url = http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/south-koreas-history-textbook-controversy/|website = The Diplomat|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the South Korean [[National Institute of Korean History]] announced plans to replace existing history textbooks in high schools with one authorized version by March 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A textbook war divides South Korea|url = http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1022-kirk-south-korea-textbook-controversy-20151022-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state-issued textbooks are to be written by a government-appointed panel of experts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Korea accused of rewriting history over schoolbook policy|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/03/south-korea-accused-rewriting-history-schoolbook-policy|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-24|first = Agence|last = France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the larger context, this controversy is a part of an ongoing dispute on whether the state should control the content of history textbooks, and possibly enforce a monopoly, or whether individual schools (or teachers) should be free to choose their own textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chosun Ilbo "Debates" the Production of History|url = http://sinonk.com/2013/11/10/chosun-ilbo-debates-the-production-of-history/|website = Sino-NK|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea used to have a state control over textbooks until the rules were relaxed in 2003 leading to the appearance of several competing textbooks used since, particularly since 2010.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Existing textbooks have been criticized by the government as well as by the Korean right or conservative side for being too positive on North Korean topics, and for "liberal, left-leaning" bias.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Textbook controversy is over competing forms of nationalist history|url = https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/11/633_190233.html|website = koreatimes|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea to Issue State History Textbooks, Rejecting Private Publishers|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/world/asia/south-korea-to-issue-state-history-textbooks-rejecting-private-publishers.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-10-12|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0362-4331|first = Choe|last = Sang-hun}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the left, also described as liberals and progressives, represented among others by ''[[The Hankyoreh]]'' newspaper, are critical of the changes such as removing any mentions of the [[Geochang massacre]] and excluding photos of the first [[Inter-Korean summit|North–South summit]], which they have described as biased towards a conservative view of history and the state that lends legitimacy to the pre-democratic, authoritarian, conservative governments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In particular, the regime of Park Chung-hee, the father of the current Korean president, [[Park Geun-hye]], is seen by liberals as given a "white-wash" treatment by the new revisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea set to rewrite history books|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/b073fa02-70af-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html#axzz3pfVjfFrq|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2015-10-12|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0307-1766|first = Simon|last = Mundy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservatives rebuke that the current textbooks describe Park Chung-hee and his predecessor, [[Rhee Syng-man]], in an excessively negative manner.&lt;ref name=ko2/&gt; Other controversial topics involve the framing of the pro-democratic protests against Park's regime,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or the inclusion of the story of Korean teenage heroine [[Yu Gwan-sun]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A high school heroine has South Koreans fighting over history textbooks|url = http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-south-korea-textbook-battle-20151105-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberals had also criticized the action on the grounds that the government control over textbooks is limiting freedom of speech and spreading propaganda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of October 22, 2015, a petition against the new textbook reform had over 50,000 signatures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The government has also been facing several lawsuits, including one by the current textbook authors who accuse the government of [[Defamation|libel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ko2&gt;{{Cite web|title = (News Focus) History textbook controversy evolves into academic, ideological conflict - The Korea Observer|url = http://www.koreaobserver.com/news-focus-history-textbook-controversy-evolves-into-academic-ideological-conflict-55659/|website = The Korea Observer|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has been described as controversial, and has led to public protests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over 400 Korean history professors have expressed their opposition to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea fights old battles with new history textbooks|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c48c9082-7bd4-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html#axzz3sOXQ9CeC|newspaper = Financial Times|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0307-1766|first = Simon|last = Mundy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Korea, the proposal has been criticized by over 200 professors of [[Korean studies]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An opinion poll showed the Korean public opinion divided into approximately 50% against the new textbook plan, and 36% in favor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Several commentators compared this to the [[comfort women]] issue, noting that with the recent government interference into the content of history books, South Korea is losing its moral high ground from which it previously criticized the Japanese government for [[Japanese history textbook controversies|its perceived historical textbook problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea fights old battles with new history textbooks|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c48c9082-7bd4-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html|newspaper = Financial Times|access-date = 2015-11-27|issn = 0307-1766|first = Simon|last = Mundy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = [Reporter's column] S.

The name of the festival is derived from an appellation in [[Ewe language|Ewe]] which is "''Kpalikpakpa si tu makpata''" which means "shooting without recording". The festival is meant to remind the Kpalime people of the valour of their ancestors during wars in the ancient days.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=2839 |title=Kpalime Celebrate Kpalikpakpa Festival |accessdate=2011-09-17 |date=1997-11-05 |publisher=Ghana Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was first held in November 1997 and has been held every year since then. The paramount chief of the area at the time was Togbe Agbi Yao VII. The first festival was at [[Wegbe Kpalime]]. It has been rotated between the towns in the district since then.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; The eighth celebration was hosted at [[Kpale Kpalime|Kpale]] in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/economy/artikel.php?ID=67513 |title=Chiefs and people of Kpalime launch festival |accessdate=2011-09-17 |date=2004-10-11 |publisher=Ghana Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th edition of the festival was celebrated in November 2012 at Kaira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaira Hosts 17th Annual KPALIKPAKPA ZÃ (Festival)|url=http://www.kpalimegh.netii.net/index.php?news&amp;nid=1_17TH-ANNUAL-KPALIKPAKPA-Z-FESTIVAL|publisher=Kpalimegh.netii.net|accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dick Reavis, "The mine's operator had failed, as laws require, to map the tunnels that his men made. Their pneumatic [[Pickaxe|pick]]s struck into the flooded tunnel of an abandoned mine, and they were helpless as the water rose because the motor on the pocito's only [[winch]] - the winch that raises and lowers the bote - wouldn't come to life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3720/is_200303/ai_n9187375 findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''La Paz incident''' occurred on May 20, 1863 at the mining town of [[La Paz, Arizona|La Paz]], [[Arizona]], and was the westernmost armed confrontation of the [[American Civil War]]. William "Frog" Edwards, only recently released from detention at [[Fort Yuma]], ambushed a party of unarmed Union soldiers when they stopped at La Paz to purchase supplies. Edwards' attack killed one soldier instantly and left another mortally wounded. Edwards then fled into the desert where he died of exposure and dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;Masich, pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
After the Confederates established their own Arizona Territory at [[Mesilla, New Mexico]], in February 1862, the Union sent the [[California Column]] east to reinforce the [[Union Army]] engaged in the [[New Mexico Campaign]]. Confederate cavalry briefly occupied Tucson from February 28 until early May 1862, but withdrew soon after the skirmmish at [[Picacho Peak]]. The following year [[General]] [[James H. Carleton]] arrested several California secessionists bound for Texas and detained them at [[Fort Yuma]]; William "Frog" Edwards was one of these detainees. La Paz was one of a handful of mining settlements that had been established along the [[Colorado River]]. It was situated along an important army supply route that had been in use since the [[Yuma War]]. The army used the Colorado River to supply garrisons in Arizona. On the evening of May 20, 1863, the Colorado River steamer ''Cocopah'' arrived at La Paz en route to [[Fort Mohave, Arizona|Fort Mohave]]. A small party of soldiers, under the command of Lieutenant James A. Hale of the [[4th California Infantry]], disembarked to purchase supplies at Cohn's Store.&lt;ref&gt;Masich, pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Lurking in the shadows was William "Frog" Edwards, only recently released from jail at Fort Yuma. As the soldiers approached the store, Edwards opened fire with his revolver. Private Ferdinand Behn was killed instantly, Private Truston Wentworth was mortally wounded and died the following day, Private Thomas Gainor was severely wounded, but recovered. One bystander was also struck and suffered a serious wound. Lieutenant Hale immediately searched the town with his remaining men but did not find Edwards. Lieutenant Hale returned to Fort Yuma aboard the ''Cocopah'' with his dead and wounded the following day. In response to Edwards' attack, a troop of forty men was deployed to hunt him down. Edwards was found several days later in the desert, where he apparently died of exposure and dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;Masich, pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''latent human error''' is a [[human error]] which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors. Latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention, especially in [[aviation]].

By gathering data about errors made, then collating, grouping and analyzing them, it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made. If this is the case, a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems/routines and human nature or [[Propensity probability|propensities]]. The routines or systems can then be analyzed, potential problems identified, and amendments made if necessary, in order to prevent future errors, incidents or accidents.

'''Games with concealed rules''' are [[game]]s where the [[Game#Rules|rules]] are intentionally concealed from new players, either because their discovery is part of the game itself, or because the game is a hoax and the rules do not exist. In fiction, the counterpart of the first category are games that supposedly do have a rule set, but that rule set is not disclosed.

==Actual games==

===Discovery games===
* [[Eleusis (card game)|Eleusis]]: A card game in which one player secretly decides on a rule which determines which cards may be played on top of each other. The other players then use deductive logic to work out the secret rule.
* [[Haggle (game)|Haggle]]: A party game in which the [[Gamemaster]] divides a set of cards and a subset of the full rules among players and allows them to trade for other cards and rules. 
* [[Mao (card game)|Mao]]: A [[Shedding-type game|shedding-type]] card game where the winner of a round adds a concealed rule of their choice to all subsequent rounds.
* [[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]: A [[tabletop role-playing game]] in which the rules are considered "classified". Only the [[Gamemaster]] has full knowledge of the rules, while other players must deduce them by trial and error as they proceed through the game. (The game acknowledges that players may read the gamemaster section, but ''demonstrating'' knowledge of the rules is considered treasonous, and the gamemaster may also make arbitrary changes.)
*[[Penultima]]: A chess variant in which the spectators make secret rules governing how the pieces move and capture. The two players are unaware of the rules and must discover them by inductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fryers |first1=Michael |year=1998 |title=Penultima |journal=[[Variant Chess]] |volume=3 |issue=28 |pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scissors (game)|Scissors]]: A party game in which a pair of scissors is passed between players, with the passer declaring that they are being passed "open" or "closed" based on an individual and secret rule. The other players must use observation to deduce the rule each player uses to make the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/326383402.html?dids=326383402:326383402&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+15%2C+1899&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=TWO+JOLLY+GAMES%2C |title= Two Jolly Games, A Noisy Play Imported From Peru and 'The Spider And The Fly' |date= October 15, 1899 |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hofmann |first= Mary Christina |title= Games for Everybody |publisher= Dodge Publishing |location= New York |year= 1905 |url= https://archive.org/stream/games10/games10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whose Triangle Is It?: A party game in which one player points to three people or objects, forming an imaginary triangle, and then asks "Whose triangle is it?" The triangle belongs to the person closest to the closest object of a similar color to the color of second point of the triangle, but this rule is not told to new players, and the game is for new players to figure out what the rule is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yarps.org/resources/games/mind-games/ |title= Mind Games |work= Yarps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Outbound Training |url= http://www.slideshare.net/outboundtraining/team-building-games-outbound-training |title= Team Building Games &amp; Activities |publisher= Slide Share}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]]: A game in which one player creates a rule for structures to follow and the other players try to discover the rule by building structures
* [[Snaps (game)]]: A game in which a player spells out a name using finger snapping and verbal cues.  Featured in [[P.S. I Love You (film)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Snaps|title=How to Play Snaps.|publisher=WikiHow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax or joke games===
* [[52 Pickup]]: A card game in which dealer scatters the cards on the floor and non-dealer must pick them up.
* [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]]: Originally a round in the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/|publisher= BBC |title= I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue: A History |accessdate= July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of each panelist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The apparent aim is to be the first to announce "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern Line. Despite appearances, however, there are no rules to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of "rules" are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation. Thus the game is intentionally incomprehensible.

==Games in works of fiction==

===Games with undisclosed rules===
* [[43-Man Squamish]]: ''MAD Magazine'' published an article outlining a college sport designed to be unplayable. The sport features a pentagonal field, silly-sounding terms and a dummy on each team.
* [[Calvinball]]: In the comic series ''[[Calvin &amp; Hobbes]]'', ''Calvinball'' is a game regularly played by the main characters. The only consistent rule of ''Calvinball'' is that "Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice".
* [[Double Fanucci]]: Featured in the computer game [[Zork Zero]], ''Double Fanucci'' has mind-bogglingly complex "rules". Legal play can depend on things like the phase of the Moon and the ancestry of the players.
* [[Dragon Poker]]: A fictional card game by [[Robert Asprin]] in the [[MythAdventures]] series. The rules change depending on weather, seating position, time of day, and other undisclosed modifiers.

The '''Livret A''' is a historic financial product offered by [[List of banks in France|French banks]]. Established in 1818 by King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] to pay back the debts incurred during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], part of the funds are now transferred to and re-invested by the [[Caisse des dépôts et consignations]], owned by the French state, to build [[HLM]], or social housing, and pay back the [[Eurozone debt crisis|Eurozone debt]]. The remaining funds are used by banks to give loans to French [[small and medium-sized enterprises]]. The product acts as a [[savings account]] for French citizens and residents, and the annual returns are not taxed. In 2012, it was owned by 60 million individuals, for a total amount of 220,8 billion Euros.

==Early history==
The Livret A was established in 1818 by King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] to pay back the debts incurred during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"&gt;Mathias Thépot, [http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/banques-finance/industrie-financiere/20120222trib000684383/ou-va-vraiment-l-argent-du-livret-a-.html Où va vraiment l'argent du Livret A ?], ''[[La Tribune]]'', February 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lepointmarc"&gt;Marc Vignaud, [http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-economie/2008-10-01/comprendre-comment-le-livret-a-finance-le-logement-social/916/0/278581 COMPRENDRE - Comment le livret A finance le logement social], ''[[Le Point]]'', October 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The funds are held and re-invested through the [[Caisse des dépôts et consignations]], founded in 1816.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt;

In the 19th century, the funds were used to build railroad tracks and canals throughout France.&lt;ref name="lepointmarc"/&gt; Between World War I and World War II, it was used to install electricity in rural France.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt;

Since 1945, it has mostly been used to build social housing.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt;

==Investments==
Part of the funds are invested through the Caisse des dépôts et consignations, which is fully owned by the French state.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; In 2011, a decree issued by the Prime Minister suggested that French banks had to transfer 60% of all funds from the Livrets A to the Caisse des dépôts.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; Prior to the decree, [[La Banque Postale]] was the only bank to transfer 100% of all funds from the Livret A to the Caisse des dépôts, while the [[Groupe Caisse d'Épargne]] transferred 80%.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; Commercial banks like the [[Société Générale]] or the [[Crédit Agricole]] only transferred between 20% and 30%.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; All French banks have by 2022 to transfer 60% to the Caisse des dépôts.

Through the Caisse des dépôts, the funds are mostly used to build new social housing known as [[HLM]].&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; They are also used to pay back the [[Eurozone debt crisis|Eurozone debt]].&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; They are also used to strengthen the collateral of French banks, and to give loans to French [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] and territorial entities (like towns, [[Departments of France|departments]], etc.).&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; Finally, the funds are invested in [[Bond credit rating|AAA and BBB-rated]] stocks and Treasury bonds.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lepointmarc"/&gt;

The remaining funds are used by banks to give loans to French [[small and medium-sized enterprises]].&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt;

==Recent years==
The product was only offered by [[La Banque Postale]] and the [[Groupe Caisse d'Épargne]] as of 2008.&lt;ref name="lepointmarc"/&gt; Since January 2009, it has been offered by all French banks.&lt;ref name="lepointmarc"/&gt;

As of 2015, only one account may be held by an individual, with an amount from 10 Euros to 22,950 Euros.&lt;ref name="servicepublic"&gt;[http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F2365.xhtml Service Public: Épargne : livret A]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[French presidential election, 2012]], [[François Hollande]], who was elected as the President of France, announced his intention to raise the individual amount to 30,600 Euros to build 150,000 new [[HLM]]s.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="challenges"&gt;[http://www.challenges.fr/economie/20120716.CHA9056/les-hlm-rappellent-a-l-ordre-hollande-sur-le-doublement-du-plafond-dulivret-a.html Les HLM rappellent à l'ordre Hollande sur le doublement du plafond duLivret A], ''[[Challenges (magazine)|Challenges]]'', July 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 46 million French citizens or residents owned a Livret A, for a total amount of 128,1 billion Euros in late 2007.&lt;ref name="lepointmarc"/&gt; As of January 2012, 60 million owned one, for a total amount of 220,8 billion Euros.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt;

The annual [[rate of return]] went down slightly in recent years. In 2010, it has an annual rate of return of 4%. In January 2012, it had an annual [[rate of return]] of 2,25%.&lt;ref name="latribunemathias"/&gt; By 2015, it had fallen to 1%.&lt;ref name="servicepublic"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''Madge Augustine Oberholtzer''' (November 10, 1896 &amp;ndash; April 14, 1925) was an American woman whose rape and murder played a critical role in the demise of the second incarnation of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In March 1925, while working for the state of [[Indiana]] on an adult literacy campaign, she was kidnapped by [[D. C. Stephenson]], [[Grand Dragon]] of the [[Indiana Klan]]. Holding her captive in his private train car, he raped and tortured her. She died from a combination of a [[staphylococcal infection]] from her injuries and [[renal failure|kidney failure]] from [[mercury chloride]] poisoning, which she took while held captive in an attempt to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Linder"&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/stephenson/atatevstprosecution.html Daniel O. Linder, "D.C. Stephenson"], Testimony, ''Famous Trials'', hosted at University of Missouri Law School, Kansas City&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the suicide attempt, Stephenson's men returned Oberholtzer to her home, assuming her injuries would soon prove fatal and believing their influential leader was immune to any prosecution. However, his victim regained consciousness long enough to give a signed statement to police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/stephenson/dyingdeclaration.html Dying Declaration of Madge Oberholtzer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She described Stephenson's assaults which led to his conviction at trial and led to the rapid decline of KKK membership in Indiana.

==Early life==
Born to [[German Americans|German-American]] parents, Oberholtzer grew up in [[Indianapolis]],&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; where her father worked as a postal clerk and her family belonged to the Irvington Methodist Church.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; She studied English, mathematics, zoology and logic at [[Butler University|Butler College]] in [[Irvington Historic District (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Irvington]], but dropped out at the end of her junior year without saying why.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; Through her life, Oberholtzer lived with her parents in the Irvington area of Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; By the time she met Stephenson, she was the manager of the Indiana Young People's Reading Circle, a special section of the Indiana Department of Public Instruction.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; However, she heard rumors that her job and the Reading Circle program were about to be eliminated due to budget cuts.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt;

==Chronology of the murder==
Oberholtzer met her murderer while attending Indiana Governor [[Edward L. Jackson]]'s inauguration party at the Athletic Club&lt;ref name=made5232&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/stephenson/dyingdeclaration.html The Dying Declaration Of Madge Oberholtzer: The Key Evidence In The 1925 Trial Of D. C. Stephenson, From ''My Indiana'' by Irving Liebowitz (1964) (pp.195-203)]&lt;/ref&gt; on January 12, 1925.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; In her dying statement, Oberholtzer said Stephenson asked her for a date several times after the banquet, but she refused.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; However, she eventually agreed and they had dinner together.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; Following that date, Stephenson called Oberholtzer on the phone several times. She finally agreed to meet him for dinner at the [[Hotel Washington (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Washington Hotel]] in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;

They began seeing each other more frequently,&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; and she acted as his aide during the 1925 session of the [[Indiana General Assembly]],&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; carrying messages from his office to his friends.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; She also helped him write a nutrition book, "One Hundred Years of Health".&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; Using her Reading Circle connections, she intended to help him sell the book to school libraries throughout the state.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; However, she ended her relationship with him after attending a party at his mansion. They would not meet again until Sunday, March 15.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;

About 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day, Oberholtzer returned home after an evening with a friend.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; Her mother told her that Stephenson's secretary had called&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; and said he was leaving for Chicago. He wanted her to call him before he left.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; She called Stephenson, and he told her he would try to protect the Reading Circle program and her job if she agreed to see him.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; She changed into a black velvet dress,&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; and a bodyguard she named as "Mr Gentry" arrived and escorted her to Stephenson's mansion a few blocks away.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; When she arrived, Stephenson, his chauffeur,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Gentry, and another bodyguard Oberholtzer named as "Clenck" took her into the kitchen and forced her to drink whiskey until she became sick.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; The four men then took her upstairs, and Stephenson took a revolver from a dresser drawer and forced her to approach him at gunpoint.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;

Oberholtzer said the men took her to the garage and forced her into Stephenson's car.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Before they left, Stephenson told Clenck to stay behind and tell his associate Claude Worley that he was going to Chicago for a business meeting.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; When they reached the railroad station, Stephenson and Gentry forced Oberholtzer onto Stephenson's private train to [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; No sooner had they entered the train's compartment coach,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; than Stephenson grabbed the bottom of her dress and pulled it over her head.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; He then grabbed her hands, tore off the rest of her clothes,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; pushed her into the lower bed, and raped her repeatedly. He also bit her all over her body.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;  Oberholtzer was still intoxicated and unable to resist.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;

She finally passed out, after her attacker. Upon waking she said, "The law will get their hands on you!" Because his Klan connections gave him tremendous political power, Stephenson laughed and replied, "I am the law in Indiana." An examination of her body later revealed deep bite wounds were on her face, neck, breasts, back, legs, ankles, and tongue.&lt;ref name=madgedeath&gt;[http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2012/08/murder-wasnt-very-pretty-the-rise-and-fall-of-d-c-stephenson/#ixzz2T15QT5Fc "Murder Wasn't Very Pretty": The Rise and Fall of D.C. Stephenson, August 30, 2012, Smithsonian.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the assault, Gentry and Stephenson dressed Oberholtzer and told her they would be stopping in [[Hammond, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Stephenson and Oberholtzer, assisted by Gentry, checked into the Indiana Hotel. Stephenson forced her to say she was his wife so they could share the same room.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Stephenson forced her to write a telegram to her mother, saying she had decided to go to Chicago with him.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;  While Stephenson was sleeping,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Oberholtzer grabbed his revolver to kill herself,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; but changed her mind,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; fearing it would dishonor her mother.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Instead, she decided to commit suicide by taking poison.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;  The next morning, she convinced Stephenson to call Shorty{{fix|title=who?|date=August 2017}} and tell him to come to the hotel so she could purchase a black silk hat.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt;

She bought the hat,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; then asked Shorty to drive her to a drug store to buy some [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]].&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; She bought an entire box of [[mercuric chloride]] tablets.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Oberholtzer returned to her room, but was still weakened from her wounds Stephenson had inflicted on her and only managed to swallow six tablets.&lt;ref name=madgedeath /&gt; She vomited blood throughout the remainder of the day.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; Stephenson insisted that he would not take her to a hospital unless she agreed to go to a nearby chapel and marry him,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; However, he panicked and ordered Shorty{{fix|title=who?|date=August 2017}} to drive them back to Indianapolis as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; When he was asked what had happened, a bodyguard said she had been in a car accident.

Oberholtzer's parents immediately called a doctor, but there was nothing that could be done to save her. On March 28, she told what had happened to her in a signed statement.&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; She died on April 14, 1925 from a staph infection from the bites, plus kidney failure from the mercury poisoning. She was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Indianapolis.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Trial===
Stephenson was indicted on charges of rape and second-degree murder. The doctor who had examined Oberholtzer testified that the injuries she received were sufficient to have killed her, as her wounds developed an infection that reached her lungs and kidneys." &lt;ref name="Linder"/&gt;

Stephenson's attorney claimed Oberholtzer had committed [[suicide]], saying the rapist could not have anticipated her behavior. The prosecution countered that based on medical testimony, prompt medical attention might have saved her life. During the closing statements, the prosecutor decried Stephenson as a "destroyer of virtue and womanhood". The jury found him guilty of [[Murder#Degrees of murder|second degree murder]], rape, and kidnapping, and the court sentenced him to life in prison. The State Supreme Court rejected his appeal.&lt;ref name="Linder"/&gt; This case is still taught in law schools as showing an enlargement of the causal relationships that define homicide.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Stephenson v. State'', 205 Ind. 141, 179 N.E. 633 (1932).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
The brutal attack on Madge Oberholtzer so outraged most members of the Klan that entire lodges quit ''en masse'', and membership dropped by the tens of thousands. The scandal destroyed the KKK in Indiana, and in the following two years, the Indiana KKK lost more than 178,000 members, nearly disappearing.

Denied a pardon in 1926, Stephenson started talking to the ''[[Indianapolis Times]]'', giving the names of officials who had accepted bribes and payments from the Klan. The ''Times'' investigated the Klan in the state.  The state finally indicted several high-ranking officials, including Governor [[Edward L. Jackson|Ed Jackson]] and the head of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]]. Other local officials resigned when facing charges. The ''Times'' investigation revealed widespread political corruption, which helped destroy the Klan in Indiana and nationwide. By February 1928, Indiana Klan rosters had dropped to just 4,000, from a peak of more than 250,000 members in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianahistory.org/library/manuscripts/collection_guides/m0264.html "D.C. Stephenson Collection, 1922-1978"], Indiana Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson was paroled on March 23, 1950, but he violated the conditions of his parole by disappearing around September 25, 1950. He was captured in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] on 15 December, and was ordered by the court in 1951 to serve another 10 years. He was paroled on December 22, 1956, on the condition that he leave Indiana and never return.

In 1961, Stephenson was arrested in Tennessee at age 70 on charges of sexually assaulting a sixteen-year-old girl. However, the charges were dropped on grounds of insufficient evidence. He died 5 years later in 1966.

'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 2002''' was the selection for the 42nd song to represent [[Sweden]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was the 41st time that this system of picking a song had been used. Five semi-finals had taken place to select the ten songs for the final, in [[Växjö]], [[Norrköping]], [[Sundsvall]], [[Falun]] and a Second Chance round in [[Stockholm]]. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1]] and [[Sveriges Radio]]'s [[Sveriges Radio P4|P4]] network. The introduction of the semi-finals and the allowance of songs in English resulted in a marked increase in voters. The final was watched by 3,720,000 people, with 926,318 votes cast in the final.

==Semi-finals==
The semi-finals for Melodifestivalen 2002 began on 19 January 2002. Ten songs from these semi-finals qualified for the final on 1 March 2002. This was the first year that a semi-final format had been used for the competition. This was the first year that songs were permitted in languages other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]], resulting in a significant number of [[English language]] songs, and two songs with lyrics in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. "Ett vackert par", composed by Py Bäckman and Micke Wennborn was disqualified before the competition, when the dance band Grönwalls had performed it on the radio before the contest (not knowing it was supposed to enter). Nanne Grönvall and Nick Borgen was thought as possible performers. It was replaced by "[[Sista andetaget]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4829">A '''money mule''', sometimes called a "smurfer," is a person who [[Money laundering|transfers money acquired illegally]] (e.g., stolen) in person, through a courier service, or electronically, on behalf of others. Typically, the mule is paid for services with a small part of the money transferred. Money mules are often dupes recruited on-line for what they think is legitimate employment, not aware that the money they are transferring is the product of crime. The money is transferred from the mule's account to the scam operator, typically in another country. Similar techniques are used to transfer illegal merchandise.

Mules recruited online are typically used to transfer the proceeds from online fraud, such as [[phishing]] scams, [[malware]] scams or scams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tehrani|first1=Rich|title=FBI: Beware New Email Scam|url=http://www.apextechservices.com/topics/articles/422430-fbi-beware-new-email-scam.htm|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that operate around auction sites like [[eBay]]. After money or merchandise has been stolen, the criminal employs a mule to transfer the money or goods, hiding the criminal's true identity and location from the victim of the crime and the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=banksafeonline.org - Bank Safe Online | url=http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk/moneymule_explained.html | accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By using instant payment mechanisms such as [[Western Union]], the mule allows the thief to transform a reversible and traceable transaction into an irreversible and untraceable one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="Is everything we know about password-stealing wrong?" | url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/161829/EverythingWeKnow.pdf | accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money mules are complicit and risk criminal prosecution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lloyds TSB - Money Mule | url=http://www.lloydstsb.com/security/money_mules.asp | accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long [[jail]] [[Sentence (law)|sentences]]. Commonly, they are recruited with job advertisements for "payment processing agents", "money transfer agents", "local processors", and other similar titles; the real benefit to the criminals is not the work carried out by the mule, but that the criminals are distanced from the risky, visible transfer. Some money mules are recruited by an attractive member of the opposite sex. After deducting a relatively small payment for themselves, candidates are asked to accept funds and to forward them to a third party, which [[Telecommuting|they can do from home]]. Legitimate companies use [[escrow]] services for this kind of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ThatsNonsense.com - Fake Job Offers | url=http://www.thatsnonsense.com/index.php?location=fake_job | accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminals trading in stolen or illegally acquired goods use similar tactics to recruit mules who receive packages and forward them to [[Commercial mail receiving agency|mail drops]] not traceable to the criminal.&lt;ref name="reshipping"&gt;{{cite web | title=ThatsNonsense.com - Reshipping Scams | url=http://www.thatsnonsense.com/index.php?location=reshipping_scams | accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, The FBI Cyber Crimes Task Force, composed of Federal, State, and Local law enforcement, charged more than 37 defendants involved in a highly organized money mule scheme, facilitated by the [[Zeus (malware)|Zeus Financial Trojan]]. This group of money mules opened several bank accounts, using both real and fake identification, to receive stolen funds from compromised bank accounts, withdraw the stolen money, then wire the stolen funds overseas.  These money mules facilitated the theft of over $3 million from victim bank accounts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manhattan U.S. Attorney Charges 37 Defendants | url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/newyork/press-releases/2010/nyfo093010.htm | accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bitcoin ATM]]s were reported by [[Brian Krebs]] in 2016 to be rising in popularity for money muling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=‘Money Mule’ Gangs Turn to Bitcoin ATMs|date=September 29, 2016|author=[[Brian Krebs]]|work=Krebs on Security|type=blog|url=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/money-mule-gangs-turn-to-bitcoin-atms/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{demoscene}}

The '''Nullarbor demo party''' is a combined [[game development]] and [[demoscene]] [[demoparty|event]] in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name='ecu'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecumediaqa.ids.ecu.edu.au/popups/mrPopup.asp?mrID=748|title=Electronic art on show at ECU|date=1 February 2006|author=Edith Cowan University Corporate Communications|accessdate=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event takes place at the beginning of every year in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]. It was named Nullarbor in reference to Perth's physical isolation from the rest of the Australia. Like other similar demo parties worldwide, it provides a platform for game developers and graphic artists to showcase their skills.

The event is supported by [[Edith Cowan University]], the [[Government of Western Australia|Western Australian government]], Perth [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGGRAPH]],&lt;ref name='siggraph'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perth.siggraph.org.au/screening_20060223.shtml|title=SIGGRAPH Technical screening at the Nullarbor demo party|author=ACM SIGGRAPH Perth|date=23 February 2006|accessdate=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perth [[IGDA]], and many [[Video game developer|game developers]] (e.g. :[[Microsoft]] and Interzone Games), and is managed by Adrian Boeing and Martin Masek. The party is also supported internationally by demo scene groups from Europe and the USA.&lt;ref name='support1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demoparty.net/nullarbor2007/|title=Nullarbor 2007|author=demoparty.net|accessdate=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nullarbor differs from many other demoparties: it does not try to keep the demoscene underground, instead it tries to promote democulture to a wider audience. Nullarbor targets academia, government and industry to promote game development and democulture in order to legitimize the scene. As a result, some of the demo entries diverge from the standard demoscene expectations, for example "Landscape Visualization", which placed 2nd in the demo competition, which were poorley received by the European demoscene&lt;ref name='rdb'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=23989|title=Landscape Visualization|author=pouet.net|accessdate=10 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still retains a hacker culture. 

Nullarbor is sometimes also referred to as "notrees", which is a play on the name 'Nullarbor'. In 2007, the event was retitled to "Interzone nullarbor 2007", or iz null in a shortened form.

== Competitions ==
The party includes multiple [[compo (demoscene)|competitions]], including but not limited to:

* [[video game]] development
* combined [[demo (computer programming)|demo]]
* 64[[Kilobyte|k]] [[Demo (computer programming)|intro]]
* [[machinima]]
* music
* [[Pixel art|graphics]]
* [[short film]] ("wild") / [[Computer animation|animation]]

== History ==
The first Nullarbor was held in February 2006. It attracted hundreds of visitors. It included only a demo, intro and game development competition, which was held at [[Edith Cowan University|ECU]] Mount Lawley. Teams from Europe and Australia competed in the competitions, including a number of interstate entries. Nullarbor was a breakthrough for the Australian demoscene, as the last demo party in Western Australia was the C party in 1994, which was 12 years before Nullarbor.&lt;ref name="Cparty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxygen.it.net.au/demos.html|title=Oxygen Releases|accessdate=10 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last demo party in Australia was Coven 2001.&lt;ref name="coven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=117&amp;when=01|title=Coven 2001 Releases|accessdate=10 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nullarbor broke a 5-year demo party drought in Australia. As a result, Nullarbor attracted a record number of first releases and new demo groups. Game Developers that were also formed in order to compete at the event and added a significant contribution to the Perth game development scene, including the formation of new digital content companies.

In 2007 nullarbor was officially renamed to "Interzone nullarbor", to reflect major sponsorship by Interzone games. It became one of the world's biggest demoparties with over 10,000 visitors,&lt;ref name='pcp'&gt;{{cite news|last=Best|first=Timothy|title=Nullarbor Game Development Contest|publisher=PC Power Play|date=4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  largely thanks to taking place as part of the [[GO3]] electronic entertainment expo and conference in the [[Perth Convention Exhibition Centre]].&lt;ref name='go3'&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061217023634/http://www.go3.com.au/html/competitions.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources report up to 30,000 visitors.&lt;ref name='scene.org'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scene.org/discussnews.php?item=339 |title=news |publisher=scene.org |date=5 April 2007 |accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nullarbor competition expanded in 2007 to include animation, pixel art, and music competitions.

The 2008 competition saw a return to the traditional [[demoparty]] style taking place at The Bakery art venue in [[Northbridge, Western Australia]]. The competition was also extended to include a pitch competition and allow for [[machinima]] entries.

Australia obtained a second demoparty in 2007, the [[Syntax Demoparty]] in Melbourne, and as of 2008 Perth has had a strong presence in the Local and [[Global Game Jam]] events. Subsequently Nullarbor events have not been held since 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19453">'''Occupational sexism''' (also called '''sexism in the work place''' and '''employment sexism''') refers to any [[discriminatory]] practices, statements, actions, etc. based on a person's [[sex]] that are present or occur in a place of [[employment]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sexist-by-occupation billboard, January 1977, California.jpg|thumb|Sexist billboard in California, 1977, in which a woman worker is called a "girl" and a male worker is called a "man."]] --&gt;
==Social role theory==
{{Main|Role theory}}
Social role theory may explain one reason for why occupational sexism exists.  Historically women's place was in the home, while the males were in the workforce.  This division consequently formed expectances for both men and women in society and occupations.  These expectances in turn gave rise to gender stereotypes that play a role in the formation of sexism in the work place, i.e., occupational sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1037/10277-000 |title=Sexism and stereotypes in modern society: The gender science of Janet Taylor Spence |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-55798-531-6 |last1=Swann |first1=William B. |last2=Langlois |first2=Judith |last3=Gilbert |first3=Lucia Albino }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a reference there are three common patterns associated with social role theory that might help explain the relationship between the theory and occupational sexism.  The three patterns are as follows:
#Women tend to take on more domestic tasks;
#Women and men often have different occupational roles; and
#In occupations, women often have lower status
These patterns can work as the fore ground for the commonality of occupational stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Eagly. (1987). Social-role theory. Retrieved from http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/social_role.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;An example
One example of this in action is the expectancy value model.  This model describes how expectances may be linked to gender discrimination in occupations.  For example, females are expected by society to be more successful in health related fields while men are expected to be more successful in science related fields.  Therefore, men are discriminated against when attempting to enter health related fields, and females are discriminated against when attempting to enter science related fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=S. |date=10/18/2008 |title=Social role theory |website=Psychlopedia |url=http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social role theory effects on women ==
===History===
Occupational sexism is caused by the social role theory and different stereotypes in society. The social role theory has many effects on women, many of them pertaining to occupations. Before World War II, women were usually found in the home, performing womanly duties such as cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children.&lt;ref&gt;Braybon, Gail. 1981. Women workers in the First World War: the British experience. London: Croom Helm.{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since World War II, women have shifted the gender roles and have began performing the jobs that men would have typically been performing, such as joining the military, becoming mechanics, driving trucks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Braybon, Gail. 1981. Women workers in the First World War: the British experience. London: Croom Helm.{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original occupations women participated in were based on the social role theory, but women have been attempting to counteract the theory by participating in jobs that would be seen as "unusual" for them.

===Stereotypes===
Despite multiple acts attempting to seal the gap between women and men in the workplace, women are still deemed as inferior based on stereotypes embedded in society caused by the social role theory. Whether it is intentional or not, there is discrimination of women based on gender related stereotypes. It has been studied by Tiina Likki, who is a part of a Behavioral Insights Team, that removing stereotypes about women in occupations is difficult because despite job training, people still acquire stereotypical thoughts.&lt;ref name=Likki2018&gt;{{cite web |last1=Likki |first1=Tiina |title=What We Learned By Failing to Make Work Better for Female Staff |website=Behavioral Scientist |date=May 31, 2018 |url=http://behavioralscientist.org/what-we-learned-by-failing-to-make-work-better-for-female-staff/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likki has been committed to improving gender inequality in the labor market; she continues to use her knowledge of sexism within occupations to make others aware of these underlying issues.&lt;ref name=Likki2018/&gt; Many stereotypes are embedded into our lives through society, which causes a constant continuation. This makes it  difficult to steer away from these stereotypes as they have been prominent in society for hundreds of years.

===Continuation of Sexism===
Economists Kerwin Kofi Charles, Jonathan Guryan, and Jessica Pan have determined that where women choose to live and work determines the sexism that is encountered.&lt;ref&gt;Tankersley, Jim. "How Sexism Follows Women From the Cradle to the Workplace." The New York Times. August 19, 2018. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/business/sexism-women-birthplace-workplace.html.&lt;/ref&gt;. These economists used research and statistics to show that women are affected by the social role theory from childhood and it follows them well into adulthood &lt;ref&gt;Tankersley, Jim. "How Sexism Follows Women From the Cradle to the Workplace." The New York Times. August 19, 2018. Accessed November 29, 2018. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/business/sexism-women-birthplace-workplace.html.&lt;/ref&gt;. Women experience gender roles as children; they can be as young as five years ole in elementary school when they begin to be affected by the social role theory. Gender roles are rooted into society and causes a continuation of sexism that follows women into their occupations.

===Trouble Advancing in Occupations===
In occupations, women rarely are awarded the managerial positions.This is caused by sexual roles within organizations. Men are viewed as superior in occupations because of the stereotype that they are stronger and more capable of dealing with their emotions than women. This is a possible reason for why women have trouble obtaining positions in occupations that put them above men&lt;ref&gt;Harlan, S. L., &amp; Berheide, C. W. (1994). Barriers to work place advancement experienced by women in low-paying occupations. Washington, DC: U.S. Glass Ceiling Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;. If women were to rise to a higher position in an occupation, there is likelihood that they will be treated differently than if a male were to obtain that same position.

===Mental Health===
Depression and mental health issues are also effects of the social role theory. In general, women are found to be almost twice as depressed as men.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender and Women's Mental Health." World Health Organization. June 24, 2013. http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/genderwomen/en/.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for the larger numbers of depression in women compared to men is the amount of sexism faced in occupations having an emotional effect. Women are becoming more depressed as a result of these stereotypical ideas against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00426-3 |pmid=12646294 |title=Epidemiology of women and depression |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=5–13 |year=2003 |last1=Kessler |first1=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an intense amount of pressure placed on women when they encounter certain stereotypes and sexual roles in the workplace and this can take a toll on their mental health.

===Fights against the theory===
The idea of gender roles has caused different reactions in women in modern society as well. Women have been fighting against gender roles and the stereotype that women can only perform certain duties in occupations.There is an entire feminist movement that focuses on the inequality of women in different aspects of society, including the treatment of women in occupations based on gender roles&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Barbara. IDEOLOGICAL PURITY AND FEMINISM:: The U.S. Women’s Movement from 1966 to 1975. ''Gender &amp; Society'', 239–257&lt;/ref&gt;. Feminists have been working towards gaining equality between men and women and eliminating the social role theory, along with stereotypical assumptions, to ensure women obtain and keep their basic human rights.

==Emotion politics==
Sexism also arises in the workplace through the beliefs concerning which emotions are appropriate for employees to show.  Stereotypically, women are expected to be kind and nurturing, communal, and modest, while they are not expected to display anger.  Expressing an emotion that doesn't line up with people's beliefs about gender-appropriate behavior could lead to being given a lower status at work, and consequently, a lower wage.&lt;ref name="Brescoll, V. L. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02079.x |pmid=18315800 |title=Can an Angry Woman Get Ahead? |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=268–275 |year=2008 |last1=Brescoll |first1=Victoria L. |last2=Uhlmann |first2=Eric Luis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study found that men who expressed anger in the workplace were given a higher status, while women who expressed anger in the workplace were given a lower status, regardless of their actual position in the company.  A trainee and a CEO who were female were both given a low status when displaying anger.  Additionally, women who displayed anger in the workplace were assumed to have something internal influencing their anger, as opposed to having an external reason to be angry.  Men more often had their anger attributed to an external cause.&lt;ref name="Brescoll, V. L. 2008"/&gt;

The expression of anger is believed to be related to status, as anger is considered a status emotion.  Positive impressions of those who display anger are reserved for people who are stereotypically conferred a higher status.  A 2007 study found that male employees who were in a subordinate position in the workplace displayed anger toward higher status employees, while female employees in a subordinate position displayed anger toward higher status employees much less frequently.  This suggests that the stereotypical norm of men displaying anger carries over into the workplace, while the norm of women restraining displays of anger also carries over.  It also suggests that, although men in low level positions in the workplace possess a low status in this context, they may carry over the higher status that comes with their gender into the workplace.  Women do not possess this high status; therefore the low status that low level women possess in the workplace is the sole status that matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0893318906295681 |title=The Impact of Gender and Organizational Status on Workplace Anger Expression |journal=Management Communication Quarterly |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=297–315 |year=2007 |last1=Domagalski |first1=Theresa A. |last2=Steelman |first2=Lisa A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wage discrimination==
Howard J. Wall, an economist for the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] of St. Louis, states that women make a median hourly income that was equal to 83.8 percent of what men make.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite news | first=Howard J. | last=Wall | title=The Gender Wage Gap and Wage Discrimination: Illusion or Reality? | url=http://stlouisfed.org/publications/re/2000/d/pages/economic-backgnd.html |  work=The Regional Economist |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis | date=October 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1980s, studies saw that about a fair amount of the [[gender pay gap]] was due to differences in the skills and experience that women bring to the labor market and about 28 percent was due to differences in industry, occupation, and union status among men and women. Accounting for these differences raised the female/male pay ratio in the late 1980s from about 72% to about 88%, leaving around 12 percent as an "unexplained" difference.&lt;ref&gt;http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blau&gt;{{cite journal

== Death at work ==
The majority of occupational deaths occur among men.  In one US study, 93% of deaths on the job involved men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm|title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary, 2013|last=|first=|date=11 September 2014|website=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]]|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a death rate approximately 11 times higher than women.  The industries with the highest death rates are mining, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and construction, all of which employ more men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Fatal Occupational Injuries - United States, 1980-1997 MMWR Weekly, April 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths of members in the military is currently above 90% men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf|title=American War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists and Statistics|last=DeBruyne|first=Nese|date=April 26, 2017|website=Federation Of American Scientists Logo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of wage discrimination==
Sociologists, economists, and politicians have proposed several theories about the causes of gender wage gap. Some believe that woman's salaries are based on the career path that women choose. They stipulate that the women chose low-paying jobs, clerical work, and to work in services&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hurst | first=Charles E. | authorlink=Charles E. Hurst | year=2006 | title=Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences | edition=6th }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Pink-collar worker]]).  This is said to be relatively true at time because many women who select these careers find it easier to continue working these simple jobs rather that quit them if they choose to raise a family.&lt;ref name="Hurst"/&gt;

== Sexism in academia ==
{{main|Sexism in academia}}
Universities have been blamed for being sexist in their hiring decisions. In particular, men have been reported to be biased towards male applicants. However, recent data suggest that women have caught up, at least when it comes to the number of faculty positions offered to women (see Table).&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.346.6211.798 |pmid=25395513 |title=No sexism in science?

==Challenging occupational sexism==
Occupational sexism become institutionalized in the U.S. today when women were originally able to join the workforce by men primarily in the 20th Century and were paid up to two-thirds of what male's income were.  Since then it is now thought of as "good business" to hire women because they could perform many jobs similar to men, yet give them lesser wages.&lt;ref name="Bravo"/&gt;  Groups like the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[National Organization for Women]] are established to fight against this discrimination, leading to the creation of groundbreaking laws such as the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]].  However, identifying and challenging sex discrimination in the workplace (on legal grounds) has been argued as being extremely difficult for the average person to attempt and even harder to prove in court.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

One successful sexism case that reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] was ''[[Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins]]''. [[Ann Hopkins]], a senior manager at [[Price Waterhouse]], sued her employer, arguing that failure to promote her to partner stemmed not from her abilities—which had been undeniably stellar—but from certain partners thinking she didn't carry herself in a feminine-enough manner. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Hopkins' favor, and a lower court ordered her employer to award her partnership and pay her back wages lost during the case.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewin|first1=Tamar|title=Winner of Sex Bias Suit Set to Enter Next Arena|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/19/us/winner-of-sex-bias-suit-set-to-enter-next-arena.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=19 May 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Supreme Court case, ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.]]'', saw a judgment in favor of plaintiff [[Lilly Ledbetter]]—which had awarded her back pay and damages for several years of receiving disproportionately low pay in comparison to her male counterparts—overturned because she waited too long to file suit. After a 5-4 decision, the majority cited reasoning that "Federal law states that 'employees must file their discrimination complaints within 180 days of the incident,'" a task that dissenting Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] claimed was unreasonable considering that quite often women have no reason to suspect discrimination until certain unfair patterns develop and they are made aware of them.&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;{{cite news | first=Jan Crawford | last=Greenburg |author2=de Vogue, Ariane | title=High Court Limits Sex Discrimination Claims | url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Politics/story?id=3221938 | publisher=ABC News | date=2007-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WackenOpenAir.jpg|thumb|[[Wacken Open Air]]]]

An '''open-air concert''' is a concert taking place outside a hall in the open air.

==Overview==
Open-air concerts can range from small, acoustic gatherings taking place at a [[municipal park]], to large multi-day [[music festival]]s, involving some of the most famous music acts in the world. Nearly any type of music can be played at one of these concerts, and they frequently feature [[pop music|pop]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Classical music|classical]], or [[jazz]] artists. Largely electronic music, such as [[techno music|techno]], are seldom featured because of the difficulties of staging the event.  Some open-air concerts known as festivals take place over several days and feature a large number of different artists.

==Facilities==
Open-air concerts take great amounts of planning, to make sure that the [[stage (theatre)|stage]]  is visible from the entire [[audience]] seating area. Frequently, the area directly in front of the stage is kept clear for dancing.  In the case of punk concerts and other energetic music, this area becomes a [[mosh pit]] filled with a violently moving crowd.  Generally, care is taken to keep the dancers off the stage, however at punk concerts, [[stagediving]] and other audience interaction are more common.

Open-air concerts can be free for the audience, or may sell [[ticket (admission)|ticket]]s for entrance.  With ticketed events, these concerts are staged in planned, fenced-in areas, to avoid non-paying visitors. The [[Fence|fencing]] used is often temporary.

Rain can wreak havoc at an open-air concert. The grass in front of the stage is often heavily damaged by concert-goers, and may need replanted after the event. Therefore, it is common that visitors get a partial refund on the ticket price if they donate a sack of grass seed at the entrance.

Concerts can take place at a location not served by the public electricity grid. In these cases, the concert promoters set up emergency power generators.

Many open-air concerts are very loud, and without the insulation of a building or arena to contain the [[noise]], this also takes an amount of planning, to assure that the concert does not bother the neighbors. Often, these events are staged at a distance from residential areas.  Many areas have [[noise regulation]]s in place limiting the areas in which these large events can take place.

For larger events, the stage is built from [[scaffolding]] and often includes a roof to protect electrical equipment from potential rain. This scaffolding rig holds lighting and other special effects equipment.  [[Loudspeaker]]s are frequently mounted to the right and left of the stage in towers, with the [[mixing console]] placed before the stage.

Support functions are often placed in areas surrounding the audience. [[Concession stand|Concessions]] are sold from trailers and other temporary structures. If plumbing facilities are available, toilets are found in this area; in areas without plumbing, chemical [[portable toilet]]s are used.

In 1982, [[serial killer]] [[Henry Lee Lucas]] confessed to her murder, although there was no [[physical evidence]] that he had been involved in the killing, sexual assault or disposing of the body.&lt;ref name=drifter/&gt;&lt;ref name=tomb/&gt;&lt;ref name=may&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|last1=Verhovek|first1=Sam Howe|title=Death-row Inmate May Not Deserve Penalty|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12454994/deathrow_inmate_may_not_deserve_penalty/|accessdate=11 October 2014|agency=Indiana Gazette|date=8 January 1992|page=4}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, he stated that he picked her up in Oklahoma, where they had sex.&lt;ref name=ae&gt;Husain, Michael.

==Media appearances and further investigation==

[[File:Orange Socks NCMEC.jpg|thumb|left|2016 reconstructions by [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children|NCMEC]]]]

The "Orange Socks" case had been featured twice on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' since the murder took place. An anonymous woman called to the program on one occasion claiming she had seen Orange Socks [[hitchhiking]] the day of her murder, but the lead has not generated any new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orange Socks Jane Doe Murder - Texas - 1979|url=http://amwfans.com/thread/826/orange-socks-jane-murder-texas|website=amwfans.com|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a missing woman's photograph surfaced that resembled Orange Socks. [[DNA]] testing, however, did not match. Another report suggests that the victim was a woman who had disappeared in the 1970s, together with her abusive boyfriend.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt; Former missing person [[Murder of Martha Morrison|Martha Morrison]] was speculated by some to possibly have been the unidentified woman, but she was eventually ruled out.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; Morrison's remains were identified in 2015 as a Jane Doe found in Washington the same year she disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillespie|first1=Emily|title=Remains of homicide victim found near Vancouver identified after 41 years|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2015/jul/13/vancouver-murder-victim-remains-martha-morrison/|accessdate=14 July 2015|work=The Columbian|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other missing women have also been excluded from the case.&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 8056|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/8056|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 37th anniversary of her discovery, new reconstructions of Orange Socks were released by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children. The organization also entered her into their database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1979|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1213120/1/screen|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=1 November 2016|date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, law enforcement stated they planned on examining the victim's ring as well as run tests to identify the location the victim's socks were made. A book of matches found near the body were traced to a hotel in Oklahoma but couldn't identify anyone matching her description in the records.&lt;ref name="continues"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spencer |first1=Bridget |title=Investigation continues into 'Orange Socks' cold case |url=http://www.fox7austin.com/news/local-news/investigation-continues-into-orange-socks-cold-case |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=KTBC |agency=Fox |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{transl|ar|ALA|Raʼs as-Sanah}}''' ({{lang-ar|رأس السنة}}, {{IPA|/raʔs asˈsana/}}, &lt;small&gt;colloquially:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ra(ː)s es-/}}; {{lang-en|New Year}}) literally means "Head of the year" in Arabic and refers to the beginning of a new year. This may apply to any of the following:
* [[New Year]] for the [[Gregorian year]]
* [[Islamic New Year]]
* [[Rosh Hashanah]], the [[Jewish]] New Year in the [[Hebrew calendar]]

The term has common origin with the [[Hebrew]] "Rosh Hashanah" (also meaning "Head of the year"), reflecting the common linguistic heritage of the Jews and Arabs.

[[Christianity]] in both Europe and the United States served to unite fellow soldiers of the same denomination and motivated them to fight. Some European countries shared unity across denominations while others did not. In Germany, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] differences caused tension while [[Austria-Hungary]] did not unify [[Catholic]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallhoff|first=Angela|last2=Schulte-Umberg|first2=Thomas|date=2015-10-02|title=The Committed Soldier: Religion as a Necessary Supplement to a Moral Theory of Warfare|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21567689.2015.1132415|journal=Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology|volume=16|issue=4|pages=434–448|doi=10.1080/21567689.2015.1132415|issn=2156-7689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian Institutions in Jerusalem ===
The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] received much of its income from [[pilgrimage]]. The [[World War I|First World War]] stopped pilgrimage and a heavy tax was required of those who didn’t want to fight in the war. The factors caused the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] to borrow large amounts of money that left the Church defective during the duration of the war.

As [[Christian]] establishments dealt with the effects of the [[World War I|First World War]], some were able to maintain themselves and prosper while others experienced great loss. The war changed the relationship between [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]] in Jerusalem and united them over a common attitude of opposition towards [[Jewish]] immigration. The war also caused the formations of new religious groups such as The Palestinian Association of Egypt. The war increased religious focus on custody of the Holy Land and local issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazza|first=Roberto|date=March 2009|title=Churches at War: The Impact of the First World War on the Christian Institutions of Jerusalem, 1914–20|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00263200802383248|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=45|issue=2|pages=207–227|doi=10.1080/00263200802383248|issn=0026-3206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unity Among Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish American Soldiers ===
When the United States entered the First World War, the most prominent religions groups were Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The conflict served to unite these religions despite their differences and dissolve the idea the Jews and Catholics were inferior to Protestants.The loyalty to the same God and same country helped soldiers put aside their religious differences for the good of the war. Tense conditions still existed between these three religious but efforts were made to provide equal opportunities to each group. A committee called the Committee of Six represented the three faiths in the formation of new policy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mislin|first=David|date=2015-11-13|title=One Nation, Three Faiths: World War I and the Shaping of “Protestant-Catholic-Jewish” America|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0009640715000943|journal=Church History|volume=84|issue=04|pages=828–862|doi=10.1017/s0009640715000943|issn=0009-6407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritualism ===
World War I also brought a focus on the afterlife and developed Spiritualism into a religion. Spirituality was enticing to those dealing with death and loss of faith after the First World War because of their beliefs in speaking with the dead and explaining mysteries about death, things that some felt Christianity couldn’t satisfy. Stobart, a British woman in charge of a hospital during the Second World War, became a spiritualist leader following the end of the war. She was enticed by Spiritualism because it offered more opportunities for her as a woman than other traditional religions did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Angela|date=October 2011|title=‘The Mists Which Shroud These Questions’: Mabel St Clair Stobart, the First World War and Faith|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7227/lh.20.2.1|journal=Literature &amp; History|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1–15|doi=10.7227/lh.20.2.1|issn=0306-1973|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Church of England ===
For national churches such as The Church of England, war was heavily supported. They felt that it was their duty to pray for soldiers because they needed the grace of God. They believed that soldiers would pass through purgatory because violence was opposed to the church's belief in peace. Despite these conflicting beliefs, church leaders supported the war. Bishop Gore, a bishop of the Church of England, was one that fantasized and downplayed the realities of war in his attempt to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Peter|date=2017-01-31|title=Guns, Gore and God: Bishop Gore and the First World War|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1740355316000255|journal=Journal of Anglican Studies|volume=15|issue=01|pages=88–107|doi=10.1017/s1740355316000255|issn=1740-3553}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Indian bicycle troops Somme 1916 IWM Q 3983.jpg|thumb|Indian bicycle troops Somme 1916 IWM Q 3983]]

=== Sikhism ===
Known for their bravery, [[Sikhs]] were more prominently found in the Indian army. Although the army also consisted of individuals from other religions, many people belonging to faiths, such as [[Hinduism]] were rarely found in combat. Regiments were even formed strictly with members of the [[Sikh]] religion. The Indian Army formed an allegiance with the [[British Empire]] and participated in a few battles during [[World War I]], including the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. &lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Peter. Die in Battle, Do Not Despair: the Indians on Gallipoli,1915. Primus Books, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ===
Members from [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]]’ participation on World War I provided an opportunity for members of the Church to clearly define themselves to the world. In a time where many negative commentaries about [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] was circulating, the War served to help in efforts to accurately portray the Church.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/368052555|title=The influence of the First World War on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|last=1973-|first=Mangum, James I.,|date=2007|oclc=368052555}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, “Mormons” were accused of being disloyal to the United States of America. In 1886, a district attorney for the state of Utah was quoted to have said “We wish to say that the so-called [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is steeped in disloyalty to the Government of the United States…We say, more than that, that the purpose of this Church here, one of its particular purposes, is to overthrow the American home and overturn the family altar in this country."&lt;ref&gt;1 “In a Nut Shell: A Strong Indictment Presented by the U. S. Attorney,” The Salt Lake Daily Tribune, vol. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Latter-day Saint soldier’s active duty in the war fought against the idea that members of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS church]] were not loyal to their country. In fact, many LDS men enlisted in the military for the soul purpose of trying to prove such accusations as false. Such Soldiers also left notable impacts on their fellow comrades throughout their active participation in military service.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/368052555|title=The influence of the First World War on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|last=1973-|first=Mangum, James I.,|date=2007|oclc=368052555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] is notoriously known for its [[missionary work]], and the case was not any different during the early years of the “Mormon Church”. During World War I, however, missionary work was negatively affected. Many of those who would otherwise serve missions for the Church, enrolled in military service, limiting the number of men available to become [[LDS missionaries]]. Areas where [[LDS Missionaries]] previously proselyted, became too dangerous for such activity and as a result all LDS Missionaries were taken out of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James Perry|date=2018|title=British Latter-day Saints in the Great War, 1914–1918|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5406/jmormhist.44.3.0070|journal=Journal of Mormon History|volume=44|issue=3|pages=70|doi=10.5406/jmormhist.44.3.0070|issn=0094-7342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women of Faith in the War ===
[[World War I]] made women into more influential figures in society, due to their symbolic necessity in representing their faith. It was women of faith that actively engaged in provided aid, emotionally, physically, and spiritually, to Soldiers in need during the violence of the War. Additionally, women assisted in actual religious pursuits and activities. They held and supported positions that would not have been previously available to them.

[[Catholic]] women were remembered helping Priests who were overloaded with the amount of spiritual and physical aid they felt needed to be administered. They worked under such responsibilities to help people come back to their faith in [[Jesus Christ]].

Women in the [[Protestant]] faith participated in similar ways, including providing care packages for Soldiers. They even took over parishes when the pastors of such parishes were busy in other endeavors during the war. It was during this time that women were symbols during the war of religious faith and devotion to supporting their countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Machen|first=Emily|date=December 7, 2012|title=Soldiers of Faith behind the Lines: religious women and community patriotism during the First World War in France|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09612025.2012.724919|journal=Women's History Review|volume=22|issue=1|pages=31–50|doi=10.1080/09612025.2012.724919|issn=0961-2025|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jews]] served in the war for several different reasons. They desired to unite with their fellow citizens and join with them in combat. The war also allowed for [[Jewish]] people to define themselves to the world. A huge driving factor for many [[Jews]] was the desire to engage in conflict against Russia, a nation that was known for being oppressive to [[Jews]]. Many felt the need to help their fellow Jewish comrades in dire circumstances. 

Due to the destruction of Hasburg Monarchy and the [[Russian Empire]], new nations were formed that developed different relations with the [[Jewish]] people than before [[World War I]]. The [[Jews]] became more recognizable and distinctive in the new states established thus creating greater [[Jewish]] influence. &lt;ref&gt;Rozenblit, Marsha L., and Jonathan Karp. World War I and the Jews Conflict and Transformations in Europe, the Middle East, and America. Berghahn Books, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===

During [[World War I]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] was under an immense amount of pressure to engage in the conflict. Leaders of the empire attempted to maintain neutrality for a time, but the pressure for inclusion only increased. The official religion of the Ottoman Empire during this time, was Islam, making joining the war was a topic of controversy in the [[Islamic State]], as [[Muslim]] law includes strict guidelines in regards to involvement in wars. 

In October of 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] faced enough pressure from Germany to agree to commence an attack on the Russian Navy stationed in the Black Sea. The [[Ottoman Empire]] deceptively claimed that they were attacked by Russia, hiding the fact that their presence in the Black Sea was to deliberately cause conflict with Russia. This event ultimately led to Russia's involvement in [[World War I]].

Many argue that the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s involvement was strictly due to benefits they desired for the [[Islamic State]]. [[Muslim]] scholars have argued that their participation was really an attempt to enlarge the [[Islamic State]] and grow in power and influence.  &lt;ref&gt;Zürcher Erik Jan.

'''SIEV X''' stands for [[Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel]] X. SIEV is the acronym used by the surveillance authority for any boat that has entered Australian waters without prior authorisation and the X is a designation where a tracking number has not or is yet to be assigned, in accordance with Australian Government orders.&lt;ref name="Select Committee"&gt;{{cite report| title=Report - Select Committee for an Inquiry into a Certain Maritime Incident|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate_Committees?url=maritime_incident_ctte/report/report.pdf| publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]| accessdate=21 December 2012| page=xi (Acronyms and Abbreviations)| format=PDF| date=23 October 2002| isbn=0 642 71191 7}} 12.7 MB&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used by author [[Tony Kevin]],&lt;ref name = "tony"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kevin |first= Tony |authorlink= |coauthors= | title = A certain maritime incident : the sinking of SIEV X. |publisher= Scribe Publications |year= 2004 |location= [[Carlton North, Victoria]] |pages= 24 cm. xiii, 306 p. : ill., maps |url= |doi= |id= | isbn = 1-920769-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to a dilapidated [[Indonesia]]n fishing boat that was en route from [[Sumatra]] to [[Christmas Island]] carrying over 400 [[asylum seekers]]. It sank in [[international waters]] on 19 October 2001, just south of the Indonesian [[island of Java]], killing 353 people. The tragedy was politically controversial in [[Australia]], as it occurred during an [[Australian federal election, 2001|election campaign]] at a time when asylum seekers and border protection were major issues.

==Background==
The SIEV-X incident occurred during the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 Australian Federal election]] campaign. The [[Tampa affair]] had focused national media's attention on the issue of [[asylum seekers]]. Prime Minister [[John Howard]] claimed his policy would prevent [[people smuggling]] and stop the boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Australia. The [[Howard Government]] had issued instructions to the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) to prevent any refugees from reaching Australia via boat. The AFP set about a campaign of disrupting organised people smugglers who operated with overcrowded and dangerous boats. The Royal Australian Navy began intercepting boats that entered Australian waters and transferring all people to Christmas Island.

==Sinking==
On 18 October 2001, a small, unnamed 19.5&amp;nbsp;metre by 4&amp;nbsp;metre Indonesian fishing boat departed [[Bandar Lampung]], [[Indonesia]], with 421 passengers on board. On the 19th, the boat sank during a storm in Indonesian waters about 70&amp;nbsp;km south of Java. The area was ''legally in international waters'' but ''within both Indonesia's'' [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) ''and Indonesia's internationally designated zone of search and rescue responsibility''. It also fell inside a temporary Australian border protection surveillance area around the Australian external territory of [[Christmas Island]] (which is some 1700&amp;nbsp;km from mainland Australia). This latter designation was an internal planning and operational tool used by the Australian authorities to deter people smuggling.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} It had no legal validity and conferred no responsibility in [[international law]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Approximately 146 children, 142 women and 65 men died. On 20 October, 44 survivors were rescued by an Indonesian fishing boat, the Indah Jaya Makmur. A 45th survivor was rescued about twelve hours later by another boat, the Surya Terang.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Marg (14 June 2005) [http://sievx.com/archives/2005/20050614.shtml "The 45th Survivor"] sievx.com. Retrieved 6 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] stated that it had expected such an event to occur due to "the way the people smugglers pack these boats".&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_224073"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=224073 |title=350 migrants reported drowned off Indonesia |date=23 October 2001 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate Select Committee==
On 20 February 2002, the [[Australian Senate Select Committee]] inquiring into ‘A Certain Maritime Incident’ met for the first time. Its primary task was to investigate the [[children overboard affair]], however its terms of reference also included investigating “operational procedures observed by the Royal Australian Navy and by relevant Commonwealth agencies to ensure the safety of asylum seekers on vessels entering or attempting to enter Australian waters”. 

The committee investigated the SIEV-X sinking, and concluded that "... it [is] extraordinary that a major human disaster could occur in the vicinity of a theatre of intensive Australian operations and remain undetected until three days after the event, without any concern being raised within intelligence and decision making circles." While no government department was found to be to blame for the tragedy, the Committee was surprised that there had been no internal investigations into any systemic problems which could have allowed the Australian government to prevent it from occurring."

Since 2003, [[Steve Biddulph]] worked with the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] to build a suitable memorial for victims and survivors of the SIEV X sinking. On Sunday, 15 September 2006, a 'temporary' memorial was erected at [[Weston Park, Canberra|Weston Park]] in [[Canberra]]. The memorial, designed by [[Mitchell Donaldson]] of [[Queensland]]'s [[Hillbrook Anglican School]], consisted of 353 white poles, all decorated by schools, churches and community groups across Australia. While the ACT Government was supportive of the memorial, with Chief Minister [[Jon Stanhope]] opening the memorial, the then [[Howard Government]] tried to stop the memorial being constructed. The [[National Capital Authority]] claimed that it was not an approved structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Govt-condemns-case-study-on-SIEV-X/2006/10/19/1160851040247.html |title=Govt condemns case study on SIEV X |date=19 October 2006 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permanent memorial, involving over a thousand student and community artists, was dedicated in October 2007.

[[File:SHE - Scalloway - Minnesmerket.jpg|thumb|right|A memorial in [[Scalloway]] commemorating the Shetland Bus operation during the Second World War]]

The '''Shetland Bus''' ([[Norwegian Bokmål]]: ''Shetlandsbussene'', [[Definiteness|def.]] [[Plural|pl.]]) was the nickname of a clandestine [[special operations]] group that made a permanent link between [[Shetland]] in [[Scotland]] and [[German occupation of Norway|German-occupied Norway]] from 1941 until the surrender of Nazi Germany on 8 May 1945. From mid-1942, the group's official name was the Norwegian Naval Independent Unit (NNIU). In October 1943, it became an official part of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] and was renamed the Royal Norwegian Naval Special Unit (RNNSU). The unit was operated initially by a large number of small [[fishing boat]]s and later augmented by three fast and well-armed [[submarine chaser]]s – {{Ship|HNoMS|Vigra||2}}, {{Ship|HNoMS|Hessa||2}} and {{Ship|HNoMS|Hitra||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=      http://forsvaretsmuseer.no/Marinemuseet/Marinens-fartoeyer-1814-2014/Fartoeysklasser/Andre-marinefartoey/Shetlandsbussene
|title=Shetlandsbussene|publisher =  forsvaretsmuseer.no|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossings were mostly made during the winter under the cover of darkness. This meant the crews and passengers had to endure very heavy [[North Sea]] conditions, with no lights and constant risk of discovery by German aircraft or patrol boats. There was also the possibility of being captured whilst carrying out the mission on the Norwegian coast. 

Early on it was decided that [[camouflage]] was the best defence, and the boats were disguised as working [[fishing boat]]s and the crew as [[fishermen]]. The fishing boats were armed with [[light machine gun]]s concealed inside oil drums placed on deck. The operation was under constant threat from German forces, and several missions went awry, of which the [[Telavåg]] tragedy in the spring of 1942 was a prime example. Several fishing boats were lost during the early operations, but after receiving the three submarine chasers there were no more losses.

==History==

===Norwegian arrival===
{{main|Shetland bus boats}}
When Germany launched ''[[Operation Weserübung]]'', the invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, French and British troops and ships were sent to help the Norwegians. Several coastal towns were bombed and destroyed by the Germans, and during April and May, the British ships had to retreat from mid-Norway. On 29 April, {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} left a devastated [[Molde]] with King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]], Crown Prince [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]], members of the Norwegian Government, and most of [[Flight of the Norwegian National Treasury|the gold]] from the [[Norges Bank|Norwegian National Bank]]. In northern Norway, the fighting lasted for another month. A few weeks after the occupation began, the first boats of an "armada" of fishing vessels and other boats began to arrive in Shetland. Some boats made several journeys across the North Sea carrying refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.warsailors.com/shetlandbus/boatsb.html|title= Boats escaping from Norway - WW II|publisher =    warsailors.com|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the boats were "Hardanger Cutters", with a straight bow and long stern from the Bergen area, others the more rounded "Møre Cutters", from the area around Ålesund. It appeared that the "Møre Cutter" was the strongest and best-fitted for the heavy weather in the North Sea. The boats were of many kinds and shapes, but most of those used as a "Shetland Bus", were from {{convert|50|–|70|ft|m}} long, with two masts and equipped with a 30 to 70&amp;nbsp;hp single-cylinder [[Hot-bulb engine|semi-diesel engine,]] which made the characteristic "tonk-tonk" sound.

===Formation===
[[File:Lunna House - Fra vest.jpg|thumb|[[Lunna House]] on Shetland where operations were coordinated.]]
In late 1940, both the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) and the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) Norwegian Naval Independent Unit (not to be confused with another SOE Norwegian unit: the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1|Norwegian Independent Company. No.1]] or ''Kompani Linge''), established a base in [[Lerwick]] (pronounced ''Lerrick''); SIS later moved to [[Peterhead]]. They asked some of the skippers of the boats that were coming from Norway, if they would return to deliver agents and bring others back to Shetland. This went on throughout the winter of 1940–41. In early 1941 it was decided formally to establish a group of men and boats to assist the SIS and the SOE.

The main purpose of the group was to transfer agents in and out of Norway and provide them with weapons, radios and other supplies. They would also bring out Norwegians who feared arrest by the Germans. Sometimes the group was involved in special operations, like the failed attack on the German battleship {{Ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, [[Operation Archery]], the raids on Måløy and [[Operation Claymore]] in the Lofoten Islands.

The men put in charge of organizing the group were a [[British Army]] officer, Major Leslie Mitchell and his assistant, Lieutenant [[David Armine Howarth|David Howarth]] [[RNVR]]. Upon their arrival in [[Shetland]] they commandeered Flemington House, (later named "Kergord"), in [[Weisdale]], for their headquarters and they found a perfect location in [[Lunna Ness]] north of Lerwick, from which the boats could operate. Before then the boats had been moored in Cat Firth. Lunna Ness had a sheltered harbour and a small population that were not too curious about what was going on and [[Lunna House]] was used as accommodation for the boat crews. Whilst Mitchell stayed in Flemington, Howarth set up headquarters in Lunna House. Their whole staff consisted of three British sergeants; Almond, Sherwood and Olsen; Norman Edwards, a [[stenographer]]; Harald Albertsen, a Norwegian cook at Lunna and two maids in Flemington. During the first winter Flemington House was used to train saboteurs and house agents and to accommodate Norwegian refugees. Later the refugees were received in a special camp at the James Sutherland Herring Factory in [[Lerwick]], administered by James Adie and his Norwegian-born wife.

===Facilities===
[[File:Scalloway 20080821.jpg|thumb|right|{{centre|A 2008 image of Scalloway harbour, the wartime base of the Shetland Bus.}}]]
The lack of a slipway and other repair facilities meant that at first the boats had to be repaired at Malakoff's in Lerwick. Later, they moved the boats and crews to [[Scalloway]], where William Moore &amp; Son had a mechanical workshop and where "Prince Olav's Slipway" was built.&lt;ref&gt;When he was 90 years old, Jack Moore, the owner of the workshop, received the highest Norwegian Order that can be given to a civilian; "Ridder av den Kongelige Norske St. Olavs Orden" ([[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav|Knight of the Royal Norwegian St. Olav's Order]]), for his services during the war.&lt;/ref&gt; Harald Angeltveit and Johan Haldorsen were the head mechanics and Severin Roald became leader of the carpenters. All ship repairs were done there but Lunna Voe was still used for preparing special operations.

Dinapore House was headquarters for the base in [[Scalloway]], while Flemington House became quarters for agents awaiting transport to Norway and for de-brief on return. A former net loft, owned by Nicolson &amp; Co. became accommodation for the boat crews and was named "Norway House". Sevrin Roald's wife, Inga Roald, was the housekeeper. Flemington House was also on occasion visited by high-ranking officers like the [[Commander-in-chief]], [[Scottish Command]] and the Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shetland. The most prominent guest was [[Olav V of Norway|HKH Crown Prince Olav of Norway]] who visited in October 1942. Mitchell left the base in Scalloway in December 1942 and Captain Arthur William Sclater, known as "Rogers", became leader of operations; his Norwegian-born wife, Alice, acted as welfare officer for the crews.

===Operations ===

[[File:Prince Olav slipway.JPG|thumb|Prince Olav slipway in 2010]]
At first, there were fourteen fishing boats of various sizes. The original Shetland Bus boat, the ''Aksel'', skippered by August Nærøy, departed for Bergen from Hamna Voe, on the west side of Lunna Ness, on 30 August 1941. The other crew on this first tour were Mindor Berge, Ivar Brekke, Andreas Gjertsen, and Bård Grotle.&lt;ref&gt;All the crewmen were civilians and were paid a wage of £4 a week, provided with free accommodation, and given a bonus of £10 for each voyage to Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing boats were used at first, but after some losses, it was decided that faster vessels were necessary. On 26 October 1943, the [[US Navy]] officially transferred the submarine chasers  ''Hitra'', ''Vigra'', and ''Hessa'' to the Shetland Bus operation. These craft were {{convert|110|ft|m}} long and powered by two 1,200&amp;nbsp;hp diesel engines, capable of a top speed of {{convert|22|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, with a normal cruising speed of {{convert|17|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. When the submarine chasers arrived, the group became an official part of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] and was renamed the Royal Norwegian Naval Special Unit (RNNSU).

[[File:Model of Norwegian submarine chaser.jpg|thumb|{{center|Model of one of the Shetland bus submarine chasers on a mission.}}]]
* ''KNM Hitra'' was commanded by [[Ingvald Eidsheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forsvaretsmuseer.no/Marinemuseet/Marinens-fartoeyer-1814-2014/Militaere-museumsfartoey/Hitra/Skipets-historie|title=Shetlandsbussen, KNM Hitra (Ex USN SC-718)|publisher =  forsvaretsmuseer.no|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.scandion.no/hordaland/lindas/kjentfolk/eidsheim.html |title=Ingvald Eidsheim|publisher =  scandion.no|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Vigra'' was commanded by [[Leif Larsen]].
* ''Hessa'' was commanded by [[Petter Salen]].
They carried out more than 100 tours to Norway, with no loss of men or ships.

On 9 May 1945, ''Vigra'', commanded by Larsen, and ''Hitra'', by Eidsheim, entered the harbour of Lyngøy near Bergen in free Norway. The group had made 198 trips to Norway in fishing boats and submarine chasers, Leif Larsen completing 52 of them. The "Shetland Bus" had transported 192 agents and {{convert|383|LT|t|abbr=on}} of weapons and supplies to Norway and had brought out 73 agents and 373 refugees. Forty-four members of the group were killed.

==Notable members==

The crews of the Shetland Bus (''Shetlandsgjengen'') were men of the coast, fishermen and sailors with detailed local knowledge. Most came over after the occupation, some with their own vessels, others with vessels that were "stolen" with the owner's approval. They were young men, most of them in their twenties, some even younger. Many of them did several tours in the spring and summer of 1940, evacuating British soldiers who had been stranded in Norway after the [[Norwegian Campaign]] and other British citizens living in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Shetlandsgjengen |title=Shetlandsgjengen |publisher=Store norske leksikon |first=Tore |last=Pryser |date= |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leif Larsen===

[[File:Leif Larsen ShetlandsLarsen.jpg|thumb|Shetlands Larsen, Norwegian leader of the "Bus" operations in World War II]]
[[Leif Larsen]] (9 January 1906–12 October 1990) nicknamed ''Shetlands Larsen'', was perhaps the most famous of the Shetland Bus men. In all he made 52 trips to Norway and became the most highly decorated Allied [[naval officer]] of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://snl.no/Leif_Andreas_Larsen |title=Leif Andreas Larsen |publisher=Store norske leksikon |first=Tore |last=Pryser |accessdate= February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larsen was born in Bergen, Norway and joined the Norwegian volunteers during the Finnish [[Winter War]]. Soon after the war in Finland ended, Norway was invaded by Germany. A Swedish officer, Benckert, set up a company of volunteers who made their way to Norway and fought in eastern Norway until 8 June 1940, until the end of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Leif_%C2%ABShetlands-Larsen%C2%BB |title=Leif (Shetlands) Larsen |publisher=Norsk biografisk leksikon |first=Ivar |last=Kraglund |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larsen arrived in [[Shetland]] with the boat M/B ''Motig I'', on 11 February 1941. After training with ''Kompani Linge'' in England and Scotland, Larsen returned to Lerwick in the ''St Magnus'' on 19 August 1941. He did his first Shetland Bus tour with M/B ''Siglaos'', skippered by Petter Salen, on 14 September 1941. After the loss of the minelayer ''Nordsjøen'', where Larsen was second in command, he became a skipper and could choose his own crew. His first crew was Palmer Bjørnøy, Leif Kinn, Arne Kinn, Kåre Iversen, Karsten Sangolt, Nils Nipen and Otto Pletten. His first boat was M/K ''Arthur'', the boat that he had "requisitioned" on his escape from Norway, after the wrecking of ''Nordsjøen''. On 8 November 1941, Larsen sailed from Shetland on his first tour as skipper. On their return to Shetland, they ran into a storm and Sangolt was blown overboard and drowned. Larsen made several tours with the ''Arthur'' but he also skippered other boats, like M/B ''Siglaos'' and M/B ''Feie''. In October 1942, he had to scuttle the ''Arthur'' in  Throndheimsfjord after a failed attempt to attack the German warship ''Tirpitz''. He and the crew escaped to Sweden but a British agent, A.B. Evans, was arrested and later shot.

On 23 March 1943, returning from Træna, Nordland, with M/K ''Bergholm'', they were attacked by German aircraft. The boat was sunk but Larsen and the crew, many of them wounded, rowed for several days until they reached the coast of Norway, near Ålesund but Nils Vika, died of his wounds. The other crew were: Andreas Færøy, Johannes Kalvø, Finn Clausen, Gunnar Clausen, Odd Hansen and William Enoksen. After hiding in different places, they were rescued on 14 April by a [[Motor Torpedo Boat]] (MTB) from [[Lerwick]] with Lieut. Broberg in command. In October 1943, the new submarine chasers arrived and Larsen became commander of ''Vigra'', with the rank of [[Sub-Lieutenant]]. In total he made 52 tours to Norway in fishing vessels and submarine chasers.

===Kåre Iversen===
Kåre Emil Iversen, (10 October 1918–22 August 2001), was born in [[Flatanger]], Norway. He was the son of a [[Maritime pilot|sea pilot]] and had joined his father on the [[pilot boat]]. When the Germans attacked Norway he was a fisherman and soon joined the [[Norwegian resistance movement|underground army]]. His activities were discovered by the Germans and he had to leave the country. He and three other men escaped to Shetland in August 1941 with his father's boat, the 42-foot ''Villa II''. From Shetland he was transferred to England where he joined and trained with the ''Kompani Linge''. He was among the men Larsen choose as crew on M/B ''Arthur'' and sailed several tours with Larsen. He was crewman on M/B ''Siglaos'', M/B ''Feie'', M/B ''Harald'' and M/B ''Heland''. In December 1943, he joined the crew on the submarine chaser ''Hessa'' as engineer, under command of Petter Salen. When ''Hessa'' was under repair, Iversen served as engineer on ''Vigra'' and did one tour on a Norwegian Navy MTB. When ''Hessa'' was back again he rejoined the crew and stayed there until the war ended. Kåre Iversen did 57 tours across the North Sea, most of them as engineer. On 6 December 1944, he married the Scalloway girl Christine 'Cissie' Slater. They stayed in Scalloway after the war and had three daughters. In 1996, Shetland Times Ltd. published Iversen's memoirs, ''I Was a Shetland Bus Man'', which was reprinted in 2004, with a new introduction and the title ''Shetland Bus Man''.

[[File:Statue Shetlandslarsen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Statue of Leif Andreas Larsen in Bergen]]
The first of the Shetland Bus men to lose his life was Nils Nesse, 23, from Bremnes on the island Bømlo south of Bergen. He was killed on 28 October 1941, when German aircraft attacked the ''Siglaos'' on its way to Shetland from Norway. Nesse was buried at Lunna Kirk churchyard with a Scottish ceremony, because there was no Norwegian clergyman to conduct the funeral. His body was moved to his home in Norway in 1948 and a cross marks his grave at Lunna. Nesse was the second Norwegian buried at Lunna Kirk. The first was an unknown sailor buried on 5 February 1940. He was probably from the cargo ship ''Hop'', that had left Bergen on 2 February 1940 and was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The third man was buried 9 June 1942. He was found drifting in the sea by a local crofter, John Johnson from Lunna. The "Shetland–Norwegian Friendship Society" has set up a plaque on the churchyard wall in remembrance to these two unknown men. British naval officer, historian and author [[David Armine Howarth|David Howarth]] (28 July 1912–2 July 1991) requested that his ashes be scattered over the water at Lunna Voe. A memorial plaque is mounted on the churchyard wall at Lunna Kirk.

'''Sitaxentan sodium''' (TBC-11251) is a medication for the treatment of [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]] (PAH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200307-957OC | pmid = 14630619  |vauthors=Barst RJ, Langleben D, Frost A, etal | title = Sitaxsentan therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | year = 2004 | volume = 169 | issue = 4 | pages = 441–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was marketed as '''Thelin''' by Encysive Pharmaceuticals until [[Pfizer]] purchased Encysive in February 2008.  In 2010, Pfizer voluntarily removed sitaxentan from the market due to concerns about liver toxicity.&lt;ref name=Pfizer&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101210/ap_on_bi_ge/us_pfizer_thelin_withdrawal Citing liver damage, Pfizer withdraws Thelin], Associated Press, December 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Sitaxentan  is a [[small molecule]] that [[Endothelin receptor antagonist|blocks]] the action of [[endothelin]] (ET) on the endothelin-A (ET&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor selectively (by a factor of 6000 compared with the ET&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Girgis | first1 = RE | last2 = Frost | first2 = AE | last3 = Hill | first3 = NS | last4 = Horn | first4 = EM | last5 = Langleben | first5 = D | last6 = McLaughlin | first6 = VV | last7 = Oudiz | first7 = RJ | last8 = Robbins | first8 = IM | last9 = Seibold | first9 = JR | last10 = Shapiro | first10 = S. | last11 = Tapson | first11 = V.

J | title = Selective endothelinA receptor antagonism with sitaxsentan for pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | volume = 66 | issue = 11 | pages = 1467–72 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17472992 | pmc = 2111639 | doi = 10.1136/ard.2007.069609| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a sulfonamide class [[endothelin receptor antagonist]] (ERA) and is undergoing [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) review for treating [[pulmonary hypertension]]. The rationale for benefit compared with [[bosentan]], a nonselective ET blocker, is negligible inhibition of the beneficial effects of ET&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation, such as [[nitric oxide]] production and clearance of ET from circulation. In clinical trials, the efficacy of sitaxentan has been much the same as bosentan, but the [[hepatotoxicity]] of sitaxentan outweighs its benefits. Dosing is once daily, as opposed to twice daily for bosentan.

==Regulatory status==
On December 10, 2010 Pfizer announced it would be withdrawing sitaxentan worldwide (both from marketing and from all clinical study use), citing that it is a cause of fatal liver damage.&lt;ref name=Pfizer/&gt;

Sitaxentan was approved for marketing in the European Union in 2006, in Canada in 2006&lt;ref name="Thelin"&gt;{{cite web |date=30 May 2007 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUSBNG28335020070530 |title=UPDATE 1-Encysive gets Canadian approval for hypertension drug |publisher=Reuters |accessdate = 2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Australia in 2007. By February 2008 it had been launched commercially in Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain and Italy.

In March 2006, the FDA recommended an approvable status to sitaxentan but said it would not yet approve the product. In July 2006, sitaxentan received a second approvable letter stating that efficacy outcome issues raised in the context of the STRIDE-2 study were still unresolved. In July 2007, Encysive commenced a formal dispute resolution process in a preliminary meeting with the FDA. In September 2007 the company announced that it was making preparations for another phase III [[clinical trial]] (intended to be named STRIDE-5) to overcome the FDA's concerns.&lt;ref name="STRIDE-5"&gt;{{cite web |date=29 September 2007 |url=http://ir.encysive.com/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=ency&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=1054488|title=Encysive Pharmaceuticals to Conduct Phase III Study With Thelin (Sitaxsentan Sodium) in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension | publisher=PrimeNewswire via COMTEX News Network | accessdate = 2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The takeover by Pfizer resulted in a reconfiguration and extension of these plans, to include combination therapy with [[sildenafil]]. The Sitaxentan Efficacy and Safety Trial With a Randomized Prospective Assessment of Adding Sildenafil (SR-PAAS) was an ongoing program of three clinical trials conducted in the United States (ClinicalTtrials.gov identifiers: NCT00795639, NCT00796666 and NCT00796510) with anticipated completion dates between June 2010 and January 2014.

==Adverse effects==
[[Adverse effect (medicine)|Adverse effects]] observed with sitaxentan are class effects of endothelin receptor antagonists, and include :
* [[liver enzyme]] abnormalities (increased [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]])
* [[headache]]
* [[edema]]
* [[constipation]]
* [[nasal congestion]]
* [[upper respiratory tract infection]]
* [[dizziness]]
* [[insomnia]]
* [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]]

Because sitaxentan inhibits [[metabolism]] of [[warfarin]], a decreased dose of warfarin is needed when co-administered with sitaxentan. This is because warfarin acts to prevent blood from [[clotting]], and if it remains unmetabolized, it can continue to thin the blood.

'''StixCamp''' is a [[BarCamp]] [[unconference]] hosted in a rural area. Organisers of StixCamps aim to engage the local community in technology, often by providing special 'how to' or introduction to technology sessions as part of the schedule. In doing so, a StixCamp aims to help break down the barriers to equitable participation in technology and ICT often faced by those who live in regional and rural locations.

The first StixCamp was held in [[Newstead, Victoria]] at the [http://www.welshmansreef.com/ Welshmans Reef Vineyard] on 14–15 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"Geeks to meet for stix camp event", [[Bendigo Advertiser]], Saturday 14 March 2009 p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of BarCamps, it was organised primarily through social media networks such as [https://twitter.com/stixcampvicau Twitter] and [http://identi.ca/stixcampvicau Identica], and supported by [[blogging]] tools and [[IRC]].

Presentations were given on a wide range of topics, including;
* Separation of presentation and content using [[model–view–controller]] architecture (Zach Miller)
* Inkscape ([[Donna Benjamin]])
* Broadband in the bush (Dave Hall)
* Accessibility ([[Gian Wild]])

Best Talk awards were given to [[Paul Fenwick (software developer)|Paul Fenwick]] for his presentation ''Hacking Other People's Brains'' and to [[James Vautin]] for his presentation on [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]]. [[Maxim Shkylar]] was awarded a Notable Mention for his presentation on XIML.

StixCampNewstead introduced the concept of 'StixBlitz' - a competition aimed at redeveloping the host venue's website in a short period of time.

openPT: a workshop inspired on the 1st StixCamp was organised in 2015 in a rural town of [[Portugal]], [[Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo]] in 2015, a second edition is planned for 2017.

'''Superleague Formula''' was an [[Open wheel car|open wheel single seater]] [[Formula racing|motor racing formula]], which started in 2008, at [[Donington Park]] in the United Kingdom. The league introduced team sponsorship by association football clubs. It used the slogan 'The Beautiful Race: Football at 300&amp;nbsp;km/h'. By 2011 the link with football was fading with more than half the teams no longer associated with football teams. It was founded by businessmen Alex Andreu and Robin Webb. On 19 May 2010, Andreu stepped down in his role as series president,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italiaracing.net/notizia.asp?id=27401&amp;cat=51 |title=ItaliaRacing.Net |publisher=ItaliaRacing.Net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309053145/http://www.italiaracing.net/notizia.asp?id=27401&amp;cat=51 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with his successor named as Alfredo Brisac not many weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=content |url=http://www.expansion.com/2010/08/05/catalunya/1281038666.html |title=Superleague Formula, a la caza de 19 millones de euros, Catalunya |publisher=Expansion.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ran between April and November at the same time as most other European race series. Every team used identical cars and 750-horsepower V-12 engines. The [[Sonangol Group]] was the series' title sponsor from June 2009 until the end of the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sonangol becomes Superleague Formula title sponsor for 2009 and 2010 seasons |url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/Sonangol-becomes-Superleague-Formula-title-sponsor-for-2009-and-2010-seasons |work=superleagueformula.com |publisher=Superleague Formula |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j3NHy6WT?url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/Sonangol-becomes-Superleague-Formula-title-sponsor-for-2009-and-2010-seasons |archivedate=15 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2010-01-19 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of the championship was in doubt after the cancellation of over three-quarters of 2011 season events. In April 2012, when most European motor racing started, there had been no news or information regarding the possibility of a 2012 or 2013 season running. The website updates ceased in 2011,&lt;ref name="superleagueformula.com"&gt;http://www.superleagueformula.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and no further seasons were organised.

==History==
[[Image:Superleague formula demonstration.jpg|thumb|The Superleague Formula prototype car is demonstrated by [[Andy Soucek]] at [[Donington Park]] in July 2008]]
{{Main|List of Superleague Formula seasons}}

Continuing the concept of [[Premier 1 Grand Prix]], the Superleague Formula was announced in 2005, receiving the full approval of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] in December 2005. The goal was to have a starting grid of twenty teams, each with one car. Much of the sales, marketing and technology work would be handled centrally by the league, thus affording a considerable cost-savings to the teams.

The inaugural season, in 2008, was won by Chinese club [[Beijing Guoan (Superleague Formula team)|Beijing Guoan]], driven by Italian [[FIA GT Championship]] racer, [[Davide Rigon]]. The season consisted of six double-headers, featuring 18 clubs, and also brought victories for [[Liverpool F.C. (Superleague Formula team)|Liverpool F.C.]], [[A.C. Milan (Superleague Formula team)|A.C. Milan]], [[PSV Eindhoven (Superleague Formula team)|PSV Eindhoven]], [[F.C. Porto (Superleague Formula team)|F.C. Porto]], [[Sevilla FC (Superleague Formula team)|Sevilla FC]], [[Al Ain (Superleague Formula team)|Al Ain]] and [[Borussia Dortmund (Superleague Formula team)|Borussia Dortmund]]. Superleague Formula's debut race was seen in 62 countries, and 100,000 people watched the twelve races, with 34,000 fans attending the last race in [[Circuito de Jerez|Jerez]], broadcast live in 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reception of Superleague Formula's first season consolidates the championship for 2009 |url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/Reception-of-first-season-consolidates-2009 |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=2010-01-19 |work=superleagueformula.com |publisher=Superleague Formula |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116150302/http://superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/Reception-of-first-season-consolidates-2009 |archivedate=16 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the second season was won by English club [[Liverpool F.C. (Superleague Formula team)|Liverpool F.C.]], driven by Spanish racer [[Adrián Vallés]]. The season consisted of six double-headers, featuring 19 clubs, and brought first victories for [[Tottenham Hotspur (Superleague Formula team)|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[FC Basel 1893 (Superleague Formula team)|FC Basel 1893]], [[Rangers F.C. (Superleague Formula team)|Rangers F.C.]], [[Olympiacos CFP (Superleague Formula team)|Olympiacos CFP]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal (Superleague Formula team)|Sporting CP]], [[R.S.C. Anderlecht (Superleague Formula team)|R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and [[Galatasaray S.K. (Superleague Formula team)|Galatasaray S.K.]]. This was the first season to feature the Super Final format, adding a six car shootout to four of the six rounds. The races were broadcast in 62 countries to a reach of 100 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/SF-Experience/SF-TV/TV-broadcasting ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701071544/http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/SF-Experience/SF-TV/TV-broadcasting |date=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 was the third season and saw the biggest change yet, with the calendar increased from six to twelve race weekends and another increase to both race event and end-of-season prize money.&lt;ref name="1 million euros"&gt;{{cite news|title=Superleague Formula by Sonangol champion set to net one million euro prize money in 2010|url=http://superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/Superleague-Formula-by-Sonangol-champion-set-to-net-one-million-euro-prize-money-in-2010|work=superleagueformula.com|publisher=Superleague Formula|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117190716/http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/Superleague-Formula-by-Sonangol-champion-set-to-net-one-million-euro-prize-money-in-2010|archivedate=17 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An average of 18 clubs competed at each event throughout the season. In a pre-season interview, Superleague Formula's Competition Director Robin Webb said,&lt;ref name="1 million euros"/&gt;
{{cquote|The new prize fund offers drivers and teams an even greater incentive to top the Superleague Formula table come November. I can’t think of anything else in Europe that offers this level of prize money for the winners, not to mention for individual races as in the Super Final’s case. All in all, the series really does now offer drivers the chance to earn a living from motor sport, something that’s not possible in single seater racing outside of Formula 1.}}

After its biggest growth in 2010, 2011 saw a significant contraction with just six football clubs continuing their association into the series fourth season. The remaining cars carried national identities with many more closely associated with the competing drivers rather than any football connection. While an ambitious calendar was announced, several races were cancelled and relocated and as late as September organisers were still seeking to confirm some of its late season races, leaving doubt as to whether the series would have more than half the races of the 2010 season.

After the cancellation of the 2011 Chinese rounds,&lt;ref name="superleagueformula.com"/&gt; there were no news reports on the 2012 season. With many drivers and teams having joined other series, as well as no updates from the Superleague Formula website, the series was discontinued after just four seasons of racing.

==Race format==

[[File:Silverstone 2010 - Pit Wall.jpg|thumb|The pit wall of the [[GU-Racing International|GU-Racing]] team at [[Silverstone Circuit]] during its 2010 round]]
Superleague Formula’s race format incorporated a Saturday qualification and races on Sunday, one with a reverse grid. For each round, the competing teams competed for prize money, plus points in a yearly championship.

===2008===
* Saturday: 45-minute free practice session, qualifying and rookie session.
* Sunday: Two 45-minute races (one with reverse grid).
* €1 million prize money per race weekend.

===New in 2009===
* Saturday: Two 45-minute free practice sessions, 1 hour rookie session and qualifying.
* Sunday: Two '44-minute plus a lap' races (the latter with reverse grid).
* Compulsory pit stop in Races 1 and 2 which must be made between laps 8 and 20. Both races feature a rolling start.
* A third, 5 lap 'Super Final' race in 4 of the 6 events in which the weekend's top six cars/drivers, found based on their combined points scores from the first two races, race to decide a 'Weekend Winner' and the distribution of prize money. This race begins with a standing start.
* €333,000 prize money to share per race weekend, including €5,000 for Race 1 pole position and €3,000, €2,000 and €1,000 for the three podium positions in the first two races as well as overall weekend prize money for the top 20 cars by performance, the most one club can get per weekend is €111,000.&lt;ref name="The Races"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/What-is-SF/Race-format/The-Races|title=The Races|work=superleagueformula.com|publisher=Superleague Formula|accessdate=2010-01-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115021344/http://superleagueformula.com/superleague/What-is-SF/Race-format/The-Races|archivedate=15 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New in 2010===
* Race and qualifying format was largely unchanged from the 2009 season, although practice sessions moved to Friday.
* There was a 'Super Final' race at the end of all twelve events instead of just at select weekends, and which counted for points.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{cite web|title=Superleague Formula 2010 Media Kit|url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/content/download/50404/372888/file/media%20kit_2010.pdf|format=PDF|work=superleagueformula.com|publisher=Superleague Formula|accessdate=2010-04-04|pages=9–10}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The series offered the biggest prize fund in European motorsport with the end-of-season champions set to earn €1 million in prize money. €500,000 went to second place and €250,000 to the third place entry. Over €5 million in total was on offer throughout 2010, with €100,000 going to the 'Weekend Winner' of each of the twelve rounds. It was therefore possible for an entry to earn up to €2.2 million over the course of the season.&lt;ref name="1 million euros"/&gt;
* Drivers had to finish a race, not only start, in order to score points.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt;

===Qualifying===
Superleague Formula employed a unique qualifying system based on a group stage to knock-out format used in some football tournaments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/What-is-SF/Race-format/Qualifying|title=Qualifying|work=superleagueformula.com|publisher=Superleague Formula|accessdate=2010-01-19}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was a draw on the Friday to split cars in Group A and Group B
* No refueling or tyre changing could take place during the qualifying
* Each group in turn had a 15-minute (2008-2009)/10-minute (2010) session to try to be in the fastest four in that group
* Five slowest from the group of the fastest driver went 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th on the grid
* Five slowest from the other group went 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th on the grid
* Quarter Final 1: first from fastest group versus fourth from slowest: single flying lap: loser went 8th on the grid
* Quarter Final 2: first from slowest group versus fourth from fastest: single flying lap: loser went 7th on the grid
* Quarter Final 3: second from fastest group versus third from slowest: single flying lap: loser went 6th on the grid
* Quarter Final 4: second from slowest group versus third from fastest: single flying lap: loser went 5th on the grid
* Semi Final 1: winner from quarter final 1 versus winner from quarter final 4: single flying lap: loser goes 4th on the grid
* Semi Final 2: winner from quarter final 2 versus winner from quarter final 3: single flying lap: loser went 3rd on the grid
* Final: single flying lap: loser went 2nd on the grid, winner got pole position

===Scoring system===
The championship was decided by points, which were awarded according to the position in which a driver classifies at the end of each race, of which there were three per race weekend. The points were allocated as follows:&lt;ref name="The Races"/&gt;

;Race 1 and 2 points
{| class="wikitable"
! Position || 1st || 2nd || 3rd || 4th || 5th || 6th || 7th || 8th || 9th || 10th || 11th || 12th || 13th || 14th || 15th || 16th || 17th || 18th || 19th || 20th || 21st || 22nd || DNF || DNS
|-
! Points || 50 || 45 || 40 || 36 || 32 || 29 || 26 || 23 || 20 || 18 || 16 || 14 || 12 || 10 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 || 0
|}

;Super Final points (since 2010)
{| class="wikitable"
! Position || 1st || 2nd || 3rd || 4th || 5th || 6th || DNQ || DNS
|-
! Points || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 || 0
|}

For the first two seasons the driver did not need to finish the race in order to collect points, but did have to start. However, in 2010 a driver needs to start and finish the race in order to score.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; The same points are awarded for Race 1 as Race 2, despite Race 2 having a reverse grid with the slowest given the advantage at the front. In 2009 began the running of a third race, a 'Super Final', at the end of certain weekends, however no points were awarded this race. As a result, the maximum number of points any football club/driver could score in one round during 2008 or 2009 was 100, by winning both main races. This feat wasn't achieved although [[Sébastien Bourdais]], [[Craig Dolby]], [[Robert Doornbos]] and [[Max Wissel]] all scored 90 points in a weekend by finishing either 2nd and 2nd or 1st and 3rd.

In 2010 however, with the Super Final also counting for points and 6 points going to the winner, the maximum points haul was now 106, achieved by winning all three races during the weekend.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; The record was 92 points, held by [[Craig Dolby]] from the [[2010 Silverstone Superleague Formula round]].

{{Main|List of Superleague Formula circuits}}

All of the circuits were existing racetracks except for the Beijing International Street Circuit which was constructed for this competition. Most of the rounds were held in Europe, although rounds were held in China. In total, 21 different circuits from 8 countries have hosted a race weekend. The first to do so was [[Donington Park]], where the first races, at its [[2008 Donington Park Superleague Formula round|2008 round]], were held. Only [[Circuit Zolder]] hosted races in every season of the competition.

In July 2010, it was announced that the series would race for the first time outside of Europe by having two events in two successive weekends in China on 3 &amp; 10 October that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Chinese track gets Superleague|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/85053|first=Charles|last=Bradley|work=autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Webb described the venture as "a significant moment in the championship’s history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/Ordos-to-host-first-of-groundbreaking-Chinese-rounds ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Robin Webb stated he wanted the formula to eventually increase to 26 cars and a more diverse range of circuits. He expected the formula to attract more big global clubs and was keen to promote the idea that "Superleague Formula combines the passion of football with the thrill of auto racing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Superleague Formula even te gast op Zolder | language = Dutch | url = http://www.gpnu.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=220:superleague-formula-even-te-gast-op-zolder&amp;catid=3:slf&amp;Itemid=37 | date = 18 June 2009 | accessdate = 2010-01-19 | work = gpnu.nl | publisher = GPNU}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cars were built by [[Panoz Auto Development]] under the [[Élan Motorsport Technologies]] banner and officially named the [[Panoz DP09]]. They are powered by 750&amp;nbsp;bhp, 4.2 litre, V12 engines designed by US-owned [[Menard Competition Technologies]]. Élan previously manufactured the [[Panoz DP01]] for the [[Champ Car]] series, as well as cars for other championships.

The chassis was built with a two-metre wide track, using under-body aerodynamics to create the needed conditions for increased overtaking opportunities. The cars were subjected to the lengthy FIA safety tests during development stages in 2007.

===Regulations===
* The cars were driven without the aid of traction control, launch control or anti-stall, leaving a lot down to the skill of the driver.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt;
* [[Michelin]] were the sole tyre supplier in Superleague Formula. Cars were allowed four new sets of tyres throughout a race weekend, lasting practice sessions, qualifying and all the races. Under conditions of rain, there was no limit to how many sets of wet tyres that can be used.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt;
* A new 'Push to Pass' button was fitted to cars for 2010. The idea, previously successful in [[A1 Grand Prix]], gave the car 12,000rpm for a minimum of 15 seconds, 1,000rpm more than the normal rev limit of 11,000rpm. Drivers could use the extra horsepower advantage to attempt to overtake another car. After the 15 seconds, the 'power boost' stopped once the car's revs dropped back to below 9,000rpm. The 'Push to Pass' button could be used a maximum of eight times by a driver during both races. After a period on the 'power boost', the extra power option was unavailable for 120 seconds. The 'Push to Pass' option was not available during practice sessions or qualifying.&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt;

===Performance===
At [[2009 Magny-Cours Superleague Formula round|Magny-Cours in 2009]], the best qualifying time for a Superleague Formula car was 1:26.391, almost 11.5 seconds slower than the fastest [[2008 French Grand Prix#Qualifying|qualifying time for an F1 car in 2008]] of 1:15.024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualification|url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/Results/By-round/2009/SF-Round-1-France/Qualification|date=27 June 2009|work=superleagueformula.com|publisher=Superleague Formula|accessdate=2009-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630031356/http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/Results/By-round/2009/SF-Round-1-France/Qualification|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Superleague Formula and Formula One raced at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in 2009 where similar dry qualifying conditions meant a better time comparison was possible. The fastest F1 time at the [[2009 Italian Grand Prix]] was a 1:22.955, whereas at the [[2009 Monza Superleague Formula round]], a month later, the fastest SF time was 1:36.444, 13.5 seconds slower. This makes the speed of Superleague Formula car comparable to the [[World Series by Renault]] cars.

On 14 January 2010, Menard Competition Technologies received a Motorsport Industry Association’s award for Technology and Innovation for its "outstanding design and engineering work undertaken on the Superleague V12 racing engine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/MCT-wins-coveted-business-award|title=MCT wins coveted business award|work=superleagueformula.com|publisher=Superleague Formula|date=21 January 2010|accessdate=2010-02-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501185437/http://www.superleagueformula.com/superleague/News-Media/News-archive/MCT-wins-coveted-business-award|archivedate=1 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6720">'''The Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival''' is an annual [[music festival]] that takes place in Stephens Lake Park in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. The festival features international, national, regional and local artists, both established and emerging, from the genres of roots, [[blues]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Country music|country]], [[Folk_music|folk]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Soul music|soul]]. The Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival is a three-day event that is typically held during the last weekend of September. 

The festival includes over 30 live music performances on two stages, food and beverage vendors, craft vendors, a Ferris wheel and art installations. The festival also hosts a half marathon and 10k race and a gospel celebration during the festival weekend. The festival is organized by Thumper Entertainment, which also manages the non-profit [http://missouribits.org/ Roots N Blues Foundation] in support of Blues in the Schools, a youth music education program.

== History ==
The Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival began in 2007 as a free promotional event celebrating the 150-year birthday of Boone County National Bank (now Central Bank of Boone County) on the streets of downtown Columbia, Missouri. The 2007 Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival was organized by advertising agency [[Woodruff (company)|Woodruff Sweitzer]] with the help of Richard King, then-owner of [[The Blue Note (Columbia, Missouri)|The Blue Note]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;McKinstry, Eric; Sadler, John. [http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/roots-n-blues-n-bbq-years-in-the-making-and/article_1dbf5476-6899-11e6-af98-7fee7dc5bd8e.html “Roots N Blues N BBQ: 10 years in the making and still going strong”], ‘’[[Columbia Missourian]]’’, Columbia, Missouri, 2 September 2016. Retrieved 1 August 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallgher, Natalie. [http://www.pitch.com/music/article/20561855/richard-king-talks-up-this-years-roots-n-blues-n-bbq-festival “Richard King talks up this year’s Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival”], ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'', 22 September 2015. Retrieved on 1 August 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; The City of Columbia shut down ten city blocks in downtown Columbia for the festival, which drew a crowd of around 70,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2007, the Blues in the Schools program was formed by King and local musician and educator TJ Wheeler.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The program brings music and cultural education to elementary, middle school and high school students across mid-Missouri. In 2013, the Roots N Blues Foundation was formed to manage the program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2008, Thumper Entertainment was established and took over organization and operation of the festival. Woodruff Sweitzer and King continued ownership of the festival and Thumper Entertainment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

In 2013, the festival was moved to Stephens Lake Park. After the change of location, the festival saw a decline in attendance, from 52,000 in the year prior to just over 23,000. The drop in attendance was likely due to an elimination of free attendance areas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Denney, Andrew. [http://www.columbiatribune.com/fd691730-2d80-11e3-a162-10604b9f6eda.html “Roots N Blues’ new location had smaller attendance”], “[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]”, 5 October 2013. Retrieved on 1 August 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the addition of a green vendor program marked a move toward sustainability. A set of guidelines for food and craft vendors, which includes replacing styrofoam and plastic plates and utensils with biodegradable alternatives, recycling fry oil and composting food scraps, intends to help minimize the festival's ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voxmagazine.com/news/features/going-green-at-rnbnbbq/article_af50a0a0-542c-5b85-a4de-dbb93724c6f0.html|title=Going Green at RNBNBBQ|last=O'Brien|first=Caleb|date=24 September 2014|website=Vox Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For the geographical place see [[Tonto Basin]]

'''''Tonto Basin''''' is a western novel written by [[Zane Grey]].

==Origin==
''Tonto Basin'' is the original version of the shorter novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To The Last Man]]'' (1921). Grey submitted the manuscript of ''Tonto Basin'' to the magazine ''The Country Gentleman,'' which published it in serialization as ''To the Last Man'' from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the  original leaving out much of the [[backstory]] and [[Characterisation|character development]]. This shorter version was published as a [[book]] by [[Harper Brothers]] in 1921.

==Plot introduction==
A story of a feud between two families, the evil it causes, and the power of love to transcend all.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with 24-year-old Jean Isbel in the last stages of a multi-week trip from Oregon to the frontier in Arizona where his family had moved four years earlier to start a cattle ranch. As he nears his destination he meets a woman in the woods, and falls in love at first sight. As they part they learn that they are mortal enemies. She is Ellen Jorth, and her family is locked in a deadly feud with his.

Jean dreads the part his father, Gaston, wants him to play in the feud. He can’t get Ellen out of his mind. They meet again and his words awake in her doubt and fear that her father, Lee Jorth, is not an honorable man but in fact a horse thief and cattle rustler. As events unfold her fears are proved true. Through thick and thin Jean Isbel defends Ellen’s honor and believes the best of her.

The feud erupts into fatal gun battles, first at the Isbel ranch house, and then at the general store in the nearby town. Most of the Isbel and Jorth clans are killed, with several of their allies. The remnant of the Jorths flee with Ellen in tow to a hide-out hidden in a deep box cañon.

Jean and his allies track them and there is a deadly gun battle in the woods nearby. Ellen is forced by one of the three remaining Jorth allies to flee once again. During their flight their horse is shot out from under them. Ellen now on foot meets one of the dying Isbels and finally learns the certain truth that her father, family, and their allies were horse thieves and cattle rustlers as she feared.

When she finally makes her way back to the hide-out, she arrives just after Jean has been forced to take refuge in the loft, unknown to her. One of the two remaining rustlers attacks her with rape in mind but is interrupted by the arrival of the other rustler. Ellen discovers Jean during this interruption. When the rustler returns a few minutes later, Ellen is forced to kill him to protect herself and Jean. A minute later Jean kills the last rustler.

The story ends with Jean and Ellen declaring their love for each other.

==Themes==
The book is concerned with the destruction deadly violence wreaks on those family members who survive. Grey writes about the intense concern Jean feels for the impact the violence will have on the wives and children whose husbands and fathers will die in the feud.

The feud is caused by a love triangle between Gaston Isbel, Lee Jorth, and Ellen the woman both love, and the mother of Ellen Jorth. The story explores how love, betrayal, and jealousy can engender a hate which leads two men to destroy their families, without a thought to the pain and suffering of those relatives who will be left to bury the dead.

Ellen grows from a naïve girl to a woman of understanding under the severe trial of the events which overtake her. She begins to examine critically her own behavior with wisdom and insight. She grows and matures emotionally and psychologically, becoming aware that her father whom she had supported with unquestioning trust, is in fact a scoundrel, a thief, and a thoroughly dishonorable rogue. At the end she acts decisively and fatally to protect herself, her virtue, and the man she loves.

==Publication==
In the early 1990s, [[Jon Tuska]], was researching the [[filmography]] of Zane Grey. During this research he discovered that ''[[Last of the Duanes (novel)|Last of the Duanes]]'' and ''[[Rangers of the Lone Star]]'' were much altered from the [[holograph]] found "in the bottom drawer of a file cabinet in the Zane Grey, Inc. room where it had survived for eighty years.".&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 8. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused him to request that they "tell me of any other manuscripts...that had  met a similar fate."&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 9. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was the discovery of the complete holographic [[manuscript]] of the novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To the Last Man]]''. A comparison of the holograph with ''To the Last Man'' revealed that the holograph was much longer, and contained detail which altered the meaning of the story. The complete uncut version was published in 2004.

'''Workplace bullying''' is a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behaviour: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical [[school bullying|school bully]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, [[bullying]] in the workplace is reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology'', 84(4), 799-816.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization.  Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |title=The Silent Epidemic: Workplace Bullying |last=Williams |first=Ray |work=Psychology Today |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=2016-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20151121235011/https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201105/the-silent-epidemic-workplace-bullying |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also take place as overbearing supervision, constant criticism, and they may work at hospice

==First known documented use==
The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
While there is no universally accepted formal definition of workplace bullying, several researchers have endeavoured to define it:
* According to Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf and Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bullying and emotional abuse in the workplace: International perspectives in research and practice|authors=Stale Einarsen, Helge Hoel, Cary Cooper|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|date=2003|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bullying at work means harassing, offending, socially excluding someone or negatively affecting someone’s work tasks. In order for the label bullying (or mobbing) to be applied to a particular activity, interaction or process it has to occur repeatedly and regularly (e.g. weekly) and over a period of time (e.g. about six months). Bullying is an escalated process in the course of which the person confronted ends up in an inferior position and becomes the target of systematic negative social acts."
* According to [[Sarah J. Tracy|Tracy]], Lutgen-Sandvik, and Alberts, researchers associated with the Arizona State University's Project for Wellness and Work-Life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/about/wellness_and_worklife |title=Project for Wellness and Work-Life (PWWL) &amp;#124; Human Communication |publisher=Humancommunication.clas.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210124054/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/about/wellness_and_worklife |archivedate=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; workplace bullying is most often "''a combination of tactics in which numerous types of hostile communication and behaviour are used''"&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=151–152|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|doi=10.1177/0893318906291980|volume=20|issue=2|issn=0893-3189|first1=Sarah J.|last1=Tracy|first2=Pamela|last2=Lutgen-Sandvik|first3=Jess K.|last3=Alberts|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/20/2/148.abstract|title=Nightmares, Demons and Slaves, Exploring the Painful Metaphors of Workplace Bullying|date=2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123204945/http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/20/2/148.abstract|archivedate=23 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gary Namie|Gary and Ruth Namie]]&lt;ref name="namiedef"&gt;Namie, Gary and Ruth [http://www.workplacebullying.org/targets/problem/definition.html Workplace Bullying Institute Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; define workplace bullying as "''repeated, health-harming mistreatment, verbal abuse, or conduct which is threatening, humiliating, intimidating, or sabotage that interferes with work or some combination of the three''."
* Pamela Lutgen-Sandvik&lt;ref name="quit"&gt;Lutgen-Sandvik, Pamela [http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~lutgensa/Lutgen%20Sandvik%202006%20Resistance%20to%20Bullying%20CMM.pdf Take This Job and ... : Quitting and Other Forms of Resistance to Workplace Bullying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113132410/http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~lutgensa/Lutgen%20Sandvik%202006%20Resistance%20to%20Bullying%20CMM.pdf |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expands this definition, stating that workplace bullying is "''persistent verbal and nonverbal aggression at work, that includes personal attacks, social ostracism, and a multitude of other painful messages and hostile interactions''."   
* Catherine Mattice and Karen Garman define workplace bullying as "''systematic aggressive communication, manipulation of work, and acts aimed at humiliating or degrading one or more individual that create an unhealthy and unprofessional power imbalance between bully and target(s), result in psychological consequences for targets and co-workers, and cost enormous monetary damage to an organization’s bottom line''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=aglecdiss |title=Mattice, C.M., &amp; Garman, K.

* Employers can also be bullies. Bad employers use bullying strategically to rid the workplace of good employees to avoid a legal obligation, such as paying [[unemployment compensation]] or a worker's compensation claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|title=Lost in Discussion: Employers that Bully|date=4 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170319123420/http://abusergoestowork.com/employers-that-bully/|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers also use bullying tactics to drive out employees who demand legal pay or overtime or assert a legal right to organize collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|title=Workplace Bullying: The Big Picture|date=25 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170318001323/http://abusergoestowork.com/workplace-bullying-the-big-picture/|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of complaint filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission involves retaliation, where an employer harasses or bullies an employee for objecting to illegal discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|title=Charge Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317054201/https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Barnes, author of ''Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace'', argues that employers that bully are a critical but often overlooked aspect of the problem in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Patricia G. (2012), "Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees &amp; Psychopaths in the Workplace." {{ISBN|978-0-615-64241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it can occur in a variety of contexts and forms, it is also useful to define workplace bullying by the key features that these behaviours possess. Bullying is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;Einarsen, 1999; Keashly &amp; Harvey 2004; Lutgen-Sandvik, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repetition (occurs regularly)
* Duration (is enduring)
* Escalation (increasing aggression)
* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] disparity (the target lacks the power to successfully defend themselves)
* Attributed intent

This distinguishes bullying from isolated behaviours and other forms of [[Occupational stress|job stress]] and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae.&lt;ref&gt;See: Thomas Sebok and Mary Chavez Rudolph, "Cases Involving Allegations of Workplace Bullying: Threats to Ombuds Neutrality and Other Challenges," JIOA, 2010, vol.3, no 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.

According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik,&lt;ref name="cycle"&gt;Lutgin-Sandvik, Pamela, [http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf The Communicative Cycle of Employee Emotional Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612011734/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/undergraduate/pdf/TheCommunicativeCycleofEmployeeEmotionalAbuse-GenerationandRegenerationofWorkplaceMistreatme.pdf |date=12 June 2010 }}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of unifying language to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and is in need of a specific vernacular.

Euphemisms intended to trivialize bullying and its impact on bullied people include: incivility, disrespect, difficult people, personality conflict, negative conduct, and ill treatment.  Bullied people are labelled as insubordinate when they resist the bullying treatment.

There is no exact definition for bullying behaviours in workplace, which is why different terms and definitions are common. For example, mobbing is a commonly used term in France and Germany, where it refers to a "mob" of bullies, rather than a single bully; this phenomenon is not often seen in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;LEYMANN, H., 1990. Mobbing and Psychological Terror at Workplaces. Violence and victims, 5(2), pp. 119-126&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}} In the United States, aggression and emotional abuse are frequently used terms, whereas harassment is the term preferred in Finland.  Workplace bullying is primarily used in Australia, UK, and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;BARON, R.A. and NEUMAN, J.H., 1998.

== Statistics ==
Bosses are the most common bullies. In fact, approximately 72% of bullies outrank their victims.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Kinsey Goman, “Is Your Boss a Bully?” Forbes, April 6, 2014, {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918173233/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ |archivedate=18 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }} carolkinseygoman/2014/04/06/is-your-boss-a-bully/&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics&lt;ref name="genderstats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |title=The 2007 WBI-Zogby Survey |publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107071240/http://www.workplacebullying.org/research.html |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 2007 WBI-Zogby survey show that 13% of U.S. employees report being bullied currently, 24% say they have been bullied in the past and an additional 12% say they have witnessed workplace bullying. Nearly half of all American workers (49%) report that they have been affected by workplace bullying, either being a target themselves or having witnessed abusive behaviour against a co-worker.

Although socioeconomic factors may play a role in the abuse, researchers from the Project for Wellness and Work-Life&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt; suggest that "workplace bullying, by definition, is not explicitly connected to demographic markers such as sex and ethnicity".&lt;ref name="nightmares pp. 151-152"/&gt;  Because one in ten employees experiences workplace bullying, the prevalence of this issue is cause for great concern, even as initial data about this issue are reviewed.

According to the 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] (NHIS-OHS), the national prevalence rate for workers reporting having been threatened, bullied, or harassed by anyone on the job was 8%.&lt;ref name = alterman1&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alterman|first1= T|last2= Luckhaupt|first2= SE|last3= Dahlhamer|first3= JM|last4= Ward|first4= BW|last5= Calvert|first5= GM|title= Job insecurity, work-family imbalance, and hostile work environment: Prevalence data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey|journal= Am J Ind Med|volume=56|issue=6|pages=660–669|date=June 2013| pmid=23023603|doi=10.1002/ajim.22123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Dr. Judy Fisher-Blando&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |title=The Lentz Leadership Institute LLC |publisher=Lentzleadership.com |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808110739/http://www.lentzleadership.com/index.php?page_name=dr.judy_blando |archivedate=8 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a doctoral research dissertation on ''Aggressive behaviour: Workplace Bullying and Its Effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf |title=Workplace Bullying: Aggressive Behavior and its effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity |last=Fisher-Blando| first=Judith Lynn|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019123522/http://www.workplaceviolence911.com/docs/20081215.pdf| archive-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study determined that almost 75% of employees surveyed had been affected by workplace bullying, whether as a target or a witness. Further research showed the types of bullying behaviour, and organizational support.

=== Gender ===
In terms of gender, the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007)&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; states that women appear to be at greater risk of becoming a bullying target, as 57% of those who reported being targeted for abuse were women. Men are more likely to participate in aggressive bullying behaviour (60%), however when the bully is a woman her target is more likely to be a woman as well (71%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |title=How a woman becomes a bully – The Sunday Times, June 7 |work=The Times |date=11 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611225342/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/appointments/article6447287.ece |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the research of Samnani and Singh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samnani|first1=Al-Karim|last2=Singh|first2=Parbudyal|title=Aggression and Violent Behavior|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|date=November–December 2012|volume=17|issue=6|pages=581–589|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012), it concludes the findings from previous 20 years' literature and claims that in terms of the gender factor, inconsistent findings could not support the differences across gender.

In a study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|title=CDC - Worker Health Information from the National Health Interview Survey - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=15 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228145656/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the NHIS-OHS confirms the previous finding, as higher prevalence rates for being threatened, bullied, or harassed were identified for women (9%) compared with men (7%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

=== Race ===

Race also may play a role in the experience of workplace bullying. According to the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007),&lt;ref name="genderstats" /&gt; the comparison of reported combined bullying (current + ever bullied) prevalence percentages reveals the pattern from most to least:
# Hispanics (52.1%)
# Blacks (46%)
# Whites (33.5%)
# Asian (30.6%)

The reported rates of witnessing bullying were:
# Asian (28.5%)
# Blacks (21.1%)
# Hispanics (14%)
# Whites (10.8%)

The percentages of those reporting that they have neither experienced nor witnessed mistreatment were:
# Asians (57.3%)
# Whites (49.7%)
# Hispanics (32.2%)
# Blacks (23.4%)

Research psychologist [[Tony Buon]] published one of the first reviews of bullying in China in the prestigious Journal PKU Business Review in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Buon, T (2005). The Management of Workplace Bullying. PKU Business Review, 5, 74-79, Peking University (PRC) (Published in Chinese){{cite web |url=.http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709151722/http://www.buon.net/PKUBullying.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital status===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a [[hostile work environment]] were identified for divorced or separated workers compared to married workers, widowed workers, and never married workers.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Education===
Higher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers with some college education or workers with  high school diploma or GED, compared to workers with less than a high school education.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Age===
Lower prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers aged 65 and older compared to workers in other age groups.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

With respect to age, conflicting findings have been reported. A study by Einarsen and Skogstad (1996) indicates older employees tend to be more likely to be bullied than younger ones.

===Industry===
Among industry groups, workers with higher prevalence rates of a hostile work environment, compared to all adults employed at some time in a 12-month period leading up to a survey in 2010 (8%), were in public administration (16%) and retail trade industries (10%). Lower prevalence rates of a hostile work environment were reported among those working in construction (5%); finance and insurance (5%); manufacturing (5%); and professional, scientific, and technical services industries (6%).&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

===Occupation===
For occupational groups, workers in protective service reported a higher prevalence rate (25%) of hostile work environments compared to the prevalence rate for all adults employed at some time in the past 12 months. Workers in community and social service occupations also experienced a relatively high rate (16%). Lower prevalence rates were observed among architecture and engineering (4%), computer and mathematical (4%), business and financial operations (5%), and construction and extraction (5%) occupations.&lt;ref name="alterman1"/&gt;

== Profiling ==
Researchers Caitlin Buon and [[Tony Buon]] have suggested that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging &lt;ref name="buon.net"&gt;Buon T &amp; Buon, C (2007) The Bully Within. Counselling at Work. Summer {{cite web |url=http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150510100132/http://buon.net/BullyingJournalArticle.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that the "bully" profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware of what they are doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. [[Tony Buon]] and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating  interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions  and  emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal  interactions.&lt;ref name="buon.net"/&gt;

== Relationship among participants ==
Based on research by H. Hoel and C.L. Cooper, most the perpetrators are [[supervisor]]s. The second most common group is peers, followed by subordinates and customers.&lt;ref&gt;HOEL, H. and COOPER, C.L., 2000. Destructive conflict and bullying at work. Manchester School of Management, UMIST Manchester, UK., http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017010389228&lt;/ref&gt; The three main relationships among the participants in workplace bullying: 
* Between supervisor and subordinate
* Among co-workers
* Employees and customers

Bullying may also occur between an organization and its employees.

Bullying behaviour by supervisors toward subordinates typically manifests as an abuse of power by the supervisor in the workplace. Bullying behaviours by supervisors may be associated with a culture of bullying and the management style of the supervisors. An authoritative management style, specifically, often includes bullying behaviours, which can make subordinates fearful and allow supervisors to bolster their authority over others.

On the other hand, some researchers suggest that bullying behaviours can be a positive force for performance in the workplace. Workplace bullying may contribute to organizational power and control.

However, if an organization wishes to discourage bullying in the workplace, strategies and policies must be put into place to dissuade and counter bullying behavior. Lack of monitoring or of punishment/corrective action will result in an organizational culture that supports/tolerates bullying.

In addition to supervisor – subordinate bullying, bullying behaviours also occur between colleagues. Peers can be either the target or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will typically choose sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators usually "win" since witnesses do not want to be the next target. This outcome encourages perpetrators to continue their bullying behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they do, thereby proliferating bullying in the organization.

Maarit Varitia, a workplace bullying researcher, found that 20% of interviewees who experienced workplace bullying attributed their being targeted to their differences from others.&lt;ref&gt;MAARIT VARTIA, 1996. The sources of bullying–psychological work environment and organizational climate. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 5(2), pp. 203-214&lt;/ref&gt;

The third relationship in the workplace is between employees and customers. Although less frequent, such cases play a significant role in the efficiency of the organization. Overly stressed or distressed employees may be less able to perform optimally and can impact the quality of service overall.

The fourth relationship in the workplace is between the organization or system and its employees. An article by Andreas Liefooghe (2012) notes that many employees describe their employer as a "bully."

These cases, the issue is not simply an organizational culture or environmental factors facilitating bullying, but bullying-like behaviour by an employer against an employee. Tremendous power imbalances between an organization and its employees enables the employer to "legitimately exercise" power (e.g., by monitoring and controlling employees) in a manner consistent with bullying.

Although the terminology of bullying traditionally implies an interpersonal relationship between the perpetrator and target, organizations' or other collectives' actions can constitute bullying both by definition and in their impacts on targets. However, while defining bullying as an interpersonal phenomenon is considered legitimate, classifying incidences of employer exploitation, retaliation, or other abuses of power against an employee as a form of bullying is often not taken as seriously.

== Organizational culture ==
{{Main|Organizational culture|Bullying culture}}
Bullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that
they have the support, or at least the implicit blessing of senior managers to carry on their abusive
and bullying behaviour.&lt;ref name=SilentEpidemic/&gt; Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as
acceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. People may be bullied irrespective of their organizational status or rank, including senior managers, which indicates the possibility of a negative domino effect, where bullying may cascade downwards, as the targeted supervisors might offload their own [[aggression]] onto their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the [[boardroom]] may actually threaten the [[productivity]] of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical culture ==
{{Main|Culture}}
Research investigating the acceptability of the bullying behaviour across different cultures (e.g.g Power et al., 2013) clearly shows that culture matters here. One's culture affects the perception of the acceptable behaviour. 
One's national background also influences the prevalence of workplace bullying (Harvey et al., 2009; Hoel et al., 1999; Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

Humane orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying for WRB (Work related bullying).
Performance orientation is positively associated with the acceptance of bullying. Future orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying. A culture of femininity suggests that individuals who live and work in this kind of culture tend to value [[interpersonal relationships]] to a greater degree.

Three broad dimensions  have been mentioned in relation to workplace bullying: power distance; masculinity versus femininity; and [[individualism]] versus [[collectivism]] (Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).

In Confucian Asia, which has a higher performance orientation than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, bullying may be seen as an acceptable price to pay for performance. The value Latin America holds for personal connections with employees and the higher humane orientation of Sub-Saharan Africa may help to explain their distaste for bullying. A culture of individualism in the US implies competition, which may increase the likelihood of workplace bullying situations.

==Culture of fear==
{{Main|Culture of fear}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]], i.e., leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755-778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies "get away with it," a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name="Organisational"/&gt; Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"/&gt;

In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[Turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had "got away with it" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

==Kiss up kick down==
{{Main|Kiss up kick down}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their abusive behaviour hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against his. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm | last=Petrecca |first= Laura |date=27 Dec 2010| title= Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. |work=USA Today | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160307090535/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2010-12-28-bullyboss28_CV_N.htm |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf |title= How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT |date=15 Oct 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313114139/http://aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf| archive-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | last=Donohue | first=Mary |title=Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager|date=10 Feb 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091303/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html | archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
their fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt;DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this ''kiss up kick down'' strategy:&lt;ref&gt;T Portis (2 Jan 2011) Understanding the Psychology of the Kiss-Up/Kick-Down Leader Lightkeepers Journal&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A bully's mistakes are always concealed or [[blamed]] on underlings or circumstances beyond their control
* A bully keeps the target under constant [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]
* A bully's power base is fear, not respect
* A bully withholds information from subordinates and keeps the information flow top-down only
* A bully blames [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] and problems on subordinate's lack of competence, poor attitude, or character flaws
* A bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not

==Fight or flight==
{{Main|Fight-or-flight response}}
The most typical reactions to workplace bullying are to do with the survival instinct – "fight or flight" – and
these are probably a victim's healthier responses to bullying. Flight is a legitimate and valid response to bullying. It is very common, especially in organizations in which upper management cannot or will not deal with the bullying. In hard economic times, however, flight may not be an option, and fighting may be the only choice.&lt;ref name=Killoren&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting the bullying can require near heroic action, especially if the bullying targets just one or two individuals. It can also be a difficult challenge. There are some times when confrontation is called for. First, there is always a chance that the bully boss is labouring under the impression that this is the way to get things done and does not recognize the havoc being wrought on subordinates.&lt;ref name=Killoren/&gt;

== Typology of bullying behaviours ==
With some variations, the following typology of workplace bullying behaviours has been adopted by a number of academic researchers. The typology uses five different categories.&lt;ref name="Rayner"&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H, [[Cary Cooper|Cooper CL]] Workplace Bullying: What we know, who is to blame and what can we do? (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Peyton"&gt;Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Threat to professional status''' – including belittling opinions, public professional [[humiliation]], accusations regarding lack of effort, intimidating use of [[discipline]] or competence procedures.
# '''Threat to personal standing''' – including [[Social undermining|undermining]] personal integrity, destructive [[innuendo]] and [[sarcasm]], making inappropriate jokes about the target, persistent [[teasing]], name calling, [[insults]], [[intimidation]].
# '''[[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolation]]''' – including preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or [[Social exclusion|excluding]].
# '''Overwork''' – including undue pressure, impossible deadlines, unnecessary disruptions.
# '''[[Destabilisation]]''' – including failure to acknowledge good work, allocation of meaningless tasks, removal of responsibility, repeated reminders of blunders, [[setting up to fail|setting target up to fail]], [[Moving the goalposts|shifting goal posts]] without telling the target.

==Tactics==
Research by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that the following are the 25 most common workplace bullying tactics:&lt;ref name=namie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/2013/04/19/top-25 |title=Workplace Bullying Institute Top 25 workplace bullying tactics|publisher=Workplacebullying.org |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-26| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808074613/http://www.workplacebullying.org/top-25/ |archive-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abusive workplace behaviours ==
According to Bassman, common abusive workplace behaviours are:&lt;ref&gt;Bassman ES Abuse in the workplace: management remedies and bottom line impact (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[respect|Disrespecting]] and [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluing]] the individual, often through disrespectful and devaluing language or [[verbal abuse]]
# Overwork and devaluation of personal life (particularly salaried workers who are not compensated)
# [[Harassment]] through [[micromanagement]] of tasks and time

# Managing by threat and [[intimidation]]
# [[plagiarism|Stealing credit]] and taking unfair advantage
# Preventing access to opportunities
# Downgrading an employee's capabilities to justify [[Layoff|downsizing]]
# Impulsive destructive behaviour

According to Hoel and [[Cary Cooper|Cooper]], common abusive workplace behaviours are:&lt;ref&gt;Hoel, H. &amp; [[Cary Cooper|Cooper, C.L]].

# Having key areas of responsibility removed or replaced with more trivial or unpleasant tasks.
Abusive cyberbullying in the workplace can have serious socioeconomic and psychological consequences on the victim. Workplace cyberbullying can lead to sick leave due to depression which in turn can lead to loss of profits for the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randy A. Sancone &amp; Lori A.

=== Blue-collar jobs ===
Bullying has been identified as prominent in [[blue collar]] jobs including on the oil rigs, and in mechanical areas and machine shops, warehouses and factories. It is thought that [[intimidation]] and fear of [[retributive justice|retribution]] cause decreased incident reports, which, in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries, would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]].

{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors.

== Forms ==
[[Tim Field]] suggested that workplace bullying takes these forms:&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullyonline.org/workbully/bully.htm |last=Field |first=Tim |title=Bullying: what is it? | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512150521/http://bullyonline.org/index.php/bullying/15-am-i-being-bullied |archive-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Serial bullying''' — the source of all dysfunction can be traced to one individual, who picks on one employee after another and destroys them, then moves on. Probably the most common type of bullying.
* '''Secondary bullying''' — the pressure of having to deal with a serial bully causes the general behaviour to decline and sink to the lowest level.
* '''Pair bullying''' — this takes place with two people, one active and verbal, the other often watching and listening.
* '''Gang bullying or group bullying''' — is a serial bully with colleagues. Gangs can occur anywhere, but flourish in corporate bullying climates. It is often called [[mobbing]] and usually involves [[scapegoating]] and [[victimisation]].
* '''Vicarious bullying''' — two parties are encouraged to fight. This is the typical "[[Triangulation (psychology)|triangulation]]" where the aggression gets passed around.
* '''Regulation bullying''' — where a serial bully forces their target to comply with rules, regulations, procedures or laws regardless of their appropriateness, applicability or necessity.
* '''Residual bullying''' — after the serial bully has left or been fired, the behaviour continues. It can go on for years.
* '''[[Legal abuse|Legal bullying]] ''' — the bringing of a vexatious legal action to control and punish a person.
* '''Pressure bullying or unwitting bullying''' — having to work to unrealistic time scales or inadequate resources.
* '''Corporate bullying''' — where an employer abuses an employee with impunity, knowing the law is weak and the job market is soft.

Adult bullying can come in an assortment of forms. There are about five distinctive types of adult bullies. A narcissistic bully is described as a self-centred person whose egotism is frail and possesses the need to put others down. An impulsive bully is someone who acts on bullying based on stress or being upset at the moment. A physical bully uses physical injury and the threat of harm to abuse their victims, while a verbal bully uses demeaning and cynicism to debase their victims. Lastly, a secondary adult bully is portrayed as a person that did not start the initial bullying but participates in afterwards to avoid being bullied themselves ("Adult Bullying").

== Emotional intelligence ==
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Workplace}}
Workplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA&gt;Hutchinson, M. &amp; Hurley, J. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x/ Exploring leadership capability and emotional intelligence as moderators of workplace bullying.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 553-562. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the [[organizational structure]] and in pursuing [[goal]]s. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high [[social intelligence]] and low [[emotional intelligence]] (EI).&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB&gt;Hutchinson, M. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x/ Bullying as workgroup manipulation: a model for understanding patterns of victimization and contagion within the workgroup.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 563-571. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at [[Social influence|influencing]] others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be [[persuaded]] to engage in unethical behaviour.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalizes]] the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; Hutchinson &amp; Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and [[leadership]] skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying.

== Related concepts  ==

=== Abusive supervision  ===
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.&lt;ref name=Tepper&gt;Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power and control===
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
A power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidv-usa.com/wheel.html Power &amp; Control in the Workplace] American Institute on Domestic Violence&lt;/ref&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* overt actions
* covert actions

}}

=== Workplace mobbing ===
{{Main|Workplace mobbing}}
Workplace mobbing overlaps with workplace bullying. The concept originated from the study of animal behaviour. It concentrates on bullying by a group.

=== Workplace incivility ===
{{Main|Workplace incivility}}
Workplace bullying overlaps to some degree with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying,&lt;ref&gt;Beale, D. (2001). Monitoring bullying in the workplace. In N. Tehrani (Ed.), Building a culture of respect, managing bullying at work.&lt;/ref&gt; but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.&lt;ref name="Rayner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peyton" /&gt;

== Personality disorders and dysfunctional personality characteristics==

=== Executives ===
In 2005, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the [[University of Surrey]], UK, interviewed and gave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in the UK. They found that three out of eleven [[personality disorders]] were actually more common in executives than in the disturbed criminals. They were:
* [[Histrionic personality disorder]]: including [[superficial charm]], insincerity, [[egocentricity]] and [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]]
* [[Narcissistic personality disorder]]: including [[grandiosity]], self-focused lack of [[empathy]] for others, [[exploitative]]ness and independence.
* [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]: including [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], excessive devotion to work, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies.

They described these business people as successful [[psychopaths]] and the criminals as unsuccessful psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;Board, B.J. &amp; Fritzon, Katarina, F. (2005). Disordered personalities at work. ''Psychology, Crime and Law'', 11, 17–32&lt;/ref&gt;

According to leading leadership academic [[Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries]], it seems almost inevitable these days that there will be some personality disorders in a senior management team.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries, The Dark Side of Leadership, ''Business Strategy Review'' 14(3), Autumn, page 26 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial/organizational psychology]] research has also examined the types of bullying that exist among business professionals and the prevalence of this form of bullying in the workplace as well as ways to measure bullying empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Salin, D. (2001). Prevalence and forms of bullying among business professionals: A comparison of two different strategies for measuring bullying. European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 10, 425-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
Narcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical
cross-over between bullies and psychopaths.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, M. G., Buckley, M. R., Heames, J. T., Zinko, R., Brouer, R. L. &amp; Ferris, G. R. 2007, ‘A Bully as an Archetypal Destructive Leader’, Journal of Leadership and rganizational Studies, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 117–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke J Working with Monsters: How to Identify and Protect Yourself from the Workplace Psychopath (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; Using meta data analysis on hundreds of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy there are two types of bullying:&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, C. R. Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Predatory bullying – the bully just enjoys bullying and tormenting vulnerable people for the sake of it.
* Instrumental bullying – the bullying is for a purpose, helping the bully achieve their goals.

A corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further their goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and [[divide and rule]].

People with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people.&lt;ref name=Nathanson&gt;Nathanson, C., Williams, K. M. &amp; Paulhus, D. L. 2006, ‘Predictors of a Behavioral Measure of Scholastic Cheating: Personality and Competence but Not Demographics’, [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], vol. 31, pp. 97–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Hare and Babiak noted that about 29% of corporate psychopaths are also bullies.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; Hare, R. D [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Nathanson/&gt;

A workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have [[psychopathic]] traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack [[anger management]] skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, P.A. (2009). The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace. Consulting Psychology Journal, 61(3), 169–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism ===
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
In 2007, researchers Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at [[San Diego State University]], USA, found that [[narcissism]] revealed a positive relationship with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making [[false allegations]]). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Mattice, MA &amp; Brian Spitzberg, PhD [http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc Bullies in Business: Self-Reports of Tactics and Motives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://noworkplacebullies.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Bully_conference_abstract.160111428.doc |date=25 April 2012 }} San Diego State University, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machiavellianism ===
{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
According to [[Gary Namie|Namie]], Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas but he emphasizes that they are not mentally ill. They do not have a personality disorder, [[schizophrenia]] and neither are they psychopaths. In his view, Machiavellianism represents the core of workplace bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Namie, G. (2006). Why Bullies Bully? A Complete Explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
According to Gary and Ruth Namie, as well as Tracy, et al.,&lt;ref name="namiehealth"&gt;Namie, Gary and Ruth [http://www.bullyinginstitute.org/research/res/2003E.html The WBI 2003 Report on Abusive Workplaces] {{webarchive|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/multi/pdf/N-N-2003C.pdf |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; workplace bullying can harm the health of the targets of bullying. Organizations are beginning to take note of workplace bullying because of the costs to the organization in terms of the health of their employees.

According to scholars at The Project for Wellness and Work-Life at [[Arizona State University]], "workplace bullying is linked to a host of physical, psychological, organizational, and social costs." [[Workplace stress|Stress]] is the most predominant health effect associated with bullying in the workplace. Research indicates that workplace stress has significant negative effects that are correlated to poor mental health and poor physical health, resulting in an increase in the use of "sick days" or time off from work (Farrell &amp; Geist-Martin, 2005).

The negative effects of bullying are so severe that [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and even suicide&lt;ref name="abcpushed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884|title=Suicide waitress 'driven to the edge and pushed' |date=9 February 2010 | website=abc.net.au | last=Caldwell | first=Alison | series=The World Today | access-date=14 August 2017 | dead-url=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815114447/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-08/suicide-waitress-driven-to-the-edge-and-pushed/323884 | archive-date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yildirim, A., &amp; Yildirim, D. (2007). Mobbing in the workplace by peers and managers: mobbing experienced by nurses working in healthcare facilities in Turkey and its effect on nurses. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 16, 1444–1453.&lt;/ref&gt; are not uncommon. Tehrani&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani, N. (2004). Bullying: A source of chronic post traumatic stress? British Journal of Guidance &amp; Counselling, 32, 357–366.&lt;/ref&gt; found that one in 10 targets experience PTSD, and that 44% of her respondents experienced PTSD similar to that of battered women and victims of child abuse. Matthiesen and Einarsen&lt;ref&gt;Matthiesen, S.B., &amp; Einarsen, S. (2004). Psychiatric distress and symptoms of PTSD among victims of bullying at work. British Journal of Guidance &amp; Counselling, 32, 335–356.&lt;/ref&gt; found that up to 77% of targets experience PTSD.

In addition, co-workers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as fear, stress, and emotional exhaustion.&lt;ref name="quit" /&gt; Those who witness repetitive workplace abuse often choose to leave the place of employment where the abuse took place. Workplace bullying can also hinder the organizational dynamics such as group cohesion, peer communication, and overall performance.

According to the 2012 survey conducted by Workplace Bullying Institute (516 respondents), Anticipation of next negative event is the most common psychological symptom of workplace bullying reported by 80%. Panic attacks afflict 52%. Half (49%) of targets reported being diagnosed with clinical depression. Sleep disruption, loss of concentration, mood swings, and pervasive sadness and insomnia were more common (ranging from 77% to 50%). Nearly three-quarters (71%) of targets sought treatment from a physician. Over half (63%) saw a mental health professional for their work-related symptoms. Respondents reported other symptoms that can be exacerbated by stress: migraine headaches (48%), irritable bowel disorder (37%), chronic fatigue syndrome (33%) and sexual dysfunction (27%).

== Financial costs to employers ==
Several studies have attempted to quantify the cost of bullying to an organization.
* According to the National Institute of Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) mental illness among the workforce leads to a loss in employment amounting to $19 billion and a drop in productivity of $3 billion (Sauter, et al., 1990).
* In a report commissioned by the ILO, Hoel, Sparks, &amp; Cooper did a comprehensive analysis of the costs involved in bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |title=The cost of violence and bullying at work |publisher=International Labour Organization (ILO) |accessdate=13 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430202909/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/violence/costof.htm |archivedate=30 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They estimated a cost 1.88 billion pounds plus the cost of lost productivity.
* Based on replacement cost of those who leave as a result of being bullied or witnessing bullying, Rayner and Keashly (2004) estimated that for an organization of 1,000 people, the cost would be $1.2 million US. This estimate did not include the cost of litigation should victims bring suit against the organization.
* A recent Finnish study of more than 5,000 hospital staff found that those who had been bullied had 26% more certified sickness absence than those who were not bullied, when figures were adjusted for base-line measures one year prior to the survey (Kivimäki et al., 2000). According to the researchers these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.

Research by Dr. [[Dan Dana]] has shown organizations suffer a large financial cost by not accurately [[conflict management|managing conflict]] and bullying type behaviours. He has developed a tool to assist with calculating the cost of conflict.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mediationworks.com/about-us/mti-team/ |title=Dan Dana |publisher=Mediationworks.com |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425093442/http://www.mediationworks.com/dmi/biodan.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, researcher Tamara Parris discusses how employers need to be more attentive in managing various discordant behaviours in the workplace, such as, bullying, as it not only creates a financial cost to the organization, but also erodes the company's human resources assets.&lt;ref name="parris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|title=Hugh Downs School of Human Communication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=asu.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610235556/http://humancommunication.clas.asu.edu/aboutus/wellnesspublications.shtml|archivedate=10 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace depression can occur in many companies of various size and profession, and can have negative effects on positive profit growth (McTernan, Dollard &amp; LaMontagne, 2013). Stress factors that are unique to one's working environment, such as bullying from co-workers or superiors and poor social support for high pressure occupations, can build over time and create an inefficient work behavior in a depressed individual (Evan-Lack &amp; Knapp, 2014). In addition, inadequate or negative communication techniques can further drive an employee towards feeling of being disconnected from the company's mission and goals (Hidzir, et al., 2017).  One way that companies can combat the destructive consequences associated with employee depression is to offer more support for counseling and consider bringing in experts to educate staff on the consequences of bullying. Ignoring the problem of depression and decreased workplace performance is creating an unsustainable path towards intergroup conflict and lasting feelings of disillusionment (Fischer, et al., 2014).

The '''World Scrabble Championship 1991''' was the first World Scrabble Championship. The winner was [[Peter Morris (Scrabble)|Peter Morris]],&lt;ref name=wsc1991&gt;{{cross-tables tournament|tid=1407|tname=WSC 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Canadian, representing the United States.

Plans for a World Scrabble Championship had formed as early as 1986/87. After [[Coleco]] bought [[Selchow and Righter]], the company announced that they were interested in helping players to organize a "World-Class Open" in 1988. At the 1987 Nationals, John Williams announced that the first World Scrabble Championship would be held the following summer in New York. It would be 1991, however, before
it became a reality.

The 48 players were separated into random groups of 6 and played round robins within their groups. The top 2 players from each group then played a knockout to produce two finalists who played a best-of-three finals.

Morris and Cappelletto split their first two games then met for a final game to decide it all. On his tenth move, Cappelletto made a rare blunder by playing the phony SMAIL instead of [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/claim CLAIMS]. The move may have cost him the championship. As it was, Morris pulled out a complicated end game for a 4-point win and the first world title.
