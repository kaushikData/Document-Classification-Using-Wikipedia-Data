The '''1990 London summit''' was the 10th [[NATO summit]] since 1949, and the 4th in 6 years.&lt;ref name=NATO-E&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO e-Library: Summits and ministerial meetings|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/comm.htm|website=nato.int|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held in [[London, England|London]] on 5–6 July 1990. The principal outcome of the summit was the ''London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic Alliance''.&lt;ref name=NATO-E /&gt;

The declaration, shaped in the midst of a changing Europe, called for substantial changes in the organization to ensure it could adapt to a rapidly evolving political landscape.&lt;ref name=NATO-CMD&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO's Command Structure: The Old and the New|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_69718.htm|website=nato.int|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the declaration called for reductions in short-range nuclear capabilities, and re-focusing its long-term strategic plans with associated changes to the structure and quantity of its military.

Notably, the declaration also reinforced a message given days earlier stating that NATO no longer saw the Warsaw Pact countries as enemies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rimanelli|first1=Marco|title=The A to Z of NATO and Other International Security Organizations|date=14 September 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810868991|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opening up channels for communication and aid with the former eastern bloc states.&lt;ref name=DOD&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Security Strategy for Europe and Nato|url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/europe/chapter_2.html|publisher=United States Depeartment of Defense|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NATO extended a "hand of friendship" to eastern European nations.&lt;ref name=NATO-ART&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Summit: a turning point in 'East-West' relations|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_116133.htm?selectedLocale=en|website=nato.int|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, on 20 December 1991, NATO and former members of the Warsaw Pact formed the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), now called the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]].

The '''1991 Indian economic crisis''' had its roots in 1985 when India began having [[balance of payments]] problems as imports swelled, leaving the country in a [[twin deficit]]: the Indian trade balance was in deficit at a time when the government was running on a large fiscal deficit.&lt;ref name="originalreport"&gt;{{cite web |title=India - Structural Adjustment Credit Project (English) - Presidents report |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/999451468260069468/India-Structural-Adjustment-Credit-Project |website=www.documents.worldbank.org |publisher=World bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of 1990 in the run-up to the [[Gulf War]], the situation became so serious that the Indian [[foreign exchange reserves]] could barely finance three weeks’ worth of imports while the government came close to defaulting on its financial obligations. By July that year, the low reserves had led to a sharp devaluation of the rupee, which in turn exacerbated the twin deficit problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/staffp/2002/03/pdf/cerra.pdf|title=What Caused the 1991 Currency Crisis in India?|last=|date=|website=International Monetary Fund|publisher=VALERIE CERRA and SWETA CHAMAN SAXENA|access-date=|first1=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This led the Indian government to airlift national [[gold reserves]] as a pledge to a large conditional [[bail out]] from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] in exchange for a loan to cover balance of payment debts.&lt;ref name="bail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/may/25/slide-show-5-lord-desai-on-recession-and-indian-politics.htm|title=I think a stimulus package is necessary, yes. Bailouts, no|work=Rediff News|publisher=|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis led to the [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalisation of the Indian economy]], as one of the conditions stipulated in the World Bank loan (structural reform), requiring India to open itself up to participation from foreign entities in its industries, including state owned enterprises.&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web |title=Structural adjustments in India - a reportof the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) |url=http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/0586CC45A28A2749852567F5005D8C89 |website=www.lnweb90.worldbank.org |publisher=World bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and consequences ==
The crisis was caused by currency [[devaluation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/staffp/2002/03/pdf/cerra.pdf|title=What Caused the 1991 Currency Crisis in India?|last=|date=|website=International Monetary Fund|publisher=VALERIE CERRA and SWETA CHAMAN SAXENA|access-date=|first1=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[current account deficit]], and investor confidence played significant role in the sharp exchange rate depreciation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/ghosh-pathways_india.pdf Pathways Through Financial Crisis: India] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025042847/http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/ghosh-pathways_india.pdf |date=25 October 2013 }}, Arunabha Ghosh, Global Governance 12 (2006), 413–429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;[http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/Ghosh%20-%20India.pdf India's Pathway through Financial Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112080531/http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/Ghosh%20-%20India.pdf |date=12 November 2011 }}. [[Arunabha Ghosh]]. Global Economic Governance Programme. Retrieved on 2 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://findebookee.com/c/crisi-in-india&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic crisis was primarily due to the large and growing fiscal imbalances over the 1980s. During the mid-eighties, India started having balance of payments problems. Precipitated by the [[Gulf War]], India’s oil import bill swelled, exports slumped, credit dried up, and investors took their money out.&lt;ref name="jolt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091104/jsp/frontpage/story_11697358.jsp |title=India shining, India scraping |work=The Telegraph |publisher= |accessdate=2009-10-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106123415/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091104/jsp/frontpage/story_11697358.jsp |archivedate=6 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large fiscal deficits, over time, had a spillover effect on the trade deficit culminating in an external payments crisis. By the end of the 1980s, India was in serious economic trouble.

The gross fiscal deficit of the government ([[Indian Central Government|centre]] and [[State governments in India|states]]) rose from 9.0 percent of GDP in 1980-81 to 10.4 percent in 1985-86 and to 12.7 percent in 1990-91. For the centre alone, the gross fiscal deficit rose from 6.1 percent of GDP in 1980-81 to 8.3 percent in 1985-86 and to 8.4 percent in 1990-91. Since these deficits had to be met by borrowings, the internal debt of the government accumulated rapidly, rising from 35 percent of GDP at the end of 1980-81 to 53 percent of GDP at the end of 1990-91. The foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks worth of imports.&lt;ref name="WB2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Project proposal - Structured adjustment of India |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/999451468260069468/India-Structural-Adjustment-Credit-Project |website=www.documents.worldbank.org |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1991, India's [[exchange rate]] was subjected to a severe adjustment. This event began with a slide in the value of the [[Indian rupee]] leading up to mid-1991. The authorities at the [[Reserve Bank of India]] took partial action, defending the currency by expanding international reserves and slowing the decline in value. However, in mid-1991, with foreign reserves nearly depleted, the Indian government permitted a sharp devaluation  that took place in two steps within three days (1 July and 3 July 1991) against major currencies.

Narasimha Rao]]’s economic reform process.&lt;ref name="circle" /&gt;

[[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] took over as [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] in June, and roped in [[Manmohan Singh]] as [[Finance Minister of India|Finance Minister]].&lt;ref name="jolt" /&gt; The [[Narasimha Rao]] government ushered in several reforms that are collectively termed as [[Economic liberalisation in India#Narasimha Rao government .281991–1996.29|liberalisation]] in the Indian [[Mass media|media]]. There was significant opposition to such reforms, suggesting they were an "interference with India's autonomy". Then Prime Minister Rao's speech a week after he took office highlighted the necessity for reforms, as New York Times reported, "Mr. Rao, who was sworn in as Prime Minister last week, has already sent a signal to the nation—as well as the [[International Monetary Fund|I.M.F]].—that India faced no "soft options" and must open the door to foreign investment, reduce red tape that often cripples initiative, and streamline industrial policy. Mr. Rao made his comments in a speech to the nation Saturday night." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/29/world/economic-crisis-forcing-once-self-reliant-india-to-seek-aid.html Economic Crisis Forcing Once Self-Reliant India to Seek Aid], New York Times, 29 June 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The foreign reserves started picking up with the onset of the liberalisation policies and reached an all-time high US$ 426.1 billion as on 13th of April 2018 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/india-s-forex-reserves-at-a-life-time-high-of-426-082-billion/story-VN1S40wNLq6LG3thW1Eb6O.html &lt;/ref&gt;

18 years after the incident, in 2009, India bought 200 Metric tons of gold from [[International Monetary Fund]],which was nearly three times the amount which India pawned to IMF in 1991 proving the fact that the economic reforms had worked wonders.

== Aftermath ==
A program of economic policy reform 1991 was put in place which has yielded mixed results so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=India: 1991 country economic memorandum |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/962181468033534646/pdf/multi0page.pdf |website=www.documents.worldbank.org |publisher=World bank |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''announcerless game''' was an [[American football]] contest played on December 20, 1980, between the [[New York Jets]] and the [[Miami Dolphins]] of the [[National Football League]]. As an experiment, the [[NBC]] television network broadcast it without assigning any [[Sports commentator|commentators]] to cover it. The two teams were playing the last game of [[1980 NFL season|that season]] for them as neither had qualified for [[National Football League playoffs|the playoffs]], and since the game was being broadcast nationally NBC executive [[Don Ohlmeyer]] decided on the idea to boost what would otherwise have been weak [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. The Jets won a 24–17 [[Upset (competition)|upset]] victory.&lt;ref name="ESPN story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garber|first=Greg|title=In this NFL game, silence was golden|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=5906858|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=December 12, 2010|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To replace the announcers, the network used more on-screen [[graphics]] than usual and asked the [[Public address system|public address]] announcer at [[Miami]]'s [[Orange Bowl]] to impart more information than he typically did. Efforts to use more sensitive microphones and pick up more sound from the field, however, did not succeed. While the experiment did increase the telecast's ratings, it was widely regarded as a failure since it did not provide sufficient context for viewers. No network broadcasting any major U.S. professional team sport has ever tried it again, except through alternate feeds of games offered with announcers.&lt;ref name="Marty Glickman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glickman|first1=Marty|last2=Isaacs|first2=Stan|authorlink1=Marty Glickman|authorlink2=Stan Isaacs|title=The Fastest Kid on the Block: The Marty Glickman Story|date=1999|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|isbn=9780815605744|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jMWCtJ5aHQC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[Don Ohlmeyer]], then [[Television producer|executive producer]] of [[NBC]]'s [[NFL on NBC|telecasts]] of [[National Football League]] (NFL) games, began considering doing a telecast without announcers early in [[1980 National Football League season|the 1980 season]]. He had several reasons. First, he had long believed that the announcers were overly chatty and did not let the game speak for itself when they needed to. Second, NBC, while it primarily covered the games of the NFL's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) teams, generally in smaller [[media market|markets]], was earning [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] almost as good as those of rival [[CBS]], who at the time was broadcasting games involving teams from the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). A game without announcers might well attract enough viewers to put NBC past CBS.&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

In October of that year reports began to circulate that Ohlmeyer was considering the idea. He confirmed it but said he would only actually do it for a game that had no [[National Football League playoffs|playoff]] implications. The last week of the season gave him the chance, with a contest scheduled for Saturday, when it would be shown nationally, between the [[New York Jets]] and the [[Miami Dolphins]].&lt;ref name="UPI pre-broadcast story"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[United Press International]]|title=Dolphins–Jets game is subject of announcer-less experiment|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19801219&amp;id=gftXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wvYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4228,2932059&amp;hl=en|newspaper=[[Bend Bulletin]]|date=December 19, 1980|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both teams had already been eliminated from the playoffs, they had reasons to win beyond ending their seasons on an upbeat note. The Dolphins, hosting the Jets at the [[Orange Bowl]], their home stadium at the time, had the better record at 8–7. [[Las Vegas]] oddsmakers [[Spread betting#Spreads in sports wagering|made them 6-point favorites]]. Despite that line, however, they had not only lost to the Jets earlier that season, a loss that was widely believed to have been the one that put the Dolphins out of the playoffs since the Jets had been the only team the Dolphins lost to that they had been expected to beat. That loss had been their fifth straight to their [[American Football Conference East|AFC East division]] [[Dolphins–Jets rivalry|rivals]]; Miami had not beaten the Jets since 1977 despite an otherwise superior record during those seasons. The Dolphins were also bringing a three-game [[Winning streak (sports)|winning streak]] into the contest; a victory would redeem their failure to reach the playoffs with a winning record for the season.&lt;ref name="UPI pre-broadcast story" /&gt;

Coming into the game at 3–12, the Jets, touted by [[Jimmy the Greek]] at the beginning of the season as a possible [[Super Bowl]] contender, had long abandoned any hopes of the playoffs. But they, too, had something to prove. The visitors were coming off an embarrassing loss at home to [[1980 New Orleans Saints season|that year]]'s [[New Orleans Saints]], the only team in the league with a worse record, who had come from behind late in the game for their only victory of the season. The team's owners were reportedly divided as to whether to retain head coach [[Walt Michaels]] for another season.&lt;ref name="David Israel column"&gt;{{cite news|last=Israel|first=David|authorlink=David Israel|title=Announcers got the day off, but viewers had to work|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/12/21/page/67/article/announcers-got-the-day-off-but-viewers-had-to-work|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=December 22, 1980|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction was mixed, ranging from "good-natured humor to applause to some surprising anger," as [[Bryant Gumbel]] would later put it on air shortly before the telecast started. "My first reaction was of incredible nerve, nervousness," [[Dick Enberg]], one of the NBC announcers, recalled to [[ESPN]] 30 years later. "We all gathered together, hoping that Ohlmeyer was dead wrong ... What if this crazy idea really worked?" Dolphins' [[defensive end]] [[Bob Baumhower]] was also apprehensive about what viewers might overhear among the players. "I hope we're all extra careful," he said. "There's a lot of extra talking going on out there that people don't realize."&lt;ref name="UPI pre-broadcast story" /&gt;

==Game==

The game started at 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. The weather was seasonal for Miami, with temperatures around {{convert|69|F}} and {{convert|12|mph|km/h|adj=on}} winds. A total of 41,854 came to see the game at the [[Orange Bowl]].&lt;ref name="Football-reference box score" /&gt;

Miami took an early lead with a 21-yard [[Uwe von Schamann]] [[field goal]]. After the Jets' [[Scott Dierking]] scored the game's first [[touchdown]] on a short plunge into the [[end zone]], [[Duriel Harris]] caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from rookie [[quarterback]] [[David Woodley]]. The first quarter ended with the Dolphins up 10–7.&lt;ref name="Football-reference box score"&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Jets 24 at Miami Dolphins 17|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198012200mia.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|date=2000–2015|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dierking went in from just outside the [[end zone]] once again three seconds before [[halftime]] to put the Jets ahead for good.&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt; The Jets were weaker offensively the whole game, gaining fewer yards overall and [[Turnover (gridiron football)|turning over the ball]] five times. However, it was one of the two Dolphin turnovers that ultimately made the difference in the third quarter, when rookie [[safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Darrol Ray]]&lt;ref name="Sack Exchange"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|title=Sack Exchange: The Definitive Oral History of the 1980s New York Jets|date=2011|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781770410039|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_2hGA2U70hUC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; went 71 yards for a score after [[interception|intercepting]] a Woodley pass, his first career interception return for a score. Woodley brought his team to within four with a one-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter; Jets kicker [[Pat Leahy (American football)|Pat Leahy]] completed the scoring with a 35-yard field goal. The season ended for both teams with the Jets victorious, 24–17, leaving the Dolphins with a .500 finish.&lt;ref name="Football-reference box score" /&gt;

==Telecast==

Ohlmeyer and the NBC broadcast crew prepared to compensate for the lack of announcers in several ways. NBC promoted the game by telling viewers they would, in lieu of announcers, have the experience of actually being in the stadium, so the network placed more microphones, and more sensitive microphones, around the field than it otherwise would have. However, the NFL refused to relax one of its restrictions and allow microphones to be placed on the players themselves, which unfortunately meant that it was impossible for viewers to make out signals called by the quarterbacks.&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

There was, in fact, no intelligible talking at all, just crowd noise, the stadium public-address system and whatever grunts and pad smashings the field-side microphones could pick up—some three and one half hours of announcerless air, the one and only protracted blank in history's ongoing, chatter-filled recording of broadcast sports''.

The network increased its use of on-camera graphics during the game to regularly convey [[Down (gridiron football)|down]] and distance, score, and statistical information, to the point that more were than had ever been used in any previous NFL telecast. The monochromatic yellow line that was superimposed on the field to indicate the distance needed for a first-down was then the most advanced technology available; however, speaking later from a 21st century perspective, Ohlmeyer said seems like "[[Cave dweller|troglodyte]] communication". The technology of the time would have allowed for a continuous [[score bug]] and a running clock, both of which would have eliminated the need to constantly provide that information, but it did not occur to the crew to deploy it that way.&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

NBC asked Bob Kaufman, the Orange Bowl's [[public address system|public address]] announcer, to make more frequent announcements of information than usual, and to include more information in those announcements than stadium announcers typically did. Accordingly, he noted aloud during the game that referees were calling for a first-down measurement, and Kaufman gave the length of game time that a [[drive (American football)|drive]] had taken. Television audiences were able to hear this.&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

[[Bryant Gumbel]] introduced the game prior to the [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]] as "a telecast that figures to be different." He was then shown walking into the stadium to watch the game. At frequent intervals, usually every other commercial break, he addressed the camera and gave the audience the score and brief updates as to what had happened and what was happening at that point. His presence was augmented by excerpts from prerecorded interviews with coaches and players, including the Dolphins' [[Don Shula]] and [[Duriel Harris]].&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

==Reaction==

As Ohlmeyer had hoped, the telecast drew higher ratings than it probably otherwise would have. "It was a dog of a game," he recalled to ESPN. "It did much better for us than [it should have]."&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt; Writing two days later, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' television columnist [[David Israel]] agreed: "People talked about a game they would otherwise have ignored."&lt;ref name="David Israel column" /&gt; Of the approximately one thousand phone calls to the NBC switchboard, the network reported later, about 60% were supportive of the decision to go without announcers.&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

Gumbel discounts the importance of that reaction, noting that a thousand callers is not statistically significant when set against the U.S. population of 200 million at that time. "I thought it was more amusing than anything else," he said later. "I viewed it as kind of a stunt with a small 's'."&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

In retrospect, Ohlmeyer wished he had cut to Gumbel more frequently than he did. Michael Weisman, who co-produced the telecast, also felt the attempt to provide higher quality audio was unsuccessful. "There's all sorts of strange noises going on, buzzing and things that sound like a frying pan."&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt; The technical limitations of television broadcasts also, Israel observed, made it hard for viewers to realize that touchdowns had been scored on two short runs and [[Duriel Harris|Harris]]'s catch, since officials were not within the frame.&lt;ref name="David Israel column" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Without announcers, David Israel concluded, "[t]his became a game with no context played by men with no pasts." Viewers had to know the backstory of the game themselves to appreciate the human drama on the field. Israel repeated [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s observation that television conditions viewers to respond passively without engaging them, but: "here, out of the blue, it was asking us to participate actively, to provide input so that what was on the screen became more than just moving wallpaper. The viewers who were unable to do that were left watching padded humanoids clanking heads".&lt;ref name="David Israel column" /&gt;

To Gumbel, one moment in the game makes this same point. At the end of the first half, the Jets decided to go for a touchdown and the lead they would never surrender instead of a tying field goal that Leahy would most certainly have made. "It lacks a degree of drama," he observes, "unless somebody is there to say, 'All right, here's why we're going to shut up and just watch this. Here's what's at stake.'"&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

Weisman came to the same conclusion in 2010, saying: "Early on in the game we realized that we could do whatever we wanted [...] We'd sit around in the truck and say, 'Let's play the tape now.' But it would just come out of the blue and didn't make a lot of sense out of context".&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

While he and his colleagues were relieved the experiment lasted no further than the one game, [[Dick Enberg]] says he did learn from the experience: "Consciously, to this day, there are moments in every sport that I do when I kind of throw up my hands as if to say to myself and to my partner, 'Let's not talk. This moment is special, we don't need to talk. Let's let it play.'"&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

Ohlmeyer says that despite a career in sports broadcasting that has involved three [[Olympic Games]] telecasts, 16 [[Emmy Award]]s and gotten him into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame, the Announcerless Game is the one he will be most remembered for. "All the stuff I've done in my career, and that's what I'm going to be remembered for," he said three decades later. "It serves me right."&lt;ref name="ESPN story" /&gt;

No other United States broadcaster has ever purposely replicated the experiment, with football or any of the other major team professional sports; the networks have produced announcerless broadcasts but only as an alternate feed (with the main network always carrying announcers). [[ESPN]] has regularly included announcerless broadcasts as part of its [[ESPN Full Circle|Full Circle and Megacast]] multi-channel broadcasts, usually on [[ESPN Classic]]. In select versions of the [[MLB.tv]] app, a 'ballpark sound' option is available on most games with only natural ballpark audio. In 2013, [[Fox Sports Detroit]] Plus offered its viewers a "Natural Sounds at [[Comerica Park]]" channel in which they could watch occasional [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]] [[baseball]] games with just the ambient sound from games at the team's home stadium, with information about the game coming via increased graphics as it did in the Announcerless Game.&lt;ref name="Detroit Tigers announcerless channel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Tully|title=Forget announcers, listen to this|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/detroit-tigers-natural-sounds-at-comerica-park-no-announcers-073013|newspaper=[[Fox Sports]]|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, offered only on a premier channel for those who paid the highest rates;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg piece"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boudway|first=Ira|title=Who Needs Sports Announcers?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-07-31/who-needs-sports-announcers|newspaper=[[Bloomberg Business]]|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the regular channel included the team's announcing duo of [[Mario Impemba]] and [[Rod Allen]].&lt;ref name="Detroit Tigers announcerless channel" /&gt;

There has been one other instance in which a major league in North America used announcerless broadcasts. In 2005, when the [[Canadian Media Guild]] went on [[strike action|strike]], [[CBC Television]] continued to carry its [[Canadian Football League]] [[CFL on CBC|broadcasts]] announcerless rather than bring in replacements. The strike ran from August 20 to October 4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708095613/http://www.brockpress.com/opinion/the-cbc-s-major-penalty-1.2302324 The CBC's major penalty]. ''The Brock Press'' (October 4, 2005). Retrieved from the Internet Archive May 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Announcerless Game, the closest any sports or any other entertainment organization has intentionally gone without announcers have been in [[professional wrestling]]. [[WWE]] has on occasions gone without announcers mostly for storyline purposes whether it be the announcers being attacked by wrestlers or ([[kayfabe]]) quitting. On one occasion, the September 10th, 2012 episode of ''[[WWE Raw]]'', WWE unexpectedly went the last hour of the broadcast without any commentary after color commentator [[Jerry Lawler]] suffered a ([[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]]) [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] live on-air, with no commentary the rest of the night except for play-by-play man [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] to provide updates on Lawler before and after each commercial break and at the end of ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caldwell|first1=James|title=WWE Raw results 9/10|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwerawreport/article_65047.shtml|website=PWTorch.com|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ira Boudway observed in ''[[Bloomberg Business]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;The problem is that cutting the feed from the booth also means cutting down egos and cutting into advertising reach. If you're not hearing [[Tim McCarver]] recite the lyrics to [[Metallica]]'s '[[Enter Sandman]]', then you're not hearing [[Joe Buck]] tell you [[Sponsor (commercial)#Sports in North America|which beer brand is bringing you the game]] ... Going announcerless is akin to skipping commercials, and broadcasters and carriers are going to want to find a way to replace the lost revenue.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg piece" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final rules required compliance by large accelerated filers beginning on January 1, 2008, and by all other filers beginning on January 1, 2009  The "e-proxy" rules allow two methods for companies to deliver their proxy materials, the "notice only" option or the "full set" option. Under the notice only option, the company must post all of its proxy materials on a publicly accessible website at the time

[[File:Linz Ars electronica center rotblau DL.jpg|thumb|left|Night view of the Center]]
Ars Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, [[Hubert Bognermayr]], [[Herbert W. Franke]], and Ulrich Rützel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz [[GmbH]] was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodelled in 2009.

Funding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of [[Upper Austria]] and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. In 2014 the organization is headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.&lt;ref name=website&gt;[http://www.aec.at/about/en/ Ars Electronica website]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ars Electronica Center}}
The Center, also known as the "Museum of the Future", is housed in a modern complex of buildings by the [[Danube]]. It acts as Ars Electronica’s permanent base and showcase. The majority of the space is used for public exhibitions and events, with an emphasis on interactivity and participation. Major themes are life sciences, environmental issues, and preparation for impending technological developments with likely impacts on society.

There is also provision for conferences, workshops, and R&amp;D. The Center was enhanced and expanded in 2009, coincident with Linz’s term as [[European Capital of Culture]]. It is the most-visited museum in Linz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/center/en/ Ars Electronica website, “Ars Electronica Center”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Futurelab==
The Futurelab, housed at the Ars Electronica Center, is a center of expertise for multidisciplinary research and development of new cyberarts technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/futurelab/en/aktuelles/about/ Ars Electronica website, "About Ars Electronica Futurelab"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is staffed by about 25 permanent team members, and offers residencies to established and emerging artists and researchers.

The Futurelab has produced infrastructure and content for the Center and Festival. More recently it has engaged in joint ventures with universities and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/futurelab/en/network/ Ars Electronica website, "Futurelab Network"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner of [the next idea] voestalpine Art and Technology Grant is entitled to a term as Artist/Scientist-in-Residence at the Futurelab.

==Comment==
Trent Nathaniel Grover has included an Appendix about Ars Electronica in his book "Dream of the Techno-Shaman" (2008).&lt;ref name=Grover&gt;Trent Nathaniel Grover (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EOOulf5psXEC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Ars+Electronica%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NpdCVKipDYbP7gaY4oGQCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ars%20Electronica%22&amp;f=false Dream of the Techno-Shaman], Appendix A ("Ars Electronica: Towards the Integration of Art, Technology, and Society"), pp. 53-68, ProQuest&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the institute’s activities as “a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society”.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|53}} Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as “beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology”.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|67}} Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the [[Modernism|Modernist]] call for "art for art’s sake".&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Grover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica "will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society".&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|67–68}}

Grover (2008) has described the published work of Ars Electronica as "a compelling snapshot of codependent technological and artistic development with expansive and lasting social and cultural impact."&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|53}}

'''Boutique Week''' is a bi-annual shopping event in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. Boutique Week was launched in October 2010 in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles with over 40 [[boutiques]] participating in each city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919143430/http://www.boutiqueweek.net/ |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the participating boutiques offers their merchandise at a discount of at least 25% off during the selected week.

==support==
Boutique Week is supported by local government in these cities as an effort to stimulate the economy and raise awareness for small local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view%3Dpage%26pageId%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023054400/http://boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view=page&amp;pageId=3 |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page%3Dhappenings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708081449/http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=happenings |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Britannia Theatre''' (1841&amp;ndash;1900) was located at 115/117 High Street, [[Hoxton]], [[London]].&lt;ref name=Arthur&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Britannia.htm ''Britannia Theatre Hoxton''] (Arthur Lloyd theatre history) accessed 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was badly damaged by a fire in 1900. The site was reused as a [[Gaumont British|Gaumont]] cinema from 1913 to 1940, when this too was destroyed. The site is marked by a [[London Borough of Hackney]] historic plaque.

A typical night's entertainment would include 3&amp;ndash;4 plays, with variety acts in the intervals between. Many [[music hall]] acts would appear during the interval, and sometimes their acts were woven into the performance. The plays varied, from [[Shakespeare]], [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]] and comedy. During the winter season [[pantomime]] was performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/icons/playbills/londonbritannia.htm ''Playbills, productions and cast lists''] (Britannia Theatre Hoxton), in the Templeman collection of the [[University of Kent]] accessed 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually for a theatre, food and drink were served in the auditorium, in the style of contemporary [[music hall]]s.&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
Samuel Haycraft Lane was born in [[Lympstone]], [[Devon]] in 1803. In 1821, he decided to escape the life of a fisherman and walk to [[London]]. After living hand to mouth and educating himself, with the help of a friend, William Brian, he encountered a troupe of actors who he had previously met on his journey. He helped the leader of the troupe, Jack Adams, to find premises for performance at the Union Tavern in [[Shoreditch]]. This hall catered for 500&amp;ndash;seated and a similar number standing. Jack Adam's company performed a successful programme of drama, song, dance and acrobatics. Sam married Jack's daughter Mary, in 1835.&lt;ref name=Crauford&gt;Crauford, Alfred L. ''Sam and Sallie: A novel of the theatre'' (London: Cranley and Day, 1933).&lt;/ref&gt;

The troupe always had ambitions to perform serious drama, and in 1839, the company performed ''[[Othello]]'', breaking the law on theatrical performance, as they were not a [[patent theatre]]. Lane lost his licence and paid a substantial fine.&lt;ref name=making&gt;[http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart1.php ''The Making of the Britannia Theatre'' Alan D. Craxford and Reg Moore] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723024600/http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart1.php# |date=23 July 2012 }} (extracts from ''Sam and Sallie'' at a family history website) accessed 21 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in London's population, and the increasing popularity of live entertainment, the law was finally changed with the [[Theatres Act 1843]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Theatres Act 1843'' (6 &amp; 7 Vict., c. 68) (also known as the ''Theatre Regulation Act'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Lane and his colleagues thought they had identified a loophole whereby performances could be offered without charge, with profits made from the sale of programmes, food and drink. The Britannia Tavern in Hoxton was identified as suitable premises. This was the former ''Pimlico'' tea gardens, an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] tavern and had a large hall attached, holding about 1,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=Today&gt;''Ruling the Britannia'' Sian Mogridge 10 March 2008 ''Hackney Today'' pp 23&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Royal Britannia Saloon and Brittania Tavern'' was opened on [[Easter Monday]] 1841 by Sam Lane. The theatre was a success. Sadly, private life was more difficult, Mary became pregnant, and slipped and fell at a rehearsal, both she and the baby died.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; By 1858 having purchased the leases of surrounding properties, the theatre was rebuilt in larger form, with 3,000&amp;nbsp;seats.&lt;ref name=Crauford/&gt; This building designed by [[Finch Hill]], consisting of two circles, a pit and a gallery and had a reported record attendance of 4,790.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

The Britannia was notable for melodramas. These included ''The String of Pearls'' (1847), the first stage adaptation of the story of [[Sweeney Todd]], written specifically for this venue by [[George Dibdin Pitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mack (2007) "Introduction" to ''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre had a resident dramatist, C.H. Hazlewood, who wrote many melodramatic spectacles for it, often based on successful novels of the time, including an adaptation of ''[[Lady Audley's Secret]]'' (1863).&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt;

===Britannia Theatre in 1861===
[[Charles Dickens]] was a frequent visitor to the theatre, and noted in the ''Uncommercial Traveller'' (1861):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Magnificently lighted by a firmament of sparkling chandeliers, the building was ventilated to perfection. [...] The air of this theatre was fresh, cool, and wholesome. [...] It has been constructed from the ground to the roof, with a careful reference to sight and sound in every corner; the result is, that its form is beautiful, and that the appearance of the audience, as seen from the proscenium -- with every face in it commanding the stage, and the whole so admirably raked and turned to that centre, that a hand can scarcely move in the great assemblage without the movement being seen from thence -- is highly remarkable in its union of vastness with compactness. The stage itself, and all its appurtenances of machinery, cellarage, height, and breadth, are on a scale more like the Scala at Milan. or the San Carlo at Naples, or the Grand Opera at Paris, than any notion a stranger would be likely to form of the Britannia Theatre at Hoxton, a mile north of St Luke’s Hospital in the Old-street-road, London. The Forty Thieves might be played here, and every thief ride his real horse, and the disguised captain bring in his oil jars on a train of real camels, and nobody be put out of the way. This really extraordinary place is an achievement of one man’s enterprise, and was erected on the ruins of an inconvenient old building, in less than five months, at a round cost of five-and-twenty thousand pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, "The Uncommercial Traveller" (1861), 43--44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sarah Lane===
Sam married Sarah Borrow (1822&amp;ndash;1899) in 1843. She was the daughter of an old friend, William Borrow, who Lane had appointed to a managerial position in the Britannia. Sarah had begun her own career on the stage, at the age of 17, as a singer and dancer, under the stage name ''Miss Sarah Wilton''. On Lane's death in 1871, Sarah, succeeded him as proprietor and manager, and continued until her own death in August 1899. She appeared regularly as [[principal boy]], in the Britannia's annual [[pantomime]]s  and in the annual benefit night, appearing in a final tableaux as ''The Queen of Hoxton''. Sarah Lane made her last stage appearance at the Britannia's 1898 Christmas show, aged 76. ''Sallie'' was a well-respected and charitable member of the local community. Large crowds lined the route of her funeral procession from the theatre to [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. Her estate was valued at a quarter of a million pounds, a significant sum in 1889.&lt;ref name=Craxford&gt;[http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart2.php ''The Britannia comes to the Craxfords''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130420022030/http://www.craxford-family.co.uk/crauart2.php# |date=20 April 2013 }} accessed 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britannia Theatre in 1900===
A review of ''King Doo-Dah'', the Christmas pantomime, 1900, at the Britannia Theatre, appeared in the ''[[News of the World]]'':
{{quote|Biggest, brightest best, and jolliest pantomime ever produced at "The Brit," is the Hoxtonian verdict upon Mr. Crauford's latest Christmas production, King Doo-Dah. Indeed, the fourteen scenes that are utilised in telling the story are so full of good things that it would be quite impossible to do justice to them in the space at our command. The ever-popular Albert and Edmunds troupe, assisted by Mr. Fred Lawrence and the Montrose Bros., very clever and humorous acrobats, keep the fun at boiling point from start to finish. Mr. H.G. Sharplin made an imposing figure as Cerberus, his magnificent voice delighting the vast audience. Miss Josephine Henley looked a dapper little Prince, and Miss Emmie Ames a charming Princess. Her first song, "Matilda," in which she introduces several mechanical toys with excellent effect, brought down the house. Miss Lily Sharplin's imitations of Marie Collins, Bessie Wentworth, and Billie Barlow, were the best we have seen. The same young lady also fetched the audience with a clever descriptive song, "The Language London Talks." The Imperial Russian Troupe of Singers and Dancers are an innovation in pantomime. Their singing and dancing were so excellent that they scored one of the greatest successes of the evening. Miss Emma Chambers, as a high class domestic, was quaint and humorous, and Miss Kate Sharplin sang sweetly as Titania. In fact, there was not a mediocre character in the whole show. The flying ballet, concluding with a shower of gold, was really magnificent, as was the grand transformation scene. The pantomime does the greatest credit to the talents of the Britannia's popular stage manager, Mr. Bigwood, and is a distinct score for Mr. Crauford.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[News of the World]]'', London, Sunday, 30 December 1900, p.4e&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:c1890 George Hook Lupino.jpg|thumb|150px|George Hook Lupino, c. 1890]]

===Lupino family===
The [[Lupino family|Lupinos]] were a theatrical family who often claimed that their scion arrived in England in 1620, as a penniless refugee. George William Lupino was a puppeteer and the family continued to earn a theatrical living becoming associated with the [[harlequinade]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]. George Lupino Hook (1820–1902) adopted the stage name Lupino from performing with the family&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Mander, Joe Mitchenson ''Pantomime : a story in pictures'' (London, 1973). In the 1881 census, the family are shown living at 50 Merrion Street, Leeds &amp;ndash; as performers, with the middle name Lupino (RG/11 4536/28 pp.9).&lt;/ref&gt; and was associated with the Britannia, performing in leading roles and taking the role of [[Harlequin]] in pantomime. A prolific man, reputed to have had 16 children, many became singers, dancers and actors, receiving their first experience in the company. The eldest son, civil registration as George Emanuel Samuel Hook (1853–1932) became both a clown and a prominent actor, amongst his grandchildren was the [[Hollywood]] actress [[Ida Lupino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0526946|name=Ida Lupino}} accessed 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lupino Lane]] was the son of Harry Charles Lupino (1825–1925), a favourite of Sarah Lane&lt;ref name=Craxford/&gt; and pursued a career in films and [[musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|name=Lupino Lane|id=0313449}} accessed 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|name=Lupino Lane|id=48871}} accessed 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Lupino Lane originated ''[[The Lambeth Walk]]'', in the 
1937 musical ''[[Me and My Girl]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0420771|title=Me and My Girl (1939 BBC broadcast)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0032688|title=The Lambeth Walk (1940)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of an era===
Soon after the 1900 pantomime, a serious fire damaged the building. The cost of bringing the building up to standard, forced the sale of the lease. It came into the hands of the [[Gaumont British|Gaumont]] organisation, and became a cinema in 1913. The original theatre was demolished to make way for a modern cinema which was never built because of the war. In 1940 the nearby Toy Theatre [Pollock's Toy Museum], was destroyed in [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Airstrike|bombing]] but the theatre building had already gone by this time.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Britannia plaque.JPG|thumb|right|150px|LBH heritage plaque, now attached to modern flats]]
The Britannia Theatre was unique amongst theatres of the time, for a number of reasons. Entry to the entertainment was always cheap, the income was made from sales of food and drink. There was an extraordinary continuity of management, the theatre was in the hands of the same family throughout its lifetime. The theatre also nurtured talent, many of the regular artistes were taken on at an early stage in their careers and remained with the theatre until retirement.&lt;ref name=Crauford/&gt; The theatre prospered with the increasing free time and prosperity of its audience, and declined with the introduction of the cinema and later, radio.

Author and critic [[Compton Mackenzie]] summed up the enduring legacy of the Britannia, in ''Echoes'' (1954):

{{quote|If I were asked to name the audience that expressed beyond any other the spirit of London I would say the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, at a pantomime. This was the apotheosis of the [[Cockney]]. This was the incarnation of his humour and gaiety and warm humanity. The women in their plumed hats! The costers in their pearlies! The oranges and nuts! That immense audience would seethe with enjoyment: it was a vast bubbling kettle of mirth. This was the stuff out of which came the London able to 'take it' forty years on.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to the London [[The Blitz|Blitz]] that would destroy the Britannia.&lt;/ref&gt; I used to have tears in my eyes just from the pleasure of being one in such a gathering. The man who was never one of an audience at the Britannia, Hoxton, has missed something in the life of London.&lt;ref&gt;[[Compton Mackenzie|Mackenzie, Compton]] ''Echoes'' (1954), in Benny Green ''The Last Empires: A Music Hall Companion'' pp. 59 (Pavilion, 1986) {{ISBN|1-85145-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Britannia Theatre was the subject of a novel called ''Sam and Sallie: A novel of the theatre'' (1933) by Alfred L. Crauford. The Crauford's had a long association with the Britannia, and Alfred was one of Sarah Lane's many nephews.

In [[Sarah Waters]] novel, [[Tipping the Velvet]], her lead characters are engaged to play pantomime in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tipping the velvet|last = Waters|first = Sarah|publisher = Virago|year = 1998|isbn = 978-1-86049-524-3|location = |pages = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chase Vault''' is a [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] in the cemetery of the [[Christ Church Parish Church]] in [[Oistins]], [[Christ Church Parish, Barbados|Christ Church]], [[Barbados]], best known for a widespread legend of "mysterious moving [[coffin]]s". According to the story, each time the heavily sealed vault was opened in the early 19th century for burial of a family member, all of the lead coffins had changed position. The facts of the story are unverified, and skeptics call the tale "historically dubious".&lt;ref name=Skeptoid&gt;{{Skeptoid | id=4399 | number= 399| title=The Moving Coffins of Barbados|date=2014-01-28|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story==
The first published version of the story appeared in 1833 in [[James Edward Alexander]]'s ''Transatlantic Sketches''. According to Alexander, a Mrs. Goddard was buried in the vault in 1807, followed in 1808 by Ann Maria Chase, and in 1812 by Dorcas Chase. When the vault was opened in late 1812 for the burial of Thomas Chase, the caskets of the Chase girls were said to be found "in a confused state, having been apparently tossed from their places." Alexander wrote that when the vault was later opened "to receive the body of another infant, the four coffins, all of lead, all very heavy, were much disturbed" and that similar disturbances were found when opening the vault for burials in 1816 and 1819:&lt;ref name="Alexander1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir James Edward Alexander|title=Transatlantic sketches, comprising visits to the most interesting scenes in North and South America, and the West Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t74NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=1833|publisher=R. Bentley|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Each time that the vault was opened the coffins were replaced in their proper situations, that is, three on the ground side by side, and the others laid on them. The vault was then regularly closed; the door (a massive stone which required six or seven men to move) was cemented by masons; and though the floor was of sand there were no marks of footsteps or water. The last time the vault was opened was in 1819. [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]] was then present, and the coffins were found confusedly thrown about the vault, some with their heads down and others up. What could have occasioned this phenomenon? In no other vault in the island has this ever occurred. Was it an earthquake which occasioned it, or the effects of an inundation in the vault?}}

Different versions of the story appeared over the years, with other accounts published in 1844 and 1860.&lt;ref name="Clark1999" /&gt;

==The origins==
According to author [[Jerome Clark]], the story of the Chase Vault appears to originate from anecdotes told by Thomas H. Orderson, Rector of Christ Church during the 1800s. Orderson gave "conflicting accounts" of the tale, each containing variations. Clark says the story was subsequently repeated in Alexander's 1833 ''Transatlantic Sketches,'' and further repeated the same year in the "Anecdote Gallery" section of [[Reuben Percy]]'s ''The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.''&lt;ref name="Percy1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reuben Percy|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7boRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=1833|publisher=J. Limbird|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark says that most stories that proliferated about the Chase Vault referred back to sources that could be traced to one of Orderson's accounts, and that folklorist [[Andrew Lang]] identified the differing versions told by Orderson in a December 1907 article published in ''[[The Folklore Society#Publications|Folk-Lore Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TkgKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP15&amp;dq=December+1907+issue+of+Folklore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W1DZUtiBDcWTyQHJiIGwDA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=December%201907%20issue%20of%20Folklore&amp;f=false A Lang "Death's Deeds A bi-located Story" Folk Lore December 1907 pp. 376–90]]&lt;/ref&gt; After combing through existing documentation to determine the veracity of the Chase Vault stories, Lang reported that he could find nothing to substantiate them, either in the burial register of Christ Church or in contemporary [[List of newspapers in Barbados|newspapers]] on Barbados, aside from an "unpublished firsthand account" by a Nathan Lucas, who claimed to be present at the opening of the vault in April 1820.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome Clark|title=Unexplained!: Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences &amp; Puzzling Physical Phenomena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szFLs6pQmsQC&amp;pg=PA573|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=1999|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-070-4|pages=573–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masonic allegory==
[[Skepticism|Skeptical]] investigator [[Joe Nickell]] said that stories about the Chase Vault were often repeated, but he called them "historically dubious."&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe; 1982. "Barbados' restless coffins laid to rest." ''[[Fate Magazine|Fate]],'' Part I, 35.4 (April): 50–56; Part II, 35.5 (May): 79–86&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell, who had investigated an earlier alleged Masonic hoax involving a tale of buried treasure at [[Oak Island]], contended that the Barbados story was fashioned around the Masonic allegory of a "secret vault" which, according to a Masonic text, "was ... in the ancient mysteries, symbolic of death, where alone Divine Truth is to be found." Nickell wrote that two of the men named in the Chase Vault story were [[Freemasonry|members of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons]], and that a similar tale of "restless coffins" was circulated in 1943 that specifically included a party of Freemasons and a vault containing the founder of Freemasonry in Barbados.&lt;ref name="Nickell2001"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell noted that Chase Vault stories were loaded with symbols and phrases which [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] would have recognized.&lt;ref name="Nickell2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Nickell|title=Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Bm-EjjG3AwC|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=24 October 2001|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2210-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Diary of a Young Girl at the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg|thumb|A [[facsimile]] of the [[The Diary of a Young Girl|original diary]] of [[Anne Frank]] on display in [[Berlin]]]]

A '''diary'''  is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by [[Calendar date|date]] reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a [[list of diarists|diarist]]. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. ''[[Hansard]]''), business [[ledger]]s, and military [[Service record|record]]s. In British English, the word may also denote [[diary (stationery)|a preprinted journal format]].

Today the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives. The word "journal" may be sometimes used for "diary," but generally a diary has (or intends to have) daily entries, whereas journal-writing can be less frequent.

Although a diary may provide information for a [[memoir]], [[autobiography]] or [[biography]], it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there is internal evidence in some diaries (e.g. those of [[Ned Rorem]], [[Alan Clark]], [[Tony Benn]] or [[Simon Gray]]) that they are written with eventual publication in mind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous) or simply for profit.

By extension the term '''diary''' is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic formats (e.g. [[blog]]s).

==Etymology==
The word ''diary'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''diarium'' ("daily allowance," from ''dies'' "day").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diary|title= Diary|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''journal'' comes from the same root (''diurnus'' "of the day") through [[Old French]] ''jurnal'' (modern [[French language|French]] for ''day'' is ''jour'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/journal?show=0&amp;t=1341691218|title=Journal|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of the word refers to a book in which a daily record was written was in [[Ben Jonson]]'s comedy ''[[Volpone]]'' in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diary&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Diary|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest extant diaries come from [[Middle East]]ern and [[East Asia]]n cultures, although the even earlier work ''To Myself'' (Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν), today known as the ''[[Meditations]]'', written in Greek by the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the second half of the 2nd century AD, already displays many characteristics of a diary. [[Pillowbook]]s of [[Japan]]ese court ladies and [[Asia]]n travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing, although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records. The scholar [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] (9th century AD), for example, kept a diary of his journey through southern China.

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Near East]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] diaries were written from before the 10th century. The earliest surviving diary of this era which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna' in the 11th century. His diary is the earliest known to be arranged in order of date (''ta'rikh'' in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Diary in Islamic Historiography: Some Notes|first=George|last=Makdisi|journal=History and Theory|volume=25|issue=2|date=May 1986|pages=173–85|doi=10.2307/2505304|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=2505304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursors of the diary in the modern sense include daily notes of [[Christian mysticism|medieval mystics]], concerned mostly with inward emotions and outward events perceived as spiritually important (e.g. [[Elizabeth of Schönau]], [[Agnes Blannbekin]], and perhaps also, in the lost vernacular account of her visions, [[Beatrice of Nazareth]]).

From the [[Renaissance]] on, some individuals wanted not only to record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'' that covers the years 1405–49, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the [[Florence|Florentines]] [[Buonaccorso Pitti]] and [[Gregorio Dati]] and the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Marino Sanuto the Younger]]. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.

In 1908 the [[Smythson]] company created the first featherweight diary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smythson.com/corporate-diaries|title=Smythson.com|work=smythson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling diaries to be carried about.&lt;ref&gt;p.181 Moss, Victoria ''The Archivists'' ''In Style'' October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published diaries==
[[Image:Samuel Pepys.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Samuel Pepys]]]]
[[Image:200px-Faustina.jpg|155px|right|thumb|[[Faustina Kowalska]]]]

Many diaries of notable figures have been published and form an important element of [[autobiography|autobiographical]] literature.

[[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703) is the earliest diarist who is well known today; his diaries, preserved in [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], were first transcribed and published in 1825. Pepys was amongst the first who took the diary beyond mere business transaction notation, into the realm of the personal. Pepys' contemporary [[John Evelyn]] also kept a notable diary, and their works are among the most important [[primary source]]s for the [[English Restoration]] period, and consist of [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of many great events, such as the [[Great Plague of London]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].

The practice of posthumous publication of diaries of literary and other notables began in the 19th century. As examples, the ''Grasmere Journal'' of [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] (1771–1855) was published in 1897; the Journals of [[Fanny Burney]] (1752–1840) were published in 1889; the diaries of [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] (1776–1867) were published in 1869.

Among important [[U.S. Civil War]] diaries are those of [[George Templeton Strong]], a [[New York City]] lawyer, and [[Mary Boykin Chesnut|Mary Chesnut]], the wife of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer. The diary of [[Jemima Condict]], living in the area of what is now [[West Orange, New Jersey]], includes local observations of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Since the 19th century the publication of diaries by their authors has become commonplace &amp;ndash; notably amongst politicians seeking justification but also amongst artists and litterateurs of all descriptions. Amongst late 20th-century British published political diaries, those of [[Richard Crossman]], [[Tony Benn]] and [[Alan Clark]] are representative, the latter being more indiscreet in the tradition of the diaries of [[Chips Channon]]. In Britain in the field of the arts notable diaries were published by [[James Lees-Milne]], [[Roy Strong]] and [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]].

One of the most famous modern diaries, widely read and translated, is the posthumously published ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'' by [[Anne Frank]], who wrote it while in hiding during the German occupation of [[Amsterdam]] in the 1940s. [[Otto Frank]] edited his daughter's diary and arranged for its publication after the War. Many edits were made before the diary was published in other countries. This was due to the sexually explicit material, which also led to some libraries banning the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/section9.rhtml|title=SparkNotes: Diary of a Young Girl: March 14, 1944–April 11, 1944|work=sparknotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of diaries was also often practiced from the 20th century onwards as a conscious act of self-exploration (of greater or lesser sincerity) &amp;ndash; examples being the diaries of [[Carl Jung]], [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Anaïs Nin]].&lt;ref&gt;This practice is explored in Tristine Rainer, ''The New Diary'', 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Among important diaries by 20th-century literary figures are those of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and the French writer Paul Léautaud (1872–1956). The self-reflective ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'' written by [[Faustina Kowalska|Saint Faustina]] contains accounts of her visions and conversations with Jesus.

A strong psychological effect may arise from having an audience for one's self-expression, even if this is the book one writes in, only read by oneself – particularly in adversity. Anne Frank went so far as to address her diary as "Kitty." [[Friedrich Kellner]], a court official in [[Nazi Germany]], thought of his diary as a weapon for any future fight against tyrants and terrorism, and named it "Mein Widerstand," ''[[My Opposition]]''. [[Victor Klemperer]] was similarly concerned with recording for the future the tyrannies and hypocrisies of Nazi Germany and of its [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] successor state in his diaries. In none of these cases, however, did the authors anticipate early – or indeed any – publication.

==Internet diaries==
{{main article|Online diary|Blog}}

As [[internet]] access became commonly available, many people adopted it as another medium in which to chronicle their lives with the added dimension of an audience. The first [[online diary]] is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's "Open Diary," published at the [[MIT Media Lab]] website from 14 November 1994 until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;a [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115535/http://geocities.com/pinhanez/open_diary/open_diary.htm copy] of his "open diary" is still in existence&lt;/ref&gt; Other early online diarists include [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal online diary-writing in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=9 June 2006 | first=Reyhan | last=Harmanci}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Burke, who started publishing "Carolyn's Diary" on 3 January 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diary.carolyn.org|title=Carolyn's Diary Museum|work=carolyn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary ''The Semi-Existence of Bryon'' in a [[USENET]] newsgroup on 19 April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.announce/browse_frm/thread/7a77561b5796150e/34c1097809c9529b#34c1097809c9529b|title= USENET announcement|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet has also served as a way to bring previously unpublished diaries to the attention of historians and other readers, such as the diary of [[Michael Shiner]], a 19th-century slave who documented his life in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/d/diary-of-michael-shiner.html John G. Sharp,  "The Diary of Michael Shiner Relating to the History of the Washington Navy Yard 1813-1869, ''Naval History and Heritage Command'', 2015, retrieved October 5, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based services such as [[Open Diary]] (started in October 1998) and [[LiveJournal]] (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate [[online publishing]], but growth in personal storytelling came with the emergence of [[blog]]s. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries. For example, some diary software now stores entries in an encrypted format, such as 256-bit AES ([[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) encryption, and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure USB device.

==Digital diaries==

With the popularization of [[mobile apps]], diary or journaling apps have become available for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Proponents cite the following as primary reasons for journaling with digital applications: Ease and speed of typing; mobile portability; search capabilities; entry location, date, and other metadata from mobile phones; and, tags and other organizational features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://bakarichavanu.com/2014/07/08/10-reasons-i-prefer-digital-journal-writing-over-pen-and-paper/|title=10 Reasons I Prefer Digital Journal Writing Over Pen and Paper|date=14 July 2014| first=Bakari | last=Chavanu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital diaries also seem tailored towards shorter-form, in-the-moment writing, similar to user engagement with [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and other social media services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/3/3212579/the-best-journal-app-day-one |title =Day One: journal app nirvana in the Twitter age |first = E |last = Hamburger |date = 3 August 2012 |work = ''[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of diaries==

=== Personal organizer ===

A personal organizer is a form of diary to  list actions and tasks for the day are recorded in a   log, often  using symbols to differentiate and categorize items.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ward |first=Jewel |date=18 December 2013 |title=The 'bullet journal': a new time organizing method or a recycled idea? |url=http://www.tamingdata.com/2013/12/18/the-bullet-journal-a-new-time-organizing-method-or-a-recycled-idea/ |website=tamingdata.com |accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet journal===
A diet journal or food diary is a daily record of all food and beverage consumed as a means of tracking [[calorie]] consumption for the purpose of weight loss or other nutritional monitoring.

===Sleep diary===
A [[sleep diary]] or sleep log is a tool used in the diagnosis and treatment of [[sleep disorder]]s or to keep track of dreams had in order to gain insight to the subconscious or for other further contemplating.

===''Tagebuch''===
The [[German language|German]] ''Tagebuch'' ("day-book") is normally rendered as "diary" in English, but the term encompasses workbooks or working journals as well as diaries proper.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andreas Dorschel, 'Denktagebücher: Zur Poetik des philosophischen Journals', ''Philosophische Rundschau'' LX (2013), no. 4, pp. 264–298.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the notebooks of the Austrian writer [[Robert Musil]] and of the German-Swiss artist [[Paul Klee]] are called ''Tagebücher''.

===Travel journal===
A [[travel journal]], travel diary, or road journal, is the documentation of a journey or series of journeys.

===War diary===
A [[war diary]] is a regularly updated official record of a military unit's administration and activities during wartime maintained by an officer in the unit.

==Fictional diaries==
{{main category|Fictional diaries}}
There are numerous examples of [[fiction]]al diaries. One of the earliest printed fictional diaries was the humorous ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' by [[George Grossmith]] and his brother Weedon. 20th-century examples include radio broadcasts (e.g. ''[[Mrs. Dale's Diary]]'') and published books (e.g. the ''Diaries of [[Adrian Mole]]''). Both prompted long-running [[satire|satirical]] features in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'': the former entitled ''[[Mrs Wilson's Diary]]'' in reference to [[Mary Wilson, Baroness Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Wilson]], wife of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]], the latter entitled "The Secret Diary of John Major Aged 47¾" and written as a pastiche of the [[Adrian Mole]] diaries from the perspective of the then-Prime Minister [[John Major]]. Another famous example of fictional diaries as prose is Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''. A modern example includes the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid series|''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' series]] where each book of the series is written in a first-person view of the main character, as if the book were an actual diary. Other examples are the ''[[Bert Diaries]]'' and the cellphone diaries in the Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] television series ''[[Future Diary]]''.

'''''Einstein on the Beach''''' is an [[opera]] in four acts (framed and connected by five "knee plays" or [[intermezzo]]s), composed by [[Philip Glass]] and directed by theatrical producer [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]].&lt;ref name="glass-music"&gt;Philip Glass, ''Music by Philip Glass'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1997) 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The opera eschews traditional narrative in favor of a formalist approach based on structured spaces laid out by Wilson in a series of storyboards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/wilson/ |title=Stanford Presidential Lectures in the Humanities and Arts |publisher=Stanford University Libraries |year=2008 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music was written "in the spring, summer and fall of 1975".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/einstein_on_the_beach_cbs.php ''Einstein on the Beach''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205195416/http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/einstein_on_the_beach_cbs.php |date=2012-02-05 }}, CBS Masterworks recording.&lt;/ref&gt; Glass recounts the collaborative process: "I put [Wilson’s notebook of sketches] on the piano and composed each section like a portrait of the drawing before me. The score was begun in the spring of 1975 and completed by the following November, and those drawings were before me all the time." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Robert_Wilson_and_his_collaborators.html?id=9CXuAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |first=Laurence |last=Shyer |title=Robert Wilson and His Collaborators |page=220 |publisher=Theatre Communications Group |year=1989 |accessdate=14 April 2010 |isbn=9780930452964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere took place on July 25, 1976, at the [[Avignon Festival]] in France. The opera contains writings by [[Christopher Knowles]], Samuel M. Johnson and [[Lucinda Childs]].&lt;ref name="page-liner_notes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philipglass.com/recordings/einstein_on_the_beach_none/ |title=Dunvagen Music Publishers, ''Einstein on the Beach'' (Recording), Nonesuch Records 1993, Liner notes written by Tim Page (accessed October 22, 2007) |publisher=Philipglass.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Glass's first and longest opera score, taking approximately five hours in full performance without intermission; given the length, the audience is permitted to enter and leave as desired.&lt;ref name="page-liner_notes" /&gt;

The work became the first in Glass's thematically related Portrait Trilogy, along with ''[[Satyagraha (opera)|Satyagraha]]'' (1979), and ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]'' (1983). These three operas were described by Glass as portraits of people whose personal vision transformed the thinking of their times through the power of ideas rather than by military force.&lt;ref name="page-liner_notes" /&gt;

== Composition and performance history ==

Glass and Wilson first met to discuss the prospects of a collaborative work, and decided on an opera of between four and five hours in length based around a historical persona. Wilson initially suggested [[Charlie Chaplin]] or [[Adolf Hitler]], whom Glass outright rejected, while Glass proposed [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (later the central figure of his opera [[Satyagraha (opera)|''Satyagraha'']]). [[Albert Einstein]] was the eventual compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130#PPA133,M1|first=Peter|last=Lavezzoli|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|page=133|publisher=Continuum|year=2006|accessdate=1 March 2010|isbn=9780826418159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976 premiere and first tour===

''Einstein on the Beach'' premiered on July 25, 1976, at the [[Avignon Festival]] in France, performed by the [[Philip Glass Ensemble]] and presented by the Byrd Hoffmann Foundation.&lt;ref name="glass-music" /&gt; The opera was also staged that summer in Hamburg, Paris, Belgrade, Venice, Brussels and Rotterdam. To realise a staging in New York, Glass and Wilson agreed to rent the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York to hold two performances in November 1976.&lt;ref name="page-liner_notes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ann Arbor News"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Will|title=Creators Philip Glass, Robert Wilson discuss legendary 'Einstein on the Beach' with packed Michigan Theater crowd|url=http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/philip-glass-robert-wilson-lecture/|website=The Ann Arbor News|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucinda Childs, Robert Wilson pupil Sheryl S. Sutton and Samuel M. Johnson filled the primary characters; all three reappeared in the 1984 BAM revival.

===1980s===

The [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) next mounted the opera in 1984. A one-hour documentary about this production appeared on public television, titled ''Einstein on the Beach: The Changing Image of Opera''.

In 1988, opera director [[Achim Freyer]] (who had staged the world premiere of Glass's ''Akhnaten'' in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1984) designed and staged a reworked version in a highly abstract style, with new spoken texts from the early 20th century, at the [[Staatsoper Stuttgart|Stuttgart State Opera]]. As with the premiere, this version was also conducted by Michael Riesman.&lt;ref&gt;Stuttgart State Theater, performance programme, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===

In 1992, a revival was mounted by International Production Associates that included the participation of Wilson, Glass and Childs. The production was re-staged at the McCarter theater at Princeton University. It subsequently toured to Frankfurt, Melbourne, Barcelona, Madrid, Tokyo, Brooklyn (BAM) and Paris.

===2000s===

In 2001, the opera was staged as an "opera-installation" at the former headquarters of the [[Staatsbank|State Bank of the GDR]] in Berlin. It was conducted by Ari Benjamin Myers, directed by Berthold Schneider, with stage design by Veronika Witte. The performance combined the concepts of opera and installation art, created by various artists for the production. The spectators were encouraged to wander through the exhibition, while the actions of the musicians could be followed on video screens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.operaworks.de/eob1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A different production by the same team, following the same principle, was staged on the Einstein anniversary in 2005 at the Berlin [[Parochialkirche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.operaworks.de/eob2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Carnegie Hall]] presented a concert version of ''Einstein'' in which violinist [[Tim Fain]] appeared as soloist. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote about his performance, "And Tim Fain, the violinist, gave the solo passages in the second, fourth and fifth 'Knee Plays' and in the climactic, swirling 'Spaceship Interior' scene an electrifying, virtuosic workout." Fain tours extensively with Phillip Glass in duo recitals and they always include the solo from "Knee Play 2" on their program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/08/arts/music/08eins.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 "At the Shore, Although the Water Is Shallower"] by [[Allan Kozinn]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
A revival with the participation of all the original collaborators was commissioned by the [[New York City Opera]] (NYCO) to open their 2009/2010 season. When General Manager designate [[Gerard Mortier]] withdrew from NYCO, the revival, along with the rest of Mortier's programming, was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=November 7, 2008|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2008/11/gerard-mortier.html |title=Gerard Mortier resigns from New York City Opera|publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com|accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team that had organized the New York City Opera production put together another group to remount ''Einstein'', under the management of Pomegranate Arts. After a month of rehearsals overseen by Glass, Wilson and Childs, the first performance in 20 years took place on January 20, 2012, presented by the University Musical Society at the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor (two additional performances that weekend followed). The performance featured Kate Moran and Helga Davis replacing Childs' and Sutton's roles respectively. [[Grammy Award]]-nominated violinist [[Jennifer Koh]] played the role of Einstein in the preview and alternated with [[Antoine Silverman]] for the subsequent tour. The other instrumental performers and [[solfege]] soprano for these performances are the current members of the [[Philip Glass Ensemble]] without Glass himself performing.  The performers in the 2012 production included members of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company: Ty Boomershine, Matthew Pardo, Patrick O'Neill, Stuart Singer, Lonnie Poupard, Caitlin Scranton, Sharon Milanese, Katie Dorn, Katherine Helen Fisher, Anne Lewis, Shakirah Stewart, and Sarah Hillmon.  The chorus for this revival was composed of sopranos Michèle Eaton, Melanie Russell, Lindsay Kesselman; altos Hai-Ting Chinn, Solange Merdinian, Kate Maroney; tenors John Kawa, Philip Anderson, Tomas Cruz; and basses Greg Purnhagen, Joe Damon Chappel, and Jason Charles Walker.

The official tour began on March 16, 2012, (after a single preview the previous evening) with the premiere at the [[Opéra national de Montpellier|Opéra Berlioz]] in Montpellier, France. This was followed by performances at the [[Teatro Municipale (Reggio Emilia)|Teatro Valli]] in Reggio Emilia, Italy; the [[Barbican Centre]], London; the [[Sony Centre for the Performing Arts]], Toronto; the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] Brooklyn, New York; [[Zellerbach Hall]] at the University of California, Berkeley, California; the Teatro del [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], Mexico City: in 2013, at [[Het Muziektheater]]/[[De Nederlandse Opera]], Amsterdam;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2012-01-24|publisher=Pomegranate Arts, Inc.|title=''Einstein on the Beach'': Tour|url=http://pomegranatearts.com/project-einstein/tour.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824224639/http://pomegranatearts.com/project-einstein/tour.html|archivedate=2011-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong; [[Arts Centre Melbourne]], Melbourne, Australia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Einstein on the Beach|url=http://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/event.aspx?id=3361|work=What's On|publisher=Arts Centre Melbourne|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles Opera]], Los Angeles: and, in 2014 there were performances in Paris and Berlin.

This touring production of ''Einstein on the Beach'' was commissioned by: BAM; the Barbican, London; Cal Performances with the University of California, Berkeley; [[Luminato]] – Toronto Festival of Arts and Creativity; De Nederlandse Opera/The Amsterdam Music Theatre; Opéra national de Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon; and the [[University Musical Society]] of the University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2012-01-24|publisher=Pomegranate Arts, Inc.|title=''Einstein on the Beach''|url=http://pomegranatearts.com/project-einstein/index.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115044107/http://www.pomegranatearts.com/project-einstein/index.html|archivedate=2012-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carolina Crown]]'s 2013 [[Drum Corps International]] Championship production "E=mc^2" included selections of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpsreps.com – The Drum Corps Repertoire Database|url=http://www.corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpsdet&amp;corps=43&amp;corpstype=Junior|website=corpsreps.com|publisher=corpsreps.com|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturebox, a digital production dedicated to cultural content for French Television, streamed a live performance from [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] on January 7, 2014, and made it available as streaming video for the next six months only. This was the first time the opera was filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Einstein on the Beach'' broadcast live on Culturebox from Théâtre du Châtelet on January 7, 2014|url=http://www.france5.fr/et-vous/userdata/a_augure_file/7/7981/EN-Culturebox-Einstein-on-the-beach.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a new staging of "Einstein on the Beach" will premiere at the [[Opernhaus Dortmund]], Germany, in April 2017. It is directed by [[Kay Voges]] and is supposed to be the first production of "Einstein on the Beach" without Glass or Wilson personally involved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theaterdo.de/detail/event/einstein-on-the-beach/ Einstein on the Beach]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theaterdo.de/detail/event/einstein-on-the-beach/ Theater Dortmund: Kay Voges inszeniert ein Opernspektakel (German language)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

From the beginning of Glass and Wilson's collaboration, they insisted on portraying the icon purely as a historical figure, in the absence of a storyline attached to his image. While they did incorporate symbols from Einstein's life within the opera's scenery, characters, and music, they intentionally chose not to give the opera a specific plot.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schwarz, Minimalists (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 1996) 135.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in accord with Wilson's formalist approach, which he asserts creates more truth on stage than naturalist theater. Wilson structured ''Einstein on the Beach'' as a repeating sequence of three different kinds of space. Between major acts are shorter entr'actes known as "knee plays," a signature technique that Wilson has applied throughout his oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Fairbrother, "Robert Wilson's Vision". (New York: Harry Abrams, 1991) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Propelling idea of "non-plot" within ''Einstein on the Beach'', its [[libretto]] employs [[solfège]] syllables, numbers, and short sections of poetry. In an interview, Glass comments that he originally intended for his audience to construct personal connections with Einstein as a character and with the music that he assigns to the icon.&lt;ref name="glass-music" /&gt; For example, the music within the first of the opera's "Knee Plays" features repeated numbers accompanied by an [[electric organ]]. Glass states that these numbers and solfège syllables were used as placeholders for texts by the singers to memorize their parts, and were kept instead of replacing them with texts.&lt;ref name="glass-music" /&gt; This numerical repetition, however, offers an interpretation as a reference to the mathematical and scientific breakthroughs made by Einstein himself. Of further reference to the icon's image, everything on the originally staged set of ''Einstein on the Beach'', from costumes to lighting, depicts specific aspects that refer to Einstein's life.&lt;ref name="cunningham"&gt;David Cunningham, "Einstein on the Beach" in ''Writings on Glass: Essays Interviews and Criticism''. Edited by Richard Kostelanetz. (New York: Schirmer Books, 1997)153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the music assigned to ''Einstein'' demonstrates a circular process, a repeating cycle that constantly delays resolution. This process uses both additive and subtractive formulas. The three main scenes within the opera—"Train", "Trial", and "Field/Spaceship"—allude to Einstein's hypotheses about his theory of relativity and his unified field theory.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt; Specifically, themes within the opera allude to nuclear weapons, science, and [[AM radio]].

The opera consists of nine connected 20-minute scenes in four acts separated by "Knee Plays". Five "Knee Plays" frame the opera's structure and appear in between acts, while also functioning as the opening and closing scenes. Glass defines a "Knee Play" as an interlude between acts and as "the 'knee' referring to the joining function that humans' anatomical knees perform".&lt;ref name="glass-music" /&gt; While the "Knee Plays" helped to create the necessary time to change the scenery of Wilson's seven sets, these interludes also served a musical function. David Cunningham, a Glass scholar, writes that the intermittence of Glass's "Knee Plays" amongst the opera's four acts, serves as a "constant motif in the whole work".&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt;

The opera requires a cast of two female, one male, and one male child in speaking roles (for the Wilson production); a 16-person [[SATB]] chamber chorus with an outstanding soprano soloist and a smaller tenor solo part; three [[Reed (instrument)#"Reed players"|reed players]]: [[flute]] (doubling [[piccolo]] and [[bass clarinet]]), [[soprano saxophone]] (doubling flute), [[tenor saxophone]] (doubling [[alto saxophone]]); solo violin, and two synthesizers/electronic organs.&lt;ref name="page-liner_notes" /&gt; The orchestration was originally tailored to the five members of the Philip Glass Ensemble, plus the solo [[violin]].

== "I Feel the Earth Move" ==

"I Feel the Earth Move" is the third section in the Trial 2/Prison section of the opera. The section is written in the same style as the rest of the opera, but has an instrumentation of [[soprano saxophone]] and [[bass clarinet]], omitting the [[electronic keyboard]] used in most of the segments in ''Einstein on the Beach''. A poem by [[Christopher Knowles]] is read over the musical soprano saxophone and bass clarinet line and in the poem's meanderings, it mentions such "TV personalities" as [[David Cassidy]]. A shortened version of this piece was chosen along with three other selections from ''Einstein on the Beach'' to appear on another Philip Glass album ''[[Songs from the Trilogy]]'', which also included selections from Glass's operas ''[[Satyagraha (opera)|Satyagraha]]'' and ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]''. The section's title is a reference to a [[Carole King]] song of the [[I Feel the Earth Move|same name]], from her album ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]''.

== Recordings ==

Two "complete" recordings of the opera have been made: the first in 1978, initially released on the [[Tomato Records|Tomato]] label (TOM-4-2901) in 1979, and later reissued by [[CBS Masterworks]], followed by [[Sony Classical]] (both M4K 38875); the second in 1993, released that same year on the [[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]] label (79323). The 1978 recording was held to 165 minutes in order to fit onto four LP records, i.e., the opening scene's repeats were considerably shortened. The 1993 recording encompassed 200 minutes, freed by the technology of the compact disc, although it was released on ''three'' CDs instead of the original's four.

[[Michael Riesman]] conducted both recordings. In 1978, Lucinda Childs, Sheryl Sutton, Paul Mann, and Samuel M. Johnson performed the opera's texts, with Philip Glass Ensemble performer Iris Hiskey taking the soprano solo. In 1993 Childs and Sutton repeated their roles, while Gregory Dolbashian and Jasper McGruder replaced Mann and the late Mr. Johnson's roles respectively, and Jeremy Montemarano voiced the role of "The Boy;" Schuman sang the soprano role. Most of the participants in the Nonesuch recording had performed in ''Einstein on the Beach'' during its 1992 world tour. A 77-minute highlights CD from the 1984 Brooklyn Academy of Music performances, accompanied by a DVD documentary, was released by Philip Glass's personal label Orange Mountain Music in early September 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009173UBY/ Philip Glass &amp; Robert Wilson: ''Einstein on the Beach'' CD/DVD], Amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; and an extended recording, 217 minutes long, was released at the same time but available only by download from the iTunes Store. In October 2013, [[Pacifica Radio]] released a two disc set of a 1976 interview with Glass and Wilson conducted at [[The Kitchen]] and excerpts from a rehearsal of some excerpts from the opera, also performed at The Kitchen on March 19, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacificaradioarchives.org/article/discovering-philip-glass-einstein-beach "Discovering Philip Glass ''Einstein on the Beach''"] by bdeshazor, Pacifica Radio, 14 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The violin part for the work has been performed by Robert Brown (in the live 1976 production), [[Paul Zukofsky]] (in the 1979 recording), [[Tison Street]] (in the live 1984 production), Gregory Fulkerson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gregory Fulkerson at Melody Bunting International | url=http://www.melodybunting.com/id63.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the live 1992 production and 1993 recording) and an interchanging performance of Jennifer Koh and Antoine Silverman during the 2012/16 production.

[[Anton Batagov]] recorded 3 transcription pieces (Scene 2 - Trail 1 from Act 1, Scene 2 - Night Train from Act 2 and Knee Play 5) from this work on solo piano in his album ''PROPHECIES'' (2016, on Orange Mountain Music label).

A 270min recording from January 2014 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris was released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=OABD7173D Glass, P.: ''Einstein on the Beach'' (Châtelet, 2014) (Blu-ray, HD) Opus Arte OABD7173D], [[Naxos Records]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre thrived in [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] and [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] Europe, where rulers utilized the form to both document and [[Propaganda|embellish]] displays of wealth and power.

==Description==
Large numbers were produced, often surviving in very few copies; the largest collection, in the [[British Library]], has over 2000 examples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/collfestbooksbl.html The British Library collection of festival books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with [[woodcut]]s or [[engraving]]s showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were [[ephemera]]; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] into [[Valladolid]], 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by [[Louis XII]] to Ferdinand at [[Savona]] (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of [[Ferdinand Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:120f.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''livrets'' are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves.  [[Roy Strong]] finds that they are "an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip II of Spain]]'s ceremonial entry into [[Antwerp]] in 1549 was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/habsburg.html British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], the playwright and author of the book on ''The Magnificent Entertainment'' for [[James I of England]] is refreshingly frank:
:''Reader, you must understand, that a regard, being had that his Majestie should not be wearied with teadious speeches; A great part of those which are in this Booke set downe, were left unspoken; So that thou doest here receive them as they should have been delivered, not as they were.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0238&amp;strPage=69 British Library online book]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ehrenpforte.kol.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of top (about 1/10 of the height) of the ''Triumphal Arch'' of Maximilian, coloured [[woodcut]], overall design by [[Albrecht Dürer]].]]
The [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I]], went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large [[woodcut]]s by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car.  ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'' (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-07.html The American Institute for Conservation]; Figure 9 (and many later ones) show the Triumphal Car of Maximilian, and Figure 10 is the first appearance of the Arch&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories.&lt;ref&gt;For all on Dürer's involvement: Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', (British Museum Press), 2002:194–7, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in [[Bruges]] in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.&lt;ref&gt;A move the burghers were to regret when his son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] later took family revenge with an especially tough siege&lt;/ref&gt;

An early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0097 account] of the visit in 1530 of the future [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then [[King of Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], to [[Constantinople]].

The '''''International Festival of Kraków Composers''''' (Międzynarodowy Festiwal Kompozytorów Krakowskich) is a contemporary music festival that has been held in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]] since 1989. It is one of the two major festivals of its kind held each year in Poland, the other being the [[Warsaw Autumn]]. The festival presents numerous concerts of music by composers with a connection to Kraków, as well as contemporary pieces from around the world. In addition there are workshops and lectures. Overall responsibility for the festival rests with The Krakow Branch of the Polish Composers’ Union. From about 1993 up until 2013 the festival was directed by the musicologist Jerzy Stankiewicz, and since 2014 the director has been [[Marcel Chyrzyński]].&lt;ref&gt;http://festiwal.zkp.krakow.pl/en/o-festiwalu/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 International Festival of Kraków Composers will run from the 14th to the 22nd of April;&lt;ref&gt;http://festiwal.zkp.krakow.pl/en/o-festiwalu/&lt;/ref&gt; the official festival website is located [http://festiwal.zkp.krakow.pl/en/ here].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21305">'''International Holocaust Cartoon Contest''' was a cartoon competition sponsored by the Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'', to denounce what it called "Western hypocrisy on [[freedom of speech]]". The event was staged in response to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1280.htm 'Iranian TV Report on International Holocaust Cartoon Contest in Tehran' (Video)], [http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1280.htm (Transcripts)], [[Islamic Republic of Iran News Network|IRINN]], September 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Several public figures, including the United States State Department, the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan criticized the contest.&lt;ref name=condemn /&gt;

In January 2015, in the wake of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] and the magazines subsequent decision to publish further cartoons of [[Muhammad]], the [[Iranian House of Cartoon]] and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex in Iran announced that they would be sponsoring ''The 2nd International Holocaust Cartoons Contest''. Selected cartoons were exhibited in the Islamic Propaganda Organization starting on May 14, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/confront-antisemitism/holocaust-denial-and-distortion/iran-cartoon-exhibition/introduction/fact-sheet|title=The Government of Iran and the 2016 Holocaust Cartoon Exhibition — United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latuff nazi camp 2.png|thumb|This cartoon by [[Carlos Latuff]] won second prize in the 2006 competition.]]

On February 6, 2006, [[Farid Mortazavi]], graphics editor of ''Hamshahri'', announced a competition for cartoons on the [[Holocaust]]. The twelve best contributions were to be rewarded with a gold coin each, which were later increased to $5,000 to $12,000 prizes for the top 3 cartoons and 3 gold coins each for 12 other cartoonists. Later, ''Hamshahri'' published an English introduction to the contest, as well as preliminary rules.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Holocaust Contest Drawings.JPG|thumb|right|]]. The bottom image is [[Artistic rendering|rendered]]--&gt;
The contest was created in response to the twelve cartoons published by the [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' (see ''[[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]'') to challenge the championing of [[free speech|freedom of speech]] in the defense of the ''Jyllands-Posten'' cartoons. This was done under the notion that those who supported the ''Jyllands-Posten'''s right to free [[War against Islam|anti-Islamic]] speech would be placed in a precarious position were they to condemn the [[antisemitic]] cartoons targeted at one of the most sensitive of Jewish topics. In that introductory message for the contest, ''Hamshahri'' denounced what they called Western hypocrisy on freedom of speech, alleging that "it is impossible in the West to joke upon or even discuss certain topics related to [[Judaism]], such as the Holocaust, and the pretexts for the creation of [[Israel]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/world/africa/24iht-iran.2585075.html In Tehran, a riposte to the Danish cartoons] ([https://www.webcitation.org/5yygC1kNW?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/world/africa/24iht-iran.2585075.html Archived] on May 26, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2006, the editor in chief of ''Hamshahri'' commented in Persian that "the purpose of establishing such a competition is not to offend or ridicule anyone, but to do a discussion about the realities of the Holocaust." He also indicated that ''Hamshahri'' tries really hard not to cause pain for anyone and also added that the newspaper has no contention with the [[Jews in Iran]] or any other place, but that it has problems with [[Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/02/060214_he-hamshahri.shtml (Persian), 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masood Shojaei]], the director of [[Iran's Caricature House]] which cosponsored the competition also said: "Iran's Caricature House, as the only technically qualified center involved in the competition regards the Holocaust topic as a terrible and saddening issue".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=290458 MehrNews.com (Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition put on by [[The Iran Cartoon Organisation]] and ''Hamshahri'' newspaper opened on August 14, 2006.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

After the winners were announced in November 2006, Shojaei said the competition would become an annual event. The [[Associated Press]] quoted him as saying "Actually, we will continue until the destruction of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;Nasser Karimi: [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003337932_webcartoons01.html Iran names winner of its Holocaust cartoon contest], ''[[Associated Press]]'', November 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shojaei categorically denies that he even spoke to the Associated Press reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irancartoon.com/120/Sheer%20lies/index.htm|title="Sheer Lies"|publisher=|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===

====In Iran====
Conservative newspapers such as ''[[Kayhan]]'' and ''[[Jomhouri Eslami]]'' have hailed the decision by ''[[Hamshahri]]'' for the contest, and their cartoonists, such as [[Maziyar Bizhani]] have actively entered the competition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Several reformers criticized the cartoon competition and also the president's statements about the Holocaust. [[Emadoddin Baghi]], a famous member of religious-intellectuals circle, [[Ebrahim Yazdi]], the head of [[Nehzat Azadi |Nehzat Azadi Party]], [[Hamid Reza Jalaeipour]], a prominent figure of [[Islamic Iran Participation Front]] and [[Sadeq Zibakalam]], a prominent political analyst of the [[Kargozaran]] party criticized these new policies by calling them "useless, scientifically-baseless and purely political actions which originates  from the authorities' lack of historical knowledge". In an interview with [[BBC]], [[Nikahang Kowsar]], a former cartoonist for ''Hamshahri'', said he thought the competition was the wrong approach. "It's a bad reaction to a bad action coming from the Danish newspaper", he told the BBC. He also claimed in his weblog that, ''Hamshahri'' cartoonists will have a bad fate if they refuse to take part in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;BBC: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4709380.stm Iran paper's Holocaust cartoons], February 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli artists spoofed the contest by the [[Israeli antisemitic cartoons contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/TA-artist-takes-on-Iranian-cartoons|title=TA artist takes on Iranian cartoons|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International====

On February 8, 2006 [[Flemming Rose]] (the cultural editor for ''Jyllands-Posten''), told [[CNN]]: "My newspaper is trying to establish a contact with that Iranian newspaper ''Hamshahri'', and we would run the cartoons the same day as they publish them". Later that day, the paper's editor-in-chief said that ''Jyllands-posten'' would under no circumstances publish the Holocaust cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/danish-paper-refuses-holocaust-cartoons-1-1105292 |title=Danish paper refuses Holocaust cartoons |date=February 9, 2006 |publisher=Scotsman |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AjNKY210?url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/danish-paper-refuses-holocaust-cartoons-1-1105292 |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, the ''Hamshahri'' website suffered a [[denial-of-service attack]]. Simultaneously, the websites of [[Ministry of Education of Iran|Iran's ministry of education]] and two major Iranian banks, [[Bank Sepah|Sepah Bank]] and [[Refah Bank]], became inaccessible, as they were all hosted by the same [[Internet backbone|backbone]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Six of the least controversial cartoons of the International Holocaust Cartoon Competition were republished by Danish Newspaper ''[[Dagbladet Information]]'' on September 8, 2006 after the editor consulted the main rabbi in Copenhagen,&lt;ref&gt;BBC: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5327852.stm Paper reprints Holocaust cartoons], September 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and three cartoons were later reprinted in ''Jyllands-Posten'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jp.dk/login?url=kultur/artikel:aid=3961206 (link invalid)&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was also criticised by the then [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]],&lt;ref name=condemn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15525133/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/moroccan-wins-iran-holocaust-cartoon-contest/ |title=Moroccan wins Iran Holocaust cartoon contest |publisher=MSNBC |date=November 2, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AjOBPO3P?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15525133/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/moroccan-wins-iran-holocaust-cartoon-contest/ |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[U.S. State Department]],&lt;ref name=condemn/&gt; the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli foreign ministry]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]: [http://www.adl.org/main_Arab_World/asam_jul_dec_cartoon_contest_2006.htm Arab Media Review: Anti-Semitism and Other Trends July - December 2006: Iranian Holocaust Cartoon Contest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806191414/http://www.adl.org/main_Arab_World/asam_jul_dec_cartoon_contest_2006.htm |date=2010-08-06 }}, January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and other parties.&lt;ref&gt;David Cesarani: [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/david_cesarani/2006/12/post_777.html Deep in denial], ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winners ===
&lt;span id="mo"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
On November 1, 2006, political cartoonist [[Abdellah Derkaoui]] ({{lang-ar|عبدالله درقاوي}}), a [[Morocco|Moroccan]], was announced as the winner and received the first prize of US$12,000. Derkaoui's winning cartoon differed from many of the runners-up, in that it did not deny the Holocaust; instead, it used the Holocaust to make a comparison between the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Criticism of the Israeli government|current actions of the Israeli government]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109185147/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3868 Holocaust Cartoon Contest] Foreign Policy in Focus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prize of US$8,000 was split to Brazilian cartoonist [[Carlos Latuff]] and far-right cartoonist [[Françoise Pichard|Chard]], from France, although Chard refused the prize, stating that her cartoon was entered into the competition without her consent. According to the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], the cartoon by Chard contains explicit [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/ahmadinejad-iran-and-holocaust-manipulation-methods-aims-and-reactions/ |title=Ahmadinejad, Iran, and Holocaust Manipulation: Methods, Aims, and Reactions |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AjOgfrue?url=http://jcpa.org/article/ahmadinejad-iran-and-holocaust-manipulation-methods-aims-and-reactions/ |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahram Rezai of Iran won the third prize of US$5,000. In addition to the main prizes, there were also 'Special Prizes' awarded to several entries, in which each was awarded with three gold coins. One of these prizes went to Italy, one prize to Morocco, two to Jordan, one to Syria, two to Brazil, and five went to Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;http://irancartoon.ir/news/archives/2006/11/post_586.php (Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016 competition ==
In December 2015, two state-sponsored Iranian cultural organizations, the Owj Media &amp; Art Institute and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex, announced a Holocaust cartoon contest. Over 150 cartoons from the contest made up a May 2016 exhibition in the art section at the Islamic Propaganda Organization in Tehran, as part of Iran's Cartoon Biennial. After the closing of the Tehran exhibition at the end of May 2016, the Islamic Propaganda Organization sponsored exhibitions of selected cartoons in provincial capitals throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Government of Iran and the 2016 Holocaust Cartoon Exhibition|url=https://www.ushmm.org/confront-antisemitism/holocaust-denial-and-distortion/iran-cartoon-exhibition/introduction/fact-sheet|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions ===

====In Iran====
In an April 2016 interview published in the ''New Yorker'', Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tried to distance the Iranian government from the contest, asserting that it did not receive government support or endorsement, and that no official permission was necessary to hold it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Robin|title=Iran's Javad Zarif on the Fraying Nuclear Deal, U.S. Relations, and Holocaust Cartoons|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/irans-javad-zarif-on-the-fraying-nuclear-deal-u-s-relations-and-holocaust-cartoons|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Zarif's statement, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance questioned the Foreign Minister's comments, stating that the Ministry supports any program that will "enlighten people about the Holocaust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran's 'moderates' and the Holocaust|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mr-zarifs-holocaust-denial-denial/2016/05/09/2b5570b6-160a-11e6-9e16-2e5a123aac62_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main spokesperson for the contest, Mas`oud Shoja'i Tabataba'i, said that Zarif was not welcome at the exhibition. Zarif was questioned in the Iranian parliament about his negative position on the Holocaust cartoon contest and exhibition three months after its closing. He maintained his belief that Holocaust denial does not benefit the Islamic Republic of Iran and he repeated the claim that the contest was the work of an NGO and not any government agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mohammadi|first1=Majid|title=Iran's Second Holocaust Cartoon Exhibition and Its Aftermath|url=https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Iran-aftermath-paper.pdf|website=US Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International====
American political cartoonist [[Daryl Cagle]] entered a cartoon into the Second Holocaust Cartoon Competition in 2015. The cartoon features Iran's Supreme Leader with his face in the shape of a pair of human buttocks: the face / posterior is farting out the words to his famous statement, "The Holocaust is an event whose reality is uncertain and if it has happened, it's uncertain how it happened."

"I'm guessing the Iranians will not choose to include my cartoon in their exhibition and competition – but considering how the contest organizers complain about the "West" censoring "discussion" of the Holocaust, I thought it was a nice irony to give them a Holocaust cartoon that they would likely censor," writes Cagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darylcagle.com/2015/04/27/i-entered-irans-holocaust-cartoon-contest/|title=I entered Iran's Holocaust cartoon contest|date=May 1, 2015|publisher=DarylCagle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irina Bokova]], Director-General of [[UNESCO]] condemned the holding of it: "Such an initiative which aims at a mockery of the genocide of the Jewish people, a tragic page of humanity's history, can only foster hatred and incite to violence, racism and anger. This contest goes against the universal values of tolerance and respect, and runs counter to the action led by UNESCO to promote Holocaust education, to fight amti-Semitism and denial."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/director-general/singleview-dg/news/unesco_director_general_condemns_the_holding_of_the_secon/|title=UNESCO Director-General condemns the holding of the "Second International Holocaust Cartoon Contest" -   United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winners ===
On May 31, 2016, French cartoonist Zeon was announced as the winner and received the first prize of US$12,000. The cartoonist was arrested by the French authorities back in March 2015 for his [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] work that he drew back in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/europe/201503171019629181/|title=Je Suis Zeon: French Freedom of Speech is a Myth, Says Cartoonist|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His winning work features what appears to be the entry gate of a Nazi-era death camp atop a cash register with six million in cash inside.

Indonesian artist Jitet Koestana won the second prize of US$7,000 while Mahmud Nazari from Iran won the third prize of US$5,000. In addition to the main prizes similar to the 2006 contest, there were also 'Special Prizes' awarded to several entries, in which each was awarded with three gold coins. One of these prizes went to [[Belgium]], [[Morocco]], [[Turkey]] and several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/403044/French-Iranian-artists-top-at-Holocaust-cartoon-contest|title=French, Iranian artists top at Holocaust cartoon contest|date=2016-05-31|newspaper=Tehran Times|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian winner, Luc Descheemaeker using the name O-sekoer, is a schoolteacher in a Catholic school in the Flemish city of [[Torhout]]. The school and the city felt very honored that he won a price at that contest. Even the Flemish press took his defense towards Jewish organisations condemning the contest. The mayor of the city is the Flemish minister of education, [[Hilde Crevits]] who refused to condemn the cartoon{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Descheemaeker was consequently nominated cultural ambassador of the city of Torhout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/bleva_02662579|title=O-sekoer, Torhouts culturele wereldambassadeur|first=Eric|last=Vanhooren|publisher=|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile other antisemitic cartoons drawn by him were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/08/25/news-opinion/world/how-my-jta-reporting-about-an-anti-semitic-cartoon-changed-my-views-of-belgium-for-the-worse|title=How my JTA reporting about an anti-Semitic cartoon changed my views of Belgium — for the worse|publisher=|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/08/10/news-opinion/world/belgian-high-school-proud-of-teacher-honored-at-irans-holocaust-cartoon-show|title=Belgian high school 'proud' of teacher honored at Iran's Holocaust cartoon show|publisher=|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the contest, the Iranian House of Cartoon and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex announced another similar contest, this time calling for cartoon submissions on the  "Zionist Caliphate" that will focus on "Zionism, terrorism and racism" and "[[ISIL]] terrorism and genocide in the name of religion and to the benefit of the [[Zionist Regime|Zionists]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.adl.org/international/winners-of-irans-holocaust-cartoon-contest-announced|title=You are being redirected...|website=blog.adl.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for entries has been set for 16 June 2016, with the winners to be announced at a later date with cash prizes of up to [[US$]]5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/holocaust-cartoon-contest-iran-zionist-caliphate-competition-465256?rm=eu|title=After Holocaust cartoon contest, Iran announces "Zionist Caliphate" competition|newspaper=Newsweek|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7515">'''Johnson Aziga''' (born 1956) is a [[Uganda]]n-born [[Canadians|Canadian]] man formerly residing in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada, notable as the first person to be charged and convicted of [[first-degree murder]] in Canada for spreading [[HIV]], after two women whom he had infected without their knowledge died.

== Background ==
Aziga was a former staffer at the [[Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General]]. According to CBC News, he was diagnosed with HIV in 1996.  He had unprotected sex with 11 women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/Ontario/2011/05/10/002-johnson-aziga-proces-sida.shtml |title=Transmission volontaire du sida : Johnson Aziga de retour en cour &amp;#124; ICI.Radio-Canada.ca |publisher=Radio-canada.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; without telling them he was HIV-positive.  Seven of these women later tested positive for HIV, two of whom died of complications from [[AIDS]] in December 2003 and May 2004.

Several Canadian courts have ruled that persons who are not informed that a sexual partner is HIV-positive cannot truly give consent to sex.

== Arrest and trial ==
{{wikinews|Canadian convicted of murder in HIV case}}
Aziga was arrested in August 2003.&lt;ref name=cp20081020&gt;{{cite news

On November 16, 2005, Justice Norman Bennett of Hamilton ruled there is sufficient evidence for Aziga to stand trial.  His trial date was initially set for May 2007 but was moved back several times. As of May, 2008, the trial was set to begin October 6, 2008.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul |last= Legall |title= Ministry to pay for HIV defence |url=http://www.thespec.com/News/Local/article/315335 |work= The Hamilton Spectator |location= Hamilton, Ontario, Canada |date= 2008-01-26 |accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to try Aziga was criticized by Richard Elliott, deputy director of the [[Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network]], who described the decision as "not particularly helpful" and argued that it may lead to a "dominant impression out there of people living with HIV as potential criminals, which is not an accurate or fair representation."

Aziga was the first Canadian ever to be criminally convicted on charges for knowingly infecting others with the  HIV virus without telling the victims. He was designated a dangerous offender.  In an earlier case, Charles Ssenyonga of [[London, Ontario]] was prosecuted on the lesser charges of aggravated assault and criminal negligence causing bodily harm, although he died of [[meningitis]] before a verdict was rendered in his case.

In the 1999 decision ''[[R. v. Cuerrier]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that people who knowingly exposed/infected others to HIV through unprotected sex could be charged with a crime on the grounds that failure to disclose one's HIV status to a sex partner constitutes [[fraud]].

Aziga's trial began in October 2008.&lt;ref name=cp20081020/&gt;  Among the first revelations made in trial proceedings are claims by Aziga's former girlfriends that he lied about his HIV status and continued having unprotected sex until the morning of his arrest in 2003.  Aziga's lawyers claim that no conclusive link can be shown to indicate that the deaths of his former girlfriends can be attributed to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20081120.BLATCH20/TPStory/TPComment/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124011414/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20081120.BLATCH20/TPStory/TPComment/ |date=November 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2009, Aziga was found guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree, 10 counts of aggravated sexual assault, and one count of attempted aggravated sexual assault by a jury made up of nine men and three women at Hamilton Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/article/613920 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=Guilty verdict in Hamilton HIV murder case | first=Barbara | last=Brown | date=2009-04-04 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder convictions resulted from the fact that Canadian jurisprudence has established that failure to disclose one's HIV status before unprotected sex means that the partner cannot give consent (as they have been deliberately deprived of information that might cause a reasonable person to reconsider), resulting in the sexual act becoming aggravated sexual assault. Under Canadian law, any death resulting from aggravated sexual assault (i.e. the two women who died as a result of HIV/AIDS complications) is automatically murder in the first degree. Aziga was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with no possibility of parole for 25 years, the mandatory sentence in Canada for a conviction of first-degree murder.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;Jordana Huber, [http://www.canada.com/news/Ontario+appeal+sentence+AIDS+deaths/1470262/story.html "Ontario man to appeal sentence in AIDS deaths"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Canwest News Service'', 2009-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Aziga has expressed his intention to appeal his conviction.&lt;ref name = appeal/&gt;

On August 2, 2011, a court in Hamilton, Ont. granted a request by Crown Prosecutors to have Johnson Aziga jailed indefinitely under the Dangerous Offender act, because he is believed to be at a high risk to re-offend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20110802/johnson-aziga-dangerous-offender-decision-110802/ | work=CTV News | location=Toronto | title=HIV killer declared dangerous offender | date=2011-08-02 | accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julekonserten''' was a Norwegian Christmas concert which was held every year between 1989 and 1999. ''Julekonserten'' toured in [[Scandinavia]], and visited cities in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] with a mix of Scandinavian artists. The long list of artists and performers includes [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]], [[The Chieftains]], [[Oslo Gospel Choir]], [[Triple &amp; Touch]], [[Rune Larsen]], [[Tor Endresen]] and Kurt Ravn. Every year ''Julekonserten'' (the concerts in [[Oslo]] and [[Gjøvik]]) was also broadcast on Television in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Stageway AS arranged these concerts and a part of the money went to aid children on the street in La Paz and Santa Cruz in Bolivia.

Two CDs were released from their concerts, ''Julekonserten'' (1996) and ''Julekonserten 10 år'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sissel.net/cds.html|title=CDs|work=Sissel.net|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209151350/http://www.sissel.net/cds.html|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rare recording of [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]] performing [[My Tribute (To God Be The Glory)]] with [[Oslo Gospel Choir]] at Julekonserten 1997 in [[Gjøvik]] can be found on the 1998 compilation album ''The Best of Sissel''.

The '''Khartoum Resolution''' of 1 September 1967 was issued at the conclusion of the [[1967 Arab League summit]] convened in the wake of the [[Six-Day War]], in [[Khartoum]], the capital of [[Sudan]]. The summit lasted from 29 August  to 1 September and was attended by eight Arab heads of state: [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Algeria]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Khartoum  The joint resolution passed by eight the member states of the Arab League: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait and Sudan. Resolutions|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/three_noes.html|work=[[American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]]|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution called for: a continued state of belligerency with [[Israel]], ending the [[1967 Oil Embargo|Arab oil boycott]] declared during the [[Six-Day War]], an end to the [[North Yemen Civil War]], and economic assistance for [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]]. It is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the "Three No's": "no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-In-History-The-Arab-Leagues-three-nos|title=This Week in History: The Arab League Three No's|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text of the resolution ==
#The conference has affirmed the unity of Arab states, the unity of joint action and the need for coordination and for the elimination of all differences. The Kings, Presidents and representatives of the other Arab Heads of State at the conference have affirmed their countries' stand by an implementation of the Arab Solidarity Charter which was signed at the third Arab summit conference in Casablanca.
#The conference has agreed on the need to consolidate all efforts to eliminate the effects of the aggression on the basis that the occupied lands are Arab lands and that the burden of regaining these lands falls on all the Arab States.
#The Arab Heads of State have agreed to unite their political efforts at the international and diplomatic level to eliminate the effects of the aggression and to ensure the withdrawal of the aggressive Israeli forces from the Arab lands which have been occupied since the aggression of 5 June. This will be done within the framework of the main principles by which the Arab States abide, namely, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it, and insistence on the rights of the Palestinian people in their own country.
#The conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil recommended that suspension of oil pumping be used as a weapon in the battle. However, after thoroughly studying the matter, the summit conference has come to the conclusion that the oil pumping can itself be used as a positive weapon, since oil is an Arab resource which can be used to strengthen the economy of the Arab States directly affected by the aggression, so that these States will be able to stand firm in the battle. The conference has, therefore, decided to resume the pumping of oil, since oil is a positive Arab resource that can be used in the service of Arab goals. It can contribute to the efforts to enable those Arab States which were exposed to the aggression and thereby lost economic resources to stand firm and eliminate the effects of the aggression. The oil-producing States have, in fact, participated in the efforts to enable the States affected by the aggression to stand firm in the face of any economic pressure.
#The participants in the conference have approved the plan proposed by Kuwait to set up an Arab Economic and Social Development Fund on the basis of the recommendation of the Baghdad conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil.
#The participants have agreed on the need to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen military preparation to face all eventualities.
#The conference has decided to expedite the elimination of foreign bases in the Arab States.

==Interpretations==
Commentators have frequently presented the resolution as an example of Arab [[wikt:rejectionism|rejectionism]]. [[Efraim Halevy]], Guy Ben-Porat, [[Steven R. David]], [[Julius Stone]], and [[Ian Bremmer]] all agree the Khartoum Resolution amounted to a rejection of Israel's [[right to exist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halevy |first=Efraim |title=Israel's Hamas Portfolio |url=http://israelcfr.com/documents/issue6_hamas.pdf |publisher=[[Israel Council on Foreign Relations]] |accessdate=8 June 2012 |authorlink=Efraim Halevy |quote=Indeed, twenty years later, after two successive wars, the Arab world rejected Israel's right to exist at the infamous Khartoum Conference of 196[7] – 'the three NOs': no to recognition, no to negotiation, and no to peace were uttered in response to Israel's appeal to negotiate without any preconditions. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225221835/http://israelcfr.com/documents/issue6_hamas.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ben-Porat|first=Guy|title= Global Liberalism, Local Populism: Peace and Conflict in Israel/Palestine and Northern Ireland|year=2006|publisher= [[Syracuse University Press]]|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|isbn= 0-8156-3069-7|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o0EVZoyteO8C&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=8 June 2012|page=145|chapter= Chapter 7: Israel, Globalization, and Peace|quote= Convening in Khartoum shortly after the war, Arab states declared their refusal to negotiate with Israel or to recognize its right to exist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=David|first=Steven R.|title=Contemporary Israel: Domestic Politics, Foreign Policy, and Security Challenges|year=2009|publisher=[[Westview Press|WestView Press]]|location=[[Boulder, Colorado]]|isbn=978-0-8133-4385-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOywsZizLi0C&amp;pg=PA559|authorlink=Steven R.

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Benny Morris]] wrote that the Arab leaders "hammered out a defiant, rejectionist platform that was to bedevil all peace moves in the region for a decade," despite an Israeli offer on June 19, 1967 "to give up Sinai and the Golan in exchange for peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/234104996|title=Righteous victims : a history of the Zionist-Arab conflict, 1881–1999|last=Morris|first=Benny|date=|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2001|isbn=9780679744757|location=|pages=346|oclc=234104996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Odd Bull]] of the [[UNTSO]] opined in much the same manner in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/490839078|title=War and peace in the Middle East the experiences a views of a U.N. observer|last=Bull|first=Odd|publisher=Leo Cooper|year=1976|isbn=9780850522266|location=|pages=126|oclc=490839078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avi Shlaim]] has argued that Arab spokesmen interpreted the Khartoum declarations to mean "no formal peace ''treaty'', but not a rejection of peace; no ''direct'' negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; and no ''de jure'' recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state" (emphasis in original). Shlaim states that the conference marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, noting that Nasser urged Hussein to seek a "comprehensive settlement" with Israel. Shlaim acknowledges that none of this was known in Israel at the time, whose leaders took the "three no's" at face value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59510046|title=The iron wall : Israel and the Arab world|last=Shlaim|first=Avi|date=|publisher=Penguin|year=2001|isbn=9780140288704|location=|pages=258–259|oclc=59510046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Khouri argued that "the Khartoum conference cleared the way for the Arab moderates to seek a political solution and to offer, in exchange for their conquered lands, important concessions short of actually recognizing Israel and negotiating formal peace treaties with her.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/arab-israeli-dilemma/oclc/634263471?|title=The Arab-Israeli dilemma|last=Khouri|first=Fred|date=|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=312–314|oclc=634263471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the [[Jarring Mission]] (1967–1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan, but neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, setting the stage for a new round of conflict.

The '''Lent Bumps''' (also Lent Races, Lents) are a set of [[Sport rowing|rowing]] races held annually on the [[River Cam]] in [[Cambridge]]. They began in 1887, after separating from the [[May Bumps]], which are bumping races held in mid-June. Prior to the separation there had been a single set of annual bumps dating from its inception in 1827.&lt;ref name="bumps"&gt;''The Bumps:An Account of the Cambridge University Bumping Races 1827-1999'', John Durack, George Gilbert &amp; Dr John Marks, 2000, {{ISBN|0-9538475-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The races are open to all college boat clubs from the [[University of Cambridge]], the University Medical and Veterinary Schools and [[Anglia Ruskin Boat Club]]. The Lent Bumps take place over five days (Tuesday to Saturday) at the end of February /start of March and are run as [[bumps race]]s.

The most recent in the series was the [[Lent Bumps 2018]], held from 27 February to 3 March 2018.  On Wednesday 28 February three of the divisions were cancelled because of snow and ice on the towpath, then all racing was cancelled on Thursday 1 March, and the two lower divisions on Friday 2 March.

== Structure ==
{{main|Bumps race}}
The races are run in divisions, each containing 17 crews. The number of crews in each bottom division varies yearly depending on new entrants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cucbc.org/mays/gor&lt;/ref&gt; Each crew consists of eight rowers and one [[coxswain]]. Unlike the [[May Bumps]], rowers trialling for places in [[Rowing (sport)|university crews]] are not allowed to take part in the Lents. A total of 121 crews took part in 2012, totalling around 1100 participants. There are currently four divisions for men's crews (referred to as M1, M2 ... M4) and three divisions for women's crews (similarly W1–W3). The divisions represent an overall race order, with Division 1 at the top. The ultimate aim is to try to finish ''Head of the River'' (also said as gaining the 'Headship'), i.e. first position in Division 1.

At the start, signalled by a cannon, each crew is separated by a distance of about 1½ boat lengths (approximately 30 m or 90&amp;nbsp;ft). Once the race has begun, a crew must attempt to catch up with the crew ahead of it and ''bump'' (physically touch or overtake it) before the crew behind does the same to them. A crew which bumps or is bumped must pull to the side of the river to allow other crews to continue racing. A crew which neither bumps the crew ahead nor is bumped by the crew behind before crossing the finishing post is said to have ''rowed over''. Any crew which bumps then swaps places with the crew that it bumped in the following day's racing. A crew which rows over stays in the same position. Crews finishing at the top of a division, the ''sandwich boat'', row at the bottom of the next division to try to move up a division. The process is repeated over four days, allowing crews to move up or down in the overall order of boats. The finish order of one year's Lent Bumps is then used as the starting order of the following year's races.

The leading men's and women's crews of the Lent Bumps go on to race the leading Oxford [[Torpids]] men's and women's crews at the [[Henley Boat Races]] around Easter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Light Blue men's and women's Lightweight crews race Oxford from Phyllis Court to Temple Island this spring|url=https://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/events/henley-boat-races-2017|publisher=Cambridge University Alumni Events|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent Bumps were cancelled from 1915 to 1918 due to war, and in 1895 and 1963 due to ice. The Lents in 1888 were not completed due to the death of an oarsman. When the races ceased, {{Camb|JE}} were in 1st position.&lt;ref name="bumps"/&gt; The [[Lent Bumps 2001]] were not completed due to an outbreak of [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|Foot and Mouth disease]] in the UK. The outbreak closed the towpath along the river, where all of the umpiring for the bumps takes place. When the races were abandoned on Friday 2 March 2001, {{Camb|EM}} were in 1st position.

In 1919, college 1st VIIIs did not race as it was the first race after [[World War I]]. The start order for the 1920 races was the finish order for the 1914 races.&lt;ref name="bumps"/&gt; Prior to 1946 {{Camb|TR}} were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.&lt;ref name="tr"&gt;http://www.firstandthird.org/ First and Third Trinity Boat Club website&lt;/ref&gt;

NB. The Women's Lent Bumps were not completed in [[Lent Bumps 2001|2001]] due to an outbreak of [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|Foot and Mouth disease]] in the UK. When the races were abandoned on Friday 2 March 2001, {{Camb|JE}} were in 1st position.

''*'' The head of the river in 1919 was, unusually, [[First Trinity Boat Club|1st Trinity]]’s second boat. It was the first race after [[World War I]] and 1st eights did not race. The start order for the 1920 races was the finish order for the 1914 races.&lt;ref name="bumps"/&gt;

Prior to 1946 {{Camb|TR}} were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.&lt;ref name="tr"/&gt;

CCAT, Clare Hall, Darwin, Homerton, Hughes Hall, King's, Lucy Cavendish, Magdalene, Robinson, St. Catharine's, Selwyn, Sidney Sussex, St Edmund's, Wolfson, Addenbrooke's and the Veterinary School are the regular entrants never to have finished Head of the River in either the men's or women's events.

The [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] generated various controversies, including onfield disputes, critiques of official decisions, and team salary issues. Most centered on specific refereeing decisions, which led many of the world's media to claim that the referees were spoiling the World Cup. Numerous World Cup records were also set by controversial calls, including [[#Three yellow cards issued (Croatia vs. Australia, group stage)|Graham Poll's three-card error]] and [[#Portugal vs. Netherlands (Second round)|Valentin Ivanov's record number of cards in a single match]].

FIFA's "Fair Play" agreement also came under intense scrutiny during the tournament, particularly during the [[#Portugal v Netherlands (Second round)|second-round match between Portugal and Netherlands]].

=== Errors ===

==== Three yellow cards issued (Croatia vs. Australia, group stage) ====
The deciding game for the Group F runners-up place, [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group F#Croatia vs Australia|Croatia vs. Australia]], saw English referee [[Graham Poll]] mistakenly issue three yellow cards to Croatian [[Josip Šimunić]] before sending him off. Šimunić was shown a yellow card by Poll in the 61st minute for a foul on Australian Harry Kewell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://wc2006.telegraph.co.uk/Document.aspx?id=8C8E2B20-81D5-4697-805E-B934B40A6F4D| date = 24 June 2006| title = Red card for Poll after clanger| last = Davies| first = Christopher| accessdate =3 July 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 90th minute, Poll held up a yellow card in front of Šimunić for a foul, but did not follow it with a red card, as is required upon a second yellow card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1151013012313&amp;call_pageid=1044529386722&amp;col=1044529386490| date = 23 June 2006| title = Soccer Notes: Ref gives 3 yellows|work=Toronto Star| accessdate =3 July 2006| location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 93rd minute, after Poll had blown the final whistle, Šimunić approached Poll angrily and gave him a push. Poll thus issued Šimunić with a 3rd yellow card and also showed him the red card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/soccer/14882044.htm| date = 23 June 2006| title = Third time not the charm| accessdate =3 July 2006| publisher = MiamiHerald.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060701214103/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/soccer/14882044.htm| archivedate= 1 July 2006| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions were raised as to why Poll's assistants [[Philip Sharp (football referee)|Phil Sharp]] and [[Glenn Turner (referee)|Glenn Turner]], and fourth official [[Kevin Stott]], had also failed to realise the error. Poll later denied any blame should be placed upon the other officials saying, "I was the referee, it was my error and the buck stops with me".&lt;ref name="pollbows"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wc2006.telegraph.co.uk/Document.aspx?id=05242562-5F1B-4C0A-944A-D253E5EDAB10 |date=30 June 2006 |title=Emotional Poll bows out |last=Davies |first=Christopher |accessdate=3 July 2006 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poll reported that the officials had felt "disbelief" upon hearing of the error in the dressing room after the game. He and the other officials consequently reviewed the DVD of the game, and Poll realised that his "dream was over".&lt;ref name="pollbows"/&gt;

[[Football Federation Australia]] chief executive [[John O'Neill (sport administrator)|John O'Neill]] later said that "Australia could have had grounds for a very strong appeal should Croatia have won the match".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0,20281,19572813-5001028,00.html |title=Aussies would have protested loss |date=24 June 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2006 |last=Hand |first=Gus |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711104411/http://www.dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0%2C20281%2C19572813-5001028%2C00.html |archivedate=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poll also explained the reason for his mistake by saying that he "incorrectly noted down the name of the Australia number three Craig Moore when booking Šimunić for the second time and failed to realise his error"&lt;ref name="pollsenthome"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5108722.stm| date = 28 June 2006| title = Ref Poll sent home from World Cup| accessdate =3 July 2006|publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060626065509/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5108722.stm| archivedate= 26 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Šimunić is Australian-born, hence speaks English with an Australian accent, probably causing the mistake).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/05/31/stuttgart-will-always-craziest-game-australias-footballing-history/| date = 31 May 2018| title = Stuttgart will always be the craziest game in Australia's footballing history| last = Tuckerman| first = Mike|website=The Roar| accessdate =27 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/documentary-helps-josip-simunic-continue-his-fight-to-clear-his-name-after-fifa-ban-20160204-gmleu8.html| date = 5 February 2016| title = Documentary helps Josip Simunic continue his fight to clear his name after FIFAban| last = Polkinghorne| first = David|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]| accessdate =27 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA Referees Committee President Angel Maria Villar Llona defended Poll but had to concede that an error had occurred. In a statement he remarked, "Thursday evening's 2–2 draw between Croatia and Australia in Stuttgart saw referee Graham Poll make an error".&lt;ref name="pollsenthome"/&gt; As a result of his error, Poll and his assistants did not progress to the second stage of the tournament. Despite encouragement from FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]], and chief executives of the Football Association and Premier League, Poll retired from refereeing international tournaments. Poll explained his decision to retire was a result of the "pain and agony" and "sleepless nights" that resulted from his mistake and the fear of it happening again.&lt;ref name="pollbows"/&gt;

Argentina was awarded a corner kick when one goal ahead in their game against Côte d'Ivoire. The kick, taken by [[Juan Román Riquelme]], found Argentine defender, [[Roberto Ayala]], who headed it towards goal. It was diverted by goalkeeper [[Jean-Jacques Tizié]]'s hands and bounced off the right goalpost before moving at least partially into the goal. Tizié fumbled the ball before returning it back into play, sparking protests from the Argentine players to Belgian referee [[Frank De Bleeckere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The first step: Argentina holds off Ivory Coast 2–1 in opener| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/specials/world_cup/2006/06/10/argentina.ivory.coast.ap/| date = 10 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006|work=Sports Illustrated}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Bleeckere looked to his assistant for help in the decision, but no confirmation could be made. TV replays reached no verdict either as to whether it was a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/sports/html/20060611T220000-0500_106766_OBS_BLATTER_PAYS_TRIBUTE_TO_WORLD_CUP_REFEREEING_SO_FAR_.asp| title = Blatter pays tribute to World Cup refereeing so far| date = 12 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006| publisher = The Jamaican Observer|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060629230824/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/sports/html/20060611T220000-0500_106766_OBS_BLATTER_PAYS_TRIBUTE_TO_WORLD_CUP_REFEREEING_SO_FAR_.asp|archivedate = 29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala was furious at referee Bleeckere for failing to award the goal and Argentine striker, [[Hernán Crespo]] later said, "It would have been a lot easier if that had counted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13247652/| title = Argentina strikes first in toughest group| date = 15 June 2006|publisher=MSNBC| accessdate =4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia vs. Japan (Group stage) ====
In the first-round game of Australia versus Japan, Egyptian referee [[Essam Abd El Fatah]] awarded a 26th-minute goal by [[Shunsuke Nakamura]] to the Japanese despite a protest from Australian goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/aussie-update/disputed-goal-rocks-socceroos/2006/06/12/1149964471236.html| title = Unbelievable win for Socceroos| date = 13 June 2006| last = Lynch| first = Michael| accessdate =4 July 2006|work=Sydney Morning Herald| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060629001130/http://www.smh.com.au/news/aussie-update/disputed-goal-rocks-socceroos/2006/06/12/1149964471236.html| archivedate= 29 June 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzer appeared to have been impeded upon by Japanese forward [[Atsushi Yanagisawa]] as he had come forward to punch the ball clear.&lt;ref name="cahilldouble"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=sportsNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-12T150023Z_01_L12411190_RTRUKOC_0_UK-SOCCER-WORLD-AUSTRALIA.xml |title=Cahill's late double delights Australia |last=Palmer |first=Justin |date=12 June 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2006|publisher=Reuters.co.uk}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese striker [[Naohiro Takahara]] then collided with Schwarzer, leaving him unable to prevent the ball rolling into the goal.&lt;ref name="hiddinkapology"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=106167 |title = Hiddink apologises for FIFA scuffle |date = 13 June 2006 |accessdate = 4 July 2006 |publisher = ninemsn |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060708170806/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=106167 |archivedate = 8 July 2006 |deadurl = yes |df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzer told reporters later that El Fatah had apologised to him for his mistake and had told Australian captain [[Mark Viduka]] that he was grateful "that God was on his side because the result went [Australia's] way in the end."&lt;ref name="refapologizes"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/specials/world_cup/2006/06/12/ref.apologizes/| title = Ref apologizes to Aussies for bad call| date = 12 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006|work=Sports Illustrated| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616181547/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/specials/world_cup/2006/06/12/ref.apologizes/| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viduka told reporters "it was obvious that he made a mistake but everybody makes a mistake."&lt;ref name="refapologizes"/&gt; Abdul-Fatah denied issuing an apology however, and said that "FIFA's refereeing committee... agreed unanimously that Japan's goal against Australia was correct," and would have awarded a penalty against Australia had the ball not gone in, as Takahara was pushed by [[Craig Moore]] into Schwarzer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://worldcup.filbalad.com/english/News.asp?NewsID=24777| author = Omar Shoeb| title = Abdul-Fattah: I did not apologize to the Aussies| date = 13 June 2006| accessdate =5 July 2006| publisher = FilBalad |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071223133633/http://worldcup.filbalad.com/english/News.asp?NewsID=24777 |archivedate = 23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian coach [[Guus Hiddink]] chose to "slightly, but not totally, apologise" for an incident off-field where he pushed an official off-balance in a scramble to see the television replay of the foul. Hiddink said he believed it was an obvious foul, but also that Schwarzer "can defend himself even more" against such incidents.&lt;ref name="hiddinkapology"/&gt;

FIFA communications director Markus Siegler told the press later that a penalty should have been awarded to Japan for a foul on Japanese midfielder [[Yūichi Komano]] by [[Tim Cahill]]. Siegler said "it was a clear mistake of the referee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world-cup-2006/refereeing-mistake-cost-japan-a-penalty-says-top-fifa-official/2006/06/14/1149964612063.html |title= Refereeing mistake cost Japan a penalty, says top FIFA official |date=15 June 2006 |website=smh.com.au |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had a yellow card been shown to Cahill, who scored the deciding goal for Australia minutes later, he would have been sent off, with the score at 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=sportsNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-14T125120Z_01_L14363777_RTRUKOC_0_UK-SOCCER-WORLD-JAPAN-PENALTY.xml&amp;archived=False |title=Referee should have given Japan penalty, says FIFA |date=14 June 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2006 |publisher=Reuters.co.uk}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese coach [[Zico]] expressed frustration at FIFA's comments, saying that El Fatah had apologised for the mistake to the Australians but had not apologised for the error which FIFA admitted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://worldcup.sportinglife.com/football/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/06/15/WORLDCUP_Japan_Nightlead.html |title=Zico frustration at FIFA comments |last=Church |first=Michael |date=15 June 2006 |publisher=sportinglife.com |accessdate=4 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930050220/http://worldcup.sportinglife.com/football/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F06%2F06%2F15%2FWORLDCUP_Japan_Nightlead.html |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan Football Association]] filed an official complaint against the Egyptian referee, who was sent home along with English referee Graham Poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19631780-2722,00.html| title = Penalty referee given plum quarter-final| date = 30 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006| last = Lusetich| first = Robert|work=The Australian}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Crouch]] pulled Trinidad and Tobago defender [[Brent Sancho]]'s dreadlocks while scoring the first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/06/200849131333899731.html|title=Sancho fumes at Crouch 'foul'|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France vs. Korea Republic (Group stage) ====
In the 31st minute of the game between France and Korea Republic, the French midfielder [[Patrick Vieira]] had a header at goal which appeared to be saved by Korean goalkeeper [[Lee Woon-Jae]] from behind the goal line. Mexican referee [[Benito Archundia]] and his linesmen did not believe the ball had passed the line, and no goal was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://int.soccerway.com/news/2006/June/18/koreans-earn-draw-against-france/| title = Koreans earn draw against France| last = Roorda| first = Jonathan| publisher = Soccerway.com| date = 18 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060703054513/http://www.soccerway.com/news/2006/June/18/koreans-earn-draw-against-france/| archivedate= 3 July 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game resulted in a last minute 1–1 draw, shocking the French. French coach [[Raymond Domenech]] believed that France "scored a second time, but the referee did not recognize that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/sports/special_packages/world_cup/14851525.htm| title = What's French word for 'uninspiring'?| publisher = MercuryNews.com| date = 19 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006| last = Jones| first = Grahame L.| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621144531/http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/sports/special_packages/world_cup/14851525.htm| archivedate= 21 June 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television replays showed that the goal should have been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldFootballNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-19T084333Z_01_L19777729_RTRIDST_0_SPORT-SOCCER-WORLD-KOREA-PICTURE.XML |title=World-Refereeing controversy still following Koreans |last=Rogers |first=Iain |publisher=Reuters.co.uk |date=19 June 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2006}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; French player [[Thierry Henry]] claimed the team was "really upset" when they saw the ball had passed the goal-line as "if he (the referee) had given us the valid goal, that would not have offered the Koreans the opportunity to come back into the match."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.clubcall.com/index.jsp?storyID=9471|title = Henry furious at refereeing display |date=19 June 2006 |accessdate = 4 July 2006 |publisher = clubcall |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008062539/http://www.clubcall.com/index.jsp?storyID=9471 |archivedate = 8 October 2007 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should also be noted that the corner kick leading to the header should have been a goal kick, as the ball had gone out of bounds off a French player.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} In addition, there appeared to be a whistle on the play for a foul on France, which would have negated the goal anyway.

The controversy revived questions over the possibility of goal-line technology use at the World Cup. A FIFA spokesperson, Markus Siegler, ruled out the short term likelihood saying that "its introduction depends on a system being developed that is 100 percent reliable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldFootballNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-19T110333Z_01_L19788729_RTRIDST_0_SPORT-SOCCER-WORLD-KOREA-PICTURE.XML&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |title=World-Goal-line technology not yet an option, says FIFA |last=Collett |first=Mike |date=19 June 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2006 |publisher=Reuters.co.uk}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; French goalkeeper [[Fabien Barthez]] voiced opposition to video replays during a game as "it's a shame to stop the play."&lt;ref name="Barthez"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Soccer/WorldCup/Groups/G/2006/06/19/1641368-ap.html| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130115060522/http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Soccer/WorldCup/Groups/G/2006/06/19/1641368-ap.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 15 January 2013| title = Barthez: No video replays| date = 19 June 2006| publisher = SLAM!

==== Togo vs. Switzerland (Group stage) ====
Near the end of the first half, Paraguayan referee [[Carlos Amarilla]] assumed that Togo's [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] had taken a dive in the penalty area, whereas most replays implied his heels had been clipped by Patrick Muller. The website Sport Network discusses the incident as follows: "Referee Carlos Amarilla caused controversy in the thirty-fifth minute when he somehow failed to give a penalty after Adebayor was hacked down by Patrick Muller. The Arsenal man had cut inside and seemed ready to unleash a shot at the Swiss goal, until Muller's trailing leg took Adebayor down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s459/st98802.htm| date = 19 June 2006| title = Switzerland 2 Togo 0 – Match Report| accessdate =5 July 2006| publisher = Sport Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Korea Republic vs. Switzerland (Group stage) ====
Referee [[Horacio Elizondo]] allowed [[Alexander Frei]]'s 77th-minute second goal for the Swiss even though one of the [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referees]] had flagged for offside.

Elizondo waved for play to continue after a cross from [[Xavier Margairaz]] ball was deflected into Frei's path by a South Korean defender and, although the lineman flagged for offside, the Argentine official overruled the decision and allowed the Swiss goal to stand. The South Korean players and head coach, [[Dick Advocaat]] protested, but referee Elizondo ignored their protest, and gave a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] to South Korean player [[Choi Jin-cheul]]. Replay later showed that Elizondo had made the correct decision, as Frei had been onside when Margairaz had played the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnTNhHr0EA0| date = 23 June 2006| title = 2006 World Cup Korea vs Switzerland| accessdate =30 May 2012 | publisher = Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

Earlier in the game the South Koreans thought they had won a penalty early in the second half when the ball bounced up off the pitch hitting the hand of [[Patrick Müller]], but the incident was seen by the referee as accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"The defenders saw the linesman had raised his flag so we stopped playing," playmaker Park Ji-sung told Reuters. "But the referee continued play." I asked the linesman why he put his flag up but he just answered (me) that I should carry on. He did nothing. I'm very upset about the situation." South Korean players protested angrily against Elizondo after Frei's controversial second goal effectively killed off any hope they had of reaching the last 16. --&gt;

==== Ghana vs. United States (Group stage) ====
In the last moments of the first half, German referee [[Markus Merk]] awarded a penalty kick to [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], which led to Ghana's winning goal and qualification to the Second round, and to the elimination of the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] from the tournament. The British newspaper ''[[Financial Times]]'' described the incident as follows: "The match turned on the worst of refereeing decisions. Germany's Markus Merk was standing in a perfect position when USA defender [[Oguchi Onyewu]] won a header against the fabulously monikered [[Razak Pimpong]]. But inexplicably Merk blew for a penalty because of a non-existent push."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c5fd4f84-0225-11db-a141-0000779e2340.html| date = 22 June 2006| title = Second wind lifts Ghana| accessdate =5 July 2006|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] agreed with this view in its match report: "Merk added one more twist to the first half, with a controversial penalty award. He penalised Onyewu, who appeared to win a clean header as Pimpong collapsed dramatically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853408.stm| date = 22 June 2006| title = Ghana 2–1 USA| accessdate =5 July 2006|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Croatia vs. Australia (Group stage) ====
The game between Australia and Croatia to decide the Group F qualifiers saw a number of controversial decisions made by English referee, [[Graham Poll]]. It was during this game that Poll made his 3-yellow card blunder (see [[2006 FIFA World Cup controversies#Three yellow cards issued (Croatia vs. Australia, group stage)|above]]). In the 7th minute, as Australian captain [[Mark Viduka]] approached the goal, attempting to score, Croatian [[Josip Šimunić]] wrestled him away from the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853428.stm| title = Croatia 2–2 Australia|publisher=BBC Sport| date = 22 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060626065259/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853428.stm| archivedate= 26 June 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians appealed for a penalty, however Poll ruled that there was no foul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=sportsNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-22T194902Z_01_SP322520_RTRUKOC_0_US-SOCCER-WORLD-CROATIA-HALF.xml&amp;archived=False |title = Croatia and Australia drawing 1–1 at half time |publisher = Reuters |date = 22 June 2006 |accessdate = 4 July 2006}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 75th minute Croatian defender, [[Stjepan Tomas]] made a handball which mirrored his penalised 38th minute error, however it was not sighted by the referee and a corner rather than a penalty was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/763306| title = Aussie advance, Italy next| publisher = tvnz.co.nz| date = 23 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010051624/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/763306 |archivedate = 10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://home.skysports.com/worldcup/article.aspx?hlid=397593&amp;CPID=4&amp;clid=575&amp;lid=4161&amp;title=AUSSIES+THROUGH+DESPITE+SCARE |title = Aussies rule in Stuttgart |publisher = Sky Sports |date = 22 June 2006 |accessdate = 4 July 2006 |last = Livie |first = Alex}}{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=Broccoli and Coffee |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add to the game's controversy, the 79th-minute goal by Australian striker [[Harry Kewell]] appeared to have scored whilst in an offside position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://int.soccerway.com/news/2006/June/22/kewell-equalizer-sends-aussies-forward/| title = Kewell equalizer sends Aussies forward| date = 22 June 2006| accessdate =4 July 2006| last = Sharp| first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an apparent goal to Australia in the last second of the match was not allowed due to the referee accidentally delayed blowing the full-time whilst fumbling for his whistle, which allowed play to continue.

==== Ukraine vs. Tunisia (Group stage) ====
Tunisia players and supporters claim that the Paraguayan referee [[Carlos Amarilla]] failed to award Tunisia a penalty kick in the second half and then mistakenly awarded one to Ukraine, which when converted by [[Andriy Shevchenko]] resulted in the 1–0 win and qualification by Ukraine to the second round. At the time Tunisia was playing with 10 men since [[Ziad Jaziri]] was sent off for his second yellow card in the last minute of the first half. The German magazine [[Der Spiegel#Spiegel Online|Spiegel Online]] described the turn of events this way: "Tunisia went close on 65 minutes after [[Hamed Namouchi|Namouchi]] was hacked down on the edge of the box. [[Anis Ayari|Ayari]]'s left footed free kick deflected off [[Andriy Voronin|Voronin]] in the Ukrainian wall and crept just over the bar. Replays suggested the ball hit Voronin's elbow and Tunisia could feel aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty. Then almost immediately the action switched to the other end when Shevchenko stumbled into the penalty area only to be brought down by [[Karim Haggui|Haggui]]. This time replays suggested Shevchenko fell over his own feet but Amarilla pointed to the spot and Shevchenko made no mistake with the penalty kick. It was tough luck for the Tunisians with two dodgy decisions costing the team badly and with only ten men left on the field the game looked beyond them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,423304,00.html| title = Ukraine Overcomes Tunisia|work=Der Spiegel | date = 23 June 2006| accessdate =5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portugal vs. Netherlands (Second round) ====
{{Main|Battle of Nuremberg (2006 FIFA World Cup)}}
Referee [[Valentin Valentinovich Ivanov|Valentin Ivanov]] set a new record for the number of red cards issued in a World Cup match with four, and tied the record for yellow cards with 16.&lt;ref name="soccernet_PORvNED"&gt;{{cite news|title=Portugal triumphs in game marred by fouls|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=372541|agency=Associated Press|date=25 June 2006|accessdate=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA president Sepp Blatter said of Ivanov, "I consider that today the referee was not at the same level as the participants, the players. There could have been a yellow card for the referee," although he later recanted, saying, "I regret what I said about his actions in the match between Portugal and the Netherlands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World-Blatter regrets criticism of referee Ivanov|url=http://worldcup.reuters.co.uk/netherlands/news/usnL04777073.html|publisher=Reuters|date=10 July 2006|accessdate=11 July 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The managers also blamed each other for not playing fairly; [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]'s [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] said, "FIFA talks about fair play. There was no fair play,"{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} while the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]' [[Marco van Basten]] responded, "If you talk about fair play, you should watch yourself first... [Portugal was] a bit more experienced with all these tricks and all this time wasting."&lt;ref name="soccernet_PORvNED" /&gt;

Ivanov criticized both teams, reportedly saying, "They are known for time wasting and hitting from behind. I was unpleasantly surprised by seeing such things from the Dutch. More so, they were the instigators."&lt;ref name="hughes_PORvsNEd"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup saga: Crime and punishment|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/28/sports/wcrefs.php|first=Rob|last=Hughes|work=International Herald Tribune|date=28 June 2006|accessdate=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th minute, Portugal's [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] left the match with an injury after being tackled in the thigh by [[Khalid Boulahrouz]]. ''International Herald Tribune'' writer Rob Hughes wrote that he had not seen "a more cynical and brutal attempt to kick a player out of a match than what [Boulahrouz] did to [Ronaldo]," and that he should have been red carded on two occasions, but only received a yellow card.&lt;ref name="hughes_PORvsNEd" /&gt; Boulahrouz was sent off in the 63rd minute after receiving his second yellow card for an elbow to [[Luís Figo]]'s face.

In the 60th minute, Figo received a yellow card despite head-butting Dutchman [[Mark van Bommel]], usually a red card offence, as stated by [[Misconduct (football)|Law 12]] of "The Laws of Football" – "A player shall be sent off if he/she is guilty of violent conduct." Figo did not receive further sanctions and was cleared to play in the subsequent quarter-final match against [[England national football team|England]] as he had been shown the yellow card during the match. Van Bommel said of the decision, "Figo head butted me and that is not a yellow card. I blame the referee, it was a clear red card."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FIGO WILL HEAD INTO FIGHT WITH ENGLAND |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tm_objectid=17296715&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=66633&amp;headline=figo-will-head-into-fight-with-england--name_page.html |last=Casey |first=Ed |publisher=The Daily Record |date=26 June 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629045628/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tm_objectid%3D17296715%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D66633%26headline%3Dfigo-will-head-into-fight-with-england--name_page.html |archivedate=29 June 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy vs. Australia (Second round) ====
In the 50th minute, Spanish referee [[Luis Medina Cantalejo]] showed Italy's [[Marco Materazzi]] a straight red card for a challenge on Australia's [[Marco Bresciano]]. The replays show Materazzi deliberately foul Bresciano outside of the box, denying him an opportunity to score; although [[Gianluca Zambrotta]] could recover. This forced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] to play with ten men for most of the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991534.stm|title=Italy 1-0 Australia|date=26 June 2006|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the referee awarded a penalty kick for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the final seconds of injury time, after [[Australia national football team|Australia]]'s [[Lucas Neill]] challenged [[Fabio Grosso]], causing Grosso to stumble and go to ground.&lt;ref name="Italy-Australia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden goal: Fabio Grosso for Italy v Germany (2006)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/dec/05/sp-golden-goal-fabio-grosso-italy-germany-2006|publisher=The Guardian|author=Nick Miller|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the score 0–0 and Italy playing with ten men, the penalty resulted in a win by Italy when converted by [[Francesco Totti]], advancing Italy to the quarter-finals.&lt;ref name="Italy-Australia"/&gt; In 2010, Grosso, according to an Australian sports site, said that he didn't stay on his feet because he was exhausted and "didn't have the strength to go forward", he said he "felt contact, so I went down" and "maybe I accentuated it a little bit", but insisted that after reviewing the replay that Neill did commit a foul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/world-cup-diver-fabio-grosso-admits-laying-it-on/story-e6frf9if-1225854490153?nk=76833d0fd8c12c454571dfc59f6ec261|title="World Cup 'diver' Fabio Grosso admits laying it on," Melbourne Herald Sun 10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil vs. Ghana (Second round) ====
Brazil striker [[Adriano Leite Ribeiro|Adriano]] put the ball in the net in the 46th minute, but was in an offside position. However, the referee's assistant kept his flag down, and Slovak referee [[Ľuboš Micheľ]], awarded the goal. The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] described it like so: "Brazil... scored the next goal, albeit with a fair bit of controversy. Adriano scored on a breakaway in first-half injury time, using his left thigh to knock in a pass from the right wing from captain [[Cafu]]. However, replays showed Adriano was in an offside position when he touched the ball into the net."&lt;ref name="brazilghanacbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ronaldo, Brazil beat brave Ghana |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/storyview.html?/story/worldcup2006/national/2006/06/27/brazil-ghana-worldcup.html |date=27 June 2006 |publisher=CBC |location=Canada |accessdate=5 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708164036/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/storyview.html?%2Fstory%2Fworldcup2006%2Fnational%2F2006%2F06%2F27%2Fbrazil-ghana-worldcup.html |archivedate= 8 July 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brazilghanambm&gt;{{cite news| title = Brazil v.

==== Spain vs. France (Second round) ====
At the 83rd minute, with the score at 1–1, referee [[Roberto Rosetti]] called a foul against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]'s [[Carles Puyol]]. [[France national football team|France]]'s [[Thierry Henry]] went down holding his face, although Puyol appeared to hit him in the chest. [[Patrick Vieira]] scored from the resulting free kick and France won the match 3–1. "For me it wasn't a foul, if anything it was a foul by (Henry) because he came from behind and collided with me," Puyol said, "but referees can get things wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=372761&amp;cc=5901| date = 27 June 2006| title = Ref made crucial mistake, says Spain's Puyol| accessdate =7 July 2006| publisher = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain coach [[Luis Aragonés]] also called the foul "non-existent".

==== Portugal vs. France (Semi-finals) ==== 

It was reported [[Zinedine Zidane]] turned to the Uruguayan referee [[Jorge Larrionda]] and the two talked for a few moments. The outcome of the discussion must not have satisfied the number 10 of the Bleus, which turned and, murmured the insult directed to Larrionda in Spanish: "hijo de puta" (son of a bitch).&lt;ref name="Round of 16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selfish Zidane has fooled Fifa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/20/newsstory.sport7|publisher=theguardian.com|author=Paul Doyle|date=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zidane y Jorge Larrionda"&gt;{{cite web|language=es|title=Zidane y Materazzi tendrán otro round|url=https://www.eluniverso.com/2006/07/14/0001/15/A0B3E4FAC947499BB9B80C8776E421A5.html|publisher=eluniverso.com|date=14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy vs. France (Final) ====
{{main|2006 FIFA World Cup Final}}
[[File:Zinedine zidane wcf 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Zinedine Zidane]] converted a controversial penalty and was sent off for a headbutt in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]]]]
[[Zinedine Zidane]] opened the scoring in the 7th minute by converting a controversial penalty spot kick, which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and into the goal. The penalty was awarded after [[Florent Malouda]] went down inside the Italian penalty area under a challenge from Italian defender [[Marco Materazzi]]. The call was somewhat controversial—as it was put by an [[Associated Press]] report posted in the ESPN website "Malouda stumbled – many might say dived – in the penalty area and Elizondo immediately signaled a penalty kick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/373590/italy-wins-fourth-world-cup-title|title=Italy wins fourth World Cup title|website=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the slow-motion replay proved the referee right.&lt;ref name="Final"&gt;{{cite web|title=TUTTO VERO! CAMPIONI DEL MONDO |url=https://issuu.com/shepard052/docs/gazzettadellosport|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|page=5|author=Antonello Capone|date=10 July 2006|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy then equalized at the 19th minute with a header by Materazzi himself and went on to win the title on penalty shoot out. The controversy surrounding the penalty was however overshadowed by the discussion surrounding [[Zinedine Zidane]]'s sending off by the end of extra-time for headbutting the Italian player in the chest.

=== Other issues ===

==== Officiating less-prominent teams, general concern ====
Match referees have faced accusations of bias from the media and team representatives for allegedly favouring larger and better-established teams at the finals, at the expense of less established football nations.&lt;ref name="officialbiastheage"&gt;{{cite news| title = Australia creating Cup history – thanks to refs| url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/aussie-update/australia-creating-cup-history-8212-thanks-to-refs/2006/06/20/1150701554788.html| first = Tim | last = Colebatch|work=The Age | date = 21 June 2006| accessdate =5 July 2006| location=Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Australian team was knocked out of the tournament as a result of a controversial penalty given against defender [[Lucas Neill]] in their [[2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Italy vs Australia|Second round match against Italy]], Australian assistant coach [[Graham Arnold]] was quoted as saying, "We are a small footballing nation that gets no favours. All we ask for is a fair go, and I don't think we received it over the four games."&lt;ref name="ausitalylatimes"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Sins of 2002 Cast Shadow on Aussie Loss| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/27/sports/sp-soccer27| last = Jones| first = Grahame L.|work=Los Angeles Times| date = 27 June 2006| accessdate =5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, after going down to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in their second round match, [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]'s head coach [[Ratomir Dujković]] stated that "the referee might as well have been wearing a yellow shirt under his own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = World Cup refs must crack down on elbowing says Blatter| url = http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=105573| publisher = TurkishPress.com| accessdate =12 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One basis for these claims has been the irregular balance of fouls sanctioned by referees between traditional powers and emerging teams. As of 27 June, the top eight [[2006 FIFA World Cup seeding|seeded teams]] have a combined net surplus of 93 more fouls sustained than committed with an average of 3.1 per match, according to statistics published on FIFA's website.&lt;ref name="officialbiasfifaworldcupyahoo"&gt;{{cite web| title = 2006 World Cup Statistics detail: Team Disciplinary| url = http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/stats/detail.html?section=tdc| publisher = FIFAWorldCup.com| accessdate =5 July 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706095441/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/stats/detail.html?section=tdc| archivedate= 6 July 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, as of 27 June, the team with the highest fouls count of the finals have been debutants; [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], with a 1.95 ratio between fouls committed and fouls sustained, [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] with a ratio of 1.76 fouls committed/sustained, and [[Australia national football (soccer) team|Australia]] with a 1.75 ratio.

By contrast, the teams with fewer fouls committed have been traditional powerhouses [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] – with respective averages of 0.66, 0.67 and 0.75 in fouls committed/sustained ratios.

On the other hand, the teams that committed the least fouls (less than 50 in three games) were Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, South Korea, Paraguay, Poland and Japan (the latter with just 38 fouls). Also, of the 5 teams most judged wrongly offside, four were in [[2006 World cup draw#Seeds|"Pot A"]], which therefore seeds them in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup seeding|top 8]] (Italy, Argentina, France and Brazil) and the other emerging European side Ukraine. Of the teams that were judged to be in an offside position incorrectly on no occasion in the first three games, only one (Mexico) was seeded into "Pot A".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = WebFocus Active Reports – On the Ball statistics |url = http://www.informationbuilders.co.uk/ontheball/wcuk.htm |publisher = Information Builders Inc. |accessdate = 14 July 2006 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060715193356/http://www.informationbuilders.co.uk/Ontheball/wcuk.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2006 |deadurl = yes |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these statistics could be used to support claims of bias, they could also indicate that some teams are rougher and that the stronger teams are more disciplined, and their success is due to their not committing excessive fouls. Additionally it should be considered that a team in possession is more likely to sustain a foul than a defending team, and therefore the successful teams are likely to sustain more fouls.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter told before the tournament that referees should protect big star players: "What has been clearly said to referees is 'please protect the physical integrity of the players', and that means protecting the big stars".&lt;ref name="blatter_protect"&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup refs must crack down on elbowing says Blatter |url=http://archive.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=127092 |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=6 June 2006 |accessdate=10 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181454/http://archive.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=127092 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Player and referee communication, Australia vs. Brazil (Group stage) ====
According to Football Federation Australia (FFA) officials, the referee [[Markus Merk]] refused to talk to Australian captain [[Mark Viduka]] when approached during the game to explain certain refereeing decisions. Although many fans believed this to be irregular, the FIFA Laws of the Game clearly state: "The captain of a team has no special status or privileges under the Laws of the Game but he has a degree of responsibility for the behaviour of his team." – (Additional Instructions for the Referee)

This was part of the evidence used by the FFA to help defend Harry Kewell's after-match argument with Merk, which (pending a FIFA enquiry) threatened his participation in Australia's following match against Croatia. The enquiry later cleared the player of any wrongdoing, due to inconsistent reports between the officials, "despite photographs and television replays showing Kewell striding purposefully towards Merk, mouthing off and pointing his finger at him – the sort of anti-referee histrionics FIFA usually frowns heavily upon."&lt;ref name="kewellcleared"&gt;{{cite news |title = Kewell cleared by FIFA |url = http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&amp;cid=72441 |publisher = [[Australian Associated Press]] |date = 20 June 2006 |accessdate = 5 July 2006 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011085356/http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&amp;cid=72441 |archivedate = 11 October 2007 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Record card tally, Portugal vs. Netherlands (Second round) ====
This second-round game created some controversy due to the record number of bookings given by referee [[Valentin Valentinovich Ivanov|Valentin Ivanov]]. He gave a total of 16 yellow cards and 4 red cards. On this occasion, FIFA president Sepp Blatter publicly criticised his performance.&lt;ref name="AP_Pye"&gt;{{cite news| title = Throwing cautions to the wind, yellow and red cards flow at World Cup| author = John Pye| url = https://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news;_ylt=A9FJqLGbHaBErxUBLhUmw7YF?slug=ap-wcup-fifa-redcards|agency=Associated Press| date = 26 June 2006| accessdate =5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview to Russian press, Ivanov stated that he "had been warned of the Portuguese harsh tactics but was surprised that the Dutch started it". This sentence generated an official protest of the Portuguese federation with FIFA.

==== Blue background for Argentine shooters, Germany vs. Argentina (Quarter final) ====
German goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] wore a sky blue shirt during the penalty shoot-outs. An advertisement placed directly behind the goal had white characters on sky blue background, and three people standing behind it were also dressed in sky blue and white shirts. Argentine fans claim that this was intentionally made to distract Argentine players at the penalty kicks.&lt;ref name="arg_ger_penalty"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.26noticias.com.ar/index.php?p=notadetalle&amp;pp=index&amp;idNota=16418| title = Alemania ganó con trampa en los penales a la Argentina | accessdate =1 March 2007| publisher = 26 Noticias| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, a fight broke out between both teams after the end of the penalty shootout.

=== Defence of referees ===
On summing up the progress of the tournament at the conclusion of the group stage, Sepp Blatter spoke in defence of FIFA's officiating in the tournament, stating "... referees are only human, and they make mistakes. We have to reduce the number of mistakes, but we're all still searching in vain for perfection."&lt;ref name="FIFAwc_Blatter"&gt;{{cite news| title = Halfway stage: FIFA President sums up| url = http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060623/1/84vg.html| date = 23 June 2006| accessdate =5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Blatter's statement, both Ivanov and Poll, referees at the center of the two largest controversies, were not included on the twelve-team list of officials selected by FIFA to referee the final eight matches of the competition.&lt;ref name="FIFA_release_officials"&gt;{{cite news| title = Twelve refereeing trios for last eight matches| url = http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060628/1/8ds8.html| publisher = [[FIFA]]| date = 28 June 2006| accessdate =5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fair-play agreements ==
FIFA and the World Cup Organization have every team member and coach sign a "Fair-play agreement".

===Portugal vs. Netherlands (Second round) ===
{{main|Battle of Nuremberg (2006 FIFA World Cup)}}
[[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] had possession of the ball when the game was interrupted by the referee to assist injured Portuguese defender [[Ricardo Carvalho]]. Under fair play conduct, when the game restarted, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] should have either not disputed the ball release or taken the ball without challenge and returned it to Portugal, however teams are not bound by the "Fair Play Agreement" signed before the tournament and no penalty can arise from such a situation. Instead, Dutch defender [[Johnny Heitinga]] kept possession, and was subsequently tackled from behind by [[Deco]], who received a yellow card.&lt;ref name="reuters_deco"&gt;{{cite news | title = No appeal from Portugal so Deco misses England game| url = http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060627/7/8bul.html| publisher = Reuters| date = 27 June 2006| accessdate =11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a second yellow card in the 78th minute for time wasting and was sent off, earning a ban for the quarter-final match against [[England national football team|England]].

Portugal coach [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] accused Dutch coach [[Marco van Basten]] of encouraging his players to play on, and said, "The Portuguese Football Federation, on the basis of the FIFA Fair Play documents, will put in a request to overturn the card for Deco."&lt;ref name="reuters_deco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portugal press case for Deco to face England |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1806875,00.html |last=Taylor |first=Chris|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=26 June 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721045444/http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0%2C%2C1806875%2C00.html |archivedate=21 July 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Portugal did not officially file the appeal, and FIFA spokesman Markus Siegler told the press, "There was a phone call from Portugal and they were clearly told 'forget it'."&lt;ref name="reuters_deco"/&gt;

==Discipline==
{{main|2006 FIFA World Cup disciplinary record}}
Certain matches attracted attention due to the high number of cards.

The Italy – USA match had three red cards with De Rossi of Italy in particular given marching orders for elbowing an opponent. This match was second only to the encounter between the Netherlands and Portugal (which had four, as well as 16 yellows). A Croatian player was also sent off after having (mistakenly) been given three yellow cards by referee Graham Poll.

==Fan issues==
{{see also|Leeuwenhosen}}
Some Dutch fans were forced to take off their trousers branded with the logo of [[Bavaria beer]], as Budweiser was the official beer of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootballinsider.com/Story.aspx?id=33443 INSIDER World Cup Diary - Bavaria Repeats Ambush Marketing; N.Korea Fans Watched.] June 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5072 Scramble for sponsorship for 2010,] [[When Saturday Comes]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than leave the stadium, they proceeded to watch the match in their underclothes.

==Crime==

===Hooliganism===
While the [[German Federal Police|German Police]] expressed satisfaction in their ability to contain and deal with [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]], speculation was rife that a number of potential flashpoints existed which could cause widespread public disorder. With a number of routes into the country, amongst them the open land borders which are a consequence of the [[Schengen agreement]], apprehension of known troublemakers and organisers of disturbances looked to be a very real problem. However, during the World Cup, Germany suspended its rules granting passport-free travel to EU citizens. As an illustration of this, on 8 June, German police apprehended 9 English hooligans attempting to enter the country via the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border. Britain has a particularly stringent policy of restricting foreign travel of known football hooligans during periods where the England team are involved. 3,500 banning orders were served, and by 8 June all but 150 had surrendered their passports. On 9 June [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK reported that although there had been no violence, England fans in [[Frankfurt]] had been kicking footballs at the windows of the city's 600-year-old [[Römer (Frankfurt am Main)|Römer]] city hall building, although local police decided not to take action over this minor incident and the staff at the Mayor's office apparently took the attempted [[vandalism]] in good humour. On the day of England's first match against Paraguay two England fans were arrested for having swastikas and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] insignia painted on their bodies. The two were flown back to England to appear in court; one was found guilty and banned from attending football matches until 2008, while the other was not banned as the symbol (the double-[[sig rune]] of the SS) was painted on his back, and he may not have been able to see it or known what it was. The court heard that the fan found guilty also had a letter J on his arm, believed to be a slight to Jews, but claimed not to know its meaning.&lt;ref name="thislancashire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/news/localnews/display.var.793030.0.supporters_arrested_in_germany_face_court.php|title=Supporters arrested in Germany face court|website=This Is Lancashire}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also concern over hooligans among the 300,000 Polish fans who travelled to Germany for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=footballNews&amp;storyID=2006-06-06T161321Z_01_L06386914_RTRIDST_0_SPORT-SOCCER-WORLD-POLAND-FANS.XML About 300,000 Poles may go to finals, says minister]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 6 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This supposition was borne out as clashes between rival groups of supporters culminated in the arrest of 429 prior to and in the wake of the game between Germany and Poland in [[Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1797760,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | title=Police arrest around 200 fans after city centre trouble | first=Paul | last=Kelso | date=15 June 2006 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesschau.de/vignettetosophora102-vignette_cid-5624788.html Aktuelle Nachrichten – Inland Ausland Wirtschaft Kultur Sport – ARD Tagesschau&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217093930/http://www.tagesschau.de/vignettetosophora102-vignette_cid-5624788.html |date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] news in the UK reported that up to that date 7 England fans had been arrested, one for a "serious offence".

===Racism===
It was claimed that "foreign-looking" people should not visit some areas in the former East Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12888810/ "Neo-Nazis ready to crash World Cup"] [[MSNBC]]. Retrieved 7 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; after one newspaper reported that [[Nazi-Skinheads|neo-Nazi skinheads]] were planning violence against foreigners. Germany contains a small but vocal neo-Nazi minority who have engaged in violent attacks against the country's immigrants, as well as foreign visitors, since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and subsequent German reunification. According to German police, neo-Nazi hate crime was on the rise and had increased significantly over the preceding few months.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5445314 [[NPR]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1197825,00.html ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two human rights organizations, the [[Africa Council]], based in Berlin, and the [[International League of Human Rights]] advised black and Asian fans to avoid certain areas of eastern Germany during the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0530/p07s02-woeu.html – "Tarnished German image on World Cup eve"] 2006-05-30 ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.

The far-right [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]], an organisation which the German government unsuccessfully tried to ban in 2001, had planned to march through [[Gelsenkirchen]] on 10 June, a day after [[Ecuador]] met [[Poland]] in the city's new purpose-built stadium. This march had first been banned by the German police, but later permitted by the Gelsenkirchen Administrative Court. Other far-right marches were planned for [[Frankfurt]] and Herne during the competition, although these were subsequently banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=qw1149782222609B226|title=IOL: Police ban far-right marches during World Cup&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FIFA]] announced that at the World Cup, teams could have points deducted for racist remarks by players and officials. A "Football Against Racism" logo covered each field's center circle until kickoff at all World Cup matches. Prior to every quarter-final match, the captains read a "declaration against racism" over the PA system.

The [[European Union]] launched a campaign against racism before the World Cup. [[Friso Roscam Abbing]], spokesman for the EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner indicated that the campaign also targeted prostitution rings and human trafficking.

===Trafficking of women===
{{See also|Prostitution in Germany}}

Some international human rights groups (like the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE), the [[Nordic Council]] and [[Amnesty International]]) expressed concern that there would be an increase in the [[trafficking in human beings|trafficking of women]] up to and during the World Cup. PACE and Amnesty claimed that 30,000 women and girls might become the subject of slavery for the purposes of forced prostitution during the World Cup. They called upon the German authorities to monitor sex venues during the World Cup and provide support for the victims of trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/document.do?id=ENGACT770082006 Amnesty International: Public Statement – "Red card to trafficking during World Cup"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816165726/http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/document.do?id=ENGACT770082006 |date=16 August 2006}} [[Amnesty International]].

According to German police, there was no noticeable increase in forced prostitution during the World Cup. While there was a significant influx of (legal and illegal) prostitutes to Germany before the World Cup, most of those were reported to have left within the first two weeks. Police officials from several cities quoted prostitutes saying that business actually decreased.&lt;ref&gt;German language article [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,425462,00.html "Flaute in den Bordellen"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823113157/http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,425462,00.html |date=23 August 2006}} (''lull in the brothels'') from German weekly ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer cracking===
FIFA's [[Information technology|IT]] provider [[Avaya]] indicated that it expected, and was prepared for, the [[denial-of-service attack]]s which were unsuccessfully launched at the IT network for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]]. No successful attacks were launched on the German World Cup system.

==Women's events==

===Women's single buck===
Competitors saw through a {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} white [[pine]] log for the fastest time. A starting cut arc is allowed in the competition. Timing begins when the signal "GO" is called and ends when the log is completely severed. The world record with a time of 11.61 seconds was set in 2006 by Nancy Zalewski.

===Women's underhand chop===
Using a single bit pinned ax, competitors chop through a horizontal aspen log, {{convert|11|in|mm}} in diameter, and {{convert|15|-|28|in|mm}} long, for the fastest time. Nancy Zalewski held the world record in 2009 with a time of 29.24 seconds. Erin Lavoie claimed the record with a time of 25.38 seconds at the Manitoba Lumberjack Championship on Sept. 27, 2016.

===Women's log rolling===
Opponents step onto a floating log, cuff it to start the roll, spin it rapidly in the water with their feet, stop or snub it suddenly by digging into the log with special caulked birling shoes and a reverse motion to maneuver their adversaries off balance and into the water, a feat called 'wetting'. Dislodging an opponent constitutes a fall. The cardinal rule of logrolling is 'never take your eyes off your opponent's feet'. The referee starts each match. Competing birlers step off a dock onto a floating log, grasping pike poles held by attendants for balance. As they push off from the dock, the referee instructs the birlers to steady the log. When he is certain both birlers have equal control, he says, 'Throw your poles'. The match is on and continues to a fall or to expiration of the time limit set for each log. When the time limit is reached, the same match continues onto the next smaller log. In all rounds, the contest is decided by the best three out of five falls. Women start on {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} logs. In 2003 Tina Bosworth set a new world record of 10 wins.

===Women's boom run===
Starting on the log-rolling dock, two competitors run head to head on adjacent booms. Each competitor must step off the logrolling dock, running across a chain of logrolling logs to the chopping dock, circling a specified competition station and cross the pond on the boom logs back to the logrolling dock. The competitor must step onto the logrolling dock and touch the starting point. This is a timed event and is timed to the tenths of a second. Anyone leaving before the word "go" will be assessed a 10-second penalty.

==Men's events==

===Underhand block chop===
Using a five-pound single-bit axe, competitors chop through a horizontal aspen log {{convert|12|in}} in diameter and {{convert|28|in}} long. Timing begins on the signal "go" and ends when the log is severed. A new world record was set in 2006 by Jason Wynyard with a time of 15.94. In 2007, competitors moved from the underhand chop to the standing block chop for one continuous timed event known as the endurance event.

===Standing block chop===
Using a five-pound single-bit axe, competitors chop through a vertical standing [[aspen]] log {{convert|12|in}} in diameter and {{convert|28|in}} long. Timing begins on the "go" signal and ends when the log is severed. This event was combined with the men's underhand chop as the endurance or combination event in 2007. Competitors moved from the underhand chop to the standing block chop for one continuous timed event. The world record for the standing block chop is 12.33 seconds set by Jason Wynyard from New Zealand in 2007.

===Springboard chop===
This event combines the skills of the chopper and the high climber. Out in the forest this technique enables a working lumberjack to reach softer wood above the tough and [[Wood#Knots|knotty]] base of a tree marked for cutting. Contestants climb a height of nine feet using two springboard placements and chop through a {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} aspen log mounted on the top of the spar pole. Dave Bolstad set a new world record of 41.15 in 2003 besting his previous world record time of 41.63 in 2001.

===Single buck===
A single sawyer uses a one-man bucking saw to cut through a {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} white pine log for the best time. Dion Lane set a new world record in 2006 with a time of 10.78 seconds.

===Hot saw===
A single sawyer using a single-cylinder, single-motor power saw makes three vertical cuts—down, up and down—through a {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} white pine log. This one-man contest is strictly against time. Chain saws may be warmed up prior to the contest, but must be turned off before the contest begins. Neither self-starting nor impulse-type push button starters nor twin motors are allowed. A starter gives the countdown and on the signal "go", competitors start their saws and make the three cuts. The contest ends when the third slice is severed. All cuts must be complete. Dave Bolstad of New Zealand holds the world record with a time of 5.55 seconds set in 2007.

[[File:SpeedClimb.jpg|thumb|right|Speed climbing]]

===60-foot speed climb===
Competitor scales a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Cedar wood|cedar]] spar pole and returns to the ground. Contestants perform on twin spar poles and they must climb within 240 degrees of the sparring pole, as marked. Event is strictly against time and begins when the signal "go" is given and ends when the contestant touches the ground after climbing to the 60-foot mark. At the starting signal, contestants must have one foot on the ground and the other foot below the orange line as marked on the sparring pole. The contestant must touch the pole every 15 feet on the descent. The two climbers use spurred climbers and steel-core climbing ropes to scale the spar poles. Only traditional spurs are allowed. Brian Bartow of Grants Pass, Oregon holds the world record of 12.33 seconds in this event.

===90-foot speed climb===
Contestant scales an {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cedar spar pole and returns to the ground against time. Contestants compete on twin spar poles. Contestant must climb within the front 240 degrees of the sparring pole, as marked. Timing begins on the signal "go" and ends when the contestant touches the ground after ringing one of the two bells on top of the spar pole. At the starting signal, contestants must have one foot on the ground and the other foot below the orange line as marked on the sparring pole. On the descent climbers are required to touch inside each section. Contestants use spurred climbers and steel-core climbing ropes to scale the spar poles. In this climb Brian Bartow of Oregon holds the world record with a time of 19.87 set in 2006.

===Logrolling (birling)===
In competition opponents step onto a floating log, cuff it to start the roll, spin it rapidly in the water with their feet, stop or snub it suddenly by digging into the log with special caulked birling shoes and a reverse motion to maneuver their adversaries off balance and into the water, a feat called 'wetting'. Dislodging an opponent constitutes a fall. The cardinal rule of logrolling is 'never take your eyes off your opponent's feet'. The referee starts each match. Competing birlers step off a dock onto a floating log, grasping pike poles held by attendants for balance. As they push off from the dock, the referee instructs the birlers to steady the log. When he is certain both birlers have equal control, he says, 'Throw your poles'. The match is on and continues to a fall or to expiration of the time limit set for each log. When the time limit is reached, the same match continues onto the next smaller log. In the semi-finals and the finals, the contest is decided by the best three out of five falls. Men start on {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} logs.

===Boom run===
Starting on the log-rolling dock, two competitors run head to head on adjacent booms. Each competitor must step off the logrolling dock, running across a chain of logrolling logs to the chopping dock, circling a specified competition station and cross the pond on the boom logs back to the logrolling dock. The competitor must step onto the logrolling dock and touch the starting point. This is a timed event and is timed to the tenths of a second. Anyone leaving before the word "go" will be assessed a 10-second penalty.

==Team events==
[[File:Lumberjack.JPG|thumb|left|Jack and Jill competition]]

===Jack and Jill===
A bucking contests where a man and woman compete for the best time to cut through a {{convert|20|in|adj=on}} white pine log. Starting cuts of no more than {{convert|1/2|in|mm|sing=on}} deep, in order to set the teeth of the saw, are allowed. Timing starts on the signal "go" and ends when the block is severed. Logs must be cut completely through. The world record for this event was set in 2005 by Jason and Karmyn Wynyard with a time of 6.17 seconds.

===Double buck===
Two sawyers working as a team use a two-man bucking saw to cut through a {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} white pine log. Double buck team consists of two men. A starting cut arc is allowed. Timing begins for both competitions when the signal to "go" is called, and ends when the log is completely severed. Jason Wynyard and Dion Lane hold the world record with a time of 4.77 seconds set in 2005.

===Team relay===
In this timed event there are two teams competing. Each team consist of a 60-foot climber, 2 boom runners (1 male, 1 female), a hot sawyer, a women's single buck sawyer and a standing block chopper. First a climber must climb and descend the 60-foot pole, when their feet touch the pad it is the signal for the male boom runner stationed on the chopping dock to run the logs to the logrolling dock; when he touches the dock it is then the female boom runner's turn to run the logs over to the chopping dock, once touching there the hot saws then cut through a {{convert|20|in|adj=on}} log and when the log drops the women commence the single buck, with the standing block chop the anchor event in this relay. Whichever team finishes first with the best time is the winner of the event. This event is the combination of the best of all the lumberjack skills: power, strength and sheer determination.

==Awards==

===All-Around Lady Jill===
The All-Around Lady Jill Champion is awarded each year to the Lumber Jill who scores the most points. The key to the All-Around title is endurance and the ability to compete in as many events as possible. The top contestants in every event receive points each day of the competition, making it important to make it through early qualifying rounds in as many events as possible. Points are given each day for the top six places in each event, with a first place being awarded 6 points, second 5 points and so on. Logrollers will receive triple points for their final placement. This is because the final standings are the only opportunity for logrollers to earn points. Women's All-Around events are the underhand chop, single buck, Jack and Jill, logrolling and the boom run. The 2009 winner was Nancy Zalewski of Wisconsin, who has now taken home the crown five times.

===Tony Wise All-Around Champion===
The Tony Wise All-Around Champion, named after the founder of the Lumberjack World Championships, is awarded each year to the lumberjack who scores the most points. The key to the All-Around title is endurance and the ability to compete in as many events as possible. The top contestants in every event receive points each day of competition, making it important to make it through early qualifying rounds in as many events as possible. Points are given each day for the top six places in each event, with a first place being awarded 6 points, second 5 points and so on. There are two exceptions to this. Due to the nature of the springboard chop and logrolling, the all-around points for these two events will be scored differently. For the springboard, the sixth fastest competitors from Friday's and Saturday's heats receive double the points. This is because springboard competitors only get one opportunity to earn all-around points. 5th and 6th placements are awarded triple points for their final placement. This is because the final standings are the only opportunity for logrollers to earn points. The Tony Wise All-Around events are: underhand chop, standing chop, springboard chop, double buck, single buck, hot saw, Jack &amp; Jill, logrolling, boom run, 60-foot climb and 90-foot climb. Jason Wynyard, who was the 2009 winner, has taken home the crown for 11 years in a row.

==Sponsors==
The event is sponsored by various companies such as [[Stihl]], [[Plum Creek Timber]], [[PepsiCo|SBI Pepsi]], and the local radio stations.

The '''murder of Megan Kanka''' (December 7, 1986 &amp;ndash; July 29, 1994) occurred in [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey]], [[United States]]. The seven-year-old was raped and murdered by her neighbor Jesse Timmendequas. The murder attracted national attention and subsequently led to the introduction of "[[Megan's Law]]", which requires law enforcement to disclose details relating to the location of registered sex offenders.

==Jesse Timmendequas==
Jesse K. Timmendequas (born April 15, 1961) had two previous convictions for sexually assaulting young girls. In 1979, he pleaded guilty to the attempted [[sexual assault|aggravated sexual assault]] of a five-year-old girl in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey]]. He was given a suspended sentence, and after failing to go to counseling, he was sent for nine months to the Middlesex Adult Correctional Center. In 1981, Timmendequas pleaded guilty in regards to the assault of a seven-year-old girl, and was imprisoned at the Adult Diagnostic &amp; Treatment Center (ADTC) in [[Avenel, New Jersey]], for six years.&lt;ref name="Stranger"/&gt;

Timmendequas reportedly participated little in the treatment program offered at the ADTC. He was described by one therapist who treated him at the facility as a "whiner" who spent most of his time sleeping. Another therapist stated that she had believed that Timmendequas would eventually commit another sex crime (although she did not believe he would commit murder).&lt;ref name="Stranger"&gt;Glaberson, William. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0DE3D61139F93BA15756C0A960958260  STRANGER ON THE BLOCK -- At Center of 'Megan's Law' Case, a Man No One Could Reach]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. Tuesday May 28, 2006. Retrieved on September 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and trial==

Timmendequas lured Kanka into his house, raped her, and then killed her by strangulation with a belt. He then placed her body in nearby [[Mercer County Park]]. The next day, he confessed to investigators and led police to the site.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

Evidence included bloodstains, hair, and [[fiber]] samples, as well as a bite mark matching Kanka's teeth on Timmendequas' hand, and led to a guilty verdict on charges of [[kidnapping]], four counts of aggravated sexual assault, and two counts of [[Felony murder rule|felony murder]]—causing a death in the course of certain specific felonies.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;  The court sentenced Timmendequas to death, and the sentence was upheld by the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Iver. "[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E15FA3E5A0C718CDDAB0894D9404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fT%2fTimmendequas%2c%20Jesse%20K%2e Death Penalty Is Upheld in 'Megan' Case]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. Friday February 2, 2001. Retrieved on September 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Dick Zimmer (New Jersey politician)|Dick Zimmer]] stated, "I believe he is exactly the kind of predator that the legislature had in mind when it enacted the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/US/9705/30/megan.kanka/ Repeat sex offender guilty in 'Megan's Law' case]." ''[[CNN]]''. May 30, 1997. Retrieved on April 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Timmendequas remained on New Jersey's [[Death Row]] until December 17, 2007, when the New Jersey Legislature abolished the [[Capital punishment in New Jersey|state's death penalty]]. As a result of the ban, Timmendequas' sentence was [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life in prison]] without the possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref&gt;Mears, Bill.

Monday December 17, 2007. Retrieved on September 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Megan's Law==
One month after the murder, the [[New Jersey General Assembly]] passed a series of bills proposed by Assemblyman [[Paul Kramer]] that would require [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry]], with a database tracked by the state, community notification of registered sex offenders moving into a neighborhood and then life in prison for repeat sex offenders. Kramer expressed incredulity at the controversy created by the bills, saying that "Megan Kanka would be alive today" if the bills he proposed had been law.&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt;

==Foundation==
'''The Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] founded by the family of Megan Kanka with the intent of preventing crimes against children.

The '''National Military Family Association''' (NMFA), headquartered in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], is a private non-profit association organized to improve the quality of family life of all military personnel.

==History==
NMFA was organized in 1969 as the [[National Military Wives Association]] by a group of wives and widows seeking financial security for survivors of uniformed service personnel and retirees. From their efforts, the ''Survivor Benefit Plan'' came into being. In the ensuing years, NMFA has been in the vanguard of advocacy for improvements in the quality of military family life. The name of the organization was changed in 1984 to reflect the broad scope of its involvement. NMFA is a [[non-profit]] [[501(c)(3)]].

==Membership and organization==
NMFA has members from all ranks of the seven uniformed services worldwide and their families. Its Board of Governors, which includes active duty service members, reserve component, retirees and spouses, sets the policies, approves the issues, and oversees operations. Governors and officers receive no financial compensation, and volunteers assist in carrying out NMFA programs.  It is also supported by distinguished Board of Advisers.
NMFA receives significant support at the top levels of the [[United States Armed Services|Services]] and works regularly on common concerns with [[The Military Coalition]], an umbrella organization of 36 military-related associations.

==Programs==
NMFA activities revolve around programs to educate the public, the military community, and the [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the rights and benefits of military families, as well as advocate for an equitable quality of life for those families.

Members of the ''Government Relations Department'' study issues, testify before [[Congressional committees]], work with Congressional staff and represent NMFA on advisory groups for many [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] agencies, to include the [[Defense Commissary Agency Patron Council]] and the [[TRICARE]] Beneficiary Panel.

Since its inception in 1969, the effectiveness of NMFA is reflected in accomplishments in most of the issue areas in which the association works. These include medical and dental benefits, dependent education, retiree and survivor benefits, relocation and spousal employment. NMFA staff speaks regularly to all types of groups, including family service organizations, [[commanders conference|Commanders' Conferences]], and officer and [[enlisted]] spouse clubs.

NMFA sponsors a military spouse scholarship program, as well as the ''NMFA Very Important Patriot Award'', which recognizes outstanding volunteers in the military community, and the ''NMFA Family Award'', which recognizes families that exemplify the best of the military lifestyle.

In 2004, it published an analysis of military family support, entitled ''Serving the Homefront: An Analysis of Military Family Support Since September 11, 2001''.

NMFA sponsors ''Operation Purple Camps'' for children of deployed service members in many U.S. military communities around the world.

NMFA's ''The Voice for Military Families'' is dedicated to providing information to and representing the interests of family members of the uniformed services. Its website provides extensive information for military families and those who service them. Additionally, NMFA publishes a monthly newsletter, as well as a weekly legislative e-mail newsletter, the ''Government and You E-News''.

{{Politics of Libya}}
The '''National Salvation Government''' ({{lang-ar|حكومة الإنقاذ الوطني}}) was a government body formed by politicians from the [[General National Congress]]'s blocs that lost the June 2014 elections in [[Libya]]. The NSG was led by [[Khalifa al-Ghawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-politics-idUSKCN0WY4IT|title=Leaders of Libyan unity govt venture onto Tripoli streets|date=1 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''Libya Dawn Coalition''' was used to refer to the armed groups and/or the wider political movement supporting the NSG. The NSG was one of the major sides in the ongoing [[Libyan Civil War (2014–present)|Second Libyan Civil War]] from its formation August 2014 until its dissolution in April 2016.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.libyaherald.com/2016/04/05/gnc-members-announce-its-dissolution-and-creation-of-the-state-council/|work=Libya Herald|title=GNC members announce its ”dissolution” and creation of the State Council|accessdate=2016-04-05|date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
A faction of the [[General National Congress]] claimed to be the legitimate parliament of Libya, but does not represent a majority of the membership of that congress, refused to handover the power to the HoR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/25/abu-sahmain-ghariani-condemned-by-thinni-and/|title=Abu Sahmain, Ghariani condemned by Thinni and parliament leader Saleh|agency=Libya Herald|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the GNC members belonged to groups now participating in the internationally recognized Libyan parliament, the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=huffpo25july&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sasha-toperich/libya-the-muslim-brotherhoods-last-stand_b_5618001.html|title=Libya: The Muslim Brotherhood's Last Stand?|agency=Huffington Post|date=25 July 2014|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox First Indochina War}}
'''Operation Vulture''' ({{lang-fr|Opération Vautour}}) was the name of the proposed American operation that would rescue French forces at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 via [[B-29]] raids based in the [[Philippines]]. The French garrison had been surrounded by the communist [[Viet Minh]] during the [[First Indochina War]]. As a result of the operation cancellation, the French Army organised the [[Operation Condor (1954)|Operation Condor]].

==Background==
[[Viet Minh]] forces under General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]] surrounded and besieged the French, who were unaware of the Viet Minh's possession of heavy artillery, including [[anti-aircraft guns]]. The attack that formally began the battle was launched 13 March 1954. French artillery outposts fell within hours, and a dismal trickle of wounded survivors into Dien Bien Phu’s garrison hospital began. The French tried to hit back with artillery and airpower, including some 30 US [[C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s which had modified to drop [[napalm]] on the Viet Minh artillery and flown mainly by American employees of [[Civil Air Transport]], the contract airline founded by Maj. Gen. [[Claire Lee Chennault]], the head of the World War II [[Flying Tigers]]. Dien Bien Phu could be supplied only via airdrop, and dropping and retrieving supplies became a nightmare as Viet Minh artillery shrank the effective size of the drop zone. On 27 March, French Col. Jean Louis Nicot, the man in charge of the aerial resupply effort, had to raise the drop altitude from 2,000 feet to 8,000 feet. Drop zone accuracy declined, and some supplies inevitably fell into Viet Minh hands. The French, with the encouragement of some US officials based in Saigon, pressed hard for the US to launch an overwhelming air strike to save Dien Bien Phu.&lt;ref name=AirForceMagazine /&gt;

==French-American meeting==
Just ten days after the start of Giap’s initial assault, General Paul Ely, the French Chief of Staff, arrived in Washington to plead the French case to US policy-makers. Discussions involved General Ely, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.&lt;ref name=AirForceMagazine&gt;{{Citation

|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The plan==
The plan included as many as 98 B-29s from Okinawa and the Philippines that would drop 1400 tonnes of bombs on positions held by the Viet Minh.&lt;ref name="MillerWainstock2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Miller|author2=Dennis D.

The plan included an option to use up to three small atomic weapons on the Viet Minh positions in support of the French.&lt;ref name=AirForceMagazine /&gt; The Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up plans to deploy tactical atomic weapons, U.S. carriers sailed to the [[Tonkin]] gulf, and reconnaissance flights over Dien Bien Phu were conducted during the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclear|first=Michael|title=The ten thousand day war: Vietnam, 1945-1975|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year= 1981|isbn= 978-0312790943|oclc= 7551292|page = 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford, the top American military officer, gave this nuclear option his backing. US B-29s, B-36s, and B-47s could have executed a nuclear strike, as could carrier aircraft from the Seventh Fleet.&lt;ref name=AirForceMagazine /&gt;

==Decision against the operation==
Nixon, a so-called "hawk" on Vietnam, suggested that the U.S. might have to "put American boys in".&lt;ref name=Tucker1999p76&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6389">This is the order of battle for the [[Six-Day War]] between Israeli Forces and Arab Forces which consisted of Syrian, Egyptian and Jordanian Military Forces. The war took place on June 5–10, 1967.

==Israeli Forces==
On full mobilization, the Israeli Army comprised some 250,000 men of whom almost three-quarters were reservists and one-quarter conscripts. Out of its 25 brigades, nine were armoured, two were fully mechanized and ten were infantry, some partly mechanized, as well as their paratroop brigades which also acted as elite assault troops. The brigades were assigned to six ugdas, or division-size task forces, whose composition varied according to their assigned mission and geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Dunstan, ''The Six Day War 1967: Sinai'', Osprey Publishing (October 27, 2009) {{ISBN|978-1846033636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syrian Army==
The Syrian Army numbered 63,000. The field fortifications were held by eight brigades of which five were infantry brigades, each with an attached tank battalion of T-34/85s and SU-100 self-propelled guns, holding the first two lines and three armoured and mechanized brigades along and behind the third line. In addition there were four reserve infantry brigades deployed between Damascus and Kuneitra, as well as seven battalions of the National Guard militia that were deployed to bolster the defensive lines. These forces were divided into 'Group Brigades' in Syrian terminology although this was an administrative convenience rather than a tactical deployment.

'''Overtrading''' is a term in financial statement analysis. Overtrading often occurs when companies expand their own operations too quickly (aggressively).Finance Wales: "A practical guide to cash-flow management", page 28. CIMA, 2004  http://www.highpeak.gov.uk/business/econdev/General/Cash_flow_management_17_08_04.pdf '' Retrieved on 2010-11-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Overtraded companies enter a negative cycle, where an increase in [[interest]] expenses negatively impacts the [[net profit]], which leads to lesser [[working capital]], and that leads to increased borrowings, which in turn leads to  [[interest]] expenses and the cycle continues.  Overtraded companies eventually face [[Accounting liquidity|liquidity]] problems and/or run out of [[working capital]].

==Conditions==
* Rapid growth in business development and sales.
* Less [[net profit]].
* The business running with limited knowledge.
* [[Cash flow]] problem or short of [[working capital]].
* Inaccurate or unrealistic cash [[budget]] .
* Having many unpaid vendors.
* High level of [[interest]] / debt servicing costs.
* High [[gearing ratio]].
* Keen [[market competition]].
* Overstock or slow movement of [[inventory]].
* Current and quick ratios fall.

'''''Panchagni''''' ({{lang-en|Five Fires}}) ([[Malayalam]]:പഞ്ചാഗ്നി) is a 1986 [[Malayalam]] [[drama]] [[thriller film]] scripted by [[M.T. Vasudevan Nair]] and directed by [[Hariharan (director)|Hariharan]], music by [[Bombay Ravi]] and lyrics by [[O N V Kurup]]. It stars [[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]], [[Mohanlal]],  [[Nadia Moidu]] and [[Thilakan]].

A remarkable tale of a remarkable woman, who puts her commitment to social activism above everything else, including her own love for an adoring man. Under the direction of Hariharan, Geetha made a sensational debut in Malayalam in one of the most powerful female characters in Indian cinema ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Screenplays for ever|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/screenplays-for-ever/article6449094.ece|agency=[[The Hindu]]|date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the classics in Malayalam cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Pazhassi Raja' reigns supreme|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/pazhassi-raja-reigns-supreme/article391756.ece|agency=[[The Hindu]]|date=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=`Mayookham`- A ray of hope!|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/boxoffice.php?id=13725556&amp;cid=2362|publisher=[[Sify]].com|date=23 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was remade in Tamil as ''[[Nyaya Tharasu]]'' (1989).

==Plot==
The movie revolves round the incidents in a two-week period, when Indira ([[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]]), a Naxal activist is out in parole. She is serving life sentence in the central jail, Kannore after being charged for the murder of Avarachan, a landlord, who she had witnessed kill a young tribal woman after she was raped and impregnated (by him).

Indira's mother, a past freedom fighter who is on her deathbed, is relieved to see her, and is under the impression that she is free now. Her younger sister Savithri ([[Nadiya Moidu]]), her husband Prabhakaran ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]) and her nephew are happy to have her back home. But her younger brother, Ravi (Meghanathan), an unemployed guy, addicted to drugs is angered by her mere presence, blaming her for his inability to secure a good job. Indira's older brother who is home from [[Delhi]] to perform the death rites of her mother refuses to even talk to her, and leaves after a big brouhaha, leaving his nephew to do the rites. Most of her acquaintances are intimidated by her, except her old classmate Sharadha ([[Chithra (actress)|Chitra]]). Sharadha had married her college sweetheart, Rajan ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]]) and lives close to Indira's home.

Rasheed ([[Mohanlal]]), a freelance journalist, tries to get an interview with Indira, she declines initially and is annoyed by his persistence.

As the days pass on, Indira feels unwanted, and ends up having no place to live. Savithri suspects an affair between her husband and Indira, making it hard for Indira to stay with them. Sharadha's husband had changed a lot in years, had degraded into a womanizer, and Indira can't stay with them either. Ultimately Indira, asks Rasheed for help her out and ends up staying at his place.
{{quote box|width=40%|align=right|size=250px|bgcolor=lightblue|quote=""In the late sixties and early seventies, there was an extremist revolutionary movement in Kerala in which a number of highly motivated young people were involved. The movement was mostly directed against big landowners who were known to be tyrannical towards their tenants. While it lasted, the movement resulted in the 'execution' of a few such tyrants, which, in turn, invited repression measures from the law enforcement agencies. Later, most of the people involved were disillusioned and the movement itself lost momentum. My film is set in this period."|source= - [[Hariharan (director)|Hariharan]] said in an interview.}}

With time, Indira and Rasheed get closer, and a lovely relationship blossoms between the two. As Indira is nearing the completion of her parole, Rasheed, with great difficulty, succeeds in getting the government remission order in time, so that Indira no longer has to go back to jail. By this time Savithri and Ravi reconcile with Indira, and are overjoyed to hear about her release. Indira rushes to Sharadha's place to share the good news, but there she is shocked to see Sharadha's servant, a young teenage girl, being gang-raped by her husband Rajan and friends. True to her righteous self, Indira ends up shooting Rajan with his hunting rifle and ultimately surrenders herself at the police station.

Hariharan about Mohanlal's casting, "''Panchagni'' was mainly Geetha's film, but when we asked Mohanlal whether he would do the film as [[Naseeruddin Shah]] was already selected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=അങ്ങനെ നസ്‌റുദ്ദിൻഷായ്ക്കു പകരക്കാരനായി മോഹൻലാൽ എത്തി-ഹരിഹരൻ|url=http://www.nanaonline.in/malayalam-movie-news/1583/#|publisher=Nana Film Weekly|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he said he would do 'any role'. The first thing I wanted was to give him a different appearance. Till then, he hadn't appeared without a moustache. So I asked him to shave it off. He immediately agreed. ''Panchagni'' went on to become a turning point in his career.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='His gift is that he underplays emotions'|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2000/aug/29hari.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|date=29 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''premiership of Theresa May''' began on 13 July 2016, when [[Theresa May|May]] accepted Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s invitation to form a government. This followed the resignation of May's predecessor as Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], who resigned in the [[Aftermath of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|aftermath of the European Union membership referendum]].

==Leadership election==
In [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|a referendum held on 23 June 2016]], Britain voted to [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|withdraw from the European Union]], with a result of 52% for withdrawal and 48% for remaining within the union. [[David Cameron]], who as prime minister had campaigned to remain within the European Union, announced on 24 June 2016, immediately following the announcement of the referendum results, that he would resign from his post.&lt;ref name="BBC11JUL"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36768148 | title=Theresa May to succeed Cameron as UK PM on Wednesday | publisher=BBC News | date=11 July 2016 | accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the first stages of a [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Conservative Party leadership election]], Home Secretary [[Theresa May]]'s only remaining competitor, [[Andrea Leadsom]], withdrew from the race on 11 July 2016. Following this announcement, [[David Cameron]] said that he would step down from his post on 13 July.&lt;ref name="BBC11JUL" /&gt; Cameron formally tendered his resignation to Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on that day, who subsequently appointed [[Theresa May]] as his successor.&lt;ref name="BBC16J"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36778350 | title=David Cameron says being PM 'the greatest honour' in final Downing Street speech | publisher=BBC News | date=13 July 2016 | accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GD13JUL"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister | title=Theresa May becomes Britain's prime minister | work=The Guardian | date=13 July 2016 | accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==
After being appointed by [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]] on 13 July 2016, May became the United Kingdom's second female Prime Minister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKenzie |first=Sheena |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/13/europe/theresa-may-david-cameron-british-prime-minister/index.html |title=Theresa May becomes new British Prime Minister |publisher=CNN |date=13 July 2016 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the first female UK Prime Minister of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="BBC11July"&gt;{{cite news |title=Theresa May to succeed Cameron as United Kingdom Prime Minister on Wednesday |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36768148 |accessdate=11 July 2016 |publisher=BBC |date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; May told the media on 11 July 2016 that she was "honoured and humbled" to be the party leader and to become prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36768148 |title=PM-in-waiting Theresa May promises 'a better Britain' |publisher=BBC News  |date=11 July 2016 |accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to some calls for a general election (reported by the news media) to confirm her mandate, "sources close to Mrs May" said there would be no such election, according to the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36769898 |title=Tributes for David Cameron at his final cabinet as UK PM |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=12 July 2016 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech after her appointment, May emphasised the term Unionist in the name of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], reminding all of "the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-36789572 |title=Theresa May: Word unionist 'very important to me' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 July 2016 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 15 July 2016, May had travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland to meet with first minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]], to reinforce the bond between Scotland and the rest of the country. "This visit to Scotland is my first as prime minister and I'm coming here to show my commitment to preserving this special union that has endured for centuries," she explained.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Heather |date=14 July 2016 |title=Theresa May's decisive reshuffle draws line under Cameron era |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/theresa-mays-decisive-reshuffle-draws-line-under-cameron-era |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the meeting at [[Bute House]], May offered the following comment about Scotland's role in the negotiations about the UK's exit from the EU. "I'm willing to listen to options and I've been very clear with the first minister today that I want the Scottish government to be fully engaged in our discussion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36800536 |title=Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon meet for Brexit talks |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 July 2016 |website=BBC News – Scotland Politics |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, May launched an investigation aimed at identifying and reducing racism in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=27 August 2016 at 3:08&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-08-27/may-orders-public-service-audit-to-reveal-racial-inequality/ |title=May orders public service audit to reveal racial inequality – ITV News |publisher=Itv.com |date=27 August 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May triggered [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] to [[Brexit|leave the EU]] in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/13b17624-7057-11e6-9ac1-1055824ca907.html |title=Theresa May ignores calls for Brexit delay |newspaper=Financial Times |date=1 September 2016 |accessdate=11 December 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/theresa-may-triggers-article-50-with-warning-of-consequences-for-uk  May triggers article 50 with warning of consequence for UK] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the government's plan to curb [[childhood obesity]], May took steps to reduce sugar content of foods though many experts feel that too little is being done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37108767 |title=Childhood obesity: Plan attacked as 'weak' and 'watered down' – |publisher=BBC News |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably there are widespread calls for curbing advertising of unhealthy foods to children and banning promotions of unhealthy food (such as multipacks and buy one get one free) in supermarkets, restaurants, cafes and take-aways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Boseley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners |title=Childhood obesity: UK's 'inexcusable' strategy is wasted opportunity, say experts &amp;#124; Society |work=The Guardian |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health Service===
Consultation will start over cost saving, streamlining and reduction of some services in the [[National Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37186455 |title=NHS cuts 'planned across England' – |publisher=BBC News |date=26 August 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics fear cuts that could put lives at risk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Diane Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/plan-to-transform-nhs-could-led-to-downgrade-of-major-london-hospitals |title=Plan to 'transform' NHS could lead to downgrade of major London hospitals &amp;#124; Society |work=The Guardian |date=26 August 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the review is about more than reducing costs.

===David Cameron===
In September 2016, [[David Cameron]] resigned as an MP, saying that he did not want to be a "distraction" for the new PM.&lt;ref name="resign-mp-bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37342152|title=David Cameron quits as Conservative MP for Witney|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2016|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toby Helm wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' in September 2016 that May is seen as less right wing than Cameron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Toby Helm |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/theresa-may-prime-minister-prepared-to-risk-it-all |title=Theresa May, the prime minister prepared to risk it all &amp;#124; Politics |work=The Guardian |date=17 September 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she is also seen as quite right wing by Rebecca Glover in ''[[The Independent]]'', especially on immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Glover |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-conservative-party-leader-shes-no-progressive-conservative-a7109121.html |title=Don't be fooled by Theresa May – she's no progressive Conservative |work=The Independent |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar schools===
In September 2016, May announced that she would end a ban on new [[grammar school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Heather Stewart and Peter Walker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may--end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools |title=Theresa May to end ban on new grammar schools &amp;#124; Education |work=The Guardian |date=9 September 2018 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[BBC]]'' article suggests grammar schools would be dumbed down while other secondary schools in the area would suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37431235 |title=Grammar schools expansion 'could dumb them down' – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=23 September 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Coles of United Learning, which runs 60 schools is unconvinced more grammar schools will raise standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffreys |first=Branwen |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37513737 |title=Academy boss says grammar plans may leave children behind – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=30 September 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor children and children from families that are 'just about managing' tend to miss out on grammar school places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38251413 |title=Children of 'just managing families left out by grammars' - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the top ten nations with the best education has UK style grammar schools selecting at age 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Stephen |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/12/face-it-none-worlds-best-education-systems-include-grammar-schools |title=Face it: none of the world's best education systems include grammar schools |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=11 December 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal Society]] commissioned research from the [[Education Policy Institute]] which shows disadvantaged pupils do worse overall in science and maths in regions with selective education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38343307 |title=Grammars 'will not boost poorest pupils' science grades' - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cross party [[Select Committee]] of MP's described the issue of grammar school expansion as an unnecessary distraction, cast doubt on the claim grammar schools improve social mobility and many speakers emphasized the need to tackle [[Education in the United Kingdom#Funding|funding problems effect on the whole of schooling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlan |first=Sean |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38956439 |title=Grammars 'unnecessary distraction', say MPs - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outcome of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 General Election]], May's grammar school policy was not included in the [[Queen's Speech]], and is unlikely to be pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coughlan|first1=Sean|title=Queen's Speech: Grammar school expansion abandoned|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40354365|website=BBC News Education|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child poverty===
The 'Child Poverty Unit' has been merged with the 'Department of Work and Pensions' leading to fears that [[child poverty]] will be less of a priority under May. This runs counter to May's pledge to govern for everyone and fight the injustice of being born poor.  In 2014–2015 28% of UK children were poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Stephen |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/12/government-must-not-give-eliminating-child-poverty |title=The government must not give up on eliminating child poverty |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=21 December 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Child Poverty Action Group]] fears restricting the Child Poverty Unit to one department will reduce its effectiveness.  The [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] projects a 50% increase in child poverty by 2020 due to benefit cuts and 'sluggish wages'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Walker Political correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/20/fears-after-government-abolishes-civil-services-child-poverty-unit |title=Fears after government abolishes civil service's child poverty unit &amp;#124; Society |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rob Merrick Deputy Political Editor |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-child-poverty-unit-axe-whitehall-department-work-pensions-dwp-prime-minister-a7486131.html |title=Theresa May accused of abandoning fight against child poverty, after axing Whitehall unit devoted to it |publisher=The Independent |date=20 December 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministerial appointments===
{{main article|First May ministry}}
May also appointed new Cabinet members, in "one of the most sweeping government reshuffles for decades"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZU1HE |title=May builds new-look Brexit cabinet to steer EU divorce |last1=Holton |first1=Kate |last2=Pitas |first2=Costas |date=14 July 2016 |agency=Reuters  |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as "a brutal cull" by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' since several prominent members, including six of Cameron's ministers, were removed from their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=Laura |date=14 July 2016 |title=Theresa May appoints Justine Greening and Liz Truss after mass cull of old government sees Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan axed |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/14/theresa-mays-cabinet-reshuffle-who-will-join-boris-johnson-and/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London, UK |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early appointments were interpreted both as "centrist and conciliatory," an effort to reunite the party in the wake of the UK's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|vote to leave the European Union]], and as "a shift to the right," according to ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister|title=Theresa May appeals to centre ground but cabinet tilts to the right|first=Heather|last=Stewart|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Peston of ''[[ITV News]]'' specifically labelled her new Cabinet as right wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-07-14/may-appoints-right-wing-cabinet-for-left-wing-agenda/ |title=May appoints right wing cabinet for left wing agenda |last=Peston |first=Robert |date=14 July 2016 |website=ITV News |publisher=ITV |accessdate=15 July 2016 |quote=Her rhetoric is more left-wing than Cameron's was, her cabinet is more right wing than his was.

May abolished the [[Department for Energy and Climate Change]] in a move widely criticised by [[Greenpeace]] which expressed concern the new government failed to see the threat from climate change, [[Friends of the Earth]] which said climate change is happening now while the new government lowers its priority, also by other more impartial people and groups.{{clarify|reason=The structure of this sentence makes this sentence difficult to understand.|date=July 2016}} Climate change is included in the scope of a new [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-department-killed-off-by-theresa-may-in-plain-stupid-and-deeply-worrying-move-a7137166.html|title=Climate change department killed off by Theresa May|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon becoming Prime Minister, May appointed former Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]] to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], former [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]] [[Amber Rudd]] to [[Home Secretary]], and former [[Shadow Home Secretary]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] to the newly created office of "[[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|Brexit Secretary]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/who-is-david-davis-a-profile-of-britains-new-minister-for-brexit/ |title=Who is David Davis?

[[File:Davos 2017 - Special Address by Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.webm|thumb|left|May addressing the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2017]]
On 20 July, May attended her first [[Prime Minister's Questions]] since taking office, then afterwards made her first [[List of international prime ministerial trips made by Theresa May|overseas trip as prime minister]], visiting [[Government of Germany|Berlin]] for talks with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger [[Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon|Article 50]] before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU. May also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]] that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |title=Brexit: Theresa May says talks won't start in 2016 |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rowena |last=Mason |first2=Philip |last2=Oltermann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |title=Angela Merkel backs Theresa May's plan not to trigger Brexit this year |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September, May attended the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit]], the first since the UK's [[Withdrawal from the European Union by the United Kingdom|withdrawal from the European Union]].

On 21 January 2017, following the [[inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] of [[Donald Trump]] as US President, the [[White House]] announced that May would meet the President on 27 January, making her the first foreign leader to meet Trump since he took office on 20 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38707524 |title=Theresa May to meet Donald Trump on Friday – White House |publisher=BBC News  |date=21 January 2017 |accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic policy and austerity programme===
Prior to her premiership, May outlined plans to backtrack on the longstanding government plan to achieve a surplus by 2020, following the UK's [[Withdrawal from the European Union by the United Kingdom|withdrawal from the European Union]]. With uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Hammond|Phillip Hammond]] has suggested that the government's [[Autumn Statement]] may be used to "reset" economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chancellor may 'reset' economic policy in Autumn Statement|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36864099|website=BBC News Business|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On 2015, while May was Home Secretary, a 18% funding cut in the police force had taken place with the loss of around 20,000 police officers. Before the [[2017 Manchester Arena bombing]] and after the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris attacks]], she was warned by a Manchester senior police officer that the cuts on the force and [[community policing]] risked terror attacks in the city due the lack of resources to do proper intelligence and anti-terrorist measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bienkov|first1=Adam|title=Theresa May was warned by Manchester police officer that cuts risked terror attack in the city|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-warned-by-manchester-police-that-cuts-risked-terror-attack-2017-5?r=UK&amp;IR=T|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=Business Insider|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waugh|first1=Paul|title=Theresa May’s Police Cuts Exposed By Manchester Bombing Army Deployment - Police Federation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/theresa-may-army-deployment-manchester-bombing-police-federation-police-cuts-steve-white_uk_5925d9f0e4b062f96a336e5f|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police cuts: Terror response warning to home secretary|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34875077|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=BBC|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May's and Hammond's 2017 budget continued government policies of freezing benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/welfare/2017/03/what-welfare-changes-did-philip-hammond-make-his-budget-2017 What welfare changes did Philip Hammond make in his Budget 2017?] ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
May has not given MPs a vote over the [[European Union]] despite in 2007 calling for MPs to have the right of veto over European talks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[Nicky Morgan]] stated "in 2016 MPs aren't asking for a veto but they do want a say and we hope the Prime Minister will remember her earlier words".

May was accused of not having a plan if Brexit talks break down.  There are fears if talks fail Britain could be left trading under [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] rules which it is feared would seriously damage jobs and livelihoods in Britain and Europe.  May's ministers have repeatedly promised to walk away from a bad final deal but, it is argued, have no plans for how to manage without a deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/11/brexit-trigger-article-50-theresa  MPs slam Theresa May over lack of a plan if Brexit talks collapse] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ivan Rogers]] described May's Brexit strategy as “an accident waiting to happen”. He said completing Brexit was “guaranteed” to take a decade and alleged May's unrealistic hopes of a trade deal made to order meant a car crash in the next few months was “quite likely”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/25/phil-hogan-ireland-eu-commissioner-brexit-chaos Irish warn Theresa May: change course or risk Brexit chaos] ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workers' representatives===
In July 2016 May said that she planned to have workers represented on company boards, saying "If I'm prime minister ... we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-plan-workers-boardroom-reform-extraordinary-tories |title=Theresa May's plan to put workers in boardrooms is extraordinary &amp;#124; Politics |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; May aimed to put workers' and consumers' representatives on boards to make them more accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Farrell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-tory-conference-workers-on-boards |title=Workers on boards: the idea is not going away &amp;#124; Business |work=The Guardian |date=2 October 2016 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nils Pratley]], a journalist at ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote in July "Fundamental principles of Britain's boardroom governance are being rethought. It is a very welcome development.

===Response to Donald Trump's Muslim ban===
Theresa May was strongly criticised in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="ip2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/muslim-ban-exemption-donald-trump-theresa-may-fall-out-a7552321.html|title= Pressure grows on May as a million people sign anti-Trump petition over 'Muslim ban'|date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38784199|title=Theresa May fails to condemn Donald Trump on refugees|date=28 January 2017|via=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-critisied-for-not-condemning-donald-trump-muslim-ban-2017-1?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Theresa May is at heart of a political storm over her 'weak' response to Trump's Muslim ban|work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/petition-to-cancel-trump-visit-to-uk-hits-1-million-signatures/article33822031/|title=British PM Theresa May faces tough lesson over Trump's U.S. entry ban}}&lt;/ref&gt; by members of all major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Executive Order 13769]] (colloquially known as the "Muslim ban")&lt;ref name="ip2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-theresa-may-muslim-ban-latest-boris-johnson-commons-statement-white-house-a7554261.html|title=Boris Johnson faces accusations that Theresa May was told the 'Muslim ban' was coming|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bi1" /&gt; as well as for inviting Trump to a state visit with [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name="McCann-Tele1Feb"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCann|first1=Kate|title=Theresa May rejects calls to block Donald Trump's state visit in fierce exchange with Jeremy Corbyn|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/01/theresa-may-rejects-calls-block-donald-trumps-state-visit-fierce/|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 1.8&amp;nbsp;million signed an official parliamentary [[e-petition]] which said that "Donald Trump's well documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/donald-trump-muslim-ban-protest-petition-sign-number-signatures-state-visit-550048|title=A petition to stop Donald Trump's planned visit to the U.K. has surpassed a million signatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said in [[Prime Minister's Questions]] (PMQs) that Trump should not be welcomed to Britain "while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees' and women's rights"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38805196|title=Trump state visit plan 'very difficult' for Queen|date=31 January 2017|via=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that Trump should be banned from the UK until the bar on Muslims entering the US is lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/nationwide-protests-uk-trump-muslim-ban-170131014554397.html|title=Nationwide protests in the UK over Trump's Muslim ban}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCann-Tele1Feb" /&gt;

[[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Baroness Warsi]], former chair of the Conservatives, accused May of "bowing down" to Trump, who she described as "a man who has no respect for women, disdain for minorities, little value for LGBT communities, no compassion clearly for the vulnerable and whose policies are rooted in divisive rhetoric."&lt;ref name="independent17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/baroness-warsi-cabinet-minister-theresa-may-donald-trump-travel-ban-muslim-immigration-uk-state-a7552631.html|title=Ex Cabinet minister tells Government to consider cancelling Trump state visit|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/donald-trump-travel-ban-muslims-theresa-may-families-torn-apart-a7553016.html|title=Theresa May will find herself as hated as Trump if she keeps sacrificing our ethics for trade deals|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; London Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] and the Conservative leader in Scotland, [[Ruth Davidson]], also called for the visit to be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-says-donald-trump-visit-will-go-ahead-despite-petition-against-it-2017-1|title=May says Trump state visit will go ahead no matter how many people sign a petition against it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent17" /&gt;

===Executive pay===
May is considering forcing companies to reveal the difference between what their CEOs are paid and what their ordinary workers are paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38120604 |title=Executive pay: Companies could be forced to reveal pay gap – |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
Following the impact of ''[[Blue Planet II]]'' in 2017, the May administration outlined plans to approve further green policy. A particular focus has been on plastic and its impact on the environment. In March 2018, May announced plans for a plastic deposit scheme modelled on a similar policy in Norway to boost recycling. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43563164|title=Drinks bottles and can deposit return scheme proposed|date=27 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 general election==
{{main|United Kingdom general election, 2017|Second May ministry}}
On 18 April 2017, in a surprise statement made outside 10 Downing Street, May announced that she was to seek parliamentary approval for an early election to be held. She explained that, following the country's decision last summer to leave the European Union, she had "only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion" and that although she had "said that there should be no election until 2020", that she had "concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theresa May's general election statement in full|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39630009|accessdate=19 April 2017|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; May previously indicated through a [[spokesperson]] she had no plan for a general election, the spokesperson stated, “There isn’t going to be one.

[[File:Theresa May 2017 election speech outside 10 Downing Street.jpg|thumb|May making a speech outside 10 Downing Street following the 2017 general election]]
As of 9 June 2017 the Conservative Party lost seats and Labour gained seats.  The Conservatives remained the largest single party but without an absolute majority. In the immediate aftermath of the election, it was unclear if Theresa May would continue as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/what-is-a-hung-parliament-and-what-happens-now What is a hung parliament and what happens now?] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; May stated that she would have an informal understanding with the DUP to keep the Conservatives in government.

On 10 June 2017 10 Downing Street issued a statement that a [[Conservative–DUP agreement]] was reached in principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40236152|title=Election 2017: DUP agrees 'confidence' deal with Tories|date=10 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours later, the statement was retracted when it was claimed that it had been "issued in error" and that talks between the Conservative Party and DUP were still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dup-tory-deal_uk_593ce995e4b0c5a35ca037cd?cop|title=Theresa May Mocked Mercilessly For 'Omnishambles' After DUP Deal Statement 'Issued In Error'|date=11 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2017 former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]], described May as a "dead woman walking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/11/theresa-may-dead-woman-walking-george-osborne-says-dup-deal/|title=Cabinet reshuffle: Michael Gove appointed Environment Secretary in shock return to frontline politics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ProStars''''' is a cartoon television show featured on [[Saturday morning cartoon]]. It was produced by [[DIC Entertainment|DiC]] and aired on [[NBC]] from September 14 to December 7, 1991. Three famous and popular professional athletes from the 1990s appear in the show in live action and as fictional super hero characters: '''[[Michael Jordan]]''', '''[[Wayne Gretzky]]''' and  '''[[Bo Jackson]]'''.

==Overview==

===Synopsis===
Originally intended to air on [[ESPN]], the show centers on [[Michael Jordan]], [[Bo Jackson]] and [[Wayne Gretzky]] fighting crime, helping children, and often protecting the environment as well. These three were chosen to represent the pinnacle of [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada#Big Four leagues|all four major American professional sports]] in the early 1990s. While Jordan and Gretzky are broadly associated with their respective sports, Jackson was included since he could represent both [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]] and was a high-profile celebrity off the field as well. A reference to his "[[Bo Knows]]" [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] ad-campaign was worked into almost every episode.

===Live-action sequences===
The stars appear in live-action sequences before the show, in which they would tell kids about the upcoming episode, and often answer questions from kids at the conclusion. Normally this is done solely by Gretzky and Jackson—often in separate sound stages and edited to appear as if talking to each other. Jordan's filmed bits were almost always one line or two, and not part of the skits before the episode. Most of the live-action parts by the athletes dealt with things such as morality. In one episode they explained ghosts stating that even they get scared sometimes, and that fear is a normal human emotion. In an episode with robot athletes, they explained how such an idea will never come to reality, as it goes against the dedication men put into their sport. However, during the animated segments of ''ProStars'', their animated counterparts were voiced by [[voice actor]]s instead of their actual selves.

===Theme music===
When the show first came out, the original theme song, "We Are ProStars", was an homage to the song "[[We Will Rock You]]", by the rock group, [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (see links below). In later episodes, the song was slowed down, and the chorus was reduced to 'ProStars! Show staaaars! The lyrics also reference the "[[Bo Knows]]" ad campaign, including the line "Bo knows everything."

==Characters==
Each character on ''ProStars'' has one stand-out character trait, especially the ProStars themselves:

* '''[[Michael Jordan]]''' (voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]): He is the leader of the troupe. He is exceptionally smart and talented with complicated contraptions, and he encourages children to study [[mathematics]] and the sciences.
* '''[[Wayne Gretzky]]''' (voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]): He typically plays the role of comic relief. Inexplicably, his mind is always on food.
* '''[[Bo Jackson]]''' (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]): He provides the proverbial "muscle" for the heroes. He is immensely strong, and has a bit of a mean streak. His strength often approaches [[superhuman]] levels, such as in the series opening, when he uses a gigantic tree trunk like a club against a logging robot.
* '''Mom''' (voiced by [[Susan Silo]]): A quasi-[[Yiddish]] and [[Jewish mother]] stereotype, she is the [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] to the ProStars' [[James Bond]]. She constantly invents wacky gadgets loosely based on sports equipment for the heroes to use. The ProStars spend all their free time in ''Mom's Gym'', and possibly live there as well. It also serves as the ProStars' "headquarters".
* '''Denise''' (voiced by [[Diana Barrows]]): She is an attractive young apprentice to Mom. She wants to help the ProStars, yet she rarely makes an impact.
* '''The Neighbor''': He is a hapless man who wears glasses and happens to live in the same neighborhood as the ProStars' headquarters. By sheer misfortune, he happens to fall victim to the malfunctions of the ProStars' machines, such as when he is buried in snow after their climate machine goes awry. In another episode, he takes a vacation to the [[Himalayas]], and he enjoys the isolation and confidence that he is far away from any mishaps the ProStars could unleash, only to find the ProStars are also in the area stopping a villain there.

===Villains===
In nearly every episode the ProStars would get a message by [[teleconference]] from a child explaining the situation such as a little boy from an island in the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]] who said his village's treasures were being stolen by Short John Silver.

Most of the villains were standard cartoon fare and had often done villainous acts akin to cartoons of the early 1990s (such as ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers|Captain Planet]]'' and ''[[Free Willy (TV series)|Free Willy]]''), namely environmental irresponsibility such as [[strip mining]], coastal pollution, or deforestation of the [[rainforest]].

Other times, a villain might hold a child for ransom, such as a [[mad scientist]] named Dr. Lobe who demanded the ProStars play his line of robot athletes in order to release a little girl he kidnapped. Episodes also touched upon kids in gangs, where an Australian village is being held captive by Gargantus' [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] and a little girl's brother joins the gang thinking they are macho to which Michael Jordan tells the little girl she cannot stop having faith or love in her brother. One episode dealt with the [[larceny]] of the [[Stanley Cup]] committed by Clockwork Delaronge (which is a personal issue for Wayne Gretzky as his name is carved on it four times) and he tells kids of the history and prestige of the award.

==Episodes==
# '''The Slugger Returns''' - The ProStars come to the aid of Jimmy Hanks when his father "Slugger" Hanks is captured by a [[mad scientist]] named Clockwork Delaronge who is using remote-controlled [[robot]]s including one of dead baseball star Cleets Robinson as part of a plot to capture the Commissioner of Baseball.
# '''Short John's Revenge''' - A [[Piracy|pirate]] supervillain named Short John Silver sails into an idyllic Caribbean Island, imprisons the inhabitants, and steals the ancient pirate treasure they had discovered.

# '''Knightmare Riders''' - The ProStars travel to Scotland to save a community from the Ghost Riders of Sir Vitus. This is a cover-up by the evil Carlotta to drive away the golfers so that she can excavate the Golden Throne of Sir Vitus.

The '''Proposed Australian constitutional referendum, 2013''' refers to an Australian referendum which was planned, and then abandoned, in 2013.

==History==
The referendum was proposed to change s 96 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] to allow the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] to directly fund [[Local government in Australia|local councils]].&lt;ref name=BS&gt;[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2013/6/24/politics/local-govt-referendum-planned Local govt referendum planned] Business Spectator, 24 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Similar referendums failed to pass in [[Australian referendum, 1974 (Local Government Bodies)|1974]] and [[Australian referendum, 1988 (Local Government)|1988]].

The proposed constitutional alteration was passed by both Houses of Parliament as the '''''Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill_em/cag2013433/memo_0.html ''Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013'', Explanatory Memorandum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "yes" campaign was supported by both the government and opposition leader [[Tony Abbott]].&lt;ref name=BS/&gt;

The federal government allocated $10 million to the "yes" campaign, but just $500,000 to the "no" campaign. The difference in funding led seven senators from the Coalition to vote against the referendum bill in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], although it passed by 46 votes to eight.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt;

Section 128 of the Constitution requires a proposed constitutional amendment be submitted to the electors in a [[Referendums in Australia|referendum]] no less than two months but no later than six months after passage. The referendum was originally planned to be held on the same day as the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], originally set for 14 September 2013. However, on 4&amp;nbsp;August, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] changed the general election date to 7&amp;nbsp;September,&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-04/rudd-announces-september-7-election-date/4863864 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd calls September 7 federal election], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], 4-Aug-2013&lt;/ref&gt; and Local Government Minister [[Catherine King (politician)|Catherine King]] announced that the referendum would be held on a later date.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

The Australian Labor Party was defeated at the 7 September 2013 federal election, and in October 2013 the Abbott Coalition government announced it would not proceed with the referendum.&lt;ref name=kills_off&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/national/abbott-government-kills-off-local-government-referendum/story-e6frfkp9-1226750784515 Abbott Government kills off local government referendum], news.com.au, October 31, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rape in Sweden''' has a legal definition described in Chapter 6 in the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Penal code|Penal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6 kap. 1 § Brottsbalk (1962:700)|url=https://lagen.nu/1962:700#K6P1S1|publisher=Lagen.nu|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[rape]] has been defined as forced [[sexual intercourse]] initiated against a woman or man by one or several people, without [[consent]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larsdotter|first1=Anna|title=Brottsoffer i skymundan|url=http://www.popularhistoria.se/artiklar/brottsoffer-i-skymundan-2/|publisher=Populär Historia|accessdate=29 March 2015|language=Swedish|date=3 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, several revisions to the definition of rape have been made to the [[law of Sweden]],&lt;ref name="paradox"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordlander|first=Jenny|title=Fler brott bedöms som våldtäkt|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fler-brott-bedoms-som-valdtakt/|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|accessdate=14 May 2014|language=Swedish|date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCN"&gt;{{cite news |date=24 May 2018 |title=Sweden approves new law recognising sex without consent as rape |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44230786 |work=[[BBC News]] |location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include not only intercourse but also [[Sexual assault|comparable sexual acts]] against someone incapable of giving consent, due to being in a vulnerable situation, such as a state of [[fear]] or unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="BBCN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="explinationofthelaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexualbrottslagstiftningen|url=http://www.nck.uu.se/Kunskapscentrum/Kunskapsbanken/amnen/Sexuellt_vald/Sexualbrottslagstiftningen/|publisher=[[Uppsala University]]|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=Swedish|quote=Begreppet våldtäkt [har] blivit könsneutralt och utvidgats så att det utöver samlag även innefattar annan jämförbar handling med en person som är oförmögen att lämna sitt samtycke.

In 2014, there were 6,697 rapes reported to the [[Swedish police]], or 69 cases per 100,000 population, according to the [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]] (BRÅ), which is an 11% increase from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slutlig brottsstatistik 2014|url=http://bra.se/bra/nytt-fran-bra/arkiv/press/2015-03-31-slutlig-brottsstatistik-2014.html|publisher=[[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]]|accessdate=27 May 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the number of reported rapes declined 12%, to 5918 (On the other hand, Swedish Crime Survey in 2015 showed that 1.7% of the total population or 129,000 people between 16-79 years old have exposed to some extension of sexual offenses include rape previously in their lives, increased from 1% in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/rape-and-sex-offences.html|title=Rape and sex offences|website=www.bra.se|language=en|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

In August 2018 [[SVT]] reported that [[rape statistics]] in Sweden show that 58% of men convicted of rape and attempted rape over the past five years were born outside of the [[European Union]]: [[Southern Africa|Southern Africans]], [[North Africa|Northern Africans]], [[Arab|Arabs]], [[Greater Middle East|Middle Easterns]], and [[Afghans]].&lt;ref name="BBCN2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45269764|title=Sweden rape: Most convicted attackers foreign-born, says TV|date=22 August 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="¨svt_2018_rapists¨" /&gt; [[Sveriges Television|Swedish Television]]'s investigating journalists found that in cases where the victims didn't know the attackers, the proportion of foreign-born [[sex offender]]s was more than 80%.&lt;ref name="BBCN2" /&gt; The number of rapes reported to the authorities in Sweden significantly increased&lt;ref name="BBCN" /&gt; by 10% in 2017,&lt;ref name="SVR"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roden |first=Lee |date=18 January 2018 |title=Reported rapes in Sweden up by 10 percent |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20180118/reported-rapes-in-sweden-up-by-10-percent |work=[[Sveriges Radio]] |location=[[Stockholm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Billner |first1=Amanda |last2=Niklas |first2=Magnusson |date=28 March 2018 |title=Surge in Rape Cases Puts Focus on Crime Ahead of Swedish Election |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/rape-case-surge-puts-focus-on-crime-as-swedish-election-looms |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |location=[[Stockholm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to latest preliminary figures from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention.&lt;ref name="SVR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; The number of reported rape cases was 73 per 100,000 citizens in 2017, up 24% in the past decade.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; Official numbers show that the incidence of sexual offences is on the rise;&lt;ref name="BBCN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCN2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish Government]] has declared that young women are facing the greatest risks and that most of the cases go unreported.&lt;ref name="BBCN" /&gt;

==Legislation==

The first [[statutory law]] against rape in Sweden dates back to the 13th century. It was considered a serious crime, punishable by death until 1779.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The current Swedish Penal Code was adopted in 1962 and enacted on 1 January 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish Penal Code|url=http://www.regeringen.se/download/d74ceabc.pdf?major=1&amp;minor=1536&amp;cn=attachmentPublDuplicator_0_attachment|publisher=[[Government Offices of Sweden]]|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established feminist movement, have led to several legislative changes and amendments, greatly expanding the definition of rape.&lt;ref name="paradox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daphne-study"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jo Lovett|author2=Liz Kelly|title=Different systems, similar outcomes?|url=http://kunskapsbanken.nck.uu.se/nckkb/nck/publik/fil/visa/197/different|publisher=London Metropolitan University|accessdate=10 July 2014|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1965 Sweden was one of the first countries in the world to criminalise [[marital rape]].&lt;ref name="daphne-study" /&gt; [[Homosexuality|Homosexual]] acts and [[gender neutrality]] was first introduced in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prop. 2004/05:45|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Propositioner-och-skrivelser/En-ny-sexualbrottslagstiftning_GS0345/|publisher=The [[Riksdag]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sex with someone by improperly exploiting them while they are unconscious (e.g. due to intoxication or sleep) was included in the definition of rape in 2005.&lt;ref name="explinationofthelaw" /&gt;

This excerpt is an unofficial translation, from the Swedish police website:

{{Quote|Rape is one of the most serious sexual crimes. Whoever by force or threat forces another person to a sexual act that seriously insulting sentenced for rape to imprisonment for between two and six years. The penalty for rape is imprisonment for not less than four and not more than ten years.

The sexual act can be intercourse, but also other sexual acts because of coercion or other circumstances are serious offensive can lead to a person convicted of rape. Anyone who exploits someone who is asleep, unconscious, drunk or under the influence of another drug, mentally disturbed, sick or otherwise is in a particularly vulnerable situation, was also convicted of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 6 of the Swedish Penal Code (unofficial translation)|url=https://polisen.se/Lagar-och-regler/Om-olika-brott/Sexualbrott/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Sweden, case law also plays an important role in setting [[precedent]] on the application of the legislation. For example, a 2008 ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] decided that [[Fingering (sexual act)|digital penetration]] of the vagina, on a woman who is intoxicated or sleeping, shall be regarded as an sexual act comparable to sexual intercourse, and is therefore an act of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sammanställning av rättspraxis i sexualbrottsmål|url=http://www.aklagare.se/PageFiles/4049/2010-04%20sexualbrott%20sammanst%C3%A4llning.pdf|publisher=[[Swedish Prosecution Authority]]|accessdate=30 March 2015|language=Swedish|format=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NJA 2008 s. 482|url=https://lagen.nu/dom/nja/2008s482|publisher=lagen.nu|accessdate=30 March 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swedish rape statistics ==


Ever since the [[collation]] of [[crime statistics]] was initiated by the [[Council of Europe]], Sweden has had the highest number of registered rape offences in Europe by a considerable extent. In 1996, Sweden registered almost three times the average number of rape offences registered in 35 European countries. However, this does not necessarily mean rape is three times as likely to occur as in the rest of Europe, since cross-national comparisons of crime levels based on official crime statistics are problematic, due to a number of factors described below.&lt;ref name=VonHofer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Hofer|first1=Hanns|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|date=2000|title=Crime Statistics as Constructs: The Case of Swedish Rape Statistics|volume=8|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1023/A:1008713631586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="explained-official"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crime statistics|url=http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/crime-statistics.html|publisher=[[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]]|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roxell-Tiby&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lena Roxell, Eva Tiby|title=Frågor, fält och filter: kriminologisk metodbok|date=2006|publisher=[[Studentlitteratur]]|location=Lund|isbn=9789144047034|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC4" /&gt;

There are three types of factors that determine the outcome of crime statistics: [[Rape in Sweden#Statistical factors|statistical factors]], [[Rape in Sweden#Legal factors|legal factors]], and [[Rape in Sweden#Substantive factors|substantive factors]].&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="explained-official" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roxell-Tiby" /&gt; The combined effect of these "make it safe to contend that the Swedish rape statistics constitute an 'over-reporting' relative to the European average", according to a study by Hanns von Hofer, Professor of [[Criminology]] at [[Stockholm University]], published by The European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;

=== Statistical factors ===

Unlike the majority of countries in Europe, crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification may be unclear. In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape, it retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="explained-official" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roxell-Tiby" /&gt;

Sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruth|first=Alexander|title=Sweden's rape rate under the spotlight|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2014|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="method"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries |url=http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=14 May 2014 |page=145 |date=2008 |quote=The Swedish mode of recording is sometimes referred to as 'extensive counting', since the crime statistics cover reported acts of rape. If a woman reports that she was subjected to several rapes by a group of men, or to repeated rapes on different occasions by one and the same man, each rape will be registered as a separate offence in the Swedish crime statistics. Furthermore, if a woman is subjected to repeated rapes during the same day by the same perpetrator, this may be registered as one or several crimes, depending on whether it is possible to distinguish each separate act. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020202147/http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roxell-Tiby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC4"&gt;{{Cite episode| title=Investigating crime statistics | url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/moreorless/moreorless_20120917-1200a.mp3 | accessdate=13 October 2014 | series=More or Less: Behind the Stats | serieslink=More or Less (radio programme) | station=[[BBC Radio 4]] | date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, crime statistics refer to the year when the offence was reported; the actual offence may have been committed long before. Swedish rape statistics can thus contain significant time-lag, which makes interpretations of annual changes difficult.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roxell-Tiby" /&gt;

=== Legal factors ===

The way the crime itself is defined and various related aspects of the judicial process affect the registration of offences in the [[official statistics]].&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="explained-official" /&gt; The concept of rape can be defined narrowly or in a more expansive manner. In Sweden, the definition of rape has been successively widened over the years, leading to an ever-larger number of sexual assaults being classified as rape.&lt;ref name="paradox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="widening1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Våldtäktsbegreppet vidgas i förslag|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/valdtaktsbegreppet-vidgas-i-forslag/|publisher=[[Sydsvenskan]]|accessdate=14 May 2014|language=Swedish|date=23 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="increase"&gt;{{cite web|title=Våldtäkt och sexualbrott|url=https://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html|publisher=[[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]]|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=Swedish|quote=Sett till en tioårsperiod (2004–2013) har de anmälda våldtäkterna ökat markant, vilket till stor del kan förklaras av förändringar i sexualbrottslagstiftningen som trädde i kraft den 1 april 2005.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170221212501/https://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html|archivedate=21 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="widening2" /&gt; For example, in 1992 a legislative change came into force which shifted the dividing line between sexual assault and rape. This legislative change resulted in about a 25% increase in the level of registered rape offences.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;

Changes in the legal process has also affected the number of reports. Until 1984, rape was only prosecuted in cases where the victim was prepared to press charges, with an additional restriction of a six months time limit. This resulted in numerous cases of rape and sexual assault going [[under-reporting|unreported]].&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;

The Swedish prosecution system is governed by the [[principle of legality]] and the "equality principle", which means that as a rule, the police and the prosecution service are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware. This can be assumed to lead to a more frequent registration of offences than in systems with the inverse "expediency principle", where the classification of offences is negotiable on the basis of [[plea bargaining]], and the prosecutor has the right not to prosecute, even when a prosecution would be technically possible.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roxell-Tiby" /&gt; English speaking [[common law]] countries operate an [[adversarial system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tonry|first1=Michael|title=The Oxford handbook of crime and criminal justice|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-539508-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substantive factors ===

Willingness to report crime also affects the statistics.&lt;ref name="explained-official" /&gt; In countries where rape remains associated with a strong taboo and a high level of shame, the propensity to report such offences probably tends to be lower than in countries characterized by a higher level of sexual equality. A police force and judicial system enjoining a high level of confidence and a good reputation with the public will produce a higher propensity to report crime than a police force which is discredited, inspires fear or distrust.&lt;ref name="VonHofer" /&gt;

The findings of the 2000 [[International Crime Victims Survey]] (ICVS) indicate that the respondents' satisfaction with the police is above average in Sweden, with almost no experience of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Anna Alvazzi del Frate|author2=John van Kesteren|title=Criminal Victimisation in Urban Europe|url=http://www.unicri.it/services/library_documentation/publications/icvs/publications/CriminalVictimisationUrbanEurope.pdf|publisher=[[International Crime Victims Survey]]|accessdate=11 July 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden has also been ranked number one in sexual equality.&lt;ref name="sexualequality"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6167486.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nordics show way in sex equality | date=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International comparison ==

{{See also|Rape in Sweden#Victim surveys}}

Widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult. Large-scale [[Victim study|victimisation surveys]] have been presented as a more reliable indicator.&lt;ref name=statistics-caution&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jo Lovett|author2=Liz Kelly|title=Different systems, similar outcomes?|date=2009|publisher=London Metropolitan University|isbn=978-0-9544803-9-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNODC report ===

A frequently cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC). In 2012, according to the report by UNODC, Sweden was quoted as having 66.5 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population,&lt;ref name="UNODC2013" /&gt; based on official statistics by [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention|Brå]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anmälda brott, totalt och per 100 000 av medelfolkmängden, efter brottstyp och månad för anmälan, år 2012 samt jämförelse med föregående år |url=http://www.bra.se/download/18.22a7170813a0d141d21800061146/1364311914171/100La-2012.xls |publisher=[[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]] |accessdate=10 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125901/http://www.bra.se/download/18.22a7170813a0d141d21800061146/1364311914171/100La-2012.xls |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest number of reported rape of any nation in the report. The high number of reported rapes in Sweden can partly be explained by the comparatively broad definition of rape, the method of which the Swedish police record rapes, a high confidence in the criminal justice system, and an effort by [[Government of Sweden|the Government]] to decrease the number of unreported rapes.{{ref label|id1|note 1|2}}&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/news-from-bra/archive/news/2011-01-18-how-common-is-rape-in-sweden-compared-to-other-european-countries.html|title=How common is rape in Sweden compared to other European countries?|publisher=The [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]]|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="method" /&gt;&lt;ref name="effort1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/nya-metoder-ska-ge-fler-valdtaktsatal/|title=Nya metoder ska ge fler våldtäktsåtal|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNODC itself discourages any cross-national comparisons based on their reports, because of the differences that exist between legal definitions, methods of offense counting and crime reporting.&lt;ref name=UNODC2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape at the national level, number of police-recorded offences|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/CTS2013_SexualViolence.xls|publisher=[[UNODC]]|accessdate=10 June 2014|year=2013|quote=Please note that when using the figures, any cross-national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, or the different methods of offence counting and recording.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, of the 129 countries listed in the UNODC report, a total of 67 countries had no reported data on rape.&lt;ref name="BBC4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNODC2013" /&gt; Some majority-[[Muslim]] countries missing data—for example [[Rape in Egypt|Egypt]]—classifies rape as assault.&lt;ref name="UNODCincomplete" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's sexual assault epidemic|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/201381494941573782.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=10 June 2014|quote=As it stands, under Egyptian law sexual harassment is not criminialised, and rape by objects or hands is only classified as assault.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crime survey funded by the UN and published in [[The Lancet]] Global Health concluded that almost a quarter of all men admit to rape in parts of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Almost a quarter of men 'admit to rape in parts of Asia'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-24021573|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevalence of and factors associated with non-partner rape perpetration: findings from the UN Multi-country Cross-sectional Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2813%2970069-X/fulltext|publisher=[[The Lancet]]|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the countries with the highest percentage of men admitting rape in that study, China and [[Bangladesh]] for instance, are also not listed or have relatively low numbers of reported rape in the UNODC report.&lt;ref name="UNODC2013" /&gt;

8 out of 10 of the countries with the highest number of reported rape in the 2011 UNODC report were members of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], an organization of high-income economies with a very high [[Human Development Index]]. 6 out of 10 countries with the highest number of reported rapes were also in the top of the [[Global Gender Gap Report|Global Gender Gap Index rankings]].&lt;ref name=UNODCincomplete&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masri|first1=Mona|title=Att tolka statistik|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/att-tolka-statistik/|publisher=[[Sydsvenskan]]|accessdate=10 June 2014|language=Swedish|quote=En förväxling som är vanlig även på andra håll, till exempel hos islamister som hävdar att våldtäkt inte finns i länder som Egypten [...] Åtta av de tio högst rankade länderna i våldtäktsstatistiken är nämligen medlemmar i OECD, samarbetsorganisationen för världens mest utvecklade länder. [...] sex av de tio länderna i topp på FN:s lista återfinns på World Economic Forums rankning över världens mest jämställda länder.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victim surveys==

In Sweden there is a comparatively broad definition of what constitutes rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For this reason, [[Criminology|criminologists]] tend to recommend crime comparisons between countries based on large surveys of the general public, so-called [[Victim study|victim surveys]].&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BRA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statistics-caution" /&gt;

In its 2018 report, ''Nationella trygghetsundersökningen 2018'' (tr: "national survey of safety 2018") the [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention]] stated that there had been an increase in the self-reported number of victims of sexual crime among from 4.7% in 2016 to 6.4% in 2017. In the 5 preceding years there were escalating levels compared to the 2005–2012 period where the level was relatively stable. The increase in self-reporte victimisation was greater among women than among men. while the number of male victims remained largely constant over the timespan (see graph). The questionnaire pollls for incidents which would equate to attempted sexual assault or rape according to Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bra.se/statistik/statistiska-undersokningar/nationella-trygghetsundersokningen.html|title=Nationella trygghetsundersökningen 2018|last=|first=|date=20 November 2018|website=|publisher=BRÅ|language=sv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conviction rate ==

In 2009, [[Amnesty International]] published a report on rape in the [[Nordic countries]], criticizing the low conviction rates in Sweden, citing previously published estimates from [[Brå]] of around 30,000 incidents of rape, with less than 13 percent of the 3,535 rape crimes reported resulting in a decision to start legal proceedings and 216 persons convicted in 2007.&lt;ref name="amnesty1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20090428/19124 |title=Swedish rapists 'enjoy impunity': Amnesty International |publisher=Thelocal.se|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[London Metropolitan University]] study in 2009, funded by the [[European Commission]] Daphne Programme—primarily focused on attrition, the process by which rape cases fail to proceed through the justice system—[[Sweden]] had the highest number of reported rapes in Europe (almost twice that of England and Wales, based on 2002-2007 [[Rape in Sweden#UNODC report|UNODC figures]]), that may or may not be attributed to the fact that in 2005 there has been reform in the sex crime legislation. That change in the legislation applies for rapes reported in 2006 and 2007 but it doesn't apply for the previous rapes reported in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 before the change and when the reported rapes in Sweden were still the highest in Europe.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; The reform made the legal definition of rape one of the widest legal definitions in the world, but not the lowest conviction rate. Insufficient evidence was the most frequent reason why cases were discontinued before court (53%).&lt;ref name="daphne-study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal-updated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20090427/19102 |title=Sweden tops European rape league - The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the study questioned the accuracy of the data provided by the countries reporting low instances of rape. They also noted that a widening of the definition of rape in law; procedural rules which require police to record all reports, a confidence in the criminal justice system and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships could account for the relative high number of reported rapes in Sweden.&lt;ref name="daphne-study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="widening2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flest våldtäkter i Sverige|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/flest-valdtakter-i-sverige/|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|accessdate=14 May 2014|language=Swedish|date=27 April 2009|quote=[I Sverige finns] bättre anmälningsupptagning än på andra håll, våldtäktsbegreppet har utvidgats och det finns en större vilja hos svenska kvinnor att anmäla våldtäkter även inom relationer, [...] säger professor Kelly.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal-updated" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different systems, similar outcomes?

The low conviction rate could be explained by the reduced legal distinction between rape and permitted intercourse, leading to greater challenges for the prosecution to prove its case, according to Petter Asp, Professor of Criminal Law at [[Stockholm University]].&lt;ref name="paradox" /&gt;

== Gang rape ==

In 2013, ''Forskning &amp; Framsteg'' ''(FoF)'', a Swedish popular science magazine, published an article reporting that “The evidence suggests that gang rapes in Sweden is increasing - despite the decline in violent crime in general.”&lt;ref name="Dramatic increase in the number of reported gang rape. Author: Henrik Hojer"&gt;[http://fof.se/tidning/2013/10/artikel/dramatisk-okning-av-antalet-anmalda-gruppvaldtakter Dramatisk ökning av antalet anmälda gruppvåldtäkter]. ''Forskning &amp; Framsteg'' (2013-10-09). Retrieved on 2017-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''FoF'' went on to report that, “The increase, which primarily occurred in the 2000s, may have to do with "rape with multiple perpetrators" from 2004, classified as "serious crime", which means that more obscure cases fall into this category.” ''FoF'' further reports that “National Council's investigator, Klara Hradilova-Selin, said that "developments could at least partly be interpreted in terms of an actual increase."&lt;ref name="Dramatic increase in the number of reported gang rape. Author: Henrik Hojer"/&gt; Although there are a number of other important reasons why we are seeing more reports, such as, Klara Hradilova-Selin goes on to say, “more woman dare to go the police” and an “increased alcohol consumption”.&lt;ref name="Dramatic increase in the number of reported gang rape. Author: Henrik Hojer"/&gt; Finally ''FoF'' goes on to report that in the 1990s “In the gang rape of three or more perpetrators 39 percent are foreign born.”&lt;ref name="Dramatic increase in the number of reported gang rape. Author: Henrik Hojer"/&gt; The statistics for gang rapes were not investigated by Swedish authorities after 2006.&lt;ref name="Dramatic increase in the number of reported gang rape. Author: Henrik Hojer"/&gt;

In March 2018, newspaper [[Expressen]] investigated gang rape court cases from the two preceding years and found that there were 43 men having been convicted. Their average age was 21 and 13 were under the age of 18 when the crime was committed. Of the convicted, 40 out of the 43 were either immigrants (born abroad) or born in Sweden to immigrant parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/brottscentralen/qs/de-ar-mannen-som-valdtar-tillsammans/|title=De är män som våldtar kvinnor tillsammans: "Jag tyckte det var en rolig grej att filma"|last=|first=|date=|work=Expressen|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320113923/https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/brottscentralen/qs/de-ar-mannen-som-valdtar-tillsammans/|archive-date=20 March 2018|dead-url=|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another investigation by newspaper Aftonbladet found that of 112 men and boys convicted for gang rape since July 2012, 82 were born outside Europe. The median age of the victims was 15, while 7 out of 10 perpetrators were between 15 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/rLKwKR/unik-granskning-112-pojkar-och-man-domda-for-gruppvaldtakt|title=112 pojkar och män dömda för gruppvåldtäkt|last=|first=|date=|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=2018-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507070557/https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/rLKwKR/unik-granskning-112-pojkar-och-man-domda-for-gruppvaldtakt|archive-date=7 May 2018|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unreported cases ==

According to [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention|Brå]] in 2013, it is likely that as many as 80 per cent of all rapes are not reported, which was confirmed in a 2014 study of the extent of violence against women, funded by the [[Government of Sweden]] and the [[Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority]].&lt;ref name="amnesty1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf |title=Rape and Human rights in the Nordic Countries |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020202147/http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Captured Queen|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~stefan/CapturedQueen.pdf|publisher=Eva Lundgren, Gun Heimer, Jenny Westerstrand, Anne-Marie Kalliokoski|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be compared to a 2007 [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] report, estimating that between 75 and 95 percent of rapes are not reported in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Without consent: A report on the joint review of the investigation and prosecution of rape offences |date= January 2007 |accessdate= 10 June 2014|url= http://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/without-consent-20061231.pdf |page=8 |publisher= [[Crown Prosecution Service]] Inspectorate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:50 Euro bill watermark.jpg|thumb|A hologram on a 50 [[Euro]] banknote]]
'''Security printing''' is the field of the [[printing]] industry that deals with the printing of items such as [[banknote]]s, [[cheque]]s, [[passport]]s, [[tamper-evident]] [[label]]s, [[security tape]]s, product [[authentication]], [[stock certificate]]s, [[postage stamp]]s and [[identity card]]s. The main goal of security printing is to prevent [[forgery]], tampering, or [[counterfeit]]ing. More recently many of the techniques used to protect these high-value documents have become more available to commercial printers whether they are using the more traditional offset and flexographic presses or the newer digital platforms. Businesses are protecting their lesser-value documents such as transcripts, coupons and prescription pads by incorporating some of the features listed below to ensure that they cannot be forged or that alteration of the data cannot occur undetected.

A number of technical methods are used in the security printing industry.

== Special paper ==
Most banknotes are made of heavy [[paper]], almost always from cotton fibres for strength and durability, in some cases linen or speciality coloured or forensic fibres are added to give the paper added individuality and protect against counterfeiting. Some countries, including [[Canada]], [[Nigeria]], [[Romania]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Israel]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], produce [[Polymer banknote|polymer (plastic) banknotes]], to improve longevity and allow the inclusion of a small transparent window (a few millimeters in size) as a security feature that is difficult to reproduce using common counterfeiting techniques.

== Watermarks ==

A [[watermark]] is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that appears lighter or darker than surrounding paper when viewed with a light from behind the paper, due to paper density variations. A watermark is made by impressing a water coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing. Watermarks were first introduced in Bologna, Italy in 1282; as well as their use in security printing, they have also been used by papermakers to identify their product. Watermarks can also be made on polymer currency, for example, Australia has its coat of arms watermarked on all its plastic bills.

=== Simulated watermarks ===

Printed with white ink, simulated watermarks have a different reflectance than the base paper and can be seen at an angle. Because the ink is white, it cannot be photocopied or scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Features|url=https://www.advlaser.com/v/vspfiles/files/pdf/security.pdf|publisher=Advantage Laser Products|accessdate=26 May 2014|location=Atlanta, GA|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intaglio printing ==

[[intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] is a printing technique in which the image is incised into a surface. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used, and the incisions are created by [[etching]] or [[engraving]] the image, but one may also use [[mezzotint]]. In printing, the surface is covered in ink, and then rubbed vigorously with tarlatan cloth or newspaper to remove the ink from the surface, leaving it in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink to the paper.

The very sharp printing obtained from the intaglio process is hard to imitate by other means. Intaglio also allows for the creation of latent images which are only visible when the document is viewed at a very shallow angle.

== Geometric lathe work ==
A [[guilloché]] is an ornamental pattern formed of two or more curved bands that interlace to repeat a circular design. They are made with a [[geometric lathe]].

[[File:Map3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A guilloché]]

== Microprinting ==
This involves the use of extremely small text, and is most often used on currency and bank checks. The text is generally small enough to be indiscernible to the naked eye. Cheques, for example, use [[microprinting|microprint]] as the signature line.

{{further|Microprinting}}

== Optically variable color-changing inks ==

[[Optically Variable Ink|Color changing inks]] are made from [[mica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather Resistance Series, Pearlescent Pigment, Pearl EX Pigments|url=http://www.dychemco.com/pearlescent-pigment/1164252.html|publisher=Dynasty Chemicals (NingBo) Co., Ltd.|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=Pearlescent Pigments are made from mica and they are widely used in paits, coating, printing ink, plastic, cosmetic, leather, wallpaper etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optically Variable Ink|Color changing inks]] colored magnetizable inks are prepared by including chromatic pigments of high color strength. The magnetic pigments’ strong inherent color generally reduces the spectrum of achievable shades. Generally, pigments should be used at high concentrations to ensure that sufficient magnetizable material is applied even in thin offset coats. Some magnetic pigment are best suited for colored magnetizable inks due to their lower blackness.
Homogenous magnetization (no preferred orientation) is easily obtained on pigment made of spherical particles. Best results are achieved when remanence and coercive field strength are very low and the saturating magnetization is high.

Magnetic pigments are also used in ribbon inks for coding and reading (MICR = Magnetic Ink Character Recognition).
The pigment is dispersed in a binder system (resin, solvent) or a wax compound and applied either by pressing or by hot melt to a carrier film (usually polyethylene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetic pigments|date=July 2004|page=6|url=http://www.basf.pl/ecp1/Poland/pl/function/conversions:/publish/upload/02_Products_Industries/04_Business_Segments/Pigmenty/Pigmenty_magnetyczne_.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2014|publisher=BASF, The Chemical Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When pearlescent pigments are viewed at different angles the angle of the light as it's perceived makes the color appear to change as the magnetic fields within the particles shift direction.

== Holograms ==
{{Main|Security hologram}}
A [[hologram]] may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein an extremely thin layer of only a few [[micrometers]] of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a [[hot-melt adhesive]] (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.
When incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram hot stamping foils become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time. Also from a security perspective, if stamped, a hologram is a superior security device as it is virtually impossible to remove from its substrate.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

== Security threads ==

Metal threads and foils, from simple iridescent features to foil color copying to foils with additional optically variable effects are often used.

There are two kinds of security threads.  One is a thin aluminum coated and partly de-metalized polyester film thread with microprinting which is embedded in the security paper as banknote or passport paper.  The other kind of security thread is the single or multicolor sewing thread made from cotton or synthetic fibers, mostly UV fluorescent, for the [[bookbinding]] of passport booklets.

On occasion, the banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect (excess belief in the latest technology), and place too much faith in some particular trick. An example is the forgery of British banknotes in the 1990s.  British banknotes in the 1990s featured a metal strip through the paper about 1&amp;nbsp;mm wide that comes to the paper surface every 8&amp;nbsp;mm. When examined in reflected light, it appears to have a dotted metallic line running across it, but when viewed through transmitted light, the metal strip is dark and solid.

Duplicating this was thought to be difficult, but a criminal gang was able to reproduce it quickly. They used a cheap hot-stamping process to lay down a metal strip on the surface of the paper, then printed a pattern of solid bars over it using white ink to leave the expected metal pattern visible. At their trial, they were found to have forged tens of millions of pounds’ worth of notes over a period of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems|page=245|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-12.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magnetic ink ==
Because of the speed with which they can be read by computer systems, magnetic ink character recognition is used extensively in banking, primarily for personal checks. The ink used in [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) technology is also used to greatly reduce errors in automated (or computerized) reading.

Some people believe that the magnetic ink was intended as a fraud prevention concept, yet the original intent was to have a non-optical technology so that writing on the cheque, like signatures, would not interfere with reading. The main magnetic fonts (E13-B and CMC7) are downloadable for a small fee and in addition magnetic toner is available for many printers. Some higher resolution toners have sufficient magnetic properties for magnetic reading to be successful without special toner.

== Serial numbers ==
[[Serial number]]s help make legitimate documents easier to track and audit. To help detect forgeries serial numbers will normally have a [[Check digit]] to verify the serial number.

Another method of protection is to create trap numbers within the serial number range. For example, the system may automatically invalidate numbers which are in a range of 200-300 (e.g. 210, 205 would be invalid). The system may even take single random numbers within a block (e.g. ending in 51, 37, 48 within a 200-300 range would be invalid).

== Anti-copying marks ==
In the late twentieth century advances in computer and photocopy technology made it possible for people without sophisticated training to easily copy currency. In an attempt to prevent this, banks have sought to add filtering features to the software and hardware available to the public that senses features of currency, and then locks out the reproduction of any material with these marks. One known example of such a system is the [[EURion constellation]].

== Copy-evident ==
{{Main|copy-evident document}}
Sometimes only the original document has value. An original signed [[cheque]] for example has value but a photocopy of it does not. An original prescription script can be filled but a photocopy of it should not be. Copy-evident technologies provide security to hard copy documents by helping distinguish between the original document and the copy.

The most common technology to help differentiate originals from copies is the [[void pantograph]]. Void pantographs are essentially invisible to the untrained, naked eye on an original but when scanned or copied the layout of lines, dots and dashes will reveal a word (frequently VOID and hence the name) or symbol that clearly allows the copy to be identified. This technology is available on both traditional presses (offset and flexographic) and on the newer digital platforms. The advantage of a digital press is that in a single pass through the printer a void pantograph with all the variable data can be printed on plain paper.

Copy-evident paper, sometimes marketed as ‘security paper’, is pre-printed void pantograph paper that was usually produced on an offset or flexographic press. The quality of the void pantograph is usually quite good because it was produced on a press with a very high resolution and when only a small number of originals are to be printed it can be a cost effective solution however the advent of the digital printer has rapidly eroded this benefit.

A second technology which complements and enhances the effectiveness of the void pantograph is the Verification Grid. This technology is visible on the original, usually as fine lines or symbols but when photocopied these lines and images disappear; the inverse reaction of the void pantograph. The most common examples of this technology are on the fine lines at the edge of a cheque which will disappear when copied or on a coupon when a symbol, such as a shopping cart, disappears when an unauthorized copy is made. Verification Grid is available for either traditional or digital presses.

Together the void pantograph and the Verification Grid complement each other because the reactions to copying are inverse, resulting in a higher degree of assurance that a hard copy document is an original.

== Prismatic coloration ==
The use of color can greatly assist the prevention of forgeries. By including a color on a document a color photocopier must be used in the attempt to make a copy however the use of these machines also tends to enhance the effectiveness of other technologies such as Void Pantographs and Verification Grids (see Copy-evident above).

By using two or more colors in the background and blending them together a prismatic effect can be created. This can be done on either a traditional or a digital press. When a document using this technique is attempted to be photocopied the scanning and re-creation by a color copier is inexact usually resulting in banding or blotching and thereby immediate recognition of the document as being a copy.

A frequent example of prismatic coloring is on checks where it is combined with other techniques such as the Void Pantograph to increase the difficulty of successful counterfeiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Features|url=https://www.advlaser.com/v/vspfiles/files/pdf/security.pdf|publisher=Advantage Laser Products|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=Prismatic Two-Color Pantograph A multi-color background in which two colors change density and blend into each other, making it very difficult to reproduce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Halo ==
Carefully created images can be hidden in the background or in a picture on a document. These images cannot be seen without the help of an inexpensive lens of a specific line screening. When placed over the location of the image and rotated the image becomes visible. If the document is photocopied the Halo image is lost.

Halo can be printed on traditional or digital presses. The advantage of traditional presses is that multiple images can be overlaid in the same location and become visible in turn as the lens is rotated.

Halo is used as a technique to authenticate the originality of the document and may be used to verify critical information within the document. For example, the value of a coupon might be encoded as a Halo image that could be verified at the time of redemption or similarly the seat number on a sporting event ticket.

== False-positive testing ==
False-positive testing derives its name because the testing requires both a false and a positive reaction to authenticate a document. The most common instance is the widely available counterfeit detector marker seen in many banks and stores.

Counterfeit detector markers use a chemical interaction with the substrate, usually paper, of a document turning it a particular color. Usually a marker turns newsprint black and leaves currency or specially treated areas on a document clear or gold. The reaction and coloring varies depending upon the formulation. Banknotes, being a specially treated substrate, usually behave differently than standard newsprint or other paper and this difference is how counterfeits are detected by the markers.

False-positive testing can also be done on documents other than currencies as a means to test their authenticity. With the stroke of a marker a symbol, word or value can be revealed that will allow the user to quickly verify the document, such as a coupon. In more advanced applications the marker creates a barcode which can be scanned for verification or reference to other data within the document resulting in a higher degree of assurance of authenticity.

Photocopied documents will lack the special treating of the substrate so are easily detectable. False-positive testing generally is a one time test because once done the results remain visible so while useful as part of a coupon this technique is not suitable for ID badges for example.

== Fluorescent dyes ==
[[Fluorescent dyes]] are dyes which [[fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light or other unusual lighting. These show up as words, patterns or pictures and may be visible or invisible under normal lighting. This feature is also incorporated into many banknotes and other documents - e.g. Northern Ireland NHS prescriptions show a picture of local '8th wonder' the Giant's Causeway in UV light. Some producers include multi-frequency fluorescence, such that different elements fluoresce under specific frequencies of light.

== Registration of features on both sides ==
Banknotes are typically printed with fine alignment between the printing on each side of the note. This allows the note to be examined for this feature, and provides opportunities to unambiguously align other features of the note to the printing. Again, this is difficult to imitate accurately enough in most print shops.

== Electronic devices ==
With the advent of [[RFID]], it is possible to insert extremely small RF-active devices into the printed product to enhance document security. This is most apparent in modern biometric passports, where an RFID chip mirrors the printed information.

== [[Thermochromatic]] ink ==
Security ink with a normal "trigger" temperature of {{convert|88|F|C}}, which will either disappear or change colors when the ink is rubbed, usually by the fingertips.

== Latent images ==
Pressure-sensitive or hot stamped labels characterized with a normal (gray or colored) appearance. When viewed via a special filter (such as a polarizer) an additional, normally latent, image appears.

'''Sextortion''' is a form of [[sexual exploitation]] that employs non-physical forms of coercion to extort sexual favors from the victim.  Sextortion refers to the broad category of sexual exploitation in which abuse of power is the means of coercion, as well as to the category of sexual exploitation in which threatened release of sexual images or information is the means of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=De la Cerna|first=Madrilena|title=Sextortion|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/177037/sextortion|accessdate=2012-10-05|newspaper=Cebu Daily News|date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
An early use of the term appears in print in 1950 in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Sextortion Charges To Come Up Next Week |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/423471351.html?dids=423471351:423471351&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+05,+1950&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc='SEXTORTION'+CHARGES+TO+COME+UP+NEXT+WEEK&amp;pqatl=google |quote= |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 5, 1950 |accessdate=2010-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 2009, The Institute for Responsible Online and Cell-Phone Communication (iroc2.org) began warning the public about the trend of "Sextortion" via live events and websites including www.sextortion.org. This is a trend that grew based on the birth and growth of the trend known as "sexting" whereby compromising images and videos were being shared by individuals without a real understanding of the short and long term consequences of sharing "private' content on digital tools designed for sharing.

In 2009, the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ), in partnership with the Association of Women Judges in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Philippine Women Judges Association, and the Tanzania Women Judges Association, and with funding from the Government of the Netherlands, launched a three-year program on "Stopping the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming, and Ending Sextortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stopping the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming and Ending Sextortion – Toolkit|url=http://iawj.org/IAWJ%20International%20Toolkit%20FINAL|publisher=International Association of Women Judges|accessdate=2012-10-05|page=5|format=PDF|year=2012}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Presentations on sextortion were made to judges attending the 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10th Biennial International Conference: {{'}}''Judicial Challenges in a Changing World''{{'}}|url=http://www.iawj.org/InternationalConferences|publisher=International Association of Women Judges|accessdate=2012-10-05}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012 Biennial World Conferences of the IAWJ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibb|first=Frances|title=Attacks and threats: why judges need support|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/sitesearch.do%3fquerystring=Attacks+and+threats%3A+why+judges+need+support&amp;p=tto&amp;pf=all&amp;bl=on|accessdate=2012-10-05|newspaper=The Times|date=May 31, 2012|location=London|quote=Judges discussed 'sextortion' a mix of sex and corruption where people in authority demand sexual favours for anything, Hale says, from immigration to prosecution decisions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International forum encourages judges to 'mind the gap{{'}}|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/news/international-forum-encourages-judges-to-mind-the-gap|accessdate=2012-10-05|date=May 31, 2012|agency=The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to NGOs attending the 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ending the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming, and Ending Sextortion.

The '''Sinai insurgency''' is an ongoing conflict in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]], between Islamist militants and Egyptian security forces, which has included attacks on civilians.&lt;ref name=age20171125&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/world/egypt-launches-airstrikes-after-deadly-mosque-attack-20171125-gzstmg.html|title=Egypt launches air strikes after deadly mosque attack|first=Farid|last=Farid|date=25 November 2017|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgency began after the start of the [[Egyptian Crisis (2011–present)|Egyptian Crisis]], which saw the overthrow of longtime [[Egypt]]ian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] in the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Awad|first1=Marwa|title=Egypt army operation nets militants in Sinai-sources|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E7JG1SE20110816|accessdate=12 September 2017|work=AF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local [[Bedouin]] tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the [[Ansar Bait al-Maqdis]] group pledged allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and proclaimed themselves [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Sinai Province|Sinai Province]], and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province group&lt;ref&gt;''The Age'', 16 February 2015: [http://www.theage.com.au/world/egypt-strikes-back-at-islamic-state-militants-after-beheading-video-killing-dozens-20150216-13ghv2.html Egypt strikes back at Islamic State militants after beheading video, killing dozens]&lt;/ref&gt; and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mazel|first1=Zvi|title=ISIS in Sinai: the Libyan connection|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/ISIS-in-Sinai-the-Libyan-connection-482149|accessdate=17 July 2017|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures.&lt;ref name="CSS"/&gt; Egypt launched two military operations, known as [[Operation Eagle]] in mid-2011 and then [[Operation Sinai (2012)|Operation Sinai]] in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]], which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president [[Mohamed Morsi]], "unprecedented clashes" have occurred.&lt;ref name=ahram5july&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75792/Egypt/Politics-/Clashes-in-Sinai-over-Morsi-removal.aspx|title=Clashes in Sinai over Morsi removal|publisher=Ahram Online|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the [[Gaza Strip|Gaza strip]]. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinai population still striving for basic rights as unrest continues: Report|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/125077/Egypt/Politics-/Sinai-population-still-striving-for-basic-rights-a.aspx|accessdate=12 March 2015|agency=Ahram Online|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 [[Sufism|Sufist]] worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in an attack on a mosque west of the city of Al-Arish.&lt;ref name=age20171125/&gt;

==Background==
[[Sufism]] was previously dominant in the region before militant jihadi ideas began to take hold.&lt;ref name="ei0Aug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/mapping-jihadi-groups-sinai|title=Mapping jihadi groups in Sinai|publisher=Egypt Independent|date=10 August 2013|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sinai peninsula has long been known for its lawlessness, having historically served as a smuggling route for weapons and supplies. Security provisions in the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979 have institutionalized a diminished security presence in the area, enabling militants to operate with a freer hand. Moreover, the limited government-directed investment and development in Sinai has discriminated against the local Bedouin population, a population that values tribal allegiance over all else. The combination of Sinai's harsh terrain and lack of resources have kept the area poor and hence ripe for militancy.&lt;ref name="GIAnalysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/1305MLN/13052212STR.asp|title=Analysis: Egypt Tackles Increased Sinai Militancy|publisher=Lebanonwire.com|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=3 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728054203/http://www.lebanonwire.com/1305MLN/13052212STR.asp|archivedate=28 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the January 2011 uprising that toppled [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s regime, the country became increasingly destabilized, creating a security vacuum in the Sinai peninsula. Radical Islamic elements in Sinai exploited the opportunity, using the unique environment, in launching several waves of attacks upon Egyptian military and commercial facilities.

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the conflict also involves local armed Bedouin "who have long-standing grievances against the central government in Cairo" and that "they are barred from joining the army or police; they find it hard to get jobs in tourism; and they complain that many of their lands have been taken from them".&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt;

==Timeline==
{{main|Timeline of the Sinai insurgency}}

===2011–2012===
Since the 2011 uprising against the Mubarak regime in Egypt, there has been increasing instability in the Sinai Peninsula. In addition the collapse of the Libyan regime increased the quantity and sophistication of weapons being smuggled into the area.&lt;ref name="CSS"/&gt; The situation provided local Bedouin with an opportunity to assert their authority, leading to clashes with Egyptian security forces, but the cause of violence soon transitioned to salafi jihadism. Hard-line militant Muslims used Sinai as a launch-point for attacks against Israel and turned on the Egyptian state.,&lt;ref name="CSS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinai Peninsula – from Buffer Zone to Battlefield |url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CSSAnalyse168-EN.pdf |accessdate=4 April 2016 |date=February 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418131034/http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CSSAnalyse168-EN.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on Egypt's security establishment and the Sinai's [[Arab Gas Pipeline]].&lt;ref name=awad&gt;{{cite news|last=Awad|first=Marwa|title=Egypt army operation nets militants in Sinai-sources|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7JG1SE20110816|accessdate=19 August 2011|newspaper=[[Reuters|Reuters Africa]]|date=16 August 2011|location=Cairo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operation Eagle====
{{main|Operation Eagle}}

In August 2011, Operation Eagle was launched, in an effort to restore law and order, driving Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs out of North Sinai's urban centers.&lt;ref name=almasry&gt;{{cite news|last=Khaled |first=Osama |title=Special forces deployed to Sinai to restore security |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/485461 |accessdate=19 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=11 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as, attempting to sever the link between militant groups in the Sinai and Gaza, by augmenting its control over the Gaza border crossing.&lt;ref name="CSS" /&gt;

The operation had limited success, and a week into the operation, Salafi jihadists carried out the biggest [[2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks|cross-border attack on Israel]] in the post-Mubarak period.

====Operation Sinai====
{{Main|August 2012 Sinai attack|Operation Sinai (2012)}}

On 5 August 2012, an [[August 2012 Sinai attack|attack on the Rafah barracks]] shook the Egyptian military and population. Only a month into his term, President [[Mohamed Morsi]] sacked the longstanding defence minister and promoted General al Sisi to take his place. Operation Sinai was launched, aimed at eliminating armed Islamist groups, protecting the Suez Canal, and destroying the tunnel network connecting the Sinai with the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="CSS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/49906/Egypt/Politics-/UPDATED-Egyptian-troops-strike-hard-in-North-Sinai.aspx|title=UPDATED: Egyptian troops strike hard in North Sinai after multiple attacks|publisher=Al Ahram|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the operation, 32 militants and suspects were killed and 38 arrested, while 2 civilians had been killed by early September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/egypt/120908/egypt-army-kills-32-sinai-offensive-gaza|title=Egypt Army kills 32, arrests 38 more in Sinai offensive|publisher=GlobalPost|date=8 September 2012|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–2014===
Since the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|July 2013 coup]], against President Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, the Egyptian military and security services in particular have been targeted by Sinai-based violent Islamist groups. In an increase in violence security forces came under near daily attack throughout July to August 2013.

In 2013, the new authorities adopted a more aggressive strategy, leading to mass arrests and hard security measures.&lt;ref name="CSS"/&gt;
Over the few months leading to 2014, the Egyptian army gained the upper hand in the battle against militias that have found safe haven in the peninsula. After isolating and largely clearing the populated northeastern Sinai, the army put many militant factions on the defensive, most notably Ansar Bait al-Maqdis. However, one thousand armed militiamen are still sheltering in the main stronghold in Jabal Halal, as well as Jabal Amer area.&lt;ref name=wic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-new-triangle-of-egypt-israel-and-hamas|title=The New Triangle of Egypt, Israel, and Hamas|publisher=Washington Institute|date=12 January 2014|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the situation in the Sinai was thrust into the spotlight with [[October 2014 Sinai attacks|deadliest attack]] on the security forces since 2011, and the group responsible [[Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis]] pledging allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) forming the [[Sinai Province (Militant Group)|Sinai Province]].
In the wake of the attack on the security forces, the government declared state of emergency, imposing a curfew and establish a buffer zone in the Sinai's border area with Gaza.

==== May ====

=====May 2013 hostage crisis=====
On May 2013, a number of Egyptian Army police officers were taken hostage by armed tribesmen in the Sinai peninsula, with their videos released on the internet begging for their lives. As a response, Egypt's government had built up security forces in northern Sinai as part of an effort to secure the release of six policemen and a border guard kidnapped by suspected militants. On 20–21 May, Egyptian troops and police, backed by helicopter gunships, conducted a sweep through a number of villages in northern Sinai, along the border with Israel.&lt;ref name=ap21may&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/05/21/more-troops-and-equipment-arrive-in-egypt-sinai-as-hostage-crisis-continues/|title=More troops and equipment arrive in Egypt's Sinai as hostage crisis continues|date=21 May 2013|accessdate=18 July 2014|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officials said the forces came under fire from gunmen in vehicles, triggering the clashes. The clashes left one gunman dead by 21 May.&lt;ref name=ap21may/&gt; The hostages were released on 22 May after talks between the captors and Bedouins.&lt;ref name="reuters30may"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Suspect in kidnapping of Egyptian security men arrested|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/30/us-egypt-sinai-suspect-idUSBRE94T0L120130530|agency=Reuters|date=30 May 2013|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suspect in the kidnapping was arrested on 30 May 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters30may"/&gt;

==== July ====

=====July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting=====
Since President Mohamed Morsi's ouster on 3 July by Sisi, there has been an increase in violence by armed Bedouin and Islamists.&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahram5july/&gt; Attacks on security forces have been witnessed almost daily since his ouster — leading many to link the militants there to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which Morsi hails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57599074/egypt-bloodletting-rages-with-islamic-militants-killing-25-police-in-sinai-peninsula/|title=Egypt bloodletting rages with Islamic militants killing 25 police in Sinai Peninsula|publisher=CBS News|date=19 August 2013|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Egypt launched a major military operation in Sinai against the militants, bringing in two additional battalions.&lt;ref name="cracks-down"&gt;{{cite web|author=Christa Case Bryant|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2013/0812/Militants-dig-in-as-Egypt-cracks-down-on-jihadi-sandbox-in-Sinai|title=Militants dig in as Egypt cracks down on jihadi sandbox in Sinai|publisher=CSMonitor.com|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the two weeks following 3 July 39 terrorist attacks occurred in North Sinai. In the resulting clashes between armed groups and security forces, 52 gunmen and civilians and six security personnel died.&lt;ref name="18Jul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/76802/Egypt/0/Sinai,-Egypts-unsolved-problem.aspx|title=Sinai, Egypt's unsolved problem - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online|publisher=English.ahram.org.eg|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July, witnessed the highest civilian casualties, when a bus transporting workers to the army-operated Al-Arish Cement Company was attacked. Five were killed and 15 were wounded. On 16 July, attacks resulted in some of the most intense army engagement, concentrated at Al-Masa'id, Al-Joura, and the Central Security camp at Al-Ahrash.&lt;ref name="18Jul" /&gt;

Security operations have been largely confined to the 40-kilometre area between Al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, extending northward toward Rafah along the border with Israel and up to the Karam Abu Salem crossing.&lt;ref name="18Jul" /&gt; Fighting intensifies between the gunmen and the joint army-police forces at night.&lt;ref name="18Jul" /&gt; The frequency of attacks has varied from two to five in a single day. In addition, targets have expanded from fixed security checkpoints to mobile patrols. In most operations, the gunmen use four-wheel drive vehicles and combinations of light and heavy weaponry. However, in three recent attacks RPG-7 launchers were used, most likely smuggled from Libya. The G-7 grenade is capable of penetrating armoured vehicles and is generally fired at the doors.&lt;ref name="18Jul" /&gt;

On 27 July, operation dubbed "Desert Storm" was launched by the Egyptian army in North Sinai Governorate and will last for 48 hours. Two of Egypt's field armies, as well as the country's Air Force and Navy are reportedly taking part in this large-scale operation. The military are said to be blocking all the roads, bridges and tunnels leading from Northern Sinai to other provinces of Egypt.&lt;ref name="RT-DesertStorm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/egypt-army-sinai-operation-681/|title=Egypt army launches counter-extremist operation in Sinai — RT News|publisher=RT|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military spokesperson Ahmed Ali said that Egyptian security forces recent operations in Sinai, from 5 July to 23 August, resulted in: 78 suspected militants killed, including 32 foreigners; 116 people injured; and 203 people arrested, including 48 foreigners, for their alleged involvement in attacks on security checkpoints in the peninsula.

On 11 September, suicide bomber targeted Egyptian military intelligence headquarters in Rafah, bringing down the structure, at the same time a car bomb had rammed an army checkpoint. In the simultaneous attack at least nine soldiers were killed.&lt;ref name="sep11AP"/&gt;

==== December ====

==Egyptian response==
===Military tactics===
The disposition of Egyptian forces in the Sinai peninsula is mandated by the [[Camp David Accords]] and monitored by the 1,600 foreign troops that make up the [[Multinational Force and Observers]]. Egypt is permitted only enough military forces in the Sinai to enforce security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfa.gov.eg/Lists/Treaties%20DB/Attachments/645/Peace%20Treaty_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Egypt sent an additional 2,500 troops and 250 armored personnel, with helicopters as part of Operation Eagle, a mission to provide security during the power transition from then-recently fallen Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.&lt;ref name="Analysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bi-me.com/main.php?id=60104&amp;t=1|title=Analysis: Egypt, Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula|publisher=bi-me|date=17 November 2012|access-date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Eagle was joined by Operation Sinai in 2012, which came in response to a militant attack against an Egyptian border post 5 August that killed 16 border guards. Together, the two operations increased the total troop count by more than 2,500 added 80 vehicles and at least two attack helicopters. Egypt also was allowed to deploy armed fighter jets to El Arish to assist its ground forces in Sinai.&lt;ref name="Analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel approves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=280732|title=Security cabinet okays Egypt attack helicopters in Sinai|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|work=Reuters|date=9 August 2012|access-date=9 August 2012|author=Herb Keinon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's expanded force structure in Sinai is designed to deny militants sanctuary by bringing more force to bear than the municipal police alone can provide. Many of the new forces are stationed in the northeast of Sinai along the Egyptian border with Gaza. Setting up roadblocks and checkpoints to monitor and inspect traffic transiting the Sinai Peninsula to counter this smuggling.&lt;ref name="Analysis" /&gt;

In the [[October 2014 Sinai attacks|October 2014 attacks]], for the first time the militants in Sinai used suicide truck bombs to breach army roadblocks and strongpoints, then followed them with an infantry attack.

After the [[October 2014 Sinai attacks|October attacks]], the Egyptian military began using armed drones for the first time since the Sinai insurgency began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=طائرات بدون طيار تقصف مواقع التكفيريين فى سيناء|url=http://www.ahram.org.eg/News/41368/136/339106/%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A1.aspx|access-date=17 November 2014|agency=Al Ahram|date=17 November 2014|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as a measure to counter weapon and militant trafficking between Egypt and Gaza strip, the Egyptian government announced the creation of a buffer zone along the Egypt-Gaza border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt to create buffer zone along Gaza border|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/7e91f9d38cd041a4bd9209ebc9361e64/egypt-create-buffer-zone-along-gaza-border|access-date=28 October 2014|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[January 2015 Sinai attacks|attacks on army and police bases in Arish in early 2015]], the Egyptian President issued a decree to create a unified military command for the east of the Suez Canal to combat terrorism. Led by General Osama Roshdy Askar, it will guide counter-terrorism activities of the Second and Third army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sisi creates unified military command to combat terrorism in Egypt's Sinai|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/121835/Egypt/Politics-/Sisi-forms-new-military-entity-to-combat-terrorism.aspx|accessdate=1 March 2015|agency=Ahram Online|date=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2015, Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree ordering the isolation and evacuation of new areas in North Sinai's Rafah city, thus expanding the buffer zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More areas of Sinai's Rafah to be evacuated: Egypt PM|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/128818/Egypt/Politics-/More-areas-of-Sinais-Rafah-to-be-evacuated-Egypt-P.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2015|agency=MENA|publisher=Ahram Online|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shift in the militants strategy appeared in the [[July 2015 Sinai clashes|July 2015 clashes]]. Zack Gold, Middle East analyst, views the battle as a change in strategy from hit and run tactics toward an ISIL-like 'holding' of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic State affiliate claims deadly attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/11710055/Militants-launch-deadly-attacks-in-Egypts-Sinai.html|accessdate=2 July 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an effort to limit car-bombs attacks, Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree banning 4X4 vehicles in army-operations zones in Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian cabinet bans use of 4X4 vehicles in army-operations zones in Sinai|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/135217/Egypt/0/Egyptian-cabinet-bans-use-of-X-vehicles-in-armyope.aspx|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=Ahram Online|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial response===
The Egyptian government has used the death penalty to punish those convicted of committing terrorist acts in Sinai. On 26 December 2017, Egypt hanged 15 men convicted of killing nine soldiers during an attack on a military checkpoint in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/world/middleeast/egypt-execution-terrorism.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmiddleeast&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=middleeast&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront|author=Nour Youssef|title=Egypt Hangs 15 for Terrorism, Stoking Fears Among Islamists|work=The New York Times|date=26 December 2017|access-date=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2017, the Islamic State announced that it had fired rockets at Eshkol region in Israel, in response to  'Jewish aircraft' assisting Egyptian security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-sinai-rocket-attack-on-israel/|title=Islamic State claims responsibility for Sinai rocket attack on Israel|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2018, the Islamic State released a video claiming that Israeli aircraft struck civilian homes in the Sinai and showed Hebrew labels on munitions purportedly found in aftermath of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/islamic-state-claims-proof-of-israeli-airstrikes-in-northern-sinai/|title=Islamic State claims 'proof' of Israeli airstrikes in northern Sinai|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 February 2018, Lebanese [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]] reported that in the last several months, Israel had struck targets of the Islamic State in Sinai, including Palestinians who after abandoing the group's strongholds in Syria and Iraq, joined the offshoot in Sinai.

==Reactions==
===Israel===
In the two years since 2011, Israel has approved two Egyptian military increases in the Sinai Peninsula above levels set in the [[Camp David Accords]], which mandates that the Sinai must remain demilitarized, with only enough forces in Sinai to enforce security.&lt;ref name="Analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel approves"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=235499|title=Barak agrees to Egypt deploying troops, vehicles in Sinai|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel did so because it is not in its interest to have unrest in Sinai, whether political protests or militant violence.&lt;ref name="Analysis" /&gt;

However, in late 2012, concern began to be raised as Egypt began deploying more force and tanks without coordination from Israel. On 21 August, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] said that it is important for Israel to make sure that the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty is upheld, and not to remain silent as Egyptian military forces enter the Sinai. Concern was raised by Israeli officials over Egyptian failure to notify Israel about the deployment of tanks in the Sinai, which violates the peace treaty. Lieberman said, "We must make sure that every detail is upheld, otherwise we'll find ourselves in a slippery slope as far as the peace treaty is concerned."&lt;ref name="Liebs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4271499,00.html|title=Lieberman: Don't let Egypt get away with violations|publisher=Yedioth Ahronot|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=21 August 2012|author=Somfalvi, Attila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Israeli daily ''Maariv'' reported that Israel sent a message to Egypt via the [[White House]], protesting Egypt's ongoing increase in military presence in the Sinai without coordination from Israel, and telling Egypt that it must remove tanks from the Sinai because their presence violates the [[Camp David Accords|Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty]] of 1979, which states that Sinai Peninsula is to remain demilitarized. The ''Maariv'' report was echoed by an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which stated that Israel was "troubled" by the entry of Egyptian tanks into the northern Sinai Peninsula without coordination with Israel and had asked Egypt to withdraw them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kershner|first=Isabel|title=Israel Asks Egypt to Remove Tanks From Sinai|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/world/middleeast/israel-asks-egypt-to-remove-tanks-from-sinai.html?ref=middleeast|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to Egypt's military deploying tanks in the Sinai Peninsula, Israel is increasingly worried about what has long been their most critical regional relationship.&lt;ref name="NYT20120822"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|title=Developments in Iran and Sinai Deepen Israel's Worries About Egypt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/world/middleeast/israels-worries-about-egypt-deepen.html?ref=egypt&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of coordination around their deployment is seen as potentially undermining a peace treaty that has been a cornerstone of Israel's security for decades according to the New York Times.&lt;ref name="NYT20120822"/&gt; Israel is also concerned that Egypt may use Operation Eagle to build up its military presence in the Sinai, and leave the tanks and armored carriers in the Sinai while not doing much more than symbolic action to eliminate the terrorist threat.&lt;ref name="after buildup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-tells-egypt-to-remove-tanks-from-sinai/|title=After buildup, Israel tells Egypt to remove tanks from Sinai|publisher=The Times of Israel|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=21 August 2012|author=Winer, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has not issued a formal complaint, and instead prefers to resolve the issue through quiet contacts, as well as mediation from the U.S., to avoid straining its relationship with Egypt.&lt;ref name="Reuters JPost"/&gt;

On 24 August 2012, a senior Egyptian military source said that Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Israeli Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] have reached an agreement on the issue of the militarization of the Sinai. ''Al Hayat'' reported that Sissi phoned Barak and said that Egypt was committed to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel.&lt;ref name="TToI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/barak-and-egyptian-counterpart-reportedly-come-to-terms-over-sinai-offensive/|title=Barak and Egyptian counterpart reportedly come to terms over Sinai offensive|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=Davidovitch, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sissi also said that the militarization was temporary, and was needed for security and to fight terrorism. However, an Israeli defense official denied that such a conversation took place.&lt;ref name="TToIEgypt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-tells-israel-military-presence-in-sinai-is-temporary/|title=Egypt tells Israel military presence in Sinai is temporary|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=25 August 2012|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2012, Morsi said that the security operations do not threaten anyone, and "there should not be any kind of international or regional concerns at all from the presence of Egyptian security forces". Morsi added that the campaign was in "full respect to international treaties. The Egyptian-Israeli peace deal places limits on Egyptian military deployment in the Sinai. Officials in Israel were concerned about Egypt building up heavy armour in Sinai.&lt;ref name="Yedioth Mercy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4273813,00.html|title=Morsi's message to Israel: No reason for concern|newspaper=Yedioth Ahronot|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2012, an Israeli official confirmed that coordination exists between Israel and Egypt regarding Operation Eagle. Egyptian Military spokesman Ahmed Mohammed Ali had earlier announced that Egypt has been consulting with Israel regarding its security measures in the Sinai.&lt;ref name="8 september"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/weve-killed-32-criminals-and-arrested-38-in-aftermath-of-sinai-terror-attack-says-egyptian-army/|title=Egypt says it has killed 32 'criminals' and arrested 38 since Sinai terror attack|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=8 September 2012|accessdate=8 September 2012|author=Shmulovich, Michal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2015, one day after the attacks on 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUZCbCHqbBk|title=معركة الثأر (مترجم إلى اللغة الإنجليزية)    Sinai against terrorism - YouTube|date=5 July 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egyptian Army]] checkpoints, Israel announced that it was giving [[Egypt]] a "free hand to operate in northern [[Sinai]] against local jihadist groups, voluntarily ignoring an annex to the 1979 Camp David Peace Accords banning the presence of significant Egyptian forces in the area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-has-given-egyptian-army-free-hand-in-sinai-official-says/|title=Israel giving Egyptian army free hand in Sinai, official says|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-IDF-to-okay-bolstered-Egyptian-forces-in-Sinai-after-deadly-attacks-407738|title=Report: IDF to okay bolstered Egyptian forces in Sinai after deadly attacks|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] sent condolences to Egypt for the terrorist attacks that rocked that country on 1 July. He further stated that "we are together with Egypt and many other states in the Middle East and the world in the struggle against extreme Islamic terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Netanyahu-We-are-partners-with-Egypt-in-the-fight-against-ISIS-that-has-reached-our-borders-407711|title=Benjamin Netanyahu: We are partners with Egypt in the fight against ISIS that has reached our borders - Arab-Israeli Conflict - Jerusalem Post|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to [[CNN]], in a move to increase security in the Sinai, help Morsi, and reassure Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary [[Leon Panetta]] offered Egypt classified intelligence-sharing capabilities to help Egypt identify military threats in the area, which he discussed during his recent trips to Egypt and Israel.  The technology has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify vehicles at great distances. The technology may also be used by the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. The United States is also offering increased intelligence sharing, including satellite imagery and drone flights, as well as cellphone intercepts and other communications among militants suspected of plotting attacks.&lt;ref name="Israel Hayom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5491|title=CNN: US offers Egyptian army intelligence aid for Sinai battles|publisher=Israel Hayom|work=Israel Hayom; Reuters|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2012, the [[State Department]] urged Egypt to be transparent over Operation Eagle and any security operations in the Sinai.  The State Department said that the United States supports Operation Eagle against terrorism, but stressed that Egypt must continue coordination with Israel regarding these operations and military increases in the Sinai, according to the 1979 [[Camp David Accords]].&lt;ref name="Times Wash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-state-department-urges-egyptian-transparency-over-sinai/|title=Washington calls for Egyptian transparency amid military buildup in Sinai|publisher=The Times of Israel|date=22 August 2012|accessdate=23 August 2012|author1=Winer, Stuart |author2=Ben Zion, Ilan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department also called on Egypt to fulfill its obligations under the 1979 [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty]] and deal strongly with security threats in the Sinai, while ensuring that "lines of communication stay open."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US urges Egypt to retake control of Sinai|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=282253|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2012, [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], speaking with Egyptian Foreign Minister [[Mohamed Kamel Amr]], urged Amr to maintain lines of communication with Israel, and emphasized the importance of being transparent over the militarization of the Sinai.&lt;ref name="Reuters JPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=282405|title=Clinton urges Egypt, Israel to talk on Sinai|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|work=Reuters|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=23 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823220456/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=282405|archivedate=23 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai===
The [[Multinational Force and Observers]] in Sinai, a 1,650-strong international organization created in 1979 during the Camp David Accords with peacekeeping responsibilities, kept a low profile during the intensification of Operation Eagle in 2012. A representative for the organization said that "we are unable to respond to queries from the media at this time" in response to whether Egypt asked permission to move weaponry into the Sinai, and whether Israel granted it.&lt;ref name="Multinational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=282083|title=Int'l force in Sinai quiet amid concern of Egypt violations|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=21 August 2012|author=Keinon, Herb|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821215113/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=282083|archivedate=21 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
The [[Arab Gas Pipeline|Egyptian pipeline]] carrying natural gas to Jordan has been attacked at least 15 times since the start of the uprising in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/22/us-egypt-pipeline-idUSBRE86L00T20120722|title=Blast rocks Egypt's gas pipeline to Israel, Jordan|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of Egyptian gas hit Jordan budget severely (by JD 1.4 billion or the equivalent of USD 2 billion yearly for the past two years) and they are looking for Egypt to compensate for the lost quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/jordan-interview-alaa-batayneh|title=His Excellency Mr. Alaa Batayneh on Jordan's path towards energy independence|publisher=Naturalgaseurope.com|date=16 May 2013|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skopje Fest''' ({{lang-mk|Скопје Фест}}) or '''Festival na zabavni melodii Skopje''' (Фестивал на забавни мелодии Скопје) is one of the main musical events in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

SkopjeFest began in 1968 in the Universal Hall in [[Skopje]], and continued until 1980. In this short time, the festival became one of the biggest music events in [[Yugoslavia]]. Skopjefest was the place where famous Macedonian singers such as [[Slave Dimitrov]], Zafir Hadzimanov, Nina Spirova made their performances together with eminent [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] performers. Audiences enjoyed over 50 songs.

After Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from [[Yugoslavia]], SkopjeFest was revived in 1994, and has since taken over from [[MakFest]] as Macedonia's premier music festival.

The show involves some of Macedonia's finest performers, singing original tracks submitted to MRT (Makedonska Radio Televizija), usually accompanied by the orchestra of MRT (excluding some of its latest editions).

It has also been used as the Macedonian national selections for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], since the late 1990s. The first Macedonian representative in Eurovision, was Macedonian singer [[Vlado Janevski]] who won SkopjeFest 1998 with the song "Ne Zori Zoro", for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]]. This was Macedonia's first participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Ever since, SkopjeFest has been shadowed by many controversial debates regarding the strategies behind the song selections and the lack of transparence concerning the winner. Such allegations are not new to this contest. However, they intensified as the Eurovision participation became a factor. After the decision to make SkopjeFest the National Pre-Selection round for Macedonia's representative to Eurovision, the traditional point award ceremony was eliminated and replaced by the controversial announcement of only the Top 3 places. Neither the points of the jury nor the televoting results are made public.

Up until 2002, SkopjeFest used to be the biggest musical activity in the country. However, it faced financial problems. In 2003, the festival wasn't held in order to save money for the next year when Macedonia was going to particate in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. In the meantime, MRT made new criteria for the national selection for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], the festival returned in 2004 only to celebrate the 60th anniversary of MRT. After that, financial problems increased and it wasn't organised until 2008, again as an ESC national final.

After the first details about selecting the Macedonian participant for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] were revealed, it was announced that Skopje Fest will continue being held as an independent event without being involved in the Macedonian selection process for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Миленковска|first=В.|title=Калиопи на Евросонг, Скопски фестивал во ноември|url=http://vest.com.mk/?ItemID=87C721F6A5784F49933D6F805AA62C17|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=Вест|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2014, it was announced that Skopje Fest will return as the Macedonian national final for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]].&lt;ref name="Macedonia 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=FYR Macedonia: 2015 Participation Is Confirmed|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/07/15/fyr-macedonia-2015-participation-is-confirmed/|publisher=Eurovoix|last=Granger|first=Anthony|accessdate=15 July 2014|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Slow Train to Izmir''''' is a 2002 play written by [[Mark Angus]]. It has been performed at the [[Southwark Playhouse]], where it was directed by [[Maggie Zolinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slow Train to Izmir|url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/play/slow-train-to-izmir/L01671530417/|website=UK Theatre Web|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play is based on a true story ([[Dorak affair]]) and focuses on the Anglo-Dutch archaeologist [[James Mellaart]]. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was accused of, in turn, stealing an invaluable collection of Neolithic artefacts found near [[Dorak]] in Turkey and, ultimately, of fabricating their entire existence. The play deals with attempts by the Turkish press both to recover the treasure and to expose Mellaart and the western archaeology 'industry' as corrupt. The city mentioned in the title is [[İzmir]], Turkey.

The premier at the Southwark Playhouse starred Robert Bowman, Jane Allighan, Anna-Marie Wayne and [[Paul Croft]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">The '''SoFFin''' (Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung - Special Financial Market Stabilization Funds) is a program of the German government with the purpose to stabilize and restore confidence in the financial system. It was created in the middle of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] on October 17, 2008 by the German Parliament and enacted on October 20, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,583739,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
As of December 31, 2010 it stopped offering new services but continued managing existing guarantees.

In November 2011, it was announced that it would be revived for potential new issues if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-14/germany-to-reactivate-soffin-bank-rescue-fund-asmussen-says.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially it was established as an agency at the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] and was supervised by the federal ministry of finance. The fund was managed by Dr. Hannes Rehm (speaker), Dr. Christopher Pleister and Gerhard Strattthaus.
Operations were conducted through three tasks

* Providing Liquidity by means of guarantees for specially issued debt by eligible financial institutions
* Investing in Equity (recapitalization)
* Purchasing securities in [[open market operation]]s

The SoFFin may grant guarantees of up to 400bn euros and recapitalize or purchase assets for an additional 80bn euros.

In January 2011 the SoFFin was reorganized under the then created German Agency for the Stabilization of the Financial Markets

The '''Theatre Royal''' in Manchester, England, opened in 1845. Situated next to the [[Free Trade Hall]], it is the oldest surviving theatre in Manchester.&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ManchesterEveningNews20111103"/&gt; It was commissioned by Mancunian businessman [[John Knowles (Manchester)|John Knowles]] who wanted a theatre venue in the city.

The Theatre Royal operated as a theatre from 1845 until 1921, when it closed in the face of growing competition from the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]] and [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]]. The building has since been converted numerous times for use as a cinema, bingo hall and nightclub. It has been unoccupied since 2009.

==Architecture==
The theatre, which stands on an island site on the south side of Peter Street, is constructed in [[sandstone]] [[ashlar]].  It is in two storeys, with an attic, and is in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style.  Around the building, between the upper storey and the attic, is a modillioned [[cornice]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1246667|desc= Royale Club, Manchester|accessdate= 26 September 2010|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its entrance front facing Peter Street is symmetrical with three [[bay (architecture)|bays]], the central bay being wider than the lateral bays.  The central bay is in the form of a [[portico]], with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns and [[pilaster]]s.  Its [[entablature]] contains a central semicircular arch breaking through to the [[gable]].  Steps lead up to entrances in each bay.  Above the central entrance is a [[pediment]]ed [[niche (architecture)|niche]] containing a statue of [[William Shakespeare]], which is based on the statue by [[Peter Scheemakers]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].  The lateral bays contain windows with balconies in the upper storey.{{sfn|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=322}}  Along the sides of the theatre are alternating rectangular windows and panels, with a blank semicircular arch above each window.  The interior of the theatre has been altered, but retains its 1875 gallery.  The theatre was designated as a Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[listed building]] on 3&amp;nbsp;October 1974.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  The authors of the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series describe it as a "splendid classical composition in stone, one of the best examples of theatre architecture surviving anywhere in England from the first half of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century".{{sfn|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=322}} The [[Theatres Trust]] described it as "unique and architecturally significant", with the façade being "one of the finest examples of theatre architecture to have survived in Britain from the first half of the nineteenth century", stating that it influenced the design of the [[Royal Opera House, London]].&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

==Use as a Theatre==
Manchester appears to have two previous Theatre Royals before the current building was constructed in 1845. The first opened in [[Spring Gardens, Manchester|Spring Gardens]] on 5 June 1775 and operated on that site until the expiration of the proprietors' lease in 1807.&lt;ref name=Collectanea&gt;{{citation |title=Collectanea relating to Manchester and its neighbourhood, at various periods |volume=2 |year=1867 |publisher=[[Chetham Society]] |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acI4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Theatre Royal opened in Fountain Street on 12 July 1807 and was destroyed by fire on 7 March 1844.&lt;ref name=Collectanea/&gt; John Knowles took over the management of this second Theatre Royal some time before the fire, at a time when the [[theatre]] in Manchester was at its lowest ebb.&lt;ref&gt;'Index to the report from the Select Committee on Theatrical Licenses and Regulations', 1866, House of Commons Parliamentary Papers, vol. XVI.1, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles set up a strong [[Stock company (acting)|stock company]] and proved himself a very capable, though somewhat authoritarian, [[theatre manager]]. However, following the 1844 fire the proprietors of the theatre in Fountain Street refused to rebuild it.

At a public dinner in his honour in July 1844, Knowles was presented a plate "in acknowledgement of his energetic and successful efforts to revive national drama in Manchester".&lt;ref name="John Knowles 1844, p. 5"&gt;'Dinner to John Knowles, Jun, Esq', ''The Manchester Guardian'', 17 July 1844, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles told the gathering that if they could get no one else to build a theatre then he would do it himself. As a result, Knowles bought the [[patent rights]] and set about finding a site for the new theatre.{{sfn|Manchester Central Library|1979|p=18}} Knowles had always been an admirer of theatrical performances and he was anxious to see their renovation in this, his native town. He desired to see the revival of the legitimate drama, and the plays represented in a manner duly worthy of them.&lt;ref name="John Knowles 1844, p. 5"/&gt;

[[Image:(Former) Theatre Royal and (Former) Free Trade Hall, Manchester.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre Royal front facade on the left with the [[Free Trade Hall]].]]
Knowles found a new site for his theatre on Peter Street. He demolished the Wellington Inn and Brogden's Horse Bazaar.{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=87}}  Knowles employed Francis Chester and John Gould Irwin as the [[architect]]s for his new theatre.{{sfn|Rudyard|Wyke|1994|p=57}}  In preparation for the building of the new Theatre Royal, Knowles and Chester went to London and visited most of the metropolitan theatres, noting their areas, internal forms, [[Acoustics|acoustic capabilities]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;'The New Theatre Royal, Peter-Street', ''The Manchester Guardian'', 2 October 1844, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  With a cost of £23,000, the new Theatre Royal opened to an audience of 2,500.{{sfn|Manchester Central Library|1979|p=19}}  Precautionary measures against fire were taken by placing a [[Water tank|tank]] on the roof capable of holding 20,000&amp;nbsp;gallons of water, which was connected by pipes to the stage and the [[green room]]. Its programme that night included [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber's]] ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' overture, [[Douglas Jerrold]]'s "Time works wonders" and an elaborate [[ballet]] spectacle "The Court Ball in 1740". Knowles's schedule of productions was intensive&amp;nbsp;– in one season there were 157 performances at which two and sometimes three plays were performed. The popularity of the theatre grew. [[Charles Dickens]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] and [[George Cruikshank|George Cruickshank]]{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=87}} were amongst notable people who appeared at the theatre. The theatre was dedicated to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and Knowles installed a [[Carrara marble]] statue of the playwright above the entrance. It was Manchester's finest outdoor statue.{{sfn|Rudyard|Wyke|1994|p=57}} In 1875, after years of success, Knowles severed his connections with the theatre, disposing of it to a [[limited company]] for £50,000.{{sfn|Manchester Central Library|1979|p=19}}

==Later use==
In 1921 the theatre was converted to a [[Movie theater|cinema]] due to competition from the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester]] and the [[Manchester Opera House]]. In 1972 the theatre became a [[bingo hall]], then a [[nightclub]] in 1978,&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt; at which point various lighting bridges and rigs were added.&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org" /&gt; It was known successively as the "Discotheque Royale", Infinity then M2 and finally a rename and rebrand to Coliseum due to the trouble caused by the clientele it attracted. The nightclub closed in 2009.&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

In 2008 a {{convert|118|m|ft|abbr=on}} 28-storey office and retail tower was proposed, called "Theatre Royal Tower", that would be connected to the back of the original theatre. It was designed by [[Stephenson Bell]] with [[The Benmore Group]] as the developer.&lt;ref name="skyscraper" /&gt;

It was announced in 2011 by owners Benmore that the Theatre Royal would receive a £2&amp;nbsp;million refurbishment to convert the building into a live music venue.&lt;ref name="ManchesterEveningNews20111103"&gt;{{cite news |title=Theatre Royal to become live music venue&amp;nbsp;– with £2m refurb |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1463880_theatre-royal-to-become-live-music-venue---with-2m-refurb |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to convert the building into a hotel and live music venue never came about.&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

Despite the promise of investment, Benmore sold the building in November 2012.&lt;ref name="MC_21Nov12" /&gt; It was purchased by the [[Edwardian Group]], who owned the [[Radisson Blu]] Edwardian hotel adjacent to the theatre in the [[Free Trade Hall]].&lt;ref name="MEN_20Nov12" /&gt; The building could potentially be restored as a theatre or banqueting hall as a complimentary extension for the hotel.&lt;ref name="MC_21Nov12" /&gt;

{{Asof|December 2016}} the building remains unused, with the Edwardian Group carrying out feasibility studies for the building. [[Theatres Trust]] has placed the building on its "Theatre Buildings At Risk" reigster.&lt;ref name="MEN_8Dec16" /&gt;

The 1845 exterior façade is virtually intact,&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org" /&gt; and the building retains the balcony from 1875.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Theatres Trust]] has said that the internal conversions for its past usage in various guises appear to have obscured&amp;nbsp;– rather than destroyed&amp;nbsp; – the interior. The Trust classify the original interior work as "restorable as a theatre".&lt;ref name="theatrestrust.org" /&gt;

'''Triplemanía II-C''' was a major ''[[lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]] event [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA) that took place at the ''[[Plaza de Toros Monumental de Tijuana|El Toreo]]'' [[bullfighting]] arena in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]] on May 27, 1994. The show was the final of three Triplemanía II shows held in 1994, preceded by [[Triplemanía II-A]] in April and [[Triplemanía II-B]] held 12 days prior. 1994 was the first year AAA held multiple Triplemanía shows in a year, a tradition they would continue through 1997, after which Triplemanía became a single annual event. The annual Triplemanía show(s) are AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of [[WrestleMania]] or their [[Super Bowl]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The May 27th show was the fourth overall show produced under the Triplemanía banner.

The main event match was the culmination of a storyline that AAA had been building for a year, starting at the previous year's [[Triplemanía I]] show. Portraying the [[archetype]]s of "good" and "evil' AAA had created a storyine where the "hero" [[Konnan]] sought revenge against the "villain" [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]]. The two faced off in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, which is considered the ultimate "feud settler" in ''Lucha Libre''. For the match both competitors bet their hair on the outcome of the match, with the loser being subjected to the humiliation of being shaved bald in the center of the ring.  The show also featured a [[steel cage match]] between ''[[Capos (professional wrestling)|Los Hermanos Dinamita]]'' (Spanish for "The Dynamite Brothers"; [[Cien Caras]], [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]]) fighting ''[[Los Payasos]]'' ("The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) in a rematch from [[Triplemanía II-A]] where ''Los Payasos'' won the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] from ''Los Hermanos Dinamita''. The show was also supposed to feature a match for the [[Mexican National Middleweight Championship]] but the reigning champion [[Octagón]] was not medically cleared to wrestle.

==Production==

===Background===
AAA founder [[Antonio Peña]] had originally envisioned the [[Triplemanía]] series as three shows held over the summer, but for the first year AAA only held 1 show, [[Triplemanía I]]. In 1994 AAA announced that they would hold three Triplemanía shows, building the storylines into its climax at the third and final Triplemanía II show. The first show, [[Triplemanía II-A]] , took place in the outdoor baseball stadium in [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes]] on April 26, the second show, [[Triplemanía II-B]], was held at the [[Estadio Olímpico Benito Juárez]] in [[Zapopan, Jalisco]] on May 15 and the third and final Triplemanía II show, Triplemanía II-C,  would happen at the ''[[Plaza de Toros Monumental de Tijuana|El Toro]]'' [[bullfighting]] arena in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]] on May 27, 1994.&lt;ref name="Trip2C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-a | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2B"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-b | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The main event match would be the conclusion of the main storyline of AAA at the time as Peña and the AAA officials had spent over a year laying out the storyline between [[Konnan]] and [[Jake Roberts|Jake "the Snake" Roberts]]. The foundation of the story began a year prior to Triplemanía II-C, at the first ever [[Triplemanía I]], held on April 30, 1993. To start the storyline Roberts was given a spot in the front row, presented as if he had bought a ticket on his own and was just there to watch the show.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1993&gt;{{cite news|title=1993 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2214|date=January 7, 1994|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main event was a "Retirement match" between Konnan and [[Cien Caras]] where the loser would be forced to retire, which saw Jake Roberts become involved in the match, arguing with Konnan during the second fall and actually distracted him enough to get counted out.&lt;ref name="Trip1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#i | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the loss Konnan was forced to retire and due to his actions Roberts became the top ''rudo'' of AAA as he was seen as directly responsible for the popular Konnan being forced to retire. For several months AAA booked Roberts in only special appearances, not actually wrestling but making appearances to remind people of what he did to Konnan. After about four months Konnan returned to AAA and together with Peña supposedly petitioned the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission to get Konnan reinstated. The storyline explanation given was that he was allowed to return to wrestling due to Roberts' interference in the match. AAA built their August 28, 1993 ''La Revencha'' show in the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] around Konnan finally getting in the ring with Robets, in a three-way elimination match that also included Cien Caras. Konnan forced Cien Caras to submit, gaining a measure of revenge from their Triplemanía match. Later on Jake "the Snake" Roberts got himself disqualified when ''[[Los Gringos Locos]]''  ([[Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Art Barr|Love Machine]]) interfered in the match.&lt;ref name=YIR1993/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/la.html#0893 | title=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Sports Arena August 1993 | date=August 28, 1993 | accessdate=July 12, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 1993 Jake Roberts and ''Los Gringos Locos'' defeated Konnan, [[Blue Panther]] and [[Perro Aguayo]] in the main event of AAA"s ''La Lucha del Honor'' event at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. During the match Roberts pinned Konnan in both the second and the third fall.&lt;ref name=YIR1993/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/la.html#1193 | title=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Sports Arena November 1993 | date=November 12, 1993 | accessdate=July 12, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of Peña booking strategy was to not have the two rivals fight one-on-one right away, building the anticipation to when they finally get in the ring for their first singles match. Roberts kept the advantage, using his partnership with ''Los Gringos Locos'' to have the numbers advantage. AAA kept the two apart until March 12, 1994 where the two finally faced off. They met in a [[steel cage match]] to even the numbers in the main event of AAA's spring Los Angeles Sports Arena show. During the show Konnan finally gained a measure of revenge on Roberts, winning the match by climbing out of the cage, but still had not pinned Roberts.&lt;ref name=YIR1994/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/la.html#0394 | title=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Sports Arena March 1994 | date=March 12, 1994 | accessdate=July 12, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss to Konnan was used as the impetus to Roberts finally agreeing to put his hair on the line in a ''[[Lucha de Apuesta]]'', or "bet match", which was the ultimate end game for the storyline. The match was scheduled to be the main event of the third Triplemanía II show, with a preview of it taking place at Triplemanía II-B where Konnan, [[Perro Aguayo]] and Cien Caras defeated Jake Roberts, Love Machine and [[Miguel Pérez Jr.]] in the main event.&lt;ref name="Trip2B"/&gt;

==Event==
The fifth match of the night, a match that was supposed to see [[Octagón]] defend his [[Mexican National Middleweight Championship]] against [[Blue Panther]]. A few days prior to the match Octagón was involved in a car accident, suffering a hand injury. The wrestling boxing commission could not medically clear Octagón to wrestle on the show. Instead he came to the ring with the championship and handed it over to Blue Panther via forfeit, only asking for a rematch once he had recovered from his injury.&lt;ref name="Trip2C"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=MexMiddleMag&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales|work=Lucha 2000|id=Especial 21|date=2004-12-20|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Roberts would remain with AAA for several months after losing all his hair, he ended up turning on ''Los Gringos Locos'' and actually teamed up with Konnan only a few months later. defeating the team of Perro Aguayo and [[Vampiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/la.html#0894 | title=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Sports Arena August 1994 | date=August 6, 1994 | accessdate=July 12, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Gringos Locos]]'' storyline carried AAA into their subsequent major shows "Night of Champions" and later on their first ever [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[AAA When Worlds Collide]] that was driven by the feud between ''a Pareja del Terror'' (Eddy Guerrero and Love Machine) facing off against El Hijo del Santo and Octagón in a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match where Guerrero and Love Machine ended up losing their hair.&lt;ref name="AlmanacWorlds"&gt;{{cite news|title=Historical Cards|work=PWI Presents: 2007 Wrestling Almanak and book of facts|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=2007 Edition|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 days afterwards Love Machine, real name Art Barr, dies of unknown causes.&lt;ref name=BarrRemembered&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/WrestlingStarBios/barr_art.html |title=Art Barr: What could have been; Looking back at Love Machine's career|last=Molinaro|first=John|accessdate=2008-10-12|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Konnan in the wake of his victory over Jake Robers made his turn to the ''rudo'' side months later ever more shocking, with Konnan attacking his longtime friend Perro Aguayo during a match and joining ''Los Gringos Locos'' instead.&lt;ref name=AAAOficial&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/historia/when-worlds-collide.html | title= El evento que comenzo la revolucion mundial | publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] | accessdate=June 27, 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At "When Worlds Collide" Aguayo defeated Konnan in a [[steel cage match]].&lt;ref name="AlmanacWorlds"/&gt;

Once Octagón had recovered from his hand injury he received a rematch for the championship he never lost in the ring, but on August 4, 1994 Blue Panther successfully defended the title against Octagón.&lt;ref name="MexMiddleMag"/&gt;

==Reception==
John Molinario, who writes about wrestling for the [[Canadian Online Explorer]], described the show as a "booking masterpiece by Pena" and that it established Antonio Peña as "the best booker in the business."&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling commentator [[Mike Tenay]], who was in attendance that night, recalled "the great heat for that main event match".&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">The '''Umm Hajul controversy''' was one of many cases of fratricide committed during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. After [[United States|American]] forces accidentally opened fire on their own men, a [[cover-up]] was attempted. A plot element of the movie ''[[Courage Under Fire]]'' was based on this particular incident.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Incident==
In the predawn hours of February 27, 1991, an armored personnel carrier of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] broke down near the airfield of Umm Hajul. The five operators of the vehicle, U.S. Army engineers, found themselves stranded in the desert when [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]] tank and [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] units of the [[3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment]] approached from the north. Specialist Craig Walker tried signaling to the approaching forces by switching his [[night vision goggles]] on and off. The armored cavalry troop had been told the airfield was defended by 500+ Iraqi soldiers, and to expect stiff resistance.  The troop commander fired warning shots in the air after requesting permission to do so from his squadron commander.  Some of the cavalry troopers saw returned fire, but whether this came from the engineers is doubtful.  The cavalry troop vehicles opened fire on the engineers with high-explosive rounds, mistaking their vehicle for an enemy position. The result of the high-explosive rounds set off demolition charges within the engineers' armored personnel carrier. The situation progressed for about seven minutes, with the troop commander calling cease fire after two volleys, thinking the "enemy forces" were contained and waiting for them to surrender. The squadron commander then arrived on the scene in his [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] and opened fire when he thought one of the engineers (still believed to be Iraqis) was trying to escape. When the shooting was over, one engineer was wounded and another, Corporal Lance Fielder of Tennessee, was dead from [[coaxial]] [[machinegun]] fire.

==Coverup==
Shortly after the incident, false reports were filed, stating that the 3rd Cavalry took an estimated 50 Iraqi prisoners in the assault. Three [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Stars]] were awarded on the basis of misleading statements and representations, as well.&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/os95010.pdf United States Government Accountability Office Report, page 92]&lt;/ref&gt;  The squadron commander was the son-in-law of a famous Vietnam-era general, and his brothers-in-law were also general officers. He did not face repercussions and was selected for promotion to colonel.  Both the cavalry troop commander and the lieutenant in charge of the engineers at the airfield were given career-ending evaluations and forced out of the Army.  This was particularly ironic, since the lieutenant was completely not culpable. Many discrepancies uncovered in three army investigations were overlooked or ignored, and several lower-ranking soldiers and officers were threatened or coerced into remaining silent.

==Investigation==
U.S. Senator [[Fred Thompson]] of Tennessee initiated a Congressional investigation into this incident, in which Corporal Lance Fielder of Nashville, Tennessee had died. The investigation resulted in the forced retirement of the squadron commander of the unit that fired shots at Fielder and others, his reduction in rank to major, and revocation of medals.&lt;ref name="Lawrimore"&gt;Lawrimore, Erin.

'''World Youth Day 1985''' was a meeting on the occasion of the [[International Youth Year]] held in [[Rome]] on March 30th and 31st 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/gmg/years/gmg_1986_po.html|title=I Jornada Mundial da Juventude 1986|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;and it was the second great international meeting promoted by the [[Catholic Church]] and later named [[World Youth Day]]. This was considered the birth of these events, which would begin to be called of this way on the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antsj.org/antillas/?p=872|title=Nuncio Apostólico presidirá celebración de la Jornada Mundial de la Juventud 2014 – Jesuitas|website=www.antsj.org|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[World Youth Day 1984|Youth Jubilee]] celebrated in Rome the year before on the occasion of the [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Holy Year]], [[Pope John Paul II]] organized a youth gathering for [[Palm Sunday]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1985/03/26/150-mila-giovani-dal-papa-per-la.html?ref=search|title=150 MILA GIOVANI DAL PAPA PER LA FESTA DELLE PALME - la Repubblica.it|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the International Youth Year proclaimed by the [[United Nations|UN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/es/events/youthday/background.shtml|title=Día Internacional de la Juventud, 12 de agosto|website=www.un.org|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/Colonia2005/rc_pc_laity_doc_20030805_cross-history-gmg_sp.html|title=JMJ 2005 - La peregrinación de la Cruz de los Jóvenes (1984-2014)|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the event==
Before the young people arrived in Rome, the Pope issued on December 8, 1984, a message for the World Day of Peace devoted to the young. Then John Paul II invited the youth to [[Palm Sunday]] to Rome for the World Youth Meeting. The Pope chose Palm Sunday as the date of the meeting because in the previous year, just on Palm Sunday, the [[Catholic Church]] celebrated the Jubilee of the Youth, celebrated on the occasion of the Holy Year 1983/1984 (1950 anniversary of the death and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]]).

==The program==
===Saturday 30 March===
The Pope met the young Catholics for the first time in [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]] at 5:00 pm. The slogan of this great meeting were the words: May you know how to realize the hope that is in you ([[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 3:15).

During this meeting the [[Ecclesiastical letter|apostolic letter]] "To the young people of the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/es/apost_letters/1985/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_31031985_dilecti-amici.html|title=Dilecti Amici, a los jóvenes del mundo con ocasión del Año internacional de la juventud (31 de marzo de 1985) - Juan Pablo II|website=w2.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, written by the Pope for the occasion, was presented firstly to those present. During the following night, there was the possibility for young people to watch in [[Eucharistic adoration|eucharistic adoration]] at some churches in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1985/03/31/un-terzo-millennio-di-pace-vogliamo-grano.html?ref=search|title='UN TERZO MILLENNIO DI PACE VOGLIAMO GRANO, NON CANNONI' - la Repubblica.it|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunday, March 31===
The following morning, starting at 6:00 WYJ participants formed three parades, which joined at [[Via della Conciliazione]] to reach [[St. Peter's Square]] together - where the final [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] would be celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://agensir.it/chiesa/2016/03/18/trentuno-anni-di-gmg-una-chiesa-amica-dei-giovani/|title=Trentuno anni di Gmg, una Chiesa amica dei giovani - AgenSIR|date=18 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The sources attest in the morning the presence of about 250,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211155616/http://www.wjt2005.de/index.php@id=161&amp;si=4.htm|title=Sito web ufficiale della XX GMG 2005: Storia delle Giornate Mondiali della Gioventù|date=11 December 2007|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aciprensa.com/jornadas/jmj2005/historia.php|title=XX Jornada Mundial de la Juventud 2005 :: ACI Prensa|website=www.aciprensa.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;/ 300,000

Young people from [[Alaska]], [[Lebanon]] were also present in Rome, as also from [[Africa]] and the [[Far East]]. Also noteworthy are the presence of other [[Christianity|Christian confessions]] (especially [[England|English]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]]), and even non-Christians (including four hundred [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1985/03/30/centocinquantamila-giovani-per-le-strade-di-roma.html?ref=search|title=CENTOCINQUANTAMILA GIOVANI PER LE STRADE DI ROMA IN NOME DEL PAPA E DE - la Repubblica.it|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
Although it is not a real WYJ (it is considered a sort of "zero edition"), this meeting has some traits that will characterize all future international events of WYD: for example, participants are given a "pilgrim's bag" and a cap with the logo of the day; for hospitality to pilgrims a network of accommodation facilities in the area is activated; an anthem is composed for the occasion.

==The anthem==
The song "Resta qui com noi" by the musical group Gen Rosso (texts by V. Ciprì and music by B. Enderle) was composed for the gathering and inaugurated the tradition of adopting an official anthem for each World Youth Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genrosso.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=98&amp;lang=en|title=Gen Rosso|website=www.genrosso.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goyaproducciones.com/blog/historia-e-himnos-de-la-jornada-mundial-de-la-juventud-jmj/|title=goyaproducciones.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The establishment of WYDs==
Given the success of the day, the Pope on next December 20 officially proclaimed the establishment of the [[World Youth Day|World Youth Days]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/gmg/documents/gmg_chronicle-wyd_20020325_sp.html|title=EL CAMINO DE LAS JORNADAS MUNDIALES DE LA JUVENTUD|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which will be held every year in all the [[Diocese|dioceses]] of the world on Palm Sunday (in 1986 it would be called the alternation on two-year cycle diocesan editions and world editions in a city selected by the
[[Pontifical Council for the Laity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/sociedad/abci-elige-ciudad-jornada-mundial-juventud-puja-discreta-entre-paises-201608011414_noticia.html|title=Así se elige la ciudad de la Jornada Mundial de la Juventud: una puja discreta entre países|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/laity_sp/pubblicazioni/rc_pc_laity_doc_20050101_notiziario-11-pc-laici_sp.html|title=Pontificio Consejo para los Laicos|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
