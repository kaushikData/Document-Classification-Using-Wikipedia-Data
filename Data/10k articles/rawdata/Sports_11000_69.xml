*[[Maegashira]] [[Takahanada]] wins his first ''[[makuuchi]]'' ''[[yusho]]'' with a 14-1 record, the youngest ever to do so. He wins all three [[Sanshō (sumo)|special prizes]] for Technique, Outstanding Performance and Fighting Spirit. Runner-up is [[Akebono Taro|Akebono]] on 13-2, who shares the Outstanding Performance and Fighting Spirit prizes. ''[[Ōzeki|Ozeki]]'' [[Konishiki]], who won the previous tournament in November 1991 and is aiming for ''yokozuna'' promotion, can only manage third place with a 12-3 score. Takahanada's brother [[Wakahanada]] shares the Technique prize. [[Toyonoumi]] wins the ''[[juryo]]'' division championship. Veteran former ''[[komusubi]]'' [[Tamaryu]] retires.

*Konishiki and his new wife, a fashion model, hold a wedding reception in Tokyo.  

===March===
*Konishiki wins his third career championship with a 13-2 record, but is not promoted to ''yokozuna''. The chairman of the [[Yokozuna Deliberation Council]], Hideo Ueda says, "We want to make doubly sure that Konishiki is worthy to be a grand champion. Therefore, we decided to wait for another tournament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1992/05/18/126516/meat-bomb-konishiki-the-quarter-ton-sumo-wrestler-from-hawaii-has-set-off-an-explosion-of-new-interest----and-controversy----in-the-hidebound-national-sport-of-japan|title=Meat Bomb: Konishiki, the quarter-ton sumo wrestler from Hawaii, has set off an explosion of new interest—and controversy—in the hidebound national sport of Japan|date=18 May 1992|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April===

*Akebono wins the championship with a 13-2 record and is promoted to ''ozeki''. He also receives the Outstanding Performance award. Konishiki can manage only a 9-6 record, meaning he is no longer on a  ''yokozuna'' promotion run and must start over. The runner-up is Wakahanada on 11-4, who wins his third Technique Award. Veteran [[Misugisato]] wins his first (and only) special prize in his career, for Fighting Spirit.

Former ''maegashira'' [[Wakasegawa]] retires.

===September===

His closest challengers are two maegashira, [[Kotonishiki]] and [[Daishoho]], both on 11-4. Daishoho shares the Fighting Spirit prize with [[Kyokudozan]], who gets a [[kachi-koshi|winning record]] in his komusubi debut. [[Kotobeppu]] wins the juryo championship, while 28 year old ex-teacher and amateur champion [[Tomonohana|Narimatsu]] wins the makushita championship.

'''The 1993 Summer Deaflympics''' officially known as the '''17th Summer Deaflympics''' is an international multi-sport event that was held from 24 July 1993 to 2 August 1993. The event was hosted by [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deaflympics.com/games.asp?1993-s|title=Games {{!}}1993 Summer Deaflympics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.deaflympics.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 50 nations participated in the multi-sporting event and this was also the first instance where more than 50 nations competed in a single Deaflympic event. The Summer Games included 12 different sports.

Sofia was selected to host the Deaflympic event for the first time and after 20 years, the city went onto host the Summer Deaflympics competition in [[2013 Summer Deaflympics|2013]]. In fact, [[Sofia]] became only the second city in the world to have hosted the Summer Deaflympics event twice after [[Copenhagen]].

The '''2012 Trading Post Perth Challenge''' was a motor racing event for the Australian sedan-based [[V8 Supercars]]. It was the fourth event of the [[2012 International V8 Supercars Championship]], featuring Races 7, 8 &amp; 9. The unusual three race format is a staple of the Barbagallo Raceway event, in part caused by the different timezone of Western Australia compared to eastern states. It was held on the weekend of 4–6 May at the [[Barbagallo Raceway]], in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]]. It was also the first time the series utilised the new pitlane on the infield of the circuit as opposed to the original one on the outside of the circuit.

The meeting saw a clean sweep of race wins by the [[Ford Performance Racing]] team. [[Mark Winterbottom]] won Saturday's Race 5 of the championship, while Sunday's two races were both won by [[Will Davison]], the third and final race saw Davison on tyres no longer capable of sustaining front running speed being caught rapidly by Winterbottom and [[Jamie Whincup]] of the [[Triple Eight Race Engineering (Australia)|Triple Eight Race Engineering]] team. Davison won as his team-mate Winterbottom snuck past Whincup on the last lap to defuse the hostile challenge from the Holden driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorsport.com/v8supercars/news/double-victory-in-perth-for-trading-post-s-davison/ |title=Double victory in Perth for Trading Post's Davison |date=2012-05-06 |work=motorsport.com |publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc |accessdate=2012-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13857">[[Image:basketball.png|thumb|right|A typical basketball]] 
A '''basketball''' is a [[Sphere|spherical]] [[ball]] used in [[basketball]] games. Basketballs typically range in size from very small promotional items only a few inches in diameter to extra large balls nearly a foot in diameter used in training exercises. For example, a youth basketball could be {{convert|27|in|cm}} in circumference, while a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) men's ball would be a maximum of {{convert|30|in|cm}} and an NCAA women's ball would be a maximum of {{convert|29|in|cm}}. The standard for a basketball in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is {{convert|29.5|in|cm}} in [[circumference]] and for the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA), a maximum circumference of {{convert|29|in|cm}}. High school and junior leagues normally use NCAA, NBA or WNBA sized balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stack.com/a/basketball-sizes |title=Basketball Sizes: A Quick Guide for All Levels of Play|last=Zirm|first=Jordan|website=STACK|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BOSW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/84284-basketball-official-size-weight/|title=Basketball Official Size &amp; Weight|first=Carl|last=Putman|date=September 11, 2017|website=LiveStrong.com|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the court and the baskets, the basketball is the only piece of equipment necessary to play the game of basketball. During the game, the ball must be bounced continuously ([[Basketball#Dribbling|dribbling]]), thrown through the air to other players ([[Basketball#Passing|passing]]) or thrown towards the basket ([[Basketball#Shooting|shooting]]). Therefore, the ball must be very durable and easy to hold on to. The ball is also used to perform tricks (sometimes called freestyling), the most common of which are spinning the ball on the tip of one's middle finger, dribbling in complex patterns, rolling the ball over one's shoulder, or performing aerobatic maneuvers with the ball while executing a [[slam dunk]], most notably in the context of a [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk contest]].

==Characteristics==
Nearly all basketballs have an inflatable inner [[rubber]] bladder, generally wrapped in layers of fiber and then covered with a  surface made either from [[leather]] (traditional), rubber, or a synthetic composite. As in most inflatable balls, there is a small opening that allows the pressure to be increased or decreased.

The surface of the ball is nearly always divided by "ribs" that are recessed below the surface of the ball in a variety of configurations and are generally a contrasting [[color]]. A brownish orange surface with [[black]] ribs and a possible logo is the traditional color scheme of basketballs but they are sold in various colors.

Balls are generally designated for indoor (generally made of leather or absorbent composites), or all-surface use (generally made of rubber or durable composites, also known as indoor/outdoor balls). Indoor balls tend to be considerably more expensive than all-surface balls due to cost of materials. In addition, brand new all-leather indoor balls must be "broken in" first to achieve optimal grip before use in competition. The abrasiveness of asphalt and the dirt and moisture present in an outdoor setting will usually ruin an indoor ball within a very short period of time, which is why an indoor/outdoor ball is recommended for recreational players. Outdoor balls are commonly made from rubber to cope with rougher conditions, and they need to be filled with more air to retain a suitable level of air pressure in colder weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsgearlab.com/best-outdoor-basketball/ |title=Sports Gear Lab |publisher=Sportsgearlab.com |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes==
Different sizes are used for different age groups.&lt;ref name=BKT&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.breakthroughbasketball.com/basketballs/size-chart.html|title=Basketball Size Chart - Recommended Sizes for Mom &amp; Me |website=www.breakthroughbasketball.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fiba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/OBR2017/BasketballEquipment/Final.pdf |title=Rule 7: Basketballs |work=Official Basketball Rules 2017: Basketball Equipment |pages=11–12 |publisher=FIBA |date=4 July 2017 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common standards are:

Note that the ball used for all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed) in the formalized halfcourt game of [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]] combines characteristics of the size 6 and size 7 balls. Its circumference is that of a size 6 ball, but its weight is that of a size 7.&lt;ref name="Wilson 3x3"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.amersports.com/newsroom/archive/news-article/2015/06/09/wilson-to-provide-the-official-game-ball-for-fiba |title=Wilson to provide the Official Game Ball for FIBA |publisher=[[Amer Sports]] |date=9 June 2015 |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Basketball historic.tif|thumb|right|A historic basketball.]]
In early December 1891, the chairman of the physical education department at the School for Christian Workers (now Springfield College) in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Canadian instructed physical education teacher [[James Naismith]], known to many as the inventor of basketball, to invent a new game to entertain the school's athletes in the winter season. Naismith assembled his class of 18 young men, appointed captains of two nine-player teams, and set in motion the first ever basketball game, played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets tacked to either end of the gymnasium.

The first purpose-built basketballs were made from panels of leather stitched together with a rubber bladder inside. A cloth lining was added to the leather for support and uniformity (identity). A molded version of the early basketball was invented in 1942. For many years, leather was the material of choice for basketball coverings, however in the late 1990s, composite materials, like synthetics were put forth and have rapidly gained acceptance in most leagues due to their superior performance in harsh outdoor game conditions.

From 1967 through 1976, the [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|American Basketball Association]] (ABA) used a distinctive red, white and blue basketball that is still seen from time to time.

==Notable basketball manufacturers==

The '''Dr Pepper Arena and StarCenter''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Frisco, Texas]] at the corner of the [[Dallas North Tollway]] and Gaylord Ave. It is the home of the [[Texas Legends]] of the [[NBA G League]], the [[Texas Revolution (indoor football)|Texas Revolution]] of [[Champions Indoor Football]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Irvine | first=Cameron | |url=http://www.texasrevs.com/texas-revolution-to-celebrate-pro-sports-in-frisco-announce-move-to-dr-pepper-arena-wednesday-aug-30/ |title=Texas Revolution to Celebrate Pro Sports in Frisco, Announce Move to Dr Pepper Arena Wednesday, Aug. 30 |publisher=Texas Revolution |date=August 28, 2017 | access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the executive offices and practice facility of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Dallas Stars]]. It previously served as the home of the [[Texas Tornado]] team of the [[North American Hockey League]]; the NAHL maintains its headquarters at the arena. 

The arena is also used for concerts and other live entertainment events. It seats between 5,000 and 7,000 people and has a 2,100-vehicle parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Cohn | first=Justin A. | date=December 10, 2017 | title=Ants staying?

The arena's south parking lot has served as the Metroplex venue for some of [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s Grand Chapiteau shows, while the arena itself has served as a Metroplex venue for its arena shows.

The [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]] has held naming rights to the arena since it opened, but the arena was originally known as the '''[[Deja Blue]] Arena''' as Dr Pepper chose to promote its brand of bottled water before its name was changed to Dr Pepper Arena. 

The Dr Pepper Arena was the former home of the [[Frisco Thunder]] team of the [[Intense Football League]]. A [[Lone Star Football League]] team to be called the [[Frisco Falcons]] was announced for a spring 2012 start but collapsed before the season began.

The arena hosted the [[2012 Robertson Cup]] Tournament to decide the champion of the NAHL, with the Texas Tornado ultimately winning the championship. It is the second time the venue has hosted the event. It also hosted the 2013 Robertson Cup with the [[Amarillo Bulls]] winning the championship.

On March 23–26, 2016, the Dr Pepper Arena hosted the [[2016 NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Elite Eight]], which was won by [[Augustana (SD) Vikings|Augustana University]] of South Dakota.

The '''Fortissimus''' is a defunct event in [[strength athletics]]. The name means "the mightiest"&lt;ref name="Milo08"/&gt; and was a multi-event challenge at the end of which the winner is crowned as the "Strongest Man on Earth". It was set up to bring together the strongest competitors on the planet independent of the organisations to which they were signed, and also as a tribute to the nineteenth-century Canadian strongman [[Louis Cyr]], which gave it many similarities to [[Le Defi Mark Ten International]] which last took place in Canada in the early 1990s. After its first airing in 2008, the strength athletics magazine Milo described it as the ultimate strongman competition ever held.&lt;ref name="Milo08"&gt;Kristin Nelson, ''Milo'', ''Fortissimus: A mighty challenge - a magnificent win'', September 2008, Vol 16, No2&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a successful edition in 2009, a reported lack of a major sponsor for 2010 resulted in the competition being suspended, no future contests have been announced.&lt;ref name="CWS suspend"&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2009/Dec/Canada_World_Strength-No_Strongman_Contest_in_2010.html Randall J. Strossen, ''Canada World Strength: No Strongman Contest in 2010'', Friday, December 11, 2009, IronMind]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The world of strength athletics in 2008 was fragmented, with a number of individuals being able to lay claim to be the strongest in the world by virtue of having won mutually exclusive events. Athletes affiliated to [[IFSA Strongman]] were not allowed to compete in the [[World's Strongest Man]] ("WSM"), which is produced by [[Trans World International|TWI]] and thus neither the WSM and its associated [[WSM Super Series]] nor the IFSA circuit can claim to have a comprehensive field of the top athletes. Some events did exist that bridged the divide between the major organisations, such as the [[Arnold Strongman Classic]]. Fortissimus was to be another such bridge but with a difference. The driving force behind the event, Paul Ohl, is one of the world's leading authorities on the great Louis Cyr, the nineteenth century strongman and want to create a competition to honour this man, said to have been the strongest man in the world. Fortissimus was set up to be the all-inclusive strength and power package to demonstrate ''"the essence of the sport of strongman is the multi-disciplinary array of tests of global strength, resulting from a combination of static (brute) strength, overall explosive power and power grip, strength athletics mastery, endurance and stamina"''. The concept was to link with the tradition of strongman and to honor the memory and deeds of the great Louis Cyr. Ten events, called the Classical Events, were incorporated into the programme.

The night before Day 1 of the 2008 event the athletes were honoured at a banquet hosted by Paul Ohl and was attended by the townspeople of [[Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire, Quebec|Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire]], where the event was being held, and the mayor of that town. Mayor Carl Dubé welcomed the athletes to Notre Dame du Rosaire in June 2008 and thousands of spectators flocked to see many of the world’s top strongmen perform, including [[Zydrunas Savickas]], [[Derek Poundstone]], [[Andrus Murumets]], [[Travis Ortmayer]] and [[Mikhail Koklyaev]]. The event was lauded across the strongman world, with the likes of Ironmind and Milo magazine praising it. So popular was it that a three-year deal with the Regional Community of [[Montmagny, Quebec]] was soon struck with the newly formed Fortissimus World Strength board. Derek Poundstone won the event in spectacular fashion. With the final event left, the Natural Stones of Strength, [[Zydrunas Savickas]] was 5 points clear of Poundstone. The three huge stone in the event were the 350&amp;nbsp;lb Bill Kazmaier stone, the 400&amp;nbsp;lb Paul Anderson stone and the giant 517&amp;nbsp;lb Louis Cyr stone.&lt;ref name="Milo08"/&gt; The winner would be the best time or most stones loaded. Some of the athletes lifted one stone, others the second. When it came to the third, the Cyr stone that only Louis Cyr had previously lifted over a century before, most athletes passed on it. Some touched it but did not attempt to lift it.&lt;ref name="Milo08"/&gt; [[Zydrunas Savickas]], having lifted the first two in an astonishing 8.8 seconds, tried the Cyr stone but managed to lift it just one inch before deciding it was too much. Poundstone took 11 seconds over the first two stones, significantly quicker than all others except Savickas. Savickas is reported to have raised his hands in victory at seeing this time.&lt;ref name="Milo08"/&gt; However, his celebration was to have been premature. To the astonishment of the athletes, the crowd and even the organisers, Poundstone managed to move the stone. Screams of amazement were said to have come from the crowd. Inch by inch he raised the stone and eventually placed it on the platform. Later, Paul Ohl was to say to Derek Poundstone ''"You know, you weren't supposed to lift that stone. I put it in the competition as a tribute to Louis Cyr. Whoever is able to lift that stone would be considered an heir to Louis Cyr."''&lt;ref name="Milo08"/&gt; Having lifted the fabled Cyr stone, Poundstone had the honour of having his name added to the stone, being the only man other than Cyr to lift the giant weight.&lt;ref name="Fort"/&gt;

One of Paul Ohl's key strengths is his ability to involve the local community, including the regional press, to increase the presence of the event. The 2009 competition saw Marcel Catellier, the chief commissioner of the Regional Community of Montmagny, as chairman of the board, in charge of the general administration of the new corporation and Paul Ohl as president of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Randall J. Strossen, Ph.D., ''Fortissimus 2009 . . . 2010 . . .2011'', Ironmind, December 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zydrunas Savickas]] reversed the results of 2008, where he came second, to clinch the title in 2009, with Poundstone coming second. Prior to the event, to further enhance the events standing a pre-tournament competition was held, the [[World Championship Rolling Thunder]] on June 26, an event which determined which athlete has the greatest grip strength in the world. [[Mark Felix]] successfully defended his title in this event.&lt;ref name="Fort"/&gt;

The 2010 edition was suspended. Canada World Strength noted in a formal statement: ''"Since the precondition for the holding of a third edition resided mainly in the arrival of a major sponsor by early December and that this condition has not been reached, the organizers have no choice but to [suspend] the 2010 edition."''&lt;ref name="CWS suspend"/&gt; However, the door was held open for 2011 with the statement continuing: ''"“The Board, however, does not abandon the idea of holding a third edition in 2011."''.&lt;ref name="CWS suspend"/&gt;

===Strongman Champions League Cooperation===
In 2008 Paul Ohl stated that the [[Strongman Champions League]] was one of three organisations that had made an agreement with Fortissimus in order to unite the world strength community, the others being the [[American Strongman Corporation]], and the [[Aussiepower]] organization. Within the agreement, Fortissimus, the competition that confers the title of "Strongest Man on the Planet", guaranteed that the winner of the [[America's Strongest Man]] title would be granted a slot in Fortissimus from 2009, as would the winner of the [[Australia's Strongest Man]] title. The agreement with the Strongman Champions League went further, stating that the top three athletes would have guaranteed places and in return the top Canadian athletes would have guaranteed selected participation in the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://74.205.126.46/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2008/May/Fortissimus_Enters_Agreement_with_Strongman_Champions_League_the_American_Strongman_Corporation_and_Aussiepower.html Fortissimus Enters Agreement with Strongman Champions League, the American Strongman Corporation and Aussiepower by Randall J. Strossen, Ph.D. 2009 IronMind Friday, May 16, 2008 ]&lt;/ref&gt; This later went further, guaranteeing the SCL its top five athletes would have places.&lt;ref name="IMJan09"/&gt; The agreement was reemphasised in a joint statement from Marcel Mostert and Paul Ohl in early 2009.&lt;ref name="IMJan09"&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2009/Jan/FORTISSIMUS_-_Strongman_Champions_League_Cooperation_and_Joint_Statement.html FORTISSIMUS - Strongman Champions League: Cooperation and Joint Statement by Randall J. Strossen, Ph.D. 2009 IronMind, Tuesday, January 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Fortissimus regards the ten events that are incorporated in its programme as the Classical Events of strength athletics.

*The LOG LIFT
*The DEADLIFT (modified version from Powerlifting)
*The YOKE
*The FARMER (FERGUS) POWER WALK
*The ATLAS (McGLASHEN) STONES LIFT
*The NATURAL STONES OF STRENGTH LIFT
*The HUSAFELL STONE CARRY (and related)
*The APOLLON AXLE LIFT
*The ONE-ARM DUMBBELL LIFT (Louis Cyr style)
*The PYRAMID WEIGHT LIFT (Power stairs)
*The BACK LIFT

==Trophy==
From 2009 Fortissimus established that the title of the champion would be "The Strongest Man on Earth". The winner’s trophy is a bronze statuette of Louis Cyr hoisting the huge 273 ¼ lbs dumbbell that brought him fame on the evening of 19 January 1892 at London’s [[Royal Aquarium]]. It was crafted by renowned Canadian sculptor Michel Binette with the original displayed at the [[Inverness Bronze Museum]], in [[Inverness, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref name="Fort"&gt;[http://www.fortissimus.ca/pages/index_e.aspx?DetailID=183 Official Sire]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard J. Lamade Stadium''' (pronounced "LAM-a-day") is a [[Baseball park|baseball stadium]] in [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania]].  Each year, along with [[Little League Volunteer Stadium]], it hosts the [[Little League World Series]]. The [[Baseball field|playing field]] is two-thirds the size of a [[professional baseball]] field, with {{convert|60|ft|1|sing=on}} basepaths, a {{convert|46|ft|0|sing=on}} mound, and after modification in 2006, outfield fences at {{convert|225|ft|1|abbr=on}}, forming one-fourth of a true [[circle]]. Stadium seating capacity is 8,000 to 10,000, much of which is bench seating, while large [[berm]]s surrounding the stadium provide additional seating allowing over 40,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/sports/llws13/story/_/id/9550942/little-league-world-series-venues |title=Little League World Series Venues |website=[[ESPN]] |date=August 12, 2013 |accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally called '''Howard J. Lamade Memorial Field''', the ballpark opened for the {{llwsy|1959}} tournament.&lt;ref name=FoD/&gt; Howard J. Lamade was the son of ''[[Grit (newspaper)|Grit]]'' newspaper founder Dietrick Lamade.&lt;ref name=BPD&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/201007072894/college-baseball/visits/ballpark-visit-howard-lamade-stadium-little-league-world-series |title=Howard Lamade Stadium / Little League World Series |first=Kevin |last=Reichard |website=ballparkdigest.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Lamade was a vice president at Grit Publishing, and served on the board of directors for [[Little League Baseball]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; A donation from Grit Publishing was used to purchase land where the stadium is located.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; The ballpark received its current name in 1968, when the original wood and steel stands were replaced with a concrete stadium.&lt;ref name=FoD&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.littleleague.org/news/howard-j-lamade-stadium-named-2018-field-distinction/ |title=Howard J. Lamade Stadium Named 2018 Field of Distinction |website=littleleague.org |date=February 20, 2018 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovations===
[[File:Exterior of Howard J. Lamade Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|The exterior of Lamade Stadium in 2007]]
Lights were added in 1992 to facilitate night game play in conjunction with expansion of the series to [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] play.&lt;ref name=setligh&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G7wjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rNAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5394%2C784828 |newspaper=[[Moscow-Pullman Daily News]] |agency=Associated Press|title=Little Leaguers are set to play under the lights |date=August 24, 1992 |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the fences were moved back {{convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|225|ft|1|abbr=on}} to all fields. This was done because [[home run]]s were becoming too common. Other renovations included the extension of the stadium roofs to the end of the [[grandstand]]s, and some [[bleacher]]s replaced with individual seats with backs, increasing seating of that type from approximately 600 to 1500.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

On August 19, {{llwsy|2011}}, Lamade Stadium set an attendance record for the game between [[La Grange, Kentucky]], and [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania]], with 41,848 people in the stands and on the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23024443/central_pa_team_shut_down_by_kentucky/ |title=Central Pa. team shut down by Kentucky |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |page=E05 |date=August 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later broken on August 29, {{llwsy|2015}}, when [[Lewisberry, Pennsylvania]], defeated [[Pearland, Texas]], with 45,716 in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23024631/pa_team_tops_texas_will_face_japan_in/ |title=Pa. team tops Texas, will face Japan in title game |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |page=D03 |date=August 30, 2015 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Høddvoll Stadion''' is a multi-sports [[stadium]] in [[Ulsteinvik]] in [[Ullstein, Norway|Ullstein]], [[Norway]]. Home of [[Adeccoligaen|First Division]] side [[IL Hødd]], it is primary used for football, but also features an [[all-weather running track]]. The sports complex consists of the main stadium, surrounded by an [[all-weather running track]], a natural grass training pitch and an artificial turf pitch, as well as an indoor hall. Høddvoll has a capacity for 4,433 spectators, of which 2,600 have been seated.

Hødd was established in 1919 and completed the construction of Høddvoll in 1921. The original field had gravel and was located at the site of current training pitch. It went through a series of upgrades, becoming a grass field in 1989. The main stadium at Høddvoll opened in 1963, and was followed by five season in the [[Norwegian Premier League|top football league]] the following decade, resulting in various upgrades. The record attendance is about 12,300, from a [[1981 Norwegian Football Cup|1981 Cup]] match when Hødd played [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]].  The venue saw several upgrades during the 1999, and Hødd play top-league games in [[1995 Norwegian Premier League|1995]]. Hødd played a single [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifier at Høddvoll in [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|2013]].

An all-new stadium on the original site is under construction and scheduled for competition in 2014. It will have capacity for 3,825, all except 1,000 seated. It will be built in conjunction with '''Ulsteinhallen''' and indoor [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[team handball|handball]] and [[gymnastics]] hall.

==History==
Hødd was established on 1 August 1919 and the club's first task was to find a suitable location to play football games.&lt;ref name=f115&gt;Flatin: 115&lt;/ref&gt; As a temporary arrangement, a football field was rented for the inaugural season for NOK&amp;nbsp;400.&lt;ref&gt;Flatin: 14&lt;/ref&gt; The first location which was considered was to purchase land at Holsekerdalen, but a clause in the contract resulted in 15 of 17 members voted against the purchase at a member meeting on 25 September. Instead the club landed on Høddvoll, which was partitioned out of the farm Støylane and approved by the members on 13 February 1920. The main advantage of Høddvoll over Holsekerdalen was that the former allowed for a future expansion of the facilities. The club borrowed 3,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK), which was guaranteed by all adult members and some supporters. Construction stated the same year and by March 1921 NOK&amp;nbsp;8,800 had been invested in the venue. Financing was aided by a grant of NOK&amp;nbsp;2,000 from the [[Football Association of Norway]] (NFF). The venue opened that year, initially with a gravel pitch.&lt;ref name=f115 /&gt;

IL Hødd started with athletics in 1925, which were also based at Høddvoll.&lt;ref&gt;Flatin: 19&lt;/ref&gt; The first club house opened in 1932, consisting of a shed measuring {{convert|4|by|5|m|sp=us}}. The building tipped over in a storm and the locker rooms were thereafter moved to a nearby farmhouse at Støylane.&lt;ref name=f113&gt;Flatin: 113&lt;/ref&gt; The first upgrade to the pitch was carried out in 1936, in which it was expanded to {{convert|92|by|50|m|sp=us}}. The upgrades cost NOK&amp;nbsp;1,500, of which the state paid NOK&amp;nbsp;800. Another new gravel surface was laid in 1939. A further expansion took place at the end of the [[Second World War]]. When completed in 1947, the field measured {{convert|92|by|58|m|sp=us}}. However, the NOK&amp;nbsp;22,000 investment was a heavy burden on the club's finances.&lt;ref name=f115 /&gt;  The third club house opened in 1948, costing NOK&amp;nbsp;3,000. It featured separate locker rooms for each team, in addition to a common shower room.&lt;ref name=f113 /&gt;

Plans for a new stadium at Høddvoll were first articulated in 1951, resulting in a visit from NFF the following year to investigate the possibilities. The motion was passed by the club's annual meeting the same year and was included near the schools in the municipal zoning plan which was being revised.&lt;ref name=f115 /&gt; Hødd applied for a municipal grant in 1954. This resulted in a political disagreement as to the location of the new venue. The majority in the municipal council wanted the new stadium to be located at Høddvoll, while the minority called for it to be located next to the schools. This would have given a more central placement in town, but the majority was concerned that this would not give sufficient space for future school expansions, as well as giving higher construction costs. The municipality gave a grant of NOK&amp;nbsp;10,000 towards land purchases, and Hødd paid NOK&amp;nbsp;26,321 for the necessary land.&lt;ref name=f117&gt;Flatin: 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction commenced in 1957,&lt;ref name=f118&gt;Flatin: 118&lt;/ref&gt; but there was very little progress in the work until 1961. The main reasons were the lack of funds and that the contractor went bankrupt. In 1961 there was a boost in the construction, with significant part of the work carried out by volunteers. The pitch was sown by hand in May 1962, but the wet summer caused the grass to not grow properly, and it was never suitable for the season. The pitch was re-sown in the spring of 1963, allowing the new stadium to open on 30 June 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Flatin: 119&lt;/ref&gt; Construction cost NOK&amp;nbsp;200,000,&lt;ref&gt;Flatin: 120&lt;/ref&gt; which included a new grandstand.&lt;ref name=f121&gt;Flatin: 121&lt;/ref&gt; The old clubhouse had become too unmodern and the players instead changed at the community center and were then bused to the stadium.&lt;ref name=f114&gt;Flatin: 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Hødd was promoted to the [[1966 Norwegian First Division]], which required Høddvoll to be upgraded, mostly by addition additional rows to the grandstand.&lt;ref name=f121 /&gt; It also saw the construction of a new club house, which featured three locker rooms, one for each team and for the referees, and a meeting room.&lt;ref name=f113 /&gt; Work on a running track for the athletics group commenced in 1971. Lack of funding delayed construction of the NOK&amp;nbsp;165,000 investment to be placed on hold until 1973. The completed athletics venue was opened in 1975.&lt;ref name=f121 /&gt; Planning of the fifth and current club house started in the early 1980s. Financing was secured through a cooperation with location businesses, with [[Ulstein Hatlø]], [[Ulstein Propeller]], [[Sunnmørsbanken]] each buying a stake in the investment of NOK&amp;nbsp;3 million. It was further expanded in the early 1990s with a kindergarten.&lt;ref name=f114 /&gt;

The reserve pitch, the original venue from 1921 which remained a gravel pitch, was upgraded to grass in 1989.&lt;ref name=f121 /&gt; It was expanded from {{convert|105|by|67|m|sp=us}} to {{convert|125|by|76|m|sp=us}}. As part of a cooperation with NFF, Hødd attempted a trial to see how extensive use the field could handle. This resulted in an extensive wear and the pitch was repeatedly closed to allow the grass to heal. Ahead of the 1992 season the stadium received a roof over the grandstand and 600 seats were installed, costing NOK&amp;nbsp;1.5 million—paid for by the club's sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;Flatin: 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The athletics part of the stadium was not upgraded since 1975 and by the 1990s the section was dilapidated and plans for an all-weather running track and were discussed.&lt;ref name=f121 /&gt; This was installed in 1999, along with a new grass turf.&lt;ref name=stadion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hodd.no/construction/article/1h9hcgckj9j6y1akw11bf9wyph/title/hoddvoll-stadion |title=Høddvoll stadion |date=3 July 2012 |publisher=IL Hødd |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225309/http://www.hodd.no/construction/article/1h9hcgckj9j6y1akw11bf9wyph/title/hoddvoll-stadion |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done simultaneously because the all-weather track required the grass pitch to be moved {{convert|9|m|sp=us}} southwards.&lt;ref&gt;Flatin: 129&lt;/ref&gt; While this took place, Hødd's A-team played its First Division matches on the training field.&lt;ref name=treningsbane&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hodd.no/construction/article/2mmp2e3bn5cf1twq9piaztnbf/title/treningsbane-gras-2 |title=Treningsbane gras 2 |date=3 July 2012 |publisher=IL Hødd |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gravel pitch north of the main stadium was converted to an artificial turf field in 2003, opening on 17 October. In addition to a multiplication of the number of hours it could be used by recreational teams and the secondary school, the field could also be used during winter.&lt;ref name=kunstgress&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hodd.no/construction/article/17teoy3tsi22q14hr41gncs8zg/title/kunstgrasbana |title=Kunstgrasbana |date=3 July 2012 |publisher=IL Hødd |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An indoor football hall, Ulsmohallen, opened in 2007.&lt;ref name=ulsmohallen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hodd.no/construction/article/1j3l73gnky0oq1oxsnns978mwo/title/ulsmohallen |title=Ulsmohallen |date=3 July 2012 |publisher=IL Hødd |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Høddvoll is a multi-sports complex located at the Støylane area of Ulsteinvik, the main village in Ulstein Norway.

It is located in the vicinity of Ulstein Upper Secondary School, which also uses the venue during daytime.&lt;ref name=kunstgress /&gt;
There are two other pitches at the site, an artificial turf pitch north of the main stadium and a natural grass pitch to the east.&lt;ref name=treningsbane /&gt;&lt;ref name=kunstgress /&gt; The latter, officially named Treningsbane gras 2, measures {{convert|125|by|76|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=treningsbane /&gt; North of the training field is the club offices, Høddvollhuset. In addition to locker rooms and club offices, it features a café and event rooms for rental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hodd.no/construction/article/187xw57c01uey1x5dkb0gquwdv/title/hoddvollhuset |title=Høddvollhuset |date=3 July 2012 |publisher=IL Hødd |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; North of the main stadium and west of the club house is the indoor hall Ulsmohallen. It features a {{convert|60|by|45|m|sp=us|adj=on}} artificial pitch.&lt;ref name=ulsmohallen /&gt;

==Events==
Høddvoll has been the home venue of IL Hødd since 1921.&lt;ref name=f115 /&gt; The team has played in the [[Tippeligaen|top domestic league]] of Norway for six seasons, in [[1966 Norwegian First Division|1966]], 1969–72 and [[1995 Norwegian Premier League|1995]]. The team has played a combined 60 home games at the top level at Høddvoll, drawing a total of 196,369 spectators, or an average 3273 per match. Hødd's highest home attendance is 5,297 in their inaugural season, and the lowest during play in the top season was 2,133 in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Fagerli: 350&lt;/ref&gt; The record attendance of 12,300 dates from a [[1981 Norwegian Football Cup|1981 Cup]] match when Hødd played [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]].&lt;ref name=stadion /&gt;

The semi-final of the [[2012 Norwegian Football Cup]] was played at Høddvoll, drawing 6,261 spectators, where Hødd won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotball.no/System-pages/Kampfakta/?matchId=5665017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222194836/http://www.fotball.no/System-pages/Kampfakta/?matchId=5665017 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2013 |title=Hødd – Brann torsdag 27. september 2012 kl. 16:00 |publisher=[[Football Association of Norway]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hødd won the [[2012 Norwegian Football Cup Final|2012 Cup Final]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tv2.no/sport/fotball/hoedd-med-cupbombe-etter-straffedrama-3932838.html |language=Norwegian |title=Hødd med cupbombe etter straffedrama |publisher=TV 2 |first=Dag Slinning |last=Aarsæther |date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team qualified for [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|second qualification round]] of the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League]]. A major issue was if the club would be allowed to play their games at Høddvoll, or would have to use the more modern stadia [[Color Line Stadion]] in [[Ålesund]] or [[Aker Stadion]] in [[Molde]]. [[UEFA]] gave Høddvoll a green light in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/mr/det-blir-europacupspel-pa-hoddvoll-1.11063187 |title=Det blir europacupspel på Høddvoll |last=Rise |first=Hans-Olav |date=5 June 2013 |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQWJSIpc?url=http://www.nrk.no/mr/det-blir-europacupspel-pa-hoddvoll-1.11063187 |archivedate=26 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hødd won 1–0 of [[FC Aktobe|Aktobe]] in Høddvoll's only European football match, but lost 1–2 in aggregate. The match sold old, drawing 2,019 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vikebladet.no/sport/article7951409.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Espen Standal sikra sigeren |work=[[Vikebladet Vestposten]] |first=Einar Orten |last=Trovåg |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQWJSIpc?url=http://www.nrk.no/mr/det-blir-europacupspel-pa-hoddvoll-1.11063187 |archivedate=26 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Høddvoll does not meet the criteria for First Division stadia, lacking such amenities as [[under-soil heating]], [[floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] and the necessary standard for locker rooms. The club is therefore working on plans to build an all-new stadium at the site of the training pitch—the site of the first stadium from 1921. The new venue will feature a main stand on the north long side and artificial turf. The project is estimated to cost NOK&amp;nbsp;50 million.&lt;ref name=thalberg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/mr/gar-mot-ny-stadion-for-hodd-1.7967416 |title=Går mot ny stadion for Hødd |last=Thalberg |first=Silje |date=24 January 2012 |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQWpb5PV?url=http://www.nrk.no/mr/gar-mot-ny-stadion-for-hodd-1.7967416 |archivedate=26 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stand will feature 1,950 seated places, the opposite, south stand will feature 875 seated places, and the eastern stand will feature standing places for 1,000 spectators, for a total of 3,825. The west end will be built as part of Høddvoll Panorama, which combines commercial estate in the ground floor and eighteen apartments in the upper two stories. The new venue is certified for Norwegian Premier League and UEFA matches. Hødd will rent the stadium from the municipality for NOK&amp;nbsp;2.5 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hodd.no/news/article/118vg57ktdz5b1qa4wnbdldif0/title/nye-hoddvoll |title=Nye Høddvoll |publisher=IL Hødd |date=20 November 2013 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013 |archivedate=26 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQVlKxaW?url=http://www.hodd.no/news/article/118vg57ktdz5b1qa4wnbdldif0/title/nye-hoddvoll |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main stand will be built in conjunction with Ulsteinhallen, and will feature common locker rooms and cafeteria.&lt;ref name=thalberg /&gt; The indoor arena will feature a hall area for recreational athletics, handball and gymnastics, with [[Dimna IL]] as the main tenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vikebladet.no/sport/article6815595.ece |title=Ulstein ror Ulsteinhallen i land |date=14 December 2012 |last=Trovåg |first=Einar Orten |work=[[Vikebladet Vestposten]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013 |archivedate=26 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQWy76yx?url=http://www.vikebladet.no/sport/article6815595.ece |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ulsteinhallen and the new stadium will be owned by Ulstein Eigedomsselskap KF, a [[kommunalt foretak|municipal enterprise]] owned by Ulstein Municipality. The municipality estimates that the hall will cost between one and a half and two million kroner per year to operate.&lt;ref name=odegard&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vikebladet.no/nyhende/article6770233.ece |title=I full sving med Ulsteinhallen |date=5 December 2012 |last=Ødegård |first=Joar |work=[[Vikebladet Vestposten]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013 |archivedate=26 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQX0n3Cu?url=http://www.vikebladet.no/nyhende/article6770233.ece |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Møre og Romsdal County Municipality]] secured 47.6 percent of the investment costs and 37.6 percent of the operating costs of the new hall, to allow it to be used by Ulstein Upper Secondary School. This will give the school access to {{convert|1000|m2|sp=us}} of new floor space and daytime access to the {{convert|6400|m2|sp=us|adj=on}} athletics hall.&lt;ref name=fkja&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vikebladet.no/nyhende/article514720.ece |title=Fylkeskommunalt ja til ny Ulsteinhall |date=2 October 2012 |work=[[Vikebladet Vestposten]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=26 November 2013 |archivedate=26 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQX3zao0?url=http://www.vikebladet.no/nyhende/article514720.ece |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction commenced in December 2012, with Nord-Berg as the main contractor.&lt;ref name=odegard /&gt; The arena is scheduled for completion in 2014, when it will become the third-largest indoor athletics arena in Norway, costing NOK&amp;nbsp;123 million.&lt;ref name=fkja /&gt;

'''Lake Merced Golf Club''' is an 18-hole private [[golf club (institution)|golf club]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the [[United States]], located in [[Daly City, California]], an adjacent suburb south of [[San Francisco]]. 

Founded {{Time ago|1922}} in 1922, the course opened the following year.

'''Lambert Field''' was a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. It was the home field of the {{cbsb link|team=Purdue Boilermakers|school=Purdue University|title=Purdue Boilermakers baseball}} from 1965 until 2012 and held 1,100 people.  It was named after former Purdue baseball coach [[Ward Lambert]].&lt;ref name="purdy"&gt;[http://www.purduesports.com/facilities/lambert-field.html Lambert Field (Baseball)] at purduesports.com, URL accessed October 24, 2009. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kksKN0Ff?url=http://www.purduesports.com/facilities/lambert-field.html Archived] October 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Opened in 1965, Lambert Field succeeded the [[Old Lambert Field]] (also known as [[Ross-Ade Field]]) as the home of Purdue baseball.  The construction of [[Mackey Arena]] on the location of Old Lambert Field necessitated the move.&lt;ref name=purdy /&gt;

In the 1990s, the university undertook three renovation projects on Lambert Field.  In 1990, a new [[press box]] was added, and the seating areas were improved.  In 1994, an electronic scoreboard was installed.  In 1999, the university adopted a yearly renovation plan for Lambert.  The annual improvements have added new fences in the [[outfield]] and foul territory, a new backstop, new [[bullpen]]s, a screen to protect the [[parking lot]] beyond the [[left field]] fence, and an irrigation system.&lt;ref name=purdy /&gt;

In 2002, the facility hosted the Indiana North-South All-Star Game.&lt;ref name=purdy /&gt;

In 2012, Purdue won its first Big 10 Regular Season championship since 1909 in the field's final season.

== Naming ==
The field was named for former [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue basketball]] and [[Purdue Boilermakers baseball|baseball]] coach [[Ward Lambert]].  During three stints coaching the baseball program (1917, 1919–35, and 1945-6), Lambert compiled a 163–156–7 record.&lt;ref name=purdy /&gt;  For his success in coaching Purdue's basketball program, Lambert [[List of coaches in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|was inducted]] into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=hof&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Jeff |title=This Little Piggy... |url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/011008aab.html |work=Big Ten.org |publisher=Big Ten Conference |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64xsrkWSV?url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/011008aab.html |archivedate=January 25, 2012 |date=January 10, 2008 |quote=Lambert was enshrined into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1960. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New stadium ==
Purdue built a new baseball venue, [[Alexander Field (Purdue University)|Alexander Field]], which it began using in 2013. Although the field was planned to open for the 2012 season, construction delays led Purdue to use Lambert Field through the end of the 2012 season.  At the end of the season, Lambert was razed to allow space for additional parking for the Student Fitness and Wellness Center.&lt;ref name=2012use&gt;{{cite web|last=Foley |first=Brian |title=Purdue to Play at Lambert Field This Spring |url=http://www.collegebaseballdaily.com/2012/01/25/purdue-to-play-at-lambert-field-this-spring/ |work=College Baseball Daily |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64xPmYZli?url=http://www.collegebaseballdaily.com/2012/01/25/purdue-to-play-at-lambert-field-this-spring/ |archivedate=January 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=12use2&gt;{{cite web|title=Purdue Baseball to Play at Lambert |url=http://www.wlfi.com/dpp/sports/purdue-baseball-to-play-at-lambert |work=WLFI.com |publisher=WLFI 18 |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64xrbvHeT?url=http://www.wlfi.com/dpp/sports/purdue-baseball-to-play-at-lambert |archivedate=January 25, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012 |quote=Purdue's baseball team will have to play all their home games at Lambert Field this season, due to delays in the construction of Alexander Field. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''larch ball''' is a structure created when [[Western Larch]] needles floating in a lake become entangled in a spherical shape due to the action of waves.  They are most commonly known to form in [[Seeley Lake, Montana]], however, they have also been known to form in similar regions such as Clark Fork and lakes in Tracy, New Brunswick such as Peltoma Lake, Big Kedron Lake, and Little Kedron Lake.  Typical specimens are 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter more rarely larger ones are found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montanamagazine.com/online2005/index.php?sIssue=2005_09-10&amp;sArticle=20050902180540 Montana Magazine September/October 2005]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurel Park''' is an American [[thoroughbred racing|thoroughbred]] [[racetrack]] located just outside [[Laurel, Maryland]] which opened in 1911.  The track is {{frac|1|1|8}} miles in circumference. Its name was changed to "Laurel Race Course" for several decades until returning to the "Laurel Park" designation in 1994.

==History==

Laurel Park Racecourse opened October 2, 1911 under the direction of the Laurel Four County Fair.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.laurelpark.com/about/history | title=History | publisher=Laurel Park | access-date=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, [[New York (state)|New York]] businessmen and prominent horsemen, [[Philip J. Dwyer]] and [[James Butler (grocer)|James Butler]] purchased the track and appointed [[Matt Winn]] as the general manager. In 1918 the field was used by Army Engineers as a training camp before deployment to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=28 December 1917|title=Track at Laurel Will Be Used By Army Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, a stable fire broke out with 60 horses saved. In 1947, the Maryland Jockey Club, which owned Timonium and [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]], purchased Laurel Park from the Butler estate with the idea of shifting the Pimlico meeting to Laurel. After the [[Maryland General Assembly]] rejected the idea of replacing Pimlico with Laurel Park, the track was sold in 1950 to [[Morris Schapiro]] who had his youngest son, John D. Schapiro as the track's new president.

From 1950 to 1984, Laurel Park underwent a period of great change. The track was renamed Laurel Race Course and the [[Washington, D.C. International Stakes|Washington, D.C. International]] was introduced at {{frac|1|1|2}} miles on the [[grass|turf]]. In 1953 Laurel opened a new clubhouse and turf club. In 1954, 14 horses were saved from another stable fire. In 1957 the grandstand was remodeled. In an effort to improve conditions for the International, Laurel lengthened its turf course from seven furlongs to one mile in 1959; simultaneously, the main track was extended from one mile to one mile and one-eighth. In 1964, an intentionally set stable fire destroyed 34 horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Arson Suspected In Laurel Fire: Horses Turned Loose|date=5 November 1964|author=Walter Haight}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the trotting track was covered with an artificial 3M "Tartan Turf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 April 1965|title=Synthetic Turf Passes Maryland Test|author=Steve Cady}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurel remodeled its clubhouse and grandstand to accommodate winter racing in 1966, enclosing the track’s seating area with 30,000 square feet of half-inch-thick glass. In 1967, another fire was set on two stables which was mitigated by new sprinklers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=2 Barn Fires at Laurel Called Arson|date=21 December 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Laurel was awarded the summer racing dates in 1982, the track installed an air conditioning system in the grandstand and clubhouse. In 1984, the 34-year Schapiro era ended with the sale of the track.

Laurel entered a new era in December 1984, when governor [[Harry Hughes]]'s selection for Economic Development secretary Frank J. De Francis and his partners, Robert and John "Tommy" Manfuso, purchased the racetrack from Schapiro before racetrack legislation would pose a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Unexpected Journey: The Autobiography of Governor Harry Roe Hughes|author=Harry Roe Hughes|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurel Park Racecourse was updated in 1985 with an innovative creation of the 'Sports Palace'. In August 1989, Frank DeFrancis died and his son, Joe DeFrancis, then served as president of Laurel and Pimlico. In 1994 the track's name returned to "Laurel Park".  Yet more improvements included those to the main entrance, Grandstand interior and backstretch barns.

In 1994, an effort to redevelop land occupied by Laurel Park and its adjacent properties was attempted to relocate the [[Washington Redskins]] Stadium at the crossroads of [[Whiskey Bottom Road]] and Brock Bridge Road. Citizens and clergy launched a successful effort that killed the proposal. A lack of sufficient parking space was a significant factor in the decision.&lt;ref&gt;Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke sought a special exception that would allow a National Football League stadium in an industrial zone east of Laurel in Anne Arundel County. The Redskins also hoped for variances from county codes on matters such as parking and landscaping for the 78,600-seat stadium. Baltimore Sun, August 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, at Laurel Park, the MJC broke ground on a new $1.85 million backstretch housing project, Laurel Commons, in cooperation with Laurel Quality of Life, Inc., the Enterprise Foundation, Inc. and the Ryan Family Foundation, Inc. In addition, Laurel Park, as part of a $16 million multi-year renovation plan, opened four premier Clubhouse areas: "Tycoons," an upscale cigar and brandy bar with an excellent television presentation of racing and other sporting events; "Sunny Jim’s," a simulcast theater with individual carrels, and food &amp; beverage service; "Clocker’s Corner," a casual simulcast theater and cafe in a convenient track-side location and the "Kelso Club," a premier accommodation for VIP customers with concierge service. [[Magna Entertainment Corp.]] purchased the track on July 15, 2002 and announced an alliance with The Maryland Jockey Club designed to raise the level of Maryland thoroughbred racing to new heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last1=Morgan | first1=Jon | last2=Keyser | first2=Tom | date=July 16, 2002 | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/bal-te.sp.tracks16jul16,0,2391592.story | title=Canadian Firm to Buy Pimlico, Laurel Tracks | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] | access-date=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another renovation of Laurel Park's track and facility in 2004 to early January 2005 widened both racing surfaces.

In 2013, following a failed attempt to introduce slot machine gambling, Laurel Park owners Stronach Group announced plans to use the Maryland Racetrack Facility Redevelopment Account to fund year-round racing, facility improvements and a tunnel under the adjacent B&amp;O railroad tracks, connecting to a 1000-unit [[transit-oriented development]] called Laurel Park Station on the [[North Laurel, Maryland|Howard County]] portion of the Racetrack property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Gazette.net|title=Owner pitches Laurel Park redevelopment plan to state panel|author=Sonny Goldreich|url=http://www.gazette.net/article/20130208/NEWS/130209113/0/SEARCH&amp;template=gazette|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the track began using a GPS-based timing system.&lt;ref name=A1&gt;{{Citation |last=Hegarty |first=Matt |year=October 11, 2018 |title=Woodbine, Laurel, Pimlico officially adopt GPS timing system |publisher=DRF |publication-place= |page= |url=https://www.drf.com/news/woodbine-laurel-pimlico-officially-adopt-gps-timing-system |accessdate=October 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highlights of the first 100 years===

* Triple Crown winners Sir Barton, War Admiral, Whirlaway, Secretariat and Affirmed won races at Laurel Park during their Hall of Fame careers.

* Kelso, the only five-time Horse of the Year, won the 1964 Washington D.C. International in his fourth attempt, beating rival Gun Bow. Kelso finished second in his three previous tries in the International, all by less than a length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="86162">These are lists of achievements in major senior-level international [[basketball]], [[3x3 basketball]] and [[wheelchair basketball]] tournaments according to first-place, second-place and third-place results obtained by teams representing different nations. The objective is not to create combined medal tables; the focus is on listing the best positions achieved by teams in major international tournaments, ranking the nations according to the most number of podiums accomplished by teams of these nations.

== Results ==
For the making of these lists, results from following major international tournaments were consulted:

'''Nagoya Kinko''' (long name: '''Nagoya Kinnosachihiko''')&lt;ref name=BR&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Nagoya_Kinko "Nagoya Kinko"], Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed Mar. 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Japanese baseball]] team that played in the [[Japanese Baseball League]] (JBL) before it merged with another team. It was owned by the daily broadsheet ''[[Nagoya Shimbun]]''.&lt;ref name=BR /&gt;

The club was founded as the '''Nagoya Golden Dolphins''' before the 1936 JBL season. In 1937 the team changed its name to Nagoya Kinko. 

The franchise never had a winning record and never placed higher than fourth in the league standings. Few players wanted to play for the team,&lt;ref name=BR /&gt; and it merged with the [[Tsubasa Baseball Club]] after the 1940 season to form the '''[[Taiyō Baseball Club]]'''; that franchise was dissolved following the 1944 JBL season.

'''North Oaks Golf Club''' (NOGC) is located in [[North Oaks, Minnesota]], United States.  The championship [[golf course]] was originally designed by [[golf course architect]] [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1950.  The course is located just inside the private community of North Oaks. It has hosted numerous MGA Championships and a few MN section [[PGA Championship]]s in 1954 and 2000.

==History==
In 1883 [[James J. Hill]], known to be '''The Empire Builder''', purchased a 3,070-acre piece of land from [[Charles D. Gilfillan]].  This piece of land Hill named the North Oaks Farm. When Hill passed on, his son, [[Louis W. Hill]] inherited much of the land. From here the Hill heirs took over and maintained the land. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Malley Elfstrom|first=Kate|title=North Oaks Golf Club|year=1999|publisher=North Oaks Golf Club, Inc|location=North Oaks, MN|page=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fast forwarding to 1950, more land was bought and the planning process began.  [[Stanley Thompson]] began work on designing the course.  It officially opened in the summer 1951. Shortly before it had opened, a “hurricane” hit.  The storm caused two holes to be flooded. &lt;ref name="Morgan1952" /&gt; North Oaks Golf Club became an official private golf club in 1953. The term and process called a [[shotgun start]], was first used at North Oaks Golf Club.  Although it was incorrectly credited three years later to a course in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Malley Elfstrom|first=Kate|title=North Oaks Golf Club|year=1999|publisher=North Oaks Golf Club, Inc|location=North Oaks, MN|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fast-forwarding even more to the year 2007, Lehman Design Group renovated the course. They fixed particular issues while mostly sticking to Thompson’s original design. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Oaks Golf Club Course Renovation|url=http://www.duininckgolf.com/news/north-oaks-golf-club-course-renovation/|publisher=Duininck Golf|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olympic Stadium of Athens "[[Spyros Louis]]"''' ({{lang-el|Ολυμπιακό Στάδιο Αθηνών "Σπύρος Λούης"}}, ''Olympiakó Stádio Athinon "Spyros Louis"'') is a sports [[stadium]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is a part of the [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex]] and is named after the first modern Olympic [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|marathon]] gold medalist in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], [[Spyridon Louis|Spyros Louis]]. The stadium hosts one of the biggest sport clubs in Greece, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]].

==History==
Located in the area of [[Marousi]] in [[Athens]], the stadium was originally designed in 1979 and built in 1980–1982. It was completed in time to host the [[1982 European Championships in Athletics]]. It was inaugurated by the [[President of Greece]] at the time, [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], on 8 September 1982. One year later, in 1983, OAKA Stadium hosted the [[1983 European Cup Final]] between Hamburger SV and Juventus (1-0). In 1987, the stadium hosted the [[1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup]] final between Ajax and Lokomotiv Leipzig (1-0). Olympic stadium is an UEFA category four stadium and is the largest stadium in Grecce. In 1994, OAKA Stadium hosted their second [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final]], this time contested between AC Milan and Barcelona (4-0). It also hosted several events of the [[1991 Mediterranean Games]] and the [[1997 World Championships in Athletics]], sought in order to prove that it was capable of hosting major sporting events after the failure of Athens to win the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] but successfully hosting the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

It was extensively renovated in time for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], including a roof designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]], and innovatively positioned with [[Enerpac]] hydraulics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ien.com/article/olympic-size-solution/3970 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503031851/http://www.ien.com/article/olympic-size-solution/3970 |archivedate=3 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof was added atop the sidelines and completed just in time for the opening of the Games. The stadium was then officially re-opened on 30 July 2004. It hosted the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics|athletics]] events and the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|football]] final at the 2004 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf 2004 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 242, 324.&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] on 13 August 2004, and the [[2004 Summer Olympics#Closing Ceremony|closing ceremony]] on 29 August 2004. In 2007, OAKA Stadium hosted the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final]] between AC Milan and Liverpool (2-1). The stadium's attendance was reduced to 72,000 for the Olympics, the initial capacity was some 75,000, though only 69,618 seats were made publicly available for the track and field events and slightly more for the football final. The turf system consists of natural grass in modular containers which incorporate irrigation and drainage systems.

==Design==
===Construction===
The foundation stone for the Olympic Stadium was laid on 7 January 1980. Its construction was revolutionary and involved the use of a prefabrication method for the 34 sets of pillars supporting the stands (each weighed 600 tons). About 26,000 seats of the lower tier were covered, while the stadium's most striking feature were the four leaning pillars that held its floodlights, each being 62 metres tall. The Athens Olympic Stadium was finally inaugurated in September 1982.
===Renovation===
The stadium was renovated from 2002 until 2004 adding the famous roof for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. The central lawn of O.A.K.A consists of approximately 6.000 plastic capsules inside which thermophile lawn is grown. The capsules are adjoining, their size is 1.2*1.2m and are situated on a flat cement surface of two acres, flanked by two lateral drainage channels. The irrigation of the lawn is achieved by 35 automatically elevated water launchers with the use of programmed irrigation. This system allows the movement of the lawn to an area outside the stadium in order for the surface to be used for different events.Thirty-four entrance gates provide access to the stands. Odd gate numbers (1 to 35) lead to the lower and even numbers (2 to 34) to the upper tier. There are no gates numbered 18 and 36, since the two video-scoreboards are located in their place. Additionally, the stadium features 17 VIP boxes and 3 parking lots. Due to its design, the stadium's tribunes have the ability to empty within 7 minutes.

'''Competition Area'''
 {{Unbulleted list

===Roof===
Designed by the world-known architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] the roof costed €130 million. The two giant arcs have a total span of 304m and a maximum height of 72m. The roof has a total weight of 18,700 tons coverering by 5,000 polycarbonate panels which covers an area of 25,000 sq m. The west arc was assembled 72m from its final position and the east 65m - both later slid into place-. The roof is designed to withstand winds up to 120 km/h and earthquakes up to 8 richter scale.
===Transport===
Access by:

'''Car''' - Exit the city centre to the north via Kifissias Avenue and just follow the roadsigns to "OAKA". If you come from the Attiki Odos ring road, use exit 11 ("Kifissias - Ol. Stadium").

'''Bus''' - Use X14 from Syntagma Square in central Athens. It will take you directly to the Olympic Stadium. Allow at least 30', although this can vary a lot.

'''Metro''' - It is a 25' ride from the city centre ("Omonia"). Use line M1 and get off at "Irini" or "Neratziotissa". From there it is a 10' walk through the Olympic Complex to the stadium.

==Stadium Features==

===Main seating areas===

The stadium is configured in a predominantly northeast-southwest placement with two sides of seating.  Entrance into the stadium is via one of four entrance gates located at the Southwest, Northwest, Southeast, and Northeast of the stadium.  Ticket booths are located near the gates.  Seating access to each of the stadium sides is provided at street level through a covered concourse.  Concessions, six areas in total, as well as twelve rest room facilities are located in the concourse area.  In addition, flat screen televisions are located throughout.  Large photographic murals from games in the earlier days of the stadium are mounted on the concourse walls.

With the exception of the press box and chair back seating sections on the west side, each side of the stadium is basically a mirror image of the other.  Each side is divided into two main levels with one level below street level and the other elevated.  A street level outdoor concourse separates the two levels.  A walkway on the south side of the stadium extends from each of the outdoor concourses and connects the two stadium sides providing easy pedestrian access from one side of the stadium to the other.

===Additional seating===

In addition to the two sides, the Morgan VIP suites located in the '''Montagne Center''' on the north end zone side of the stadium provide 112 seats (16 seats for each of the 7 suites).  The Montagne Center Red Room, located above the VIP suites and overlooking the stadium, can accommodate up to 75 guests.  Overflow attendance can be accommodated by large grassy areas located on both the north and south sides of the stadium.  (Seating in the grassy areas is not included in the stated 16,000 stadium capacity.)  The two southern porch sections of the Montagne Center also provide additional seating.  Additionally, a presidential suite which can hold 25 is located in the press box.  The presidential suite includes a kitchenette.

The outdoor concourses and south side walkway also contain a total of one hundred eight (108) chair-back seats as well as additional space for wheelchair seating. Each side has forty chair-back seats and additional space for wheelchair seating. In addition, the south side walkway includes twenty-eight (28) chair-back seats and wheelchair seating space.  The seating sections were added as part of the stadium's complete renovation in 2009 and were part of stadium enhancements made to make the stadium compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provost Umphrey Stadium Improvements and Athletic Complex Beaumont, Texas|url=http://leoadaly.com/portfolio/lamar-university-provost-umphrey-stadium-improvements-and-athletic-complex/|publisher=Leo A Daly|accessdate=September 13, 2015|quote=The upgrade includes improvements to spectator amenities and concourses, modifications to seating areas to meet ADA requirements, and team training and athletic offices housed in a new south end zone building.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press box===

The two story press box, named the ''Dan F. and Sandra A. Smith Press Box'', includes a media center with seating for 32; a TV broadcast booth; two radio broadcast booths; a kitchenette; restrooms; two camera decks; two coaches booths; scoreboard booth; public address booth; and private suites as well as the 25 seat presidential suite discussed above in the ''Additional seating'' section.&lt;ref name = "press box"&gt;{{cite web|title=Houston couple gives Lamar University engineering, football program $6 million gift|url=http://lamarcardinals.com/news/2009/3/20/Houston_couple_gives_Lamar_University_engineering_football_program_6_million_gift.aspx?path=football|publisher=Lamar University|accessdate=May 10, 2018|date=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Press box access is via an elevator located at the rear of the press box and from west side seating.

===Dauphin Athletic Complex===

The two story [[Dauphin Athletic Complex]], constructed in 2010, is located adjacent to the southern end of the stadium.  The 54,000 sq. ft. complex includes an academic center; a 108-seat team auditorium; meeting rooms; locker rooms for both home and visiting teams; and offices for the athletic director, coaches, and other athletic department personnel.  Also included is the '''J. B. Higgins Weight Room''' with 8,000 sq ft of weight training space, three offices, a storage room, and media room.  The university's main athletic training facility, '''The Beaumont Bone and Joint Institute Sports Medicine Facility''', is also located in the complex. It includes a hydrotherapy pool with Hydroworx 1200 treadmill therapy pool, a plunge pool, electrical stimulation and ultrasound units, and a deep-penetrating vibration therapy device.  The training facility is one of four on campus training facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lamar University 2014 Football Information Guide|url=http://issuu.com/lamarcards/docs/8_by_11|publisher=Lamar University Athletics|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoreboards===

Mounted on top of the Dauphin Athletic Complex is the '''Education First Credit Union scoreboard'''.  The scoreboard and video board is mounted in an 88' x 48' outer frame and includes a high definition 51' x 26' Daktronics video board, one of the largest in NCAA Division I FCS football.&lt;ref name="daktronics.com"/&gt;  Another scoreboard is located near the base of the Morgan Suites on the northern end of the stadium.

==History==
'''Cardinal Stadium''', as it was originally known, was completed in 1964 for a cost of $1,000,000. The original stadium capacity was 17,500.  The stadium was built as the home of the [[Lamar Cardinals football]] team. The football team was disbanded in 1989.  Until plans to reinstate the Lamar Cardinal football program were finalized, the stadium hosted some Ozen High School football home games as well as the university [[soccer]] team for its first two seasons.

Presidential candidate, [[Barry Goldwater]], spoke before an estimated 15,000-18,000 persons at the stadium on October, 15, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Goldwater to Shun Jenkins Case But Not Its Aspects Of Security |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/16/archives/goldwater-to-shun-jenkins-case-but-not-its-aspects-of-security.html |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |date=October 16, 1964 |quote=In his Beaumont speech, before a crowd estimated at 15,000 ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enthusiastic Audience Welcomes Goldwater |url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth499080/m1/1/?q=barry%20goldwater |publisher=The Redbird (Beaumont, TX) |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |page=1 |date=October 23, 1964 |quote=An estimated crowd of more than 18,000 persons filled Cardinal Stadium to hear Sen. Barry Goldwater speak.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 1998, the stadium played host to the [[1998 Southern vs. Prairie View A&amp;M football game]] as a "neutral ground" location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1998/09/20/battling_bands/|publisher=[[CNN|CNN/SI.com]]|accessdate=April 11, 2011|date=September 20, 1998|title=Battle of the bands goes too far}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was the final loss of 80 straight losses for the [[Prairie View A&amp;M Panthers football|Prairie View]] program, but is more well known for a halftime brawl between the [[marching band]]s of the two schools resulting in a two-game suspension for both bands.&lt;ref name="Onnidan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onnidan.com/98-99/news/swac0921.htm|publisher=Onnidan.com|title=SWAC Suspends PVAMU and SU Marching Bands|date=September 21, 1998|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern Jaguars football|Southern]] won the game 37–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=4558&amp;year=1998|publisher=[[College Football Data Warehouse]]|first=David|last=DeLassus|accessdate=April 11, 2011|title=Coaching Records Game-by-Game, Greg Johnson (1998)| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525201101/http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=4558&amp;year=1998| archivedate= 25 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the university started renovation on the newly named '''Provost Umphrey Stadium''' for the return of football in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamar.edu/news-and-events/cardinal-cadence/2009-issues/cardinal-stadium-reborn.html|title=Cardinal Stadium reborn (Provost Umphrey)|publisher=Lamar.edu|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Capacity was reduced to 16,000&lt;ref name="lamarcardinals.com"/&gt; in the 2010 renovation due to modifications in order to make the stadium [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA compliant]].  The modifications resulted in the loss of 1,500 seats.   '''Provost Umphrey Stadium''' renovations and a new adjacent 54,000 sq ft athletic complex, detailed above, were completed for a combined total of $30,000,000. Another component of the stadium renovation included the addition of a new video board&lt;ref name="daktronics.com"/&gt;

==Donations and gifts==
On November 10, 2008, the stadium became Provost Umphrey Stadium in recognition of a $3 million contribution to [[Lamar University]] from the Provost Umphrey law firm and an additional $1 million gift from Walter and Sheila Umphrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamar.edu/newsevents/articles/221_7135.htm|title=$4 million gift from law firm, couple prompts stadium naming|publisher=Lamar.edu|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, 2009, alumnus Dan F. Smith donated $6 million to the University, $1 million of which was earmarked for the return of football. In recognition of this gift the press box bears his name. The press box is detailed above in the ''Stadium Features'' section.&lt;ref name="press box"/&gt;

On February 15, 2010 Education First Federal Credit Union donated $1 million to Lamar Athletics.  In recognition for their support the 51' by 26' ft digital score board will permanently have Education First FCU displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamar.edu/newsevents/news/207_8345.htm|title=Education First FCU gives $1 million as sponsor of LU Athletics|publisher=Lamar.edu|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2010, the Morgan Charitable Foundation on behalf of Glen and Teri Morgan donated an undisclosed amount of money to build the Morgan Suites on the south east side of the [[Montagne Center]]. Seven new suites were built and lease for $25,000 per year with a three-year commitment. The leases include 16 tickets to each home game and parking passes. Revenue from leasing the suites supports football scholarships. Each suite includes a bar with four stools overlooking two tiered rows of 6 seats each, a total of 16 seats. The suites open to the front and feature motorized windows that can be lowered as desired. Each suite includes a small refrigerator and cabinet space. Food and beverage service is available through the university catering vendor at additional charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamar.edu/newsevents/news/207_8639.htm|title=Morgan Suites to enhance football complex|publisher=Lamar.edu|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Redbird Arena''' is a 10,200-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] located in [[Normal, Illinois]], on the campus of [[Illinois State University]]. Built in 1989, the building is notable for its use of a [[Teflon]]-coated roof that gives off a "glow" during night events. Three [[Illinois State Redbirds]] athletic teams use the facility as their home court: [[Illinois State Redbirds men's basketball|men's basketball]], [[Illinois State Redbirds women's basketball|women's basketball]], and [[Illinois State Redbirds women's volleyball|women's volleyball]].&lt;ref&gt;http://goredbirds.com/schedule.aspx?path=wvball&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Illinois State is one of just 10 college volleyball programs to draw more than 250,000 fans in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Redbird Arena|url=http://goredbirds.com/sports/2014/5/12/Facilty_redbird_arena.aspx?id=114|publisher=Illinois State University Department of Athletics|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who enjoy men's basketball and sit in the student section often paint their faces red and wear red t-shirts and become part of "Red Alert", the official student spirit group of Illinois State athletics.

==Amentities==
Redbird Arena boasts new scoreboards installed during the 2006-2007 basketball season.  The center-hung scoreboard has four-sided [[Light-emitting diode|HD]] video boards.  They were initiated at the Bradley game when the court was named after ISU great [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ISU Falls to Bradley|first=Jim|last=Benson|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/sports/isu-falls-to-bradley/article_7a1681f1-a5b7-5901-9f09-f4d39fb39d18.html|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|location=Bloomington–Normal|date=February 4, 2007|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Students Get Real–World Experience at ISU Games|first=Jim|last=Benson|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/sports/students-get-real-world-experience-at-isu-games/article_d0a13394-6b3b-598d-acbf-3bb46b1b9d6a.html|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|location=Bloomington–Normal|date=February 21, 2007|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 2011-2012 basketball season an HD video board between opposing benches courtside was installed.  It was funded and named after sponsor Frontier Communications Company, that also provided new black leather chairs for players and coaches.

==Miscellaneous==
Redbird Arena has hosted a variety of [[Illinois High School Association]] events. It has been the home of the girls' [[volleyball]] tournament since 1990 and the girls' [[basketball]] tournament since 1992. It has also hosted the dual team portion of the state [[wrestling]] tournament and in 2006 hosted the inaugural state competitive [[cheerleading]] meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Good Cheer Name of Game at Redbird|first=Randy|last=Sharer|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/sports/good-cheer-name-of-game-at-redbird/article_8027317a-64f5-5f07-8f5f-5e54e70514b0.html|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|location=Bloomington–Normal|date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robison Field''' is the best-known of several names given to a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[stadium|park]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. It was the home of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] of the [[National League]] from April 27, [[1893 in baseball|1893]] until June 6, [[1920 in baseball|1920]].

==History==
[[File:Fire in the grandstand at League Park (Robison Field), Vandeventer Avenue and Natural Bridge Road, 4 May 1901.jpg|thumb|Fire in the grandstand at League Park (Robison Field), Vandeventer Avenue and Natural Bridge Road, May 4, 1901]]
Today's Cardinals of the National League began in 1882, as the St. Louis Browns of the then-major [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]. They won four championships during the Association's ten-year existence of 1882 through 1891.  During that decade, the team was playing their home games at [[Sportsman's Park]], at the corner of Grand and Dodier. In 1892, four of the Association clubs were absorbed into the National League, and the Association folded. Sportsman's Park remained the home of the Browns during their first NL season.

Although the Browns had been the most successful of the Association clubs, they fell on hard times for some years after the merger. For 1893, owner [[Chris von der Ahe]] moved his team a few blocks to the northwest and opened a '''"New" Sportsman's Park''', on the southeast corner of Natural Bridge and Vandeventer. The move to this particular site was part of a "deal", as the property had been owned by a trolley company, who then ran a trolley line out near the ballpark. The diamond was in the northwest corner of the block. Prairie Avenue was the east (left field) border. Right field, the shorter of the outfields, was bordered by Lexington Avenue.

The ballpark was generations ahead of its time in some ways. Along with the basic stands, Von der Ahe had built an adjoining [[amusement park]], a [[beer garden]], a race track in the outfield, a "shoot-the-shoots" water flume ride, and an artificial lake (used for [[ice skating]] in winter).  The side show notwithstanding, the club performed poorly on the field for most of the 1890s, consistently finishing at or near last place in the 12-team league as Von der Ahe sold off his best players in order to keep the club solvent.

On April 16, 1898, a fire ignited by a dropped and still-burning cigar consumed the grandstands and other structures. A heroic overnight effort was made to construct some temporary seating, and the game scheduled for the 17th was played. Von der Ahe was able to secure financing to rebuild the permanent stands, albeit in a much more modest design than before.[http://www.thisgameofgames.com/home/the-sportsmans-park-fire-of-1898] But this was the last step in the decline of his once-proud franchise. 

In [[1899 in baseball|1899]], Von der Ahe sold the Browns to [[Frank Robison|Frank]] and [[Stanley Robison]]. By then the ballpark was no longer the "New" Sportsman's Park. During the Robison's tenure, the venue was simply called '''League Park'''. It would bear that name through the [[1910 in baseball|1910]] season.

The Robison brothers sought to change the image and reverse the fortunes of their team. They dropped the old "Browns" identity, abandoning that team color and switching to Cardinal red. This would yield a new and lasting nickname. However, for 1899 they are known to historians as the "Perfectos".

The Robisons had previously owned the [[Cleveland Spiders]], and in fact still owned them as the 1899 season began (a situation that would not be allowed today). They stripped Cleveland of its best players, including [[Cy Young]], and sent them to St. Louis. If this made the St. Louis club the "Perfectos", it also unfortunately made the Cleveland club the "Wanderers", as they became known when they were forced to play most of that season (their last) on the road. Despite loading up their roster, the previously cellar-dwelling St. Louis club was only able to improve to fifth place.

Cleveland and three other clubs were contracted after the 1899 season. The Cardinals began the [[1900 in baseball|1900]] season with less competition, but sank back toward the cellar again. The only thing that kept the baseball situation in balance was that the new Browns of the American League generally fared equally poorly in the pennant races.

The wooden ballpark continued to be plagued by fire. On May 4, 1901, a fire began under the main part of the stands, and as with the 1898 fire, the structure was consumed within half an hour. During the rebuilding process, the Robison brothers arranged with the management of Athletic Park (as the "old" Sportsman's Park was being called by then) to play there until yet another wooden stand could be built. However, after playing on the 5th, they went on a month-long road trip, and returned to a newly-rebuilt League Park on June 3.

In its final form, the park was typical for its era: a wooden structure, with a covered grandstand behind home plate and extending to first and third base; open bleachers extending to the left field corner; bleachers in parts of the outfield; and a covered pavilion from first base to the right field corner.

[[Helene Hathaway Britton|Helene Britton]], daughter of Frank Robison, inherited the Cardinals team and the ballpark from her uncle Stanley upon his death in [[1911 in baseball|1911]]. Helene renamed the ballpark '''Robison Field''' as a memorial to her father (who had died in 1908) and her uncle. She held the club for next few seasons, until selling her interest in the team in 1917 to a group that included [[Sam Breadon]].

With the Robison family no longer associated with the team, the park was often called simply '''Cardinal Field''' in its final years. Breadon attained majority ownership in 1920 and decided that the nearly three-decades-old wooden ballpark was no longer adequate.

In mid-season 1920 the Cardinals abandoned this ballpark and moved back to [[Sportsman's Park]], making their debut there on June 6. The park had been rebuilt, owned and occupied by the [[American League]] version of the [[Baltimore Orioles|Browns]] since [[1902 in baseball|1902]].  The "Old" Sportsman's Park would outlive the "New" by some four decades.

==Legacy==

Robison Field was the last remaining major league ballpark that was primarily wooden. The park site continued to be owned by the Cardinals for a few more years. They finally sold the property to the developers of [[Beaumont High School (St. Louis)|Beaumont High School]], which was built on the site and was opened in [[1926 in baseball|1926]]. After their constant on-field struggles at the old park, the club had begun to improve after their move, and with some fresh cash, they were ready to taste success. 1926 would also be the year of the Cardinals' first modern league and [[1926 World Series|World Series]] championship.

Beaumont High School produced a number of major league ballplayers. Its own life cycle ended in the spring of 2014, when it closed.

The '''Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club''' is a private [[Country club|golf club]] and [[golf course]] comprising two 18-hole courses located in [[Old Deer Park]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], south west London.

==Location==

The course lies in an arc of [[Crown Estate]] land on the east bank of the [[River Thames]] which includes [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]] to the north and other parts of Old Deer Park to the south. The Old Deer Park sports ground, used by [[London Welsh RFC]] and other clubs, borders the east of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olddeerpark.co.uk/sitePages.asp?step=4&amp;navID=8&amp;contentID=7 |title=Welcome to Old Deer Park| publisher=Old Deer Park private members' club |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Within the boundaries of the golf course lies the Grade I listed [[Kew Observatory]], established by King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] in 1769. To the SW of the Observatory, under the fairway of the 14th hole of the golf course, lie the foundations of the former Carthusian [[Sheen Priory]], founded by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1414.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[John Cloake|Cloake, John]] |title=Richmond's Great Monastery, The Charterhouse of Jesus of Bethlehem of Shene |publisher=[[Richmond, London#Societies|Richmond Local History Society]] |volume=6, |date=November 1990 |page=51 | isbn=978-0950819860| postscript=. (diagram).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course and club were established in 1892 and [[John Henry Taylor|J. H. Taylor]], one of the famous '[[Great Triumvirate (golf)|Great Triumvirate]]' of Braid, Taylor and Vardon, laid out the 36-hole [[golf course]] on the northern section of Old Deer Park Park. [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]] was the club's first president and the Royal connection continued when the [[Edward VIII|Prince of Wales]] became captain in 1926.

Taylor remained based at the club until 1946 and, along with greenkeeper Peter Lees, developed many features to relieve the otherwise flat landscape. Taylor handed over the role of club professional to [[Henry Cotton (golfer)|Henry Cotton]] who was succeeded by his assistant, [[Max Faulkner]]. Faulkner continued until 1953. [[Jimmy Adams (golfer)|Jimmy Adams]] took over on his return from Australia and held the post until 1969 when [[David Talbot (golfer)|David Talbot]] commenced a long and distinguished run as professional lasting 47 years. Talbot was succeeded by his son, [[Philip Talbot|Philip]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmsgc.co.uk/club/history/ |title=History |publisher=Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001 a fire destroyed the clubhouse and, with it, a substantial collection of memorabilia, portraits, pictures and trophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Meredith |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3002977/Amateur-Golf-Treasured-memories-are-reduced-to-ashes-in-blaze.html |title=Amateur Golf: Treasured memories are reduced to ashes in blaze
|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=10 Apr 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was replaced by a larger one and was opened in November 2003 by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Courses==
The course is divided into two 18-hole courses, an outer and inner course named after famous members of the club.

===JH Taylor Course===

==History==
Limerick Lawn Tennis Club was first established in 1877 in [[Limerick]], [[County Limerick]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=History - Limerick Lawn Tennis Club|url=http://www.lltc.ie/about-us/history |website=www.lltc.ie |publisher=Limerick Lawn Tennis Club |accessdate=31 July 2018 |location=Limerick, Ireland |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the club staged the first Open Championships in Ireland in August 1877 one month after the Wimbledon Championships were inaugurated, the results of that tournament were however not recorded.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was not until 1879 that the first [[Irish Lawn Tennis Championships]] were staged  at the [[Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club|Fitzwilliam Tennis Club]] in Dublin.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
 
In 1878 the first ''South of Ireland Championships'' also known as the ''Limerick Cup'' were founded &lt;ref name="Nieuwland 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nieuwland |first1=Alex |title=Tournament – South of Ireland Championships -  Limerick Cup |url=http://www.tennisarchives.com/tournament/?t=574&amp;n=South%20of%20Ireland%20Championships |website=www.tennisarchives.com |publisher=Idzznew BV |accessdate=31 July 2018 |location=Harlingen, Netherlands |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the men's event was won by Veere St Leger Goold.&lt;ref name="Nieuwland 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The event featured both men's and women's singles and doubles competitions and was the first notable tournament in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] to feature a woman's competition seven years before the [[Wimbledon Championships]] followed suit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1881 the reigning [[1884 Wimbledon Championships – Gentlemen's Singles|Wimbledon Champion]] [[William Renshaw]] and his twin brother [[Ernest Renshaw]] entered the doubles competition. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Between 1884 and 1885 no women's event were staged.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The 1885 and 1886 editions were won by future Wimbledon Champion [[Willoughby Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

Between 1911 and 1912 the championships were won by Irishman Frank Cosbie. &lt;ref name="Nieuwland 2017"/&gt; With the advent of World War One the championships were still held from 1914 and 1919.&lt;ref name="Tennis Ireland"/&gt; Post war the championships were won again by [[Irish Lawn Tennis Championships]] finalist Frank Cosbie three times consecutively 1924 to 1926.&lt;ref name="Nieuwland 2017"/&gt;  The tournament was still staged during World War Two from 1939 to 1945.&lt;ref name="Tennis Ireland"/&gt; Post war the 1953 championships were won by American player Ellis Williamson. &lt;ref name="Nieuwland 2017"/&gt;  In 1975 the men's championships were won Michael. P. Hickey who played in 21 Davis Cup competitions as part of the Irish Team. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; British player [[Ross Matheson (tennis)|Ross Matheson]] won the event in 1991, 1994 and 1996. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Into the 2000's Brian McCarthy was probably the most successful player he won the championships in (2010,2014) and reached the finals on four occasions (2010-11, 2013-16). 

The tournament was part of the pre-open era mens tennis tour from 1878 to 1967. &lt;ref name="Nieuwland 2017"/&gt; Into the [[Open Era]] it did not survive as a  tour tournament on the lucrative [[Grand Prix tennis circuit]] but did remain a fixture on the [[International Tennis Federation]] circuit for a short while until the mid-1990's. The tournament was downgraded again to regional status and continues to operate within the annual tennis tournament circuit of [[Tennis Ireland]].  The championships were staged in June 2018 which was the 141st edition of this tournament it was won by James Halas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tennis Ireland - Hartmann Optometrists 141st South of Ireland Tennis Championships 2018 - General |url=https://ti.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=5FF7EC47-B849-478C-A4FE-653FC109C738&amp;draw=1 |website=ti.tournamentsoftware.com |publisher=Tennis Ireland |accessdate=1 August 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weidner Field''' is a 5,000 seat [[soccer-specific stadium]] built in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. At an altitude of roughly 6,600 feet above sea-level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Security Service Field: Context Matters|first=Dan|last=Fox|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060711&amp;content_id=104479&amp;vkey=news_t551&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t551|work=[[Baseball Prospectus]]|date=July 11, 2006|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stadium is at the highest elevation of any primary home stadium used by a professional team in the [[American Soccer Pyramid|American soccer pyramid]]. The stadium is immediately adjacent to [[Security Service Field]].

After [[Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC]] were awarded a franchise in USL Pro, now known as the [[United Soccer League]], it was announced on June 14, 2014, that the Colorado Springs City Council had approved an agreement that gave the new franchise a ten-year lease on the site.&lt;ref&gt;http://uslpro.uslsoccer.com/home/824281.html&lt;/ref&gt; On March 7, 2016, Sand Creek Stadium had a name proposal approved by the City of Colorado Springs Parks Department, and the name was changed to Switchbacks Stadium.

'''''Youngblood''''' is a 1986 American [[drama (film and television)|drama]] [[sports film]] directed, co-produced, and co-written by [[Peter Markle]], and starring [[Rob Lowe]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Cynthia Gibb]] and is also [[Keanu Reeves]]' second film appearance.

==Plots==
A 17-year-old farmhand from rural New York, Dean Youngblood has dreams of playing in the [[National Hockey League]]. Dean voices these dreams to his father, but receives negative feedback, and it is not until his brother, Kelly convinces their father Blane to let him try that he is granted the chance to travel to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs. At the try-outs, Youngblood demonstrates the abilities which garnered him "92 goals in the New York League" but also displays a lack of physical toughness that is so prized in Canadian junior hockey. This perceived weakness is pounced upon by a brutish player, Carl Racki, who is also trying out for the team and engages him in a fight. Youngblood quickly learns that flashiness and pure athletic ability will not be enough to be successful in this league. Despite being one-punched by Racki, Mustangs head coach Murray Chadwick, a former NHL [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star]] with the [[New York Rangers]], opts to select Youngblood for a spot on the team. He ingratiates himself to the other players through a hazing ritual in which members of the Mustangs pin Youngblood down, and Captain Derek Sutton shaves his testicles. Youngblood meets the coach's daughter Jessie after this incident, and despite his embarrassment, an early attraction is felt.

After his mentor and friend on the team, Derek Sutton, is brutally injured by Racki (now with a rival team), Youngblood returns home to the farm. After a pep-talk by Kelly about the nature of never quitting, Youngblood is inspired to learn how to survive on the ice. Dean's father Blane, who initially disapproved of his son playing, especially after Kelly had been injured ending a promising career, also teaches his son some fighting tricks, stating "You can learn to punch in the barn, but you've got to learn to survive on the ice". Youngblood returns to the team, ready to confront Racki in the final game of the [[Memorial Cup]] playoffs.

The game ends with a dramatic, game-winning goal by Youngblood with 3 seconds left. Youngblood demands to be left in the game as time expires to confront Racki. Youngblood emerges victorious, landing several blows to the face and body of his nemesis Racki, and is carried off the ice on the shoulders of his teammates.

==Reception==

The movie gained a mediocre reception, with critics finding the plot derivative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= PATRICK GOLDSTEIN |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-31/entertainment/ca-2888_1_dean-youngblood |title=Movie Reviews : A Violent 'Youngblood': . . .

==Production==
The filming of ''Youngblood'' took place in the east end of Toronto in the summer of 1984. [[Ted Reeve Arena]] was used as the setting for the interior of the Hamilton Mustangs home rink while Scarborough Gardens Arena was used for the setting of the arena's exterior; a third city arena was also used for filming.&lt;ref name="thn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleischer|first1=David|title=Where the Rob Lowe Cult Classic Youngblood Was Filmed in Toronto|url=http://torontoist.com/2017/01/where-youngblood-was-filmed-in-toronto/|website=Torontoist|publisher=St. Joseph Media|accessdate=August 25, 2017|date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the cast and crew had actual hockey experience and skills, though star Rob Lowe had to learn to skate, and both he and Patrick Swayze, a better skater, used doubles for many of their on-ice skating scenes. Director and writer Peter Markle was a former minor-pro and international player for the USA. Cinematographer [[Mark Irwin]], a Canadian, wore skates and a helmet and devised a special rig for shooting hockey scenes on the ice. The film's hockey consultant [[Eric Nesterenko]] was a two decade NHL veteran who also appeared as the father of the film's lead character. Keanu Reeves played goalie growing up and in high school. [[George Finn (Canadian)|George Finn]], who played villain Carl Racki, was a former OHL enforcer. Many of the other team members were actual NCAA or junior hockey players, some of whom went on to significant NHL careers.&lt;ref name="thn"/&gt;

Lowe later said he "hated" learning how to skate. "I don't like any sport where you're already exhausted when you're done putting on the equipment. But that said, once I got the equipment on and was out on the ice, I loved that. I loved hitting people, being hit, skating. I love the exertion and competition, so that was all great. But it's a lot of work putting all of that shit on! Give me a surfboard and let me just paddle into the ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The AV Club|access-date=1 March 2017|title=Of all his films, Rob Lowe wants you to go back and watch Bad Influence |first=Will|last=Harris|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/all-his-films-rob-lowe-wants-you-go-back-and-watch-239875|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
