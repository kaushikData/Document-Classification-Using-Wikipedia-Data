An '''acoustic transmission line''' is the use of a long duct, which acts as an [[Waveguide (acoustics)|acoustic waveguide]] and is used to produce or transmit sound in an undistorted manner. Technically it is the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[analogy|analog]] of the electrical [[transmission line]], typically conceived as a rigid-walled duct or tube, that is long and thin relative to the [[wavelength]] of [[sound]] present in it. 

Examples of transmission line (TL) related technologies include the (mostly obsolete) [[speaking tube]], which transmitted sound to a different location with minimal loss and distortion, [[wind instrument]]s such as the [[pipe organ]], [[woodwind]] and [[brass instrument|brass]] which can be modeled in part as transmission lines (although their design also involves generating sound, controlling its [[timbre]], and [[coupling]] it efficiently to the open air), and [[Transmission line loudspeaker|transmission line based loudspeakers]] which use the same principle to produce accurate extended low [[Bass (sound)|bass]] frequencies and avoid distortion. The comparison between an acoustic duct and an electrical transmission line is useful in "lumped-element"  modeling of acoustical systems, in which acoustic elements like volumes, tubes, pistons, and screens can be modeled as single elements in a circuit.  With the substitution of pressure for voltage, and volume particle velocity for current, the equations are essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;Beranek, Leo (1954) ''Acoustics''. American Institute of Physics. {{ISBN|978-0883184943}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical transmission lines can be used to describe acoustic tubes and ducts, provided the frequency of the waves in the tube is below the critical frequency, such that they are purely planar. 

== Design principles ==
[[File:TL Phase.jpg|thumb|right|Fig.&amp;nbsp;1 - Relationship between TL length and wavelength]]
[[File:TL measurement.jpg|thumb|Fig.&amp;nbsp;2 - Frequency response (magnitude) measurement of drive unit and TL outputs]]
Phase inversion is achieved by selecting a length of line that is equal to the quarter wavelength of the target lowest frequency. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows a hard boundary at one end (the speaker) and the open-ended line vent at the other. The phase relationship between the bass driver and vent is in phase in the pass band until the frequency approaches the quarter wavelength, when the relationship reaches 90&amp;nbsp;degrees as shown. However by this time the vent is producing most of the output (Fig.&amp;nbsp;2). Because the line is operating over several octaves with the drive unit, cone excursion is reduced, providing higher SPL’s and lower distortion levels, compared with reflex and infinite baffle designs.

The calculation of the length of the line required for a certain bass extension appears to be straightforward, based on a simple formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \frac{344}{\, 4 \times f \,~}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;f\,~~~~&lt;/math&gt; is the sound frequency in [[Hertz (unit)|Hertz (Hz)]]
: 344&amp;nbsp;{{frac|m|s}}  is the speed of sound in air at 20°&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|C]]
: &lt;math&gt;\ell\,~~~~&lt;/math&gt;  is the length of the transmission line in [[meter (unit)|meters]].

The complex loading of the bass drive unit demands specific [[Thiele Small parameters|Thiele-Small driver parameters]] to realise the full benefits of a TL design.  Most drive units in the marketplace are developed for the more common reflex and infinite baffle designs and are usually not suitable for TL loading. High efficiency bass drivers with extended low frequency ability, are usually designed to be extremely light and flexible, having very compliant suspensions. Whilst performing well in a reflex design, these characteristics do not match the demands of a TL design. The drive unit is effectively coupled to a long column of air which has mass. This lowers the resonant frequency of the drive unit, negating the need for a highly compliant device.  Furthermore, the column of air provides greater force on the driver itself than a driver opening onto a large volume of air (in simple terms it provides more resistance to the driver's attempt to move it), so to control the movement of air requires an extremely rigid cone, to avoid deformation and consequent distortion.

The introduction of the absorption materials reduces the velocity of sound through the line, as discovered by Bailey in his original work. Bradbury published his extensive tests to determine this effect in a paper in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society (JAES) in 1976 &lt;ref&gt;L J S Bradbury, “The Use of Fibrous Materials in Loudspeaker Enclosures”, Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, April 1976, pages 404-412&lt;/ref&gt; and his results agreed that heavily damped lines could reduce the velocity of sound by as much as 50%, although 35% is typical in medium damped lines. Bradbury’s tests were carried out using fibrous materials, typically longhaired wool and glass fibre. These kinds of materials, however, produce highly variable effects that are not consistently repeatable for production purposes. They are also liable to produce inconsistencies due to movement, climatic factors and effects over time. High-specification acoustic foams, developed by loudspeaker manufacturers such as PMC, with similar characteristics to longhaired wool, provide repeatable results for consistent production. The density of the polymer, the diameter of the pores and the sculptured profiling are all specified to provide the correct absorption for each speaker model. Quantity and position of the foam is critical to engineer a low-pass acoustic filter that provides adequate attenuation of the upper bass frequencies, whilst allowing an unimpeded path for the low bass frequencies.

== Discovery and development==
[[File:Transmission-line.png|thumb|right|150px|This image is actually an inverted folded horn. You can tell as the throat is larger than near the port opening. A true Transmission Line enclosure is the same width 'vent' throughout.]]
The concept was termed "acoustical labyrinth" by Stromberg-Carlson Co. when used in their console radios beginning in 1936 (see http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/stromberg_acoustical_labyrinth_837.html). This type of loudspeaker enclosure was proposed in October 1965 by Dr A.R. Bailey and A.H. Radford in ''[[Wireless World]]'' (p483-486) magazine. The article postulated that energy from the rear of a driver unit could be essentially absorbed, without damping the cone's motion or superimposing internal reflections and resonance, so Bailey and Radford reasoned that the rear wave could be channeled down a long pipe. If the acoustic energy was absorbed, it would not be available to excite resonances. A pipe of sufficient length could be tapered, and stuffed so that the energy loss was almost complete, minimizing output from the open end. No broad consensus on the ideal taper (expanding, uniform cross-section, or contracting) has been established.


==Uses== 
===Loudspeaker design===
{{main|Transmission line loudspeaker}}
Acoustic transmission lines gained attention in their use within [[loudspeaker]]s in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1965, A R Bailey’s article in Wireless World, “A Non-resonant Loudspeaker Enclosure Design”,&lt;ref&gt;A R Bailey, “A Non-resonant Loudspeaker Enclosure Design”, Wireless World, October 1965, pages 483-486&lt;/ref&gt; detailed a working Transmission Line, which was commercialized by [[John Wright (audiophile designer)|John Wright]] and partners under the brand name [[IMF]] and later [[TDL Electronics|TDL]], and were sold by audiophile [[Irving M. Fried|Irving M. "Bud" Fried]] in the United States.

A transmission line is used in loudspeaker design, to reduce time, phase and resonance related distortions, and in many designs to gain exceptional bass extension to the lower end of human hearing, and in some cases the near-[[infrasonic]] (below 20 Hz). TDL's 1980s reference speaker range (now discontinued) contained models with frequency ranges of 20 Hz upwards, down to 7 Hz upwards, without needing a separate [[subwoofer]]. &lt;ref name="tdl_reference"&gt;http://www.imf-electronics.com/Home/imf/speaker-range/reference-speakers&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irving  M. Fried]], an advocate of TL design, stated that:
: ''"I believe that speakers should preserve the integrity of the signal waveform and the Audio Perfectionist Journal has presented a great deal of information about the importance of time domain performance in loudspeakers. I’m not the only one who appreciates time- and phase-accurate speakers but I have been virtually the only advocate to speak out in print in recent years. There’s a reason for that."''

In practice, the duct is folded inside a conventional shaped cabinet, so that the open end of the duct appears as a vent on the speaker cabinet.  There are many ways in which the duct can be folded and the line is often tapered in cross section to avoid parallel internal surfaces that encourage standing waves. Depending upon the drive unit and quantity – and various physical properties – of absorbent material, the amount of taper will be adjusted during the design process to tune the duct to remove irregularities in its response. The internal partitioning provides substantial bracing for the entire structure, reducing cabinet flexing and colouration. The inside faces of the duct or line, are treated with an absorbent material to provide the correct termination with frequency to load the drive unit as a TL.  A theoretically perfect TL would absorb all frequencies entering the line from the rear of the drive unit but remains theoretical, as it would have to be infinitely long. The physical constraints of the real world, demand that the length of the line must often be less than 4 meters before the cabinet becomes too large for any practical applications, so not all the rear energy can be absorbed by the line. In a realized TL, only the upper bass is TL loaded in the true sense of the term (i.e. fully absorbed); the low bass is allowed to freely radiate from the vent in the cabinet. The line therefore effectively works as a low-pass filter, another crossover point in fact, achieved acoustically by the line and its absorbent filling. Below this “crossover point” the low bass is loaded by the column of air formed by the length of the line.  The length is specified to reverse the phase of the rear output of the drive unit as it exits the vent.  This energy combines with the output of the bass unit, extending its response and effectively creating a second driver.

== Sound ducts as transmission lines ==
A duct for sound propagation also behaves like a transmission line (e.g. air conditioning duct, car muffler, ...). Its length may be similar to the wavelength of the sound passing through it, but the dimensions of its cross-section are normally smaller than one quarter the wavelength.
Sound is introduced at one end of the tube by forcing the pressure across the whole cross-section to vary with time. An almost planar [[wavefront]] travels down the line at the speed of sound. When the wave reaches the end of the transmission line, behaviour depends on what is present at the end of the line. There are three possible scenarios:

# The frequency of the pulse generated at the transducer results in a pressure peak at the terminus exit (odd ordered harmonic open pipe resonance) resulting in effectively low acoustic impedance of the duct and high level of energy transfer.
# The frequency of the pulse generated at the transducer results in a pressure null at the terminus exit (even ordered harmonic  open pipe anti -resonance) resulting in effectively high acoustic impedance of the duct and low level of energy transfer.
# The frequency of the pulse generated at the transducer results in neither a peak or null in which energy transfer is nominal or in keeping with typical energy dissipation with distance from the source.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4607">'''Alberto Alén Pérez''' (1948 in Havana&amp;nbsp;– 14 October 2004) was a [[Cuba]]n [[musicologist]] and [[cellist]].

==Academic formation==

Alén studied [[violoncello]] with Professor Fabio Landa at Alejandro García Caturla Conservatory in [[Marianao]], [[Havana]], and at the Amadeo Roldán Conservatory in the same city.&lt;ref name="Orovio"&gt;{{cite book|author=Orovio, Helio|title= Cuban Music from A to Z|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780822332121}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied psychology at the [[Havana University]] &lt;ref name="Diagnosticar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alén Pérez, Alberto|title=Diagnosticar&gt;Diagnosticar la musicalidad|url= http://www.casa.cult.cu/premios/musicologia/diagnosticar.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and musicology in the [[Instituto Superior de Arte|Higher Institute of Art]] (ISA) where he graduated in 1982.&lt;ref name="Orovio"/&gt;

==Biography==

As a cellist, Alén worked in several orchestras such as the Orquesta Popular de Conciertos founded by Maestro Alfredo Diez Nieto &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gell, Leonardo|title= Alfredo Diez Nieto y la Orquesta Popular de Conciertos|url= http://www.cmbfradio.cu/articulo.php?art=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Orchestra of the Grand Theater of Havana.  He also performed in other orchestras affiliated to the Cuban Radio and Television Network.&lt;ref name="Orovio"/&gt; Alén taught at the Higher Institute of Art (ISA) and worked as researcher at the Center for Research and Development of Cuban Music. He worked also as an adviser for musical programs in Cuban Television. Alberto Alén gave classes and lectures in Cuba, Mexico and [[Algeria]]. His works on musicology include: ''Perspectivas de la investigación musical actual'' (1976), ''La forma de las formas musicales'' (1978) and ''La génesis del espacio musical'' (1986). Also in 1986, Alén received the prestigious [[Casa de Las Américas Prize]] on the musicology category for his book: ''Diagnosticar la musicalidad''.

==Work==

Although Alén's work remains relatively unknown to the general public, it actually represents a relevant contribution to musicology. According to [[Eugene Chadbourne]], “Musicology students might consider making Spanish their Language Major simply to study the works of Alberto Alén... by any standards Alen's most challenging work has been a series of five books written and published between 1976 and 1986”.&lt;ref name="Chadbourne"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chadbourne, Eugene|title= Alberto Alén, Biography|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alberto-alen-mn0002033019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early work: ''La forma de las formas musicales (The form of musical forms)'', is for the musicological science what the Bauhaus investigations and experimentations represented for the modern development of visual arts and design. In this article, Alberto Alén applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to the traditional musical forms analysis. In it he explains, referring to the perception of musical structures: “The visual forms (as well as the audition and tactile forms) are something different from a succession or sum of particular sensations. They are something else. The complex of stimulations that arrive to the retina (or to the Organ of Corti in the case of audition) generate, at a cortical level, – so affirms Pavlov- “functional systems that act integrally as in the case of an elemental conditioned reflex’, where all particular contents of different stimulations is transcended when reflecting their multiple reciprocal relationships, that are continuously exerting influence between each other (González, 1960: 72; Rubinstein, 1967:274).&lt;ref&gt;Alén, Alberto. La forma de las formas musicales. Casa de las Américas. Boletín de Música No. 72. Pag. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

“''Diagnosticar la Musicalidad'', the latest of Alen's tomes, continues an in-depth study of practical musical phenomena that rivals the writings of the German composer and musicologist [[Paul Hindemith]]”&lt;ref name="Chadbourne"/&gt;... states Eugene Chadbuorne in reference to this particular work from Alberto Alén. In Diagnosticar la Musicalidad, the author presents to the general public the results of an extensive investigation, conducted between 1976 and 1983 with the purpose to improve the musical tests performed in Cuban schools to select new music students.&lt;ref name="Diagnosticar"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10477">[[Image:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]] ([[Turkey]]), anastylosis carried out 1970–1978]]
'''Anastylosis''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|αναστήλωσις, -εως}}; {{lang|grc|ανα}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}} = "again", and {{lang|grc|στηλόω}}&lt;!-- or styloo--&gt; = "to erect [a stela &lt;!-- or stylos--&gt; or building]") is an [[archaeological]] term for a reconstruction technique whereby a ruined building or monument is restored using the original architectural elements to the greatest degree possible. It is also sometimes used to refer to a similar technique for restoring broken pottery and other small objects.

== Methodology ==
The intent of anastylosis is to rebuild, from as much of the original materials that is left after usually thousands of years of abuse, historical architectural monuments which have fallen into ruin. This is done by placing components back into their original positions. Where standing buildings are at risk of collapse, the method may entail the preparation of drawings and measurements, piece-by-piece disassembly, and careful reassembly, with new materials as required for structural integrity; occasionally this may include new foundations. When elements or parts are missing, modern materials (of restoration grade) may be substituted, such as [[plaster]], [[cement]], and synthetic [[resin]]s.

The international [[Venice Charter]] of 1964 details criteria for anastylosis. First, the original condition of the structure must be confirmed scientifically. Second, the proper placement of each recovered component must be determined. Third, supplemental components must be limited to those necessary for stability (that is, substitute components may never lie at the top), and must be recognizable as replacement materials. New construction for the sake of filling in apparent lacunae is not allowed.

== Criticism ==
Anastylosis has its detractors in the scientific community. In effect, the method poses several problems:
* No matter how rigorous preparatory studies are, any errors of interpretation will result in errors, often undetectable or incorrigible, in reconstruction.
* Damage to the original components is practically inevitable.
* An element may be, or may have been reused in, or may have originated in, different buildings or monuments from different periods. To use it in one reconstruction obviates its use in others.

== Examples ==
===Greece===
[[File:Anastylose Evans Cnossos 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Anastylosis in [[Knossos]] palace, Crete, Greece, by [[Arthur Evans]]]]
A primitive anastylosis was carried out in 1836 at the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]], where the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] was re-erected from remaining parts. Starting in 1902, the Greek architect Nikolas Balanos used anastylosis in order to restore a collapsed portion of the [[Parthenon]], restore the [[Erechtheion]], and rebuild the Nike Temple a second time. Iron clamps and plugs which had been used earlier had started to rust and had caused heavy damage to the original structure. These were removed and replaced with precious metal clamps. When the temple was once again rebuilt additional newly identified original fragments were added. Currently, anastylosis is being applied to the Parthenon.

===India===
Several monuments protected by [[Archeological Survey of India]] have been restored, including [[Shekhavati]] [[haveli]]s, [[Humayun's Tomb]], etc.

===Indonesia===
[[File:The Borobudur in Java, Indonesia.jpg|200px|thumb|One of the earlier examples of anastylosis: the [[Borobudur]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]
Early in the 20th century, Dutch archaeologists carried out anastylosis of the [[stupa]] at the [[Buddhist]] temple complex at [[Borobudur]] in Java, [[Indonesia]] between 1907 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=zCQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=anastylosis+Borobudur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R8cfiLo3gr&amp;sig=QolFH5HIJqWT7cqoPooQ_NlfusM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0ibq46efZAhUMnpQKHYEyAr8Q6AEIWjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=anastylosis%20Borobudur&amp;f=false|title=Architectural Conservation in Asia: National Experiences and Practice|last=Stubbs|first=John H.|last2=Thomson|first2=Robert G.|date=2016-11-10|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317406198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prambanan]] Hindu temple complex was excavated and was partially reconstructed between 1911 and 1953, also reconstructed using anastylosis method. The recent practice of anastylosis in Indonesia is the reconstruction of [[Kedulan]] temple, built in 869, the temple was buried under volcanic layers for centuries, until was discovered in 1993. The restoration of the entire Kedulan Temple complex is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/02/15/kedulan-temple-restoration-enters-anastylosis-phase.html|title=Kedulan Temple restoration enters anastylosis phase|last=Ajie|first=Stefanus|date=17 February 2018|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
The [[École Française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) began restoration work at [[Angkor Wat]] in 1908. Between 1986 and 1992, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) carried out restoration work on the temple. [[Bayon]] was restored by EFCO followed by Japanese Government Team for the Safeguarding of Angkor (JSA). [[Ta Prohm]] is being restored by [[Archaeological Survey of India]].

The term animalier was first used by the French press and [[Salon (Paris)|salon]] jurors, often as a derogatory term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallery|first1=The Bronze|title=Les Animaliers - The 19th century French movement of Bronze Sculpture|url=http://bronze-gallery.com/info/info.cfm?infoID=9|website=bronze-gallery.com|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris salon thought animal subjects too common for fine art, but with the opening of the new [[Jardin des Plantes|Paris Jardin des Plantes]] zoo and the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes]], interest in animal art increased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukes of [[Duke of Orléans|Orleans]], [[Duke of Luynes|Luynes]], [[Duke of Montpensier|Montpensier]], and [[Duke of Nemours|Nemours]] were soon to become Barye's patrons. In 1882 [[Edouard Manet]] created a portrait in pastel on canvas of the animalier artist Julien de La Rochenoire, which has been owned by the [[Getty Museum]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/265936/edouard-manet-portrait-of-julien-de-la-rochenoire-french-1882/&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project]] The art of George Stubbs became a favorite of collector [[Paul Mellon]], who donated many of Stubbs' paintings to the [[Yale Center for British Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maj|first1=Yale Center for British Art, Lec|title=Zebra|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1669240|website=collections.britishart.yale.edu|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "many animal sculptures were modeled in plaster for exhibition and cast later in bronze editions. The size and variety of an edition depended on the popularity of the piece at exhibition, and many Barye, Mêne, and Fratin pieces were so popular that they were cast in very large editions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metz Collection|url=http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html|website=www.iub.edu|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalier artists ==
[[File:Rembrandt bugatti zoo antwerpen 1910.jpg|thumb|left|Rembrandt Bugatti at the zoo in Antwerp, Belgium]]Artists of the animalier movement were referred to as ''[[les animaliers]]''. Important artists of the animalier movement included [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1796–1875), [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (1884–1916), [[George Stubbs]] (1724–1806), [[Alfred Dedreux]] (1810–1860), [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801–1864),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=21

== Animalier reproductions ==
Many beautiful [[replicas]] are made of animalier sculpture, which may be cast or molded in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as [[cast iron]], [[spelter]], or [[cast bronze]], as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional [[lost wax]] process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auguste Cain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11783">[[Image:Sadlers_Wells_Theatre_edited.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A performance at Sadler's Wells, circa 1808.]]
The [[:Category:Theatrical genres|theatrical genre]] of '''aqua drama''' that was popular in 19th century France, England, and the United States involved flooding the arenas of circuses for recreations of major naval conflicts and similar aquatic events;  some venues participated to such a great extent in this once-popular form as to install permanent water-tanks on stage.&lt;ref name=H17&gt;Harrison, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Water-based spectacles, especially those portraying great naval battles, had been popular in Roman times, when they were known as ''[[naumachia]]'', and the custom was resurrected at various times during the [[Middle Ages]].

== Beginning ==
At the start of the 19th century, the already established [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] came under the management of Charles Dibdin, Jr., a man who had big plans for the theatre's future. In 1804, he installed a large 90x24x3ft water tank that covered the entire stage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jane Austin's World&lt;/ref&gt; The water used to fill the tank was pumped in from the New River, which was adjacent to the theatre, by an Archimedes wheel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Arundell p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; This process took twelve men twelve hours: four men would work in four hour shifts and then rotate until the entire tank was full.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even though the tanks were drained and refilled every three weeks they would become filthy. The water would become dirty not only from the shows, but the actors would bathe in the tank, along with rowdy audience members jumping in to see if the water was real.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lewis&lt;/ref&gt; The Aquatic Drama was popular in the early 19th century, and with Sadler's Wells on the outskirts of London, the audiences, especially in the pit were unruly, loud, and most likely drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb and Edwin 397&lt;/ref&gt; The large water tank that these disruptive audience members would jump into was not the only tank in the theatre, Dibdin Jr. had a second 5x5x5 ft tank above the theatre that was used to simulate waterfalls.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==19th century performances==
The first show Dibdin, Jr. and his crew put on was ''The Siege of Gibralter.'' It opened in 1804, and it was a play that depicted the naval battle between the English Navy and the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A playbill from this performance describes the battle in the show:

''"the conflagration of the town in various places, the defense of the garrison, and attack by the floating batteries, [which] is so faithfully and naturally represented, that when the floating batteries take fire, some blowing up with a dreadful explosion, and others, after burning to the water’s edge, sink to the bottom; while the gallant Sir Roger Curtis appears in his boat to save the drowning Spaniards, the British tars for that purpose plunging into the water, the effect is such as to produce an unprecedented climax of astonishment and applause."''&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 177 ships on the liquid stage, all equipped with live guns and ready for battle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over a hundred real scale sized naval ships would not have been able to fit in Sadler's Wells tanks, so Dibdin hired men who worked at the [[Woolwich Dockyard]]s to build him smaller ships built at a one-inch per foot scale, with exact detailed imitation down to the rigging.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Children were cast as some of the Spanish naval officers manning the tiny ships, and were seen “drowning” after the Spanish had been defeated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The climactic battle of the show was when the English and Spanish went head on, full force, with guns blazing, and the audience members saw incredible spectacle as the English triumphantly destroyed the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Arundell p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823 Sadler's Wells presented the aqua drama entitled ''The Island or Christian and His Comrades'' which dramatized the main events of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny on board HMS ''Bounty'']].&lt;ref name=k55&gt;Kirk, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In order to alleviate a twenty-minute delay between a dry land scene and an aquatic scene, the stage was made to ascend to near the roof of the theatre, in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name=L4&gt;Ledger, p. f&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Fall ==
Eventually the aqua drama slash began to ripple then calm as audience members were no longer pleased with what was being performed at Sadler's Wells. This could have been due to the fact that Dibdin, Jr. tried to reuse many of his 177 ships from the ''Siege of Gibraltar,'' and they were no longer new and exciting to the audiences, but also the Napoleonic wars could have contributed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Dan Cuickshank at BBC News, the Napoleonic wars were raging on during the early 1800s and England dipped its toes in the war waters in 1793 with the new Revolutionary France. After a decade of fighting the two countries finally signed at the Treaty of Amiens, which only lasted a month until in May 1803 war broke out between the two countries again.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cuickshank&lt;/ref&gt; The initial declaration of war could have sparked a rise in nationalism with in England, being a contributing factor into the Dibden, Jr. and his aquatic drama's success. Britain was known for having a large and powerful navy, and they didn't mind flexing their muscles as they asserted themselves as the most powerful navy in Europe at the 1815 after their victory at Waterloo.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The citizens of England would have known how powerful their countries navy was. Seeing shows, such as the ones being put at Sadler's Wells, reminded the English people of how strong their military was, making them feel proud and safe initially. Yet, after a few years into the war the citizens began to realize the horrors of war. According to Mather, they were exposed not only to the death of friends and family along with the fear of invasion, but also the raising of taxes to fund the military.&lt;ref&gt;Mather&lt;/ref&gt; A staggering 11.6 million, which is around 570 million pounds in today's market, was spent on forts alone, most of which were protecting dock yards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The British people became fed up with war, especially naval combat and eventually the tanks were taken out of the theatre. Removal of the tanks due to lack of popularity reflects the English nation's view of war.

== Legacy ==
Even though the tanks were removed in 1824, aqua drama was a part of a long lasting theatre's history. The legacy left behind of aquatic theatre is only a few pages in books and websites, and a painting or two, but Sadler's Wells legacy has been alive and well since Richard Sadler first opened his music house in 1683.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Crompton&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the theatre has seen many triumphs and tragedies. After Charles Dibdin, Jr. resigned there was a false fire alarm during one of the shows which lead to 18 people being stampeded to death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1843 the theater was once again successful, as the actor manager Samuel Philips put on Shakespeare's plays. Sadly, in 1915 the doors to Sadler's Wells were closed. Lilian Baylis, who wanted everyone in London to have the privilege to see the mesmerizing art of theatre, raised the money to reopen Sadler's Wells. The Sadler's Wells legacy continued as it was once again able to share theatre's magic with the people of northern London in 1931. After many years of putting on progressive theatre that entertained northern London, the play aspect of Sadler's Wells eventually faded out, opera and dance became prominent. Around 1945 Sadler's Wells started to become a strictly dance performance hall. The theatre legacy was replaced over the next half century as the once music hall become an outstanding, well respected dance hall. Sadler's Wells still stands today, not in the same building, but with the murky water of Charles Dibdin, Jr.’s aquatic theatre running in its historic veins.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== New York ==
[[New York City]]'s [[Lafayette Circus (Theatre)|Lafayette Circus]] (1826-1829) boasted equipment for both [[Hippodrama|equestrian, or "Hippodrama"]], and aquatic dramas.&lt;ref name=B1136&gt;Banham, p. 1136&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1840, The [[Bowery Theatre]] in [[New York City]] produced ''The Pirates Signal''.  An immense stage was entirely covered by water upon which a full-rigged ship maneuvered. The scene took place upon the decks of the ship itself.&lt;ref name=B17&gt;Brown, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Asperger syndrome''' ('''AS'''), also known as '''Asperger's''', is a [[developmental disorder]] characterized by significant difficulties in [[Interpersonal relationships|social interaction]] and [[nonverbal communication]], along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; As a milder [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal [[language development|language]] and [[cognitive development|intelligence]].&lt;ref name=ICD10&gt;{{cite web|title=F84.5 Asperger syndrome|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F84.5|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 March 2016|date=2015|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102042503/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F84.5|archive-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common.&lt;ref name=McPart2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McPartland J, Klin A | title = Asperger's syndrome | journal = Adolescent Medicine Clinics | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 771–88; abstract xiii | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17030291 | doi = 10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010 | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baskin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baskin JH, Sperber M, Price BH | title = Asperger syndrome revisited | journal = Reviews in Neurological Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16596080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/autism-spectrum-disorder-qf-15-5511/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|access-date=12 March 2016|date=September 2015|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312130731/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/autism-spectrum-disorder-qf-15-5511/index.shtml|archive-date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is probably partly [[Heredity|inherited]], the underlying [[genetics]] have not been determined conclusively.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klauck SM | title = Genetics of autism spectrum disorder | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 714–20 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16721407 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental factors are also believed to play a role.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; [[neuroimaging|Brain imaging]] has not identified a common [[pathology|underlying problem]].&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with [[autism]] and [[pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS).&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|access-date=12 March 2016|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309015426/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml|archive-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains within the tenth edition of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-10) {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=ICD10 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines and physical clumsiness.&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; Interventions may include social skills training, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[speech therapy]], parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety.&lt;ref name=NINDS&gt;{{cite web|author=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|date=31 July 2007|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm|access-date=24 August 2007|title=Asperger syndrome fact sheet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821112426/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm|archive-date=21 August 2007|deadurl=no}} NIH Publication No. 05-5624.&lt;/ref&gt; Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist.&lt;ref name="Woodbury-Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodbury-Smith MR, Volkmar FR | title = Asperger syndrome | journal = European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–11 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18563474 | doi = 10.1007/s00787-008-0701-0 | url = http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/12424 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a [[Autism rights movement|shift in attitudes]] toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Disability &amp; Society|year=2007|volume=22|issue=7|pages=761–76|title='Surplus suffering': differences between organizational understandings of Asperger's syndrome and those people who claim the 'disorder'|vauthors=Clarke J, van Amerom G|doi=10.1080/09687590701659618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BaronCohen2002&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Focus Autism Other Dev Disabl|year=2002|volume=17|issue=3|pages=186–91|title=Is Asperger syndrome necessarily viewed as a disability?|author=Baron-Cohen S|doi=10.1177/10883576020170030801}} A preliminary, freely readable draft, with slightly different wording in the quoted text, is in: {{cite web|url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2002_BC_ASDisability.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=2 December 2008|year=2002|author=Baron-Cohen S|title=Is Asperger's syndrome necessarily a disability?|publisher=Autism Research Centre|location=Cambridge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217140628/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2002_BC_ASDisability.pdf|archive-date=17 December 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
In 2015, Asperger's was estimated to affect 37.2 million people globally.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre /&gt; The syndrome is named after the Austrian [[pediatrician]] [[Hans Asperger]], who in 1944 described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication, had limited [[Empathy#Cognitive empathy|understanding of others' feelings]], and were physically clumsy.&lt;ref name=ha&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=Uta | name-list-format = vanc |title=Autism and Asperger Syndrome|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-38608-1|chapter='Autistic psychopathy' in childhood|pages=37–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went through a period of popularization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klin A, Pauls D, Schultz R, Volkmar F | title = Three diagnostic approaches to Asperger syndrome: implications for research | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–34 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15909408 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-2001-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism?|veditors=Schopler E, Mesibov GB, Kunce LJ|publisher=Plenum press|location=New York|year=1998|chapter=The history of Asperger syndrome|vauthors=Wing L|pages=11–25|isbn=978-0-306-45746-3|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jz_xbeWgG9AC&amp;pg=PA11|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313123459/https://books.google.ca/books?id=jz_xbeWgG9AC&amp;pg=PA11|archive-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodbury-Smith M, Klin A, Volkmar F | title = Asperger's syndrome: a comparison of clinical diagnoses and those made according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 235–40 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15909409 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-2002-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a standardized [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Linda2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Linda|name-list-format=vanc|title=Asperger's Syndrome: Intervening in Schools, Clinics, and Communities|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-62414-9|page=44|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KiSRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313125152/https://books.google.ca/books?id=KiSRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|archive-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many questions and controversies remain about aspects of the disorder.&lt;ref name="Woodbury-Smith" /&gt; There is doubt about whether it is distinct from [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA).&lt;ref name=Klin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klin A | title = [Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview] | journal = Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria | volume = 28 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = S3–11 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16791390 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006000500002 | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-44462006000500002&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929142312/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-44462006000500002&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | archive-date = 29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly because of this, the percentage of people affected is not firmly established.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defined Asperger syndrome (AS) as one of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum of psychological conditions]] that are characterized by abnormalities of [[social interaction]] and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior.

Pervasive developmental disorders|isbn=978-92-4-154419-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism [[phenotype]], which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like [[Trait (biology)|traits]], such as social deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piven J, Palmer P, Jacobi D, Childress D, Arndt S | title = Broader autism phenotype: evidence from a family history study of multiple-incidence autism families | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–90 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9016266 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.154.2.185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other four ASD forms, [[autism]] is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in [[cognitive development]]; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and [[PDD not otherwise specified|pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)]] is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL, Amaral DG | title = Autism spectrum disorders | journal = Neuron | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 355–63 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11144346 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00115-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Autism-stacking-cans 2nd edit.jpg|thumb|People with Asperger syndrome often display restricted or specialized interests, such as this boy's interest in stacking cans.]]
As a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language.&lt;ref name=BehaveNet&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]])|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2000|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD)|chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm|publisher=&lt;!-- pacify Citation bot --&gt;|location=&lt;!-- pacify Citation bot --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided [[verbosity]], restricted [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hannon G, Taylor EP | title = Suicidal behaviour in adolescents and young adults with ASD: findings from a systematic review | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 1197–204 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24201088 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2013.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social interaction ===
{{Further|Asperger syndrome and interpersonal relationships}}
A lack of demonstrated [[empathy]] affects aspects of communal living for persons with Asperger syndrome.&lt;ref name=Baskin /&gt; Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest); a lack of social or emotional [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] (social "games" give-and-take mechanic); and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] in areas such as [[eye contact]], [[facial expression]], posture, and gesture.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;

People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others, compared with those with other, more debilitating forms of [[autism]]; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd".&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Such failures to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings and may come across as insensitive.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display [[selective mutism]], not speaking at all to most people and excessively to specific others. Some may choose only to talk to people they like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview|work=Medscape eMedicine|title=Asperger's Syndrome|author=Brasic JR|date=7 July 2010|access-date=25 November 2010|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223170232/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview|archive-date=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate [[social norms]] in a laboratory context,&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naïve. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;

==== Violent or criminal behavior ====
The [[hypothesis]] that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated, but is not supported by data.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H | title = Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 748–58 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 17805955 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence suggests that children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome are victims rather than offenders.&lt;ref name=Tsatsanis&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsatsanis KD | title = Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–63, vi | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12512398 | doi = 10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00056-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with Asperger syndrome had also other coexisting psychotic [[psychiatric disorders]] such as [[schizoaffective disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newman SS, Ghaziuddin M | title = Violent crime in Asperger syndrome: the role of psychiatric comorbidity | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 1848–52 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18449633 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0580-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior ===
People with Asperger syndrome can display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in [[Stereotypy|stereotyped]] and repetitive ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of objects, or engage in compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns.&lt;ref name=BehaveNet /&gt;

Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking among possible features of AS.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt;

Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM | title = Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–58 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15909401 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.&lt;ref name=BehaveNet /&gt; These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than [[tic]]s, which are usually faster, less rhythmical, and less often symmetrical.&lt;ref name=RapinTS&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapin I | title = Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome | journal = Advances in Neurology | volume = 85 | pages = 89–101 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11530449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA) diagnostic test, a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards non-fiction is common among adults with AS.&lt;ref name=ASAdulthood /&gt;

=== Speech and language ===
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, [[language acquisition]] and use is often atypical.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt; Abnormalities include [[verbosity]]; abrupt transitions; literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance; use of metaphor meaningful only to the speaker; [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory perception deficits]]; unusually [[Pedantic speech|pedantic]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|formal]], or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry|idiosyncratic]] speech; and oddities in loudness, [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; [[Echolalia]] has also been observed in individuals with AS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frith U | title = Social communication and its disorder in autism and Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–53 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 22302727 | doi = 10.1177/026988119601000108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, [[Tangential speech|tangential]] and [[circumstantial speech]], and marked [[verbosity]]. Although [[inflection]] and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky, or loud. Speech may convey a sense of [[Coherence (linguistics)|incoherence]]; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide [[Context (language use)|context]] for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Klin /&gt;

Children with AS may have a sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and such children have often been colloquially called "little professors", but have difficulty understanding [[figurative language]] and tend to use language literally.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, teasing, and sarcasm. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of [[humor]], they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others.&lt;ref name=Kasari /&gt; Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Humor in autism and Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 521–31 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15628606 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-2547-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor and sensory perception ===
Individuals with Asperger syndrome may have signs or symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT, Cook EH, Dawson G, Gordon B, Gravel JS, Johnson CP, Kallen RJ, Levy SE, Minshew NJ, Ozonoff S, Prizant BM, Rapin I, Rogers SJ, Stone WL, Teplin S, Tuchman RF, Volkmar FR | title = The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 439–84 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10638459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021943802493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.

Individuals with AS often have excellent [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]] and [[visual perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frith U | title = Emanuel Miller lecture: confusions and controversies about Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 672–86 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15056300 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00262.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of small changes in patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Psychological factors in autism |vauthors=Prior M, Ozonoff S|pages=69–128|title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders|edition=2nd|editor=Volkmar FR|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-54957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, compared with individuals with [[high-functioning autism]], individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or [[visual memory]].&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual [[sensory processing|sensory]] and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Bogdashina O|title=Sensory Perceptional Issues in Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Different Sensory Experiences, Different Perceptual Worlds|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|year=2003|isbn=978-1-84310-166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD.

Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring [[dexterity]], such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar, and may seem to move awkwardly or feel "uncomfortable in their own skin". They may be poorly coordinated or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with [[motor coordination]].&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klin" /&gt; They may show problems with [[proprioception]] (sensation of body position) on measures of [[developmental coordination disorder]] ([[motor planning]] disorder), balance, [[tandem gait]], and finger-thumb apposition. There is no evidence that these motor skills problems differentiate AS from other high-functioning ASDs.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt;

Children with AS are more likely to have sleep problems, including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[Middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polimeni MA, Richdale AL, Francis AJ | title = A survey of sleep problems in autism, Asperger's disorder and typically developing children | journal = Journal of Intellectual Disability Research | volume = 49 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 260–68 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15816813 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00642.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tani /&gt; AS is also associated with high levels of [[alexithymia]], which is difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Alexithymia and AS:

== Causes ==
{{Further|Causes of autism}}
Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the [[Expressivity (genetics)|expression]] of autism, given the [[phenotypic]] variability seen in children with AS.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt; Evidence for a [[Behavioral genetics|genetic link]] is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading).&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; Most [[behavioral genetic]] research suggests that all [[Heritability of autism|autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms]], but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt; There is probably a common group of genes where particular [[allele]]s render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt;

A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to [[Teratology#Teratogenic agents|teratogens]] (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]]. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that ASD arises very early in development.&lt;ref name=Arndt&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM | title = The teratology of autism | journal = International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 189–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15749245 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[environmental factor]]s have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutter M | title = Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning | journal = Acta Paediatrica | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–15 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15858952 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x | authorlink = Michael Rutter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
{{Main|Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome}}
Standard diagnostic criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities, and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development. Unlike the international standard,&lt;ref name="ICD-10-F84.0" /&gt; the [[DSM-IV-TR]] criteria also required significant impairment in day-to-day functioning;&lt;ref name=BehaveNet /&gt; [[DSM-5]] eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis in 2013, and folded it into the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref name=DSMV /&gt; Other sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed by [[Peter Szatmari#Diagnostic criteria for Asperger Syndrome|Szatmari ''et al.'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szatmari P, Bremner R, Nagy J | title = Asperger's syndrome: a review of clinical features | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

Diagnosis is most commonly made between the ages of four and eleven.&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt; A comprehensive assessment involves a multidisciplinary team&lt;ref name="Baskin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald /&gt; that observes across multiple settings,&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt; and includes neurological and genetic assessment as well as tests for cognition, psychomotor function, verbal and nonverbal strengths and weaknesses, style of learning, and skills for independent living.&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; The "gold standard" in diagnosing ASDs combines clinical judgment with the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R), a semistructured parent interview; and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS), a conversation and play-based interview with the child.&lt;ref name="Woodbury-Smith" /&gt; Delayed or mistaken diagnosis can be traumatic for individuals and families; for example, misdiagnosis can lead to medications that worsen behavior.&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald /&gt;&lt;ref name="leskovec"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leskovec TJ, Rowles BM, Findling RL | title = Pharmacological treatment options for autism spectrum disorders in children and adolescents | journal = Harvard Review of Psychiatry | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–112 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18415882 | doi = 10.1080/10673220802075852 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdiagnosis and [[overdiagnosis]] may be problems. The cost and difficulty of [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] and assessment can delay diagnosis. Conversely, the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has motivated providers to overdiagnose ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shattuck PT, Grosse SD | title = Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–35 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17563895 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are indications AS has been diagnosed more frequently in recent years, partly as a residual diagnosis for children of normal intelligence who are not autistic but have social difficulties.&lt;ref name="Klin-Volkmar" /&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Many children with AS are initially misdiagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref name="McPart2006" /&gt; Diagnosing adults is more challenging, as standard diagnostic criteria are designed for children and the expression of AS changes with age.&lt;ref name=LehnhardtDiffDiag2013rev /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tantam D | title = The challenge of adolescents and adults with Asperger syndrome | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–63, vii–viii | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12512403 | doi = 10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00053-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough [[medical history]] gained from both the individual and other people who know the person, focusing on childhood behavior.&lt;ref name="ASAdulthood"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roy M, Dillo W, Emrich HM, Ohlmeier MD | title = Asperger's syndrome in adulthood | journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt International | volume = 106 | issue = 5 | pages = 59–64 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19562011 | pmc = 2695286 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2009.0059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screening ==
Parents of children with Asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age.&lt;ref name=Foster /&gt; Developmental screening during a routine [[check-up]] by a [[general practitioner]] or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation.&lt;ref name=McPart2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there are no concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siu AL, Bibbins-Domingo K, Grossman DC, Baumann LC, Davidson KW, Ebell M, García FA, Gillman M, Herzstein J, Kemper AR, Krist AH, Kurth AE, Owens DK, Phillips WR, Phipps MG, Pignone MP | title = Screening for Autism Spectrum Disorder in Young Children: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 7 | pages = 691–96 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26881372 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.0018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequency estimates vary enormously.

The children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by [[social isolation]].&lt;ref name=NINDS /&gt; Fifty years later, several standardizations of AS as a [[medical diagnosis]] were tentatively proposed, many of which diverge significantly from Asperger's original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hippler K, Klicpera C | title = A retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of 'autistic psychopaths' diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the University Children's Hospital, Vienna | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

People identifying with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as ''aspies'' (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Willey LH|title=Pretending to be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|pages=71, 104|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85302-749-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[neurotypical]]'' (abbreviated ''NT'') describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical and is often used to refer to non-autistic (or ''allistic'') people.

Internet sites like [[Wrong Planet]] have made it easier for individuals to connect.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

Some autistic people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex [[syndrome]]s rather than diseases that must be cured.

By contrast, Pier Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaarsma P, Welin S | title = Autism as a natural human variation: reflections on the claims of the neurodiversity movement | journal = Health Care Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21311979 | doi = 10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 | url = http://www.imh.liu.se/avd_halsa_samhalle/filarkiv1/1.264263/JaarsmaWelin2011Autismasanaturalvariation.pdf | format = PDF | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101015957/http://www.imh.liu.se/avd_halsa_samhalle/filarkiv1/1.264263/JaarsmaWelin2011Autismasanaturalvariation.pdf | df = dmy | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 1 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They say that "higher functioning" individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis [...] some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics.

'''BREEAM''' ('''Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method'''), first published by the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BREEAM: What is BREEAM?|url=http://www.breeam.org/about.jsp?id=66|publisher=Building Research Establishment|accessdate=8 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194348/http://www.breeam.org/about.jsp?id=66|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the world's longest established method of assessing, rating, and certifying the [[Sustainable development|sustainability]] of buildings.  More than 250,000 buildings have been BREEAM-certified and over a million are registered for certification – in more than 50 countries worldwide. BREEAM also has a tool which focuses on neighborhood development. 

==Purpose==
'''BREEAM''' is an assessment using scientifically based [[Sustainability metrics and indices]] that covers a range of environmental issues. Its categories evaluate energy and water use, health and wellbeing, pollution, transport, materials, waste, ecology and management processes. Buildings are rated and certified on a scale of 'Pass', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent' and 'Outstanding'.  It is carried out by independent, licensed assessors.

It works to raise awareness amongst owners, occupiers and designers of the benefits of taking a sustainability approach. It helps them to successfully adopt sustainable solutions in a cost effective manner, and provides market recognition of their achievements. It aims to reduce the negative effects of construction and development on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowe, Watts|first=Jack, Norman|year=2011|title=An Evaluation of A BREEAM Case Study Project|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/7585/1/2011_3(1)_watts.pdf|journal=Sheffield Hallam University Built Environment Research Transaction|volume=|pages=42-53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Work on creating BREEAM began at the [[Building Research Establishment]] (based in [[Watford]], [[England]], [[UK]]) in 1988. The first version for assessing new office buildings was launched in 1990. This was followed by versions for other buildings including superstores, industrial units and existing offices.

In 1998 there was a major revamp of the '''BREEAM Offices standard''', and the scheme's layout, with features such as weighting for different sustainability issues, was established. The development of BREEAM then accelerated with annual updates and variations for other building types such as retail premises being introduced.

A version of BREEAM for new homes called [[EcoHomes]] was launched in 2000. This scheme was later used as the basis of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]], which was developed by BRE for the UK Government in 2006/7 and replaced EcoHomes in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. In 2014, the Government in England signalled the winding down the Code for Sustainable homes, since then BRE has developed the Home Quality Mark which is part of the BREEAM family of schemes. 

An extensive update of all BREEAM schemes in 2008 resulted in the introduction of mandatory post-construction reviews, minimum standards and innovation credits. International versions of BREEAM were also launched that year.

Another major update in 2011 resulted in the launch of BREEAM New Construction, which is now used to assess and certify all new UK buildings. This revision included the reclassification and consolidation of issues and criteria to further streamline the BREEAM process. The latest update of BREEAM UK New Construction was launched in March 2018 at [[Ecobuild]].

==Scope==
BREEAM has expanded from its original focus on individual new buildings at the construction stage to encompass the whole life cycle of buildings from planning to in-use and refurbishment. Its regular revisions and updates are driven by the ongoing need to improve sustainability, respond to feedback from industry and support the UK's sustainability strategies and commitments.

Highly flexible, the BREEAM standard can be applied to virtually any building and location, with versions for new buildings, existing buildings, refurbishment projects and large developments:

'''BREEAM New Construction''' is the BREEAM standard against which the sustainability of new, non-residential buildings in the UK is assessed. Developers and their project teams use the scheme at key stages in the design and procurement process to measure, evaluate, improve and reflect the performance of their buildings.

'''BREEAM International New Construction''' is the BREEAM standard for assessing the sustainability of new residential and non-residential buildings in countries around the world, except for the UK and other countries with a national BREEAM scheme (see below). This scheme makes use of assessment criteria that take account of the circumstances, priorities, codes and standards of the country or region in which the development is located.

'''BREEAM In-Use''' is a scheme to help building managers reduce the running costs and improve the environmental performance of existing buildings. It has three parts – Parts 1 (building asset) and 2 (building management) are relevant to all non-domestic, commercial, industrial, retail and institutional buildings. Part 3 (occupier management) of the BREEAM In-Use certification scheme is currently restricted to offices. BREEAM In-Use is widely used by members of the International Sustainability Alliance (ISA) which provides a platform for certification against the scheme.

'''BREEAM Refurbishment''' provides a design and assessment method for sustainable housing refurbishment projects, helping to cost effectively improve the sustainability and environmental performance of existing dwellings in a robust way.
A scheme for non-housing refurbishment projects is being developed and is targeted for launch in early 2014. The launch date will be announced once the piloting and independent peer review processes has been completed.

'''BREEAM Communities''' focusses on the [[Urban planning|masterplanning]] of whole communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharifi|first=Ayyoob|author2=Akito Murayama|title=Neighborhood Sustainability Assessment in Action: Cross-Evaluation of Three Assessment Systems and Their Cases from the US, the UK, and Japan|journal=Building and Environment|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.11.006|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharifi|first=Ayyoob|author2=Murayama, Akito|title=Viability of using global standards for neighbourhood sustainability assessment: insights from a comparative case study|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|date=28 January 2014|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/09640568.2013.866077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is aimed at helping construction industry professionals to design places that people want to live and work in, are good for the environment and are economically successful.

BREEAM includes several sustainability categories for the assessment, generally

* Management
* Energy
* Health &amp; wellbeing
* Transport
* Water
* Materials
* Waste
* Land use and ecology
* Pollution

Home Quality Mark was launched in 2015 as part of the BREEAM family of schemes. It rates new homes on their overall quality and sustainability, then provides further indicators on the homes impact upon the occupants 'Running costs', 'Health and wellbeing' and 'Environmental footprint'.

==National Operators==
BREEAM is used in more than 70 countries, with several in Europe having gone a stage further to develop country-specific BREEAM schemes operated by National Scheme Operators (NSOs). There are currently NSOs affiliated to BREEAM in:

*''' [[Netherlands]]''' – the Dutch Green Building Council operates BREEAM NL
*'''[[Spain]]''' – the Instituto Tecnológico de Galicia operates BREEAM ES [http://www.breeam.es www.breeam.es]
*'''[[Norway]]''' – the Norwegian Green Building Council operates BREEAM NOR
*'''[[Sweden]]''' – the Swedish Green Building Council operates BREEAM SE
*'''[[Germany]]''' – the German Institute for Sustainable Real Estate (DIFNI) is operating BREEAM DE.

Schemes developed by NSOs can take any format as long as they comply with a set of overarching requirements laid down in the Code for a Sustainable Built Environment. They can be produced from scratch by adapting current BREEAM schemes to the local context, or by developing existing local schemes.

==The cost and value of sustainability==
A growing body of research evidence is challenging the perception, still held by many, that sustainable buildings are significantly more costly to design and build than those that simply adhere to regulatory requirements. Research by the [[Sweett Group]]&lt;ref&gt;Sweett Group, BRE. Putting a price on sustainability – an update. IHS BRE Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; into projects using BREEAM, for example, demonstrates that sustainable options often add little or no capital cost to a development project. Where such measures do incur additional costs, these can frequently be paid back through lower running expenses, ultimately leading to saving over the life of the building.

Research studies have also highlighted the enhanced value and quality of sustainable buildings. Achieving the standards required by BREEAM requires careful planning, design, specification and detailing, and a good working relationship between the client and project team – the very qualities that can produce better buildings and better conditions for building users.&lt;ref&gt;Yates A. Sustainable Buildings : benefits for occupiers/designers/investors and developers/constructors. BRE IP 13/03 Parts 1-4. BRE Bookshop, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey commissioned by [[Schneider Electric]] and undertaken by [[BSRIA]]&lt;ref&gt;BSRIA in association with Schneider Electric. The Value of BREEAM. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the experiences of a wide range of companies that had used BREEAM. The findings included, for example, that 88% think it is a good thing, 96% would use the scheme again and 88% would recommend BREEAM to others.

The greater efficiency and quality associated with sustainability are also helping to make such building more commercially successful. There is growing evidence, for example, that BREEAM-rated buildings provide increased rates of return for investors, and increased rental rates and sales premiums for developers and owners. A [[Maastricht University]] document, published by [[RICS]] Research,&lt;ref&gt;Chegut A, Eicholtz P, Kok N. Supply, Demand and the Value of Green Buildings. Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported on a study of the effect of BREEAM certification on office buildings in London from 2000–2009. It found, for example, that these buildings achieved a 21% premium on transaction prices and an 18% premium on rents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7671">'''Certified Backyard Wildlife Habitat''' is a program of the [[National Wildlife Federation]] that encourages homeowners in the United States to manage their [[gardens]] and yards as a [[wildlife garden]], with the goal of maintaining healthy and diverse animal [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s.  The program began in 1973.  By 1998, it had impacted more than 21,000 yards and, as of 2006, has certified over 60,000 'backyards'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danforth, Peter |year=2005 |title=An Evaluation of the National Wildlife Federation's Schoolyard Habitat Program in the Houston Independent School District |format=PDF |work=An Evaluation of the National Wildlife Federation's Schoolyard Habitat Program in the Houston Independent School District |url=http://www.peecworks.org/PEEC/PEEC_Research/0032637E-007EA7AB.9/Danforth%20schoolyard%20habitat%202005.pdf |accessdate=2006-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080613/http://www.peecworks.org/PEEC/PEEC_Research/0032637E-007EA7AB.9/Danforth%20schoolyard%20habitat%202005.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joyce, Stephanie |year=2000 |title=Why the Grass Isn't Always Greener |work=Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 106, Number 8, August 1998 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/docs/1998/106-8/focus.html |accessdate=2006-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013181443/http://www.ehponline.org/docs/1998/106-8/focus.html |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=National Wildlife Federation | year=2006 | title=Get Started!

==Certification==
To be a certified Backyard Wildlife Habitat, a garden or yard, or any outdoor space from a balcony up to a multi-acre tract of land, must offer food, water, shelter, and a place for raising young to [[beneficial insect]]s or animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Lerner, Joel M. | title=Creating a Backyard Haven for Fauna | work=Washington Post, Saturday, January 7, 2006 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/06/AR2006010600767.html?nav=rss_realestate/own | accessdate=2006-05-25 | date=2006-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time the Federation has introduced variants or expansions of the program for schoolyards and for communities.

In order for a backyard to be certified as a Backyard Wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation, the space must do all of the following: provide food, water, cover, a place to raise young, and be maintained in a way that has a positive effect o n the health of the soil, air, water, and habitat for native wildlife.  More specifically, the presence of native forbs, shrubs, and trees is necessary to provide food.  Water can be supplied by natural features such as a streams, ponds, or wetlands, or by human-made features such as bird baths.  Native vegetation can also provide cover and places for wildlife to raise their young, as can brush piles or dead trees.  With all of these features in place, it is crucial that the land be cared for thoughtfully and as naturally as possible.  Avoid the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, reduce the area that turf grass occupies, utilize mulch obtained from sustainable forestry practices, and minimize water use in order to maintain the integrity of the soil, air, and water in and outside of the habitat.

== Effectiveness and success ==
Prior to 2004 there was no scientific study as to whether backyard habitats actually help butterflies.  A study published in 2004 of the effect on ''[[Pipevine swallowtail|Battus philenor]]'' in the San Francisco area found that gardens where the host plants were more than 40 years old, the gardens were as good as natural sites, where the host plants were less than eight years old the species was unlikely to visit, and in between the butterflies laid eggs but these had an inferior survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Levy, Jacqueline M.  |author2=Connor, Edward F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2000 | title=Are gardens effective in butterfly conservation? A case study with the pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor| work=Are gardens effective in butterfly conservation? A case study with the pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor | url=http://www.springerlink.com/(1o5epsfisxgwih554yrkk3j5)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,9;journal,7,36;linkingpublicationresults,1:100177,1 | accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no scientific study has been done that has studied Certified Wildlife Habitats, as defined above, specifically in terms of increased native biodiversity, extensive investigation has been made into the biodiversity benefits of using native plants in suburban and urban native landscapes in general.  An article published in Conservation Biology addresses the need to enhance the habitat value of suburban and urban spaces, which have been identified as a primary cause of decline in many threatened or endangered species, and promotes these areas as having potential for social and educational value as well.  The author asserts that using a more balanced approach to [[conservation biology]] that addresses more densely populated areas, rather than one that focuses mainly on relatively undisturbed areas, can help to mitigate effects of human land use (Miller, 2002).

==Native plants use==
One study that was published in Conservation Biology reported that [[native plant]]s supported more [[species]] of [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]] than [[introduced species|introduced plants]] (Tallamy, 2009).  Another study, which studied species richness and diversity of small [[mammal]]s, recommended planting native trees along [[riparian zone]] stream corridors in order to promote more diversity of small mammals in suburban and urban parks after finding populations resembling natural conditions in parks managed for passive recreation as compared to those containing manicured habitats surrounded by human-modified landscapes (Mahan, 2005).  A second study compared properties landscaped with entirely [[native plant]]s with those containing a mix of native and non-native plants.  Results showed that the native properties supported significantly higher species richness and diversity of caterpillars and birds, as well as greater numbers of breeding pairs and biomass of native species (Burghardt, 2008).

The '''Baroque''' ({{IPAc-en|US|b|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) is a highly ornate and often extravagant [[Style (visual arts)|style]] of architecture, art and music that flourished in Europe from the early 17th until the mid-18th century.  It followed the [[Renaissance style]] and preceded the [[Rococo]] (in the past often referred to as "late Baroque") and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. It was encouraged by the [[Catholic Church]] as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of [[Protestant]] architecture, art and music, though [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed in parts of Europe as well.&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baroque style used contrast, movement,  exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe.  The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome,  then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria and southern Germany. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called ''[[rocaille]]'' or ''[[Rococo]]'', which appeared in France and central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.

The word ''baroque'' was a Portuguese term for a pearl (barocco) with an irregular shape. Cognates for the term in other Romance languages include: ''barroco'' in Portuguese, ''barrueco''&lt;!--Antes de corregir esto al "barroco", por favor, verifique la fuente citada, y tenga en cuenta que esta palabra es un sustantivo que significa "perla barroca".--&gt; in Spanish, and ''barocco'' in Italian.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary on-line definition of Baroque&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in French to describe pearls in a 1531 inventory of [[Charles V of France|Charles V's]] treasures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=CMdwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR28&amp;lpg=PR28&amp;dq=baroque+1531+Oxford+English+Dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zptCm4Wxki&amp;sig=45xkAmnoROBehwvsaY3xADkg_jc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE1rnTsNDYAhULtRQKHZrrBXQQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%201531%20Oxford%20English%20Dictionary&amp;f=false Michael Meere, ''French Renaissance and Baroque Drama: Text, Performance, Theory''], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, {{ISBN|1611495490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the term was usually used to describe music.  In an anonymous satirical review of the première of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' in October 1733, which was printed in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and composer as well as philosopher,  wrote in 1768 in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'':   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"&gt;''Encyclopedie''; ''Lettre sur la Musique Francaise'' under the direction of [[Denis Diderot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first used to describe the period of art that followed the [[Renaissance]] in 1855 by the Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] in an article in the journal ''[[Cicerone|Le Cicerone]]''. He used the term to attack the movement for subverting the values of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, "Les Styles en Architecture'', (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "style baroque" did not enter into the [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|dictionary]] of the [[Académie française]] until 1878, when it lost its original negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |chapter=What is Baroque? |title=Three Essays on Style |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1995 |page=19 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1888, the art historian [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] published the first serious academic work on the style, ''Renaissance und Barock'', which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, ''Les Styles en Architecture'' (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture: origins and characteristics==
{{Main|Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Triumph of the Name of Jesus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Quadratura'' or [[trompe-l'œil]]  ceiling of the Church of the Jesu, Rome, by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] (1669–1683)]]
The Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the [[Catholic Church]] at the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545–63, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The first phase of the [[Counter-Reformation]] had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers.  The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, J. Quentin (1953). [http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.01(1952-55)/MH.1(1953)2/orig05.pdf The Influence of Italian Mannerism Upon Maltese Architecture]. ''Melitensiawath''.

Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (Belmont, CA: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005), p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin’s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city’s Cathedral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth, The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
Another feature of baroque churches are the ''quadratura''; [[trompe-l'œil]] paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. ''Quadratura'' paintings of [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church.  Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective,  to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real.

The interiors of baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque,  and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome.  The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] (1647–53) and the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|Baldachino of St. Peter]] (1623–34), both by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was "compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter’s in Rome".&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;

The twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light.
The [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]] was another characteristic feature of baroque decoration.  These were large plaques of carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions.  For the [[Palazzo Spada]] in Rome, Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician.

===Italian Baroque architecture===
[[File:Basilica di San Pietro in Vaticano September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (early 17th century)]]
[[File:Santa Maria della Salute in Venice 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Santa Maria della Salute]], Venice (1631–1687)]]
The first building in Rome to have a Baroque facade was the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance facades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented.

In Rome in 1605, [[Paul V]] became the first of series of [[popes]] who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colors and dramatic effects.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1606–1619), and the new nave and loggia which connected the facade to Michelangelo's dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide facade, and the contrast on the facade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes [[Urban VIII]] and [[Alexander VII]]. The sculptor and architect [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peter's Square (1656 to 1667). The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theater.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose major work was the Church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains (1634–46).  The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"/&gt;

Painted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and [[trompe-l'œil]] architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included ''The Entry of Saint Ignace into Paradise'' by [[Andrea Pozzo]] (1685–1695) in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of Saint Ignatius]] in Rome, and ''The triumph of the name of Jesus'' by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome (1669–1683), which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy:  It appeared in Venice in the church of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] (1631–1687) by [[Baldassare Longhena]], a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola.  It appeared also in Turin, notably in the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]]  (1668–1694) by [[Guarino Guarini]]. The style also began to be used in palaces;  Guarini designed the [[Palazzo Carignano]] in Turin, while Longhena designed the [[Ca' Rezzonico]] on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], (1657), finished by [[Giorgio Massari]] with decorated with paintings by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pages 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of massive earthquakes in [[Sicily]] required the rebuilding of most of the, and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style.

===Spanish Baroque architecture===
{{Main|Spanish Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Basílica de Santiago 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The towers of the Cathedral of [[Santiago de Compostela]] by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]] (1680 (center tower) and 1738–50)]]
[[File:Palacio San Telmo facade Seville Spain.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Palace of San Telmo]], [[Seville]] (1682)]]
The Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque architecture.  The first major work in the style was the San Isidro Chapel in [[Madrid]], begun in 1643 by [[Pedro de la Torre]].  It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cathedral in [[Santiago de Compostela]] was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly-ornate bell tower (1680), then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the ''Obradorio'', added between 1738 and 1750 by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]]. Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the [[Palace of San Telmo]] in [[Seville]] by [[Leonardo de Figueroa]].&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"&gt;Cabanne (1988) pgs. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Granada]] had only been liberated from the Moors in the 15th century, and had its own distinct variety of Baroque.  The painter, sculptor and architect [[Alonso Cano]] designed the Baroque interior of [[Granada Cathedral]] between 1652 and his death in 1657.  It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor.

Some of the most and ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the period was designed by the brothers [[Churriguera]], who worked primarily in [[Salamanca]] and Madrid. The [[Church of San Esteban (Salamanca)|Church of San Esteban]] in Salamanca (1693) is one of the most ornate baroque churches anywhere. Their other works include the buildings on the city's main square, the [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor of Salamanca]] (1729).&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

Other notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include [[Pedro de Ribera]], a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Royal Hospice of San Fernando in Madrid, and [[Narciso Tomé]], who designed the celebrated [[El Transparente]] altarpiece at [[Toledo Cathedral]] (1729–32) which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards.&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

The architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain;  their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The Church built by the Jesuits for a college in [[Tepotzotlán]], with its ornate Baroque facade and tower, is a good example.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe and ''Rococo'' (1740s–1770s)===
{{Main|Rococo}}
[[File:Chram sv Mikulase interier oltar od vchodu.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9| [[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)]] Prague (1704–1755)]]

[[File:Wies altar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Wiesekirche in Bavaria by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] (1745–1754)]]
From 1680 to 1750,  many highly ornate cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage churches were built in central Europe, in Bavaria, Austria, and what is now the Czech Republic.  Some were in [[Rococo]] style,  a distinct, more flamboyant and asymmetric style which emerged out of the Baroque, then replaced it in Central Europe in the first half of the 18th century, until it was replaced in turn by classicism.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéristique des Styles'' (2014), page 92&lt;/ref&gt; 

The princes of the multitude of states in that region also chose Baroque or Rococo for their palaces and residences, and often used Italian-trained architects to construct them.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pp. 89–94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable architects included Johann Fischer von Erlach, [[Lukas von Hildebrandt]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] in Bavaria, [[Balthasar Neumann]] in [[Brühl (Rhineland)|Bruhl]], and [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]] in Dresden. In Prussia, [[Frederic II of Prussia]] was inspired the [[Grand Trianon]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]], and used it as the model for his summer residence, [[Sanssouci]], in [[Potsdam]], designed for him by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] (1745–1747). Another work of baroque palace architecture is the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Potsdam]], the former orangerie of the palace of the Dukes of [[Saxony]] in the 18th century.

One of the best examples of a rococo church is the Basilika Vierzehnheiligen, or [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]], a pilgrimage church located near the town of [[Bad Staffelstein]] near Bamberg, in [[Bavaria]], southern Germany. The Basilica was designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]] and was constructed between 1743 and 1772, its plan a series of interlocking circles around a central oval with the altar placed in the exact center of the church. The interior of this church illustrates the summit of Rococo decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example of the style is the Pilgrimage Church of Wies ({{lang-de|Wieskirche}}). It was designed by the brothers [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann|J. B.]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]]. It is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]], in the municipality of [[Steingaden]] in the [[Weilheim-Schongau]] district, [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the [[Wessobrunner School]]. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

Another notable example is the [[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)]] in Prague (1704–55), built by [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]]. Decoration covers all of walls of interior of the church. The altar is placed in the nave beneath the central dome, and surrounded by chapels,  Light comes down from the dome above and from the surrounding chapels. The altar is entirely surrounded by arches, columns, curved balustrades and pilasters of colored stone, which are richly decorated with statuary, creating a deliberate confusion between the real architecture and the decoration.  The architecture is transformed into a theater of light, color and movement.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"/&gt;

===French Baroque or ''Classicism''===
{{main|French Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Château de Balleroy 25.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chateau de Balleroy]] by [[François Mansart]] (1626–1636)]]
[[File:Château de Versailles 04 2016 5737.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Versailles]] (begun by [[Louis Le Vau]] in 1661)]]
France largely resisted the ornate baroque style of Italy, Spain, Vienna and the rest of Europe. The French Baroque style (often termed ''Grand Classicism'' or simply ''Classicism''  in France) is closely associated with the works built for [[Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV]]; it features more geometric order and measure than baroque, and less elaborate decoration on the facades and in the interiors.  Louis XIV invited the master of baroque, Bernini, to submit a design for the new wing of the Louvre, but rejected it in favor of a more classical design by [[Claude Perrault]] and [[Louis Le Vau]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pages 25–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal architects of the style included [[François Mansart]] ([[Chateau de Balleroy]], 1626–1636), [[Pierre Le Muet]] (Church of [[Val-de-Grace]], 1645–1665), [[Louis Le Vau]] ([[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], 1657–1661) and especially [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] and [[Robert de Cotte]], whose work included the [[Galerie des Glaces]] and the [[Grand Trianon]] at Versailles (1687–1688). Mansart was also responsible for the Baroque-classicism of the [[Place Vendôme]] (1686–1699).&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major work of the period was the [[Palace of Versailles]], begun in 1661 by Le Vau with decoration by the painter [[Charles Le Brun]]. The gardens were designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] specifically to complement and amplify the architecture. The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the centerpiece of the château, with paintings by Le Brun, was constructed between 1678 and 1686. Mansart completed the Grand Trianon in 1687. The chapel, designed by de Cotte, was finished in 1710. Following the death of Louis XIV, Louis XV added the more intimate [[Petit Trianon]] and the highly ornate theater. The fountains in the gardens were designed to be seen from the interior, and to add to the dramatic effect. The palace was admired and copied by other monarchs of Europe, particularly [[Peter the Great]] of Russia, who visited Versailles early in the reign of Louis XV, and built his own version at [[Peterhof Palace]] near Saint Petersburg, between 1705 and 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Baroque===

[[File:The Great Church of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, iconostasis.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Great Church of the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg, by Rastrelli (1753–1759)]]
The debut of Russian Baroque, or [[Petrine Baroque]], followed a long visit of [[Peter the Great]] to western Europe in 1697–98,  where he visited the Chateaux of Fontainebleu and Versailles and other architectural monuments.  He decided, on his return to Russia, to construct similar monuments in St. Petersburg, when he moved the Russian capital there in 1712. Early major monuments in the Petrine baroque include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].
During the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; called [[Elizabethan Baroque]]. Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the Elizabethan Baroque are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;* William Craft Brumfield.

==Painting==
{{Main|Baroque painting}}
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|''The Raising of the Cross'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1610–1611)]]

[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Quadratura''; a painted dome by [[Andrea Pozzo]] for the [[Jesuit Church, Vienna]], giving the illusion of looking upwards at heavenly figures around a nonexistent dome (1703)]]
Baroque painters worked deliberately to set themselves apart from the painters of the Renaissance and the Mannerism period after it.  In their palette, they used intense and warm colors, and particularly made use of the [[primary colors]] red, blue and yellow, frequently putting all three in close proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;   In their lighting, they avoided the even lighting of Renaissance painting and used strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures.  In their composition, they avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama.  Unlike the tranquil faces of Renaissance paintings, the faces in Baroque paintings clearly expressed their emotions.  They often used asymmetry, with action occurring away from the center of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical or horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement.  They enhanced this impression of movement by having the costumes of the personages blown by the wind, or moved by their own gestures. The overall impressions were movement, emotion and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pgs. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Another essential element of baroque painting was allegory; every painting told a story and had a message, often encrypted in symbols and allegorical characters, which an educated viewer was expected to know and read.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The Toilet of Venus, by François Boucher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Toilet of Venus'' by [[François Boucher]] (1755)]]
The earliest Baroque painters were the Italians the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci| Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio's realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.    Other major painters associated closely with the Baroque style include [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Andrea Pozzo]], and [[Paolo de Matteis]] in Italy; [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] in Spain; [[Adam Elsheimer]] in Germany; and [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Georges de La Tour]] in France (though Poussin spent most of his working life in Italy).  Poussin and La Tour adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the line of the figures in the painting than colour.  

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] was the most important painter of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] style.  Rubens' highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, color, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.

One important domain of Baroque painting was ''Quadratura'', or paintings in ''[[trompe-l'oeil]]'', which literally "fooled the eye".  These were usually painted on the stucco of ceilings or upper walls and balustrades, and gave the impression to those on the ground looking up were that they were seeing the heavens populated with crowds of angels saints, and other heavenly figures, set against painted skies and imaginary architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéistique des Styles'' (2014), pg. 92 &lt;/ref&gt;  

In Italy, artists often collaborated with architects on interior decoration; [[Pietro da Cortona]] was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the [[Palazzo Barberini|Palace of the Barberini family]] (1633–39), to glorify the reign of [[Pope Urban VIII]].  Pietro da Cortona’s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the [[Sistine Chapel]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pages 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Boucher]] was an important figure in the more delicate French Rococo style, which appeared during the late Baroque period.  He designed tapestries, carpets and theater decoration as well as painting.  His work was extremely popular with [[Madame Pompadour]], the Mistress of King [[Louis XV]]. His paintings featured mythological romantic, and mildly erotic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pp. 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant figure in baroque sculpture was [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  Under the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]], he made a remarkable series of monumental statues of saints and figures whose faces and gestures vividly expressed their emotions, as well as portrait busts of exceptional realism, and highly decorative works for the Vatican, including the imposing [[Chair of St. Peter]] beneath the dome in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]  In addition, he designed fountains with monumental groups of sculpture to decorate the major squares of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'' (1999), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque sculpture was particularly inspired by ancient Roman statuary, particularly by the famous statue of [[Laocoön]] from the First Century A.D., which was on display in the gallery of the Vatican.  When he visited Paris in 1665, Bernini addressed the students at the Academy of painting and sculpture, he advised the students to work from classical models, rather than from nature.  He told the students, "When I had trouble with my first statue, i consulted the ''Antinous'' like an oracle."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1999) page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable late French baroque sculptors included [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]] and [[Jean Baptiste Pigalle]].  Pigalle was commissioned by [[Frederick the Great]] to make statues for Frederick's own version of Versailles at [[Sanssouci]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. Falconet also received an important foreign commission, creating the famous statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback found in St. Petersburg.

In Spain, the sculptor [[Francisco Salzillo]] worked exclusively on religious themes, using polychromed wood. Some of the finest baroque sculptural craftsmanship was found in the gilded stucco altars of churches of the Spanish colonies of the New World, made by local craftsmen; examples include the Rosary Chapel of the Church of Santo Domingo in Oaxaca, Mexico (1724–31).

==Music and ballet==

[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Antonio Vivaldi]], (1678–1741)]]
The term ''Baroque'' is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art. The first uses of the term 'baroque' for music were criticisms.  In an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau's ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]],'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734, the critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque," complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and noted composer as well as philosopher, made a very similar observation in 1768 in the famous ''Encylopedié'' of [[Denis Diderot]]:   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"/&gt;

Common use of the term for the music of the period began only in 1919, by [[Curt Sachs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachs |first1=Curt |authorlink1=Curt Sachs |title=Barockmusik |trans-title=Baroque Music |series=Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters |volume=26 |year=1919 |publisher=Edition Peters |location=Leipzig |language=German|pages=7–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English in an article published by [[Manfred Bukofzer]].{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

The baroque was a period of musical experimentation and innovation. New forms were invented, including the [[concerto]] and [[sinfonia]]. [[Opera]] was born in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly lost ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe:   Louis XIV created the first Royal Academy of Music,  In 1669, the poet [[Pierre Perrin]] opened an academy of opera in Paris, the first opera theater in France open to the public, and premiered ''[[Pomone (opera)|Pomone]]'', the first grand opera in French, with music by [[Robert Cambert]], with five acts, elaborate stage machinery, and a ballet.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"&gt;Bély, Lucien, ''Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde'' (2005), pp. 152–54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century.

The classical ballet also originated in the Baroque era. The style of court dance was brought to France by [[Marie de Medici]], and in the beginning the members of the court themselves were the dancers. [[Louis XIV]] himself performed in public in several ballets. In March 1662, the [[Académie Royale de Danse]], was founded by the King.  It was the first professional dance school and company,  and set the standards and vocabulary for ballet throughout Europe during the period.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"/&gt;

Several new instruments, including the [[piano]], were introduced during this period. The invention of the piano is credited to [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]], as the Keeper of the Instruments. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristofori named the instrument ''un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte'' ("a keyboard of [[cypress]] with soft and loud"), abbreviated over time as ''pianoforte'', ''fortepiano'', and later, simply, piano.&lt;ref&gt;Isacoff (2012, 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
[[File:Set design Act5 of Andromède by P Corneille 1650 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Set design for ''Andromedé'' by [[Pierre Corneille]], (1650)]]

The Baroque period was a golden age for theater in France and Spain;  playwrights included [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Moliere]] in France; and [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] Spain.

During the Baroque period, the art and style of the theater evolved rapidly, alongside the development of opera and of ballet.  The design of newer and larger theaters, the invention the use of more elaborate machinery, the wider use of the [[proscenium arch]], which framed the stage and hid the machinery from the audience, encouraged more scenic effects and spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica on-line, ''Baroque Theater''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baroque had a Catholic and conservative character in Spain, following an Italian literary models during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The Hispanic Baroque theatre aimed for a public content with an ideal reality that manifested fundamental three sentiments: Catholic religion, monarchist and national pride and honour originating from the chivalric, knightly world.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two periods are known in the Baroque Spanish theatre, with the division occurring in 1630. The first period is represented chiefly by [[Lope de Vega]], but also by [[Tirso de Molina]], [[Gaspar Aguilar]], [[Guillén de Castro]], [[Antonio Mira de Amescua]], [[Luis Vélez de Guevara]], [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón]], [[Diego Jiménez de Enciso]], [[Luis Belmonte Bermúdez]], [[Felipe Godínez]], [[Luis Quiñones de Benavente]] or [[Juan Pérez de Montalbán]]. The second period is represented by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] and fellow dramatists [[Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Álvaro Cubillo de Aragón]], [[Jerónimo de Cáncer]], [[Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla]], [[Juan de Matos Fragoso]], [[Antonio Coello y Ochoa]], [[Agustín Moreto]], and [[Francisco Bances Candamo]].&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco'', Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; These classifications are loose because each author had his own way and could occasionally adhere himself to the formula established by Lope. It may even be that the "manner" of Lope was more liberal and structured than Calderón's.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco'', Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Lope de Vega introduced through his ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo'' (1609) the ''new comedy''. He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three [[Aristotle]] unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time and place) and a fourth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented.&lt;ref&gt;Lope de Vega, 2010, Comedias: El Remedio en la Desdicha. El Mejor Alcalde El Rey, pp.&amp;nbsp;446–447&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theatre or scenography. The Lope's comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirso de Molina, Lope de Vega, and Calderón were the most important play writers in Golden Era Spain. Their works, known for their subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person's humanity, could be considered a bridge between Lope's primitive comedy and the more elaborate comedy of Calderón. Tirso de Molina is best known for two works, ''The Convicted Suspicions'' and ''[[The Trickster of Seville]]'', one of the first versions of the [[Don Juan]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward M.; Moir, Duncan (1992). ''Historia de la literatura española: Siglo De Oro: Teatro'' (1492–1700). Editorial Ariel, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival to Madrid, [[Cosimo Lotti]] brought to the Spanish court the most advanced theatrical techniques of Europe. His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called "Fiestas" and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called "Naumaquias". He was in charge of styling the Gardens of [[Buen Retiro]], of [[Palace of Zarzuela|Zarzuela]] and of [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Lope's formulas begins with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theatre foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Calderón de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calderón's style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calderón's work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calderón's intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of [[Autos sacramentales]] achieved high ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Molina Jiménez,  María Belén (2008). El teatro musical de Calderón de la Barca: Análisis textual. EDITUM, p. 56
&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of Comedia is political, multi-artistic and in a sense hybrid. The poetic text interweaved with Medias and resources originating from architecture, music and painting freeing the deception that is in the Lopesian comedy was made up from the lack of scenery and engaging the dialogue of action.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known German playwright was [[Andreas Gryphius]], who used the [[Jesuit]] model of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pierre Corneille]]. There was also [[Johannes Velten]] who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the [[commedia del'arte]]  with the classic theatre of Corneille and [[Molière]]. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.

==End of the style, condemnation and academic rediscovery==
Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, probably without intending it, contributed to the decline of the baroque and rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named Royal Director of buildings in 1754. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting of architecture. {{sfn|Cabanne|1988|pg. 106}} 

The pioneer German art historian and archeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] also condemned the baroque style, and praised the superior values of classical art and architecture.  By the 19th century, Baroque was a target for ridicule and criticism.  The neoclassical critic Francesco Milizia wrote: "Borrominini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pierre de Cortone in painting...are a plague on good taste, which infected a large number of artists."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, Bruce, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'', Thames and Hudson, (1997), page 9&lt;/ref&gt;    In the 19th century, criticism went even further; the British critic [[John Ruskin]] declared that baroque sculpture was not only bad, but also morally corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss-born art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) started the rehabilitation of the word Baroque in his Renaissance und Barock (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between Mannerism and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Baroque art and architecture became fashionable between the two World Wars, and has largely remained in critical favor.  The term "Baroque" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line.

In 1892 [[August Weismann]] proposed in his [[germ plasm]] theory that heritable information is transmitted only via [[germ cell]]s, which he thought contained determinants (genes). [[Francis Galton]], supposing that undesirable traits such as [[club foot]] and [[criminality]] were inherited, advocated eugenics, aiming to prevent supposedly defective people from breeding. [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Paul Broca]] attempted to relate the cranial capacity (internal skull volume) to skin colour, intending to show that white people were superior. Other workers such as [[H. H. Goddard]], and [[Robert Yerkes]] attempted to [[Intelligence Quotient|measure people's intelligence]] and to show that the resulting scores were heritable, again to demonstrate the supposed superiority of people with white skin.

Galton popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]], later often used to characterize the heated debate over whether genes or the environment determined human behavior. Scientists such as ecologists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Normile, Dennis |title=Nature From Nurture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=351 |issue=6276 |pages=908–910 |date=2016 |doi=10.1126/science.351.6276.908|pmid=26917750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behavioural geneticists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powledge, Tabitha M. |title=Behavioral Epigenetics: How Nurture Shapes Nature|journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=588–592 |date=2011 |doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.8.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; now see it as obvious that both factors are essential, and that they are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |year=2003 |title=The Dependent Gene: The Fallacy of Nature Vs.

Late in the 20th century, the [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|determinism of gender roles]] was debated by geneticists and others. Biologists such as [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] attempted to describe [[femininity]] and [[homosexuality]] according to then-current social standards; against this, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] and others argued that clothing and other preferences vary in different societies. The biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] founded the discipline of sociobiology, founded on observations of animals such as [[social insects]], controversially suggesting that its explanations of social behaviour might apply to humans.

==History==

=== Roots ===
Biological determinism is the belief that a human’s behavior is controlled by an person’s genes and inherited traits. It dates back to the 1800s. Stephen Jay Gould has spent his career tracing the roots of this “western” thought because it is more involved than anyone could have assumed. Gould suggests that the main theories of biological determinism are based on bad biology and bad use of the scientific method. When a scientist says they used the scientific method to gather their data, the readers automatically assume that the information given must be correct. 
	
Gould presents three key ideas that have influenced biological determinism. The first is that measurement and quantification have changed science over the past century and without context, these measurements are useless. If something is assigned a number, then it must be real, true, and scientific. If these numbers and measurements are given without context, then the data can be given many different meanings. The second is that reinfication, the idea that certain qualities (intelligence, race) are valid because we put a name on it. One could separate a group into different components and give a name to these divided groups and have it be true, but actually, there is nothing scientific about intelligence being used as a unitary quality. The third problem is that the main thought behind biological determinism is that traits are inherited. Scientists have traced certain traits through families lines and found that some are inherited. Gould suggests that these studies merely restate the original assumption. Gould points out that various theories of biological determinism have no evidence or science to back them up, and even though these ideas are very flawed, people still widely accept them. 
	
However, Gould is thought to be flawed in his own way because readers believe he is simply disregarding certain aspects of science. Gould questions that since the scientific aspects of the works themselves are so flawed that why is it so widespread accepted. Gould suggests that there could be some social, political, and economic forces which could explain why these biological determinism theories are so widely accepted, but he fails to go further deep into the topic. Gould shows that these biological determinism theories have many consequences for human life and scientists in the future can see these and use his book to continue trying to show the people that biological determinism, is in fact, false. 
	
In this review of Gould’s essay by Garland E. Allen, Allen writes that Gould has helped future scientists examine social, economic, and political values of this time regarding biological determinism. Biological determinism is still prominent in scientific works, past and present, that have been regarded by the public as true and believable. Gould wants his readers to understand that biological determinism has roots all throughout science, even though it has been proven false. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Garland E.|date=1984|editor-last=Gould|editor-first=Stephen Jay|title=The Roots of Biological Determinism|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=141–145|jstor=4330882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germ plasm===
{{main|Germ plasm}}
In 1892, the Austrian biologist [[August Weismann]] proposed that multicellular organisms consist of two separate types of cell: [[somatic cell]]s, which carry out the body's ordinary functions, and [[germ cell]]s, which transmit heritable information. He called the material that carried the information, now identified as [[DNA]], the [[germ plasm]], and individual components of it, now called [[gene]]s, determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |authorlink=August Weismann |year=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A Theory of Inheritance |language=German |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/germ-plasm/facsimile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued that there is a one-way transfer of information from the germ cells to somatic cells, so that nothing acquired by the body during an organism's life can affect the germ plasm and the next generation. This effectively denied that [[Lamarckism|Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics)]] was a possible mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Huxley, Julian| authorlink=Julian Huxley |year=1942 |title=Evolution, the modern synthesis |publisher=Allen and Unwin |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern equivalent of the theory, expressed at molecular rather than cellular level, is the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, J. Scott |editor1=Henning, Brian G.|editor2=Scarfe, Adam Christian |title=Biology's Second Law: Homeostasis, Purpose, and Desire |work=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naQm1_Lutq4C&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2013 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7391-7436-4 |page=192 |quote=Where Weismann would say that it is impossible for changes acquired during an organism's lifetime to feed back onto transmissible traits in the germ line, the CDMB now added that it was impossible for information encoded in proteins to feed back and affect genetic information in any form whatsoever, which was essentially a molecular recasting of the Weismann barrier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugenics===
[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|The early eugenicist [[Francis Galton]] invented the term [[eugenics]] and popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |authorlink=Francis Galton |date=1874 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On men of science, their nature and their nurture |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain |volume=7 |pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Eugenics}}

Early ideas of biological determinism centred on the inheritance of undesirable traits, whether physical such as [[club foot]] or [[cleft palate]], or psychological such as [[alcoholism]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[criminality]]. The belief that such traits were inherited led to the desire to solve the problem with the [[eugenics]] movement, led by a follower of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), by forcibly reducing breeding by supposedly defective people. By the 1920s, many U.S. states brought in laws permitting the compulsory [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of people considered genetically unfit, including inmates of [[prison]]s and [[psychiatric hospital]]s. This was followed by similar laws in Germany, and throughout the Western world, in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Garland Edward |title=Biological determinism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/biological-determinism |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllenReview&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mismeasure&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |title=The Mismeasure of Man |date=1981 |publisher=W. W. Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific racism===
{{main|Scientific racism}}

Under the influence of determinist beliefs, the American [[craniologist]] [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851), and later the French anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880), attempted to measure the cranial capacities (internal skull volumes) of people of different skin colours, intending to show that whites were superior to the rest, with larger brains. All the supposed proofs from such studies were invalidated by methodological flaws. The results were used to justify [[slavery]], and to oppose [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

===Heritability of IQ===
{{main|Heritability of IQ}}[[Alfred Binet]] (1857–1911)  designed tests specifically to measure performance, not innate ability.  From the late 19th century, the American school, led by researchers such as [[H. H. Goddard]] (1866–1957), [[Lewis Terman]] (1877–1956), and [[Robert Yerkes]] (1876–1956), transformed these tests into tools for measuring inherited mental ability.  They attempted to measure people's intelligence with [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ tests]], to demonstrate that the resulting scores were [[heritable]], and so to conclude that people with white skin were superior to the rest.  It proved impossible to design culture-independent tests and to carry out testing in a fair way given that people came from different backgrounds, or were newly arrived immigrants, or were illiterate. The results were used to oppose immigration of people from southern and eastern Europe to America.&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

===Human gender roles===
{{main|Biological determinism of human gender roles}}

Lynda Birke argues in her 1992 book ''In Pursuit of Difference'' that biology explains sexual differences by the mechanisms of chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;''In Pursuit of Difference'' by Lynda Birke, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, hormonal differences are not absolute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people can be born with intersex characteristics, for example as a genetic mosaic.&lt;ref name="isna.org"&gt;[http://www.isna.org Intersex Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality]] can be attributed to both [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological and social causes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Nature/Sexual Culture|year=1995|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226001821|page=4|edition=1|editor=[[Paul R.

The neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] in 1991 studied the difference in [[hypothalamic structure]]s between homosexual and heterosexual men, finding that the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] suggested a partial cause for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spanier |first=Bonnie |journal=[[NWSA Journal]] |year=1995 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=54–71 |title=Biological Determinism and Homosexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimmons |first=David |title=Sex and the Brain |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/sexandthebrain346/?searchterm=levay#.UpLnSGRDuqw |work=[[Discover Magazine]]|date=March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]]'s book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' discussed a study of girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]". The biologists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fitted their own social standards, such as clothing preference or using makeup. The experiment, in Lewontin's words, "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves." Gender differences in work are becoming less pronounced, suggesting that these are imposed by society.&lt;ref name=LewontinRoseKamin1984&gt;[[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin, Richard]], Steven Rose, and Leon Kamin. ''Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature''. New York: Pantheon Books, 1984. "The Determined Patriarchy", Chapter 6, pp. 131–163&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Anne Fausto-Sterling#The Standard Model|standard model of sex and gender]] indicates a clear-cut dichotomy between males and females, with no overlap, a cultural model followed by professionals such as doctors when they deal with gender assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne, "Of Gender and Genitals" in ''Sexing the Body, Of Gender and Genitals'', Basic Books, 2000, pp. 44–77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociobiology===
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]] reignited debate on biological determinism with his 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.]]
{{main|Sociobiology}}

&lt;div&gt;[[Sociobiology]] emerged with [[E. O. Wilson]]'s 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sociobiology: a new synthesis and an old quarrel |author=May, Robert M. |date=1 April 1976 |volume=260 |issue=5550 |pages=390–392 |pmid=11643303 |doi=10.1038/260390a0 |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a putative [[altruism]] gene is debated.

J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geneticist [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] argues that altruistic behaviour like "loving our neighbour" is built into the human genome, with the proviso that neighbour means member of "our tribe", someone who shares many genes with the altruist, and that the behaviour can thus be explained by [[kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Giberson |first1=Karl |title=Book review: ‘The Serpent’s Promise,’ on Bible-Science tensions, by Steve Jones |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-serpents-promise-on-bible-science-tensions-by-steve-jones/2014/08/15/6db92e54-133f-11e4-98ee-daea85133bc9_story.html |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologists such as Jones have argued that genes that did not lead to selfish behaviour would die out compared to genes that did, because the selfish genes would favour themselves.

==Nature versus nurture debate==
{{main|Nature and nurture}}

The belief in biological determinism has been matched by a [[tabula rasa|blank slate]] denial of any possible influence of genes on human behavior, leading to [[Nature and nurture|a long and heated debate about "nature and nurture"]]. By the 21st century, many scientists had come to feel that the dichotomy made no sense. They noted that genes were expressed within an environment, in particular that of [[prenatal development]], and that genes were continuously controlled by the environment through mechanisms such as [[epigenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Matt Ridley |author=Ridley, M. |date=2003 |title=Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, &amp; What Makes Us Human |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-002-00663-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-199-92234-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gutiérrez, Luci |date=January 24, 2014 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-retire-the-simplicity-of-nature-vs-nurture-1390610295 |title=Time to Retire The Simplicity of Nature vs. Nurture |newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

'''Collective animal behavior''' is a form of [[social behavior]] involving the coordinated behavior of large groups of similar animals as well as [[Emergence|emergent]] properties of these groups. This can include the costs and benefits of group membership, the transfer of information across the group, the group decision-making process, and group locomotion and synchronization. Studying the principles of collective animal behavior has relevance to human engineering problems through the philosophy of [[biomimetics]]. For instance, determining the rules by which an individual animal navigates relative to its neighbors in a group can lead to advances in the deployment and control of groups of swimming or flying micro-robots such as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).

==Examples==
Examples of collective animal behavior include: 
* [[Flocking (behavior)|Flocking]] birds
* [[Herd]]ing [[ungulate]]s
* [[Shoaling and schooling]] fish
* Schooling [[Antarctic krill]]
* Pods of [[dolphins]]
* [[Marching locusts]]
* [[Ant nest|Nest building]] ants

==Proposed functions==
Many functions of animal aggregations have been proposed. These proposed functions may be grouped into the four following categories: social and genetic, anti-predator, enhanced foraging, and increased locomotion efficiency.

===Social interaction===
Support for the social and genetic function of aggregations, especially those formed by fish, can be seen in several aspects of their behavior. For instance, experiments have shown that individual fish removed from a school will have a higher respiratory rate than those found in the school. This effect has been partly attributed to stress, although hydrodynamic factors were considered more important in this particular study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abrahams | first1 = M. | last2 = Colgan | first2 = P. | year = 1985 | title = Risk of predation, hydrodynamic efficiency, and their influence on school structure | url = | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 195–202 | doi=10.1007/bf00000931}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calming effect of being with conspecifics may thus provide a social motivation for remaining in an aggregation. Herring, for instance, will become very agitated if they are isolated from conspecifics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Partridge | first1 = B. | last2 = Pitcher | first2 = T. | last3 = Cullen | first3 = M. | last4 = Wilson | first4 = J. | year = 1980 | title = The three-dimensional structure of fish schools | url = | journal = Behav Ecol and Sociobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 277–288 | doi=10.1007/bf00292770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish schools have also been proposed to serve a reproductive function since they provide increased access to potential mates.

===Protection from predators===
[[File:School of Pterocaesio chrysozona in Papua New Guinea 1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Shoaling and schooling|School]] of [[goldband fusilier]]s]]

Several [[Antipredator adaptations|anti-predator functions]] of animal aggregations have been proposed. One potential method by which fish schools or bird flocks may thwart [[predator]]s is the ‘predator confusion effect’ proposed and demonstrated by Milinski and Heller (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milinski | first1 = H. | last2 = Heller | first2 = R. | year = 1978 | title = Influence of a predator on the optimal foraging behavior of sticklebacks | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 275 | issue = | pages = 642–644 | doi=10.1038/275642a0 | bibcode=1978Natur.275..642M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predator's visual channel. Milinski and Heller's findings have been corroborated both in experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeschke JM, Tollrian R | year = 2007 | title = Prey swarming: which predators become confused and why? | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334720700187X | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–393 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ioannou CC, Tosh CR, Neville L, Krause J | year = 2008 | title = The confusion effect—from neural networks to reduced predation risk | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/1/126 | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–130 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arm109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and computer simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Krakauer DC | year = 1995 | title = Groups confuse predators by exploiting perceptual bottlenecks: a connectionist model of the confusion effect | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00177338 | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 421–429 | doi = 10.1007/BF00177338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Hintze A, Dyer FC, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behaviour | url = http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/85/20130305 | journal = J.

A second potential anti-predator effect of animal aggregations is the "many eyes" hypothesis. This theory states that as the size of the group increases, the task of scanning the environment for predators can be spread out over many individuals. Not only does this [[Mass Collaboration|mass collaboration]] presumably provide a higher level of vigilance, it could also allow more time for individual feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = G. | year = 1996 | title = Why individual vigilance declines as group size increases | url = | journal = Anim Behav | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 1077–1086 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lima | first1 = S. | year = 1995 | title = Back to the basics of anti-predatory vigilance: the group-size effect | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 49 | issue = 1| pages = 11–20 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Haley PB, Dyer FC, Adami C | year = 2015 | title = Exploring the evolution of a trade-off between vigilance and foraging in group-living organisms | url = http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/9/150135 | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 2 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.150135 | pages=150135 | pmid=26473039 | pmc=4593673| arxiv=1408.1906 | bibcode=2015RSOS....250135O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third hypothesis for an anti-predatory effect of animal aggregation is the "[[encounter dilution]]" effect. Hamilton, for instance, proposed that the aggregation of animals was due to a "selfish" avoidance of a predator and was thus a form of cover-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1971 | title = Geometry for the selfish herd | url = | journal = J. Theor Biology | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 295–311 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5 | pmid=5104951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Critical Interplay Between Density-dependent Predation and Evolution of the Selfish Herd | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2463372.2463394 | journal = Proceedings of GECCO 2013 | pages = 247–254 | doi = 10.1145/2463372.2463394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another formulation of the theory was given by Turner and Pitcher and was viewed as a combination of detection and attack probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = G. | last2 = Pitcher | first2 = T. | year = 1986 | title = Attack abatement: a model for group protection by combined avoidance and dilution | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 128 | issue = 2| pages = 228–240 | doi=10.1086/284556}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the detection component of the theory, it was suggested that potential prey might benefit by living together since a predator is less likely to chance upon a single group than a scattered distribution. In the attack component, it was thought that an attacking predator is less likely to eat a particular animal when a greater number of individuals are present. In sum, an individual has an advantage if it is in the larger of two groups, assuming that the probability of detection and attack does not increase disproportionately with the size of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krause | first1 = J. | last2 = Ruxton | first2 = G. | last3 = Rubenstein | first3 = D. | year = 1998 | title = Is there always an influence of shoal size on predator hunting success? | url = | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 494–501 | doi=10.1006/jfbi.1997.0595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhanced foraging===
A third proposed benefit of animal groups is that of enhanced foraging. This ability was demonstrated by Pitcher and others in their study of foraging behavior in shoaling cyprinids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitcher | first1 = T. | last2 = Magurran | first2 = A. | last3 = Winfield | first3 = I. | year = 1982 | title = Fish in larger shoals find food faster | url = | journal = Behav. Ecol. and Sociobiology | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the time it took for groups of minnows and goldfish to find a patch of food was quantified. The number of fishes in the groups was varied, and a statistically significant decrease in the amount of time necessary for larger groups to find food was established. Further support for an enhanced foraging capability of schools is seen in the structure of schools of predatory fish. Partridge and others analyzed the school structure of Atlantic bluefin tuna from aerial photographs and found that the school assumed a parabolic shape, a fact that was suggestive of cooperative hunting in this species (Partridge et al., 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Partridge | first1 = B. Johansson | last2 = Kalish | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = The structure of schools of giant bluefin tuna in Cape Cod Bay | url = | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 9 | issue = 3–4| pages = 253–262 | doi=10.1007/bf00692374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased locomotion efficiency===
This theory states that groups of animals moving in a fluid environment may save energy when swimming or flying together, much in the way that bicyclists may [[Drafting (racing)|draft]] one another in a [[peloton]]. Geese flying in a Vee formation are also thought to save energy by flying in the updraft of the [[Wingtip vortices|wingtip vortex]] generated by the previous animal in the formation. Ducklings have also been shown to save energy by swimming in a line.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, F.E. Kinematics of ducklings swimming in formation: consequences of position. (1995) Journal of Experimental Zoology 273:1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased efficiencies in swimming in groups have also been proposed for schools of fish and Antarctic krill.

==Group structure==
The structure of large animal groups has been difficult to study because of the large number of animals involved. The experimental approach is therefore often complemented by mathematical modeling of animal aggregations.

===Experimental approach===
Experiments investigating the structure of animal aggregations seek to determine the 3D position of each animal within a volume at each point in time. It is important to know the internal structure of the group because that structure can be related to the proposed motivations for animal grouping. This capability requires the use of multiple cameras trained on the same volume in space, a technique known as [[Photogrammetry|stereophotogrammetry]]. When hundreds or thousands of animals occupy the study volume, it becomes difficult to identify each one. In addition, animals may block one another in the camera views, a problem known as occlusion. Once the location of each animal at each point in time is known, various parameters describing the animal group can be extracted.

These parameters include:

'''''Density''''': The density of an animal aggregation is the number of animals divided by the volume (or area) occupied by the aggregation. Density may not be a constant throughout the group. For instance, starling flocks have been shown to maintain higher densities on the edges than in the middle of the flock, a feature that is presumably related to defense from predators.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ballerini, N. Cabibbo, R. Candelier, A. Cavagna, E. Cisbani, I. Giardina, A. Orlandi, G. Parisi, A. Procaccini, M. Viale, and V. Zdravkovic (2008) ‘Empirical investigation of starling flocks: a benchmark study in collective animal behaviour’ Animal Behavior 76(1): 201-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Polarity''''': The group polarity describes if the group animals are all pointing in the same direction or not. In order to determine this parameter, the average orientation of all animals in the group is determined. For each animal, the angular difference between its orientation and the group orientation is then found. The group polarity is then the average of these differences (Viscido 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Viscido | first1 = S. | last2 = Parrish | first2 = J. | last3 = Grunbaum | first3 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Individual behavior and emergent properties of fish schools: a comparison of observation and theory | url = | journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series | volume = 273 | issue = | pages = 239–249 | doi=10.3354/meps273239| bibcode = 2004MEPS..273..239V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nearest Neighbor Distance''''': The nearest neighbor distance (NND) describes the distance between the centroid of one animal (the focal animal) and the centroid of the animal nearest to the focal animal. This parameter can be found for each animal in an aggregation and then averaged. Care must be taken to account for the animals located at the edge of an animal aggregation. These animals have no neighbor in one direction.

'''''Nearest Neighbor Position''''': In a polar coordinate system, the nearest neighbor position describes the angle and distance of the nearest neighbor to a focal animal.

'''''Packing Fraction''''': [[Packing density|Packing fraction]] is a parameter borrowed from physics to define the organization (or state i.e. solid, liquid, or gas) of 3D animal groups. It is an alternative measure to density. In this parameter, the aggregation is idealized as an ensemble of solid spheres, with each animal at the center of a sphere. The packing fraction is defined as the ratio of the total volume occupied by all individual spheres divided by the global volume of the aggregation (Cavagna 2008). Values range from zero to one, where a small packing fraction represents a dilute system like a gas. Cavagna found that the packing fraction for groups of starlings was 0.012.&lt;ref name=cavagna&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cavagna | first1 = A. | last2 = Cimarelli | first2 = Giardina | last3 = Orlandi | first3 = Parisi | last4 = Procaccini | first4 = Santagati | last5 = Stefanini | first5 =  | year = 2008 | title = New statistical tools for analyzing the structure of animal groups | url = | journal = Mathematical Biosciences | volume = 214 | issue = | pages = 32–37 | doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2008.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Integrated Conditional Density''''': This parameter measures the density at various length scales and therefore describes the homogeneity of density throughout an animal group.&lt;ref name=cavagna/&gt;

'''''[[Pair Distribution Function]]''''': This parameter is usually used in physics to characterize the degree of spatial order in a system of particles. It also describes the density, but this measures describes the density at a distance away from a given point. Cavagna et al. found that flocks of starlings exhibited more structure than a gas but less than a liquid.&lt;ref name=cavagna/&gt;

===Modeling approach===
The simplest mathematical models of animal aggregations generally instruct the individual animals to follow three rules:
#Move in the same direction as your neighbor
#Remain close to your neighbors
#Avoid collisions with your neighbors
[[File:Metric vs topological distance for animal aggregations.png|right|thumb|400px|A diagram illustrating the difference between 'metric distance' and 'topological distance' in reference to fish schools]]

An example of such a simulation is the [[Boids]] program created by Craig Reynolds in 1986. Another is the [[Self-propelled particles|Self Propelled Particle]] model. Many current models use variations on these rules. For instance, many models implement these three rules through layered zones around each animal. In the zone of repulsion very close to the animal, the focal animal will seek to distance itself from its neighbors in order to avoid a collision. In the slightly further away zone of alignment, a focal animal will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbors. In the outmost zone of attraction, which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal animal will seeks to move towards a neighbor. The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of the animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish, on the other hand, rely on both vision and on hydrodynamic signals relayed through its [[lateral line]]. Antarctic krill rely on vision and on hydrodynamic signals relayed through its [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].

Recent studies of starling flocks have shown, however, that each bird modifies its position relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ballerini, N. Cabibbo, R. Candelier, A. Cavagna, E. Cisbani, I. Giardina, V. Lecomte, A. Orlandi, G. Parisi, A. Procaccini, M. Viale, and V. Zdravkovic (2008) ‘Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than metric distance: Evidence from a field study’ PNAS 105:1232-1237.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a topological rule rather than a metric rule. It remains to be seen whether the same rule can be applied to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hildenbrandt | first1 = H | last2 = Carere | first2 = C | last3 = Hemelrijk | first3 = CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemelrijk | first1 = CK | last2 = Hildenbrandt | first2 = H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index Project Starflag]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk Swarm behaviour model by University of Groningen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collective decision making==
Aggregations of animals are faced with decisions which they must make if they are to remain together. For a school of fish, an example of a typical decision might be which direction to swim when confronted by a predator. Social insects such as ants and bees must collectively decide where to build a new nest.&lt;ref&gt;Sumpter, D. http://www.collective-behavior.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; A herd of elephants must decide when and where to migrate. How are these decisions made? Do stronger or more experienced 'leaders' exert more influence than other group members, or does the group make a decision by consensus? The answer probably depends on the species. While the role of a leading matriarch in an elephant herd is well known, studies have shown that some animal species use a consensus approach in their [[collective decision-making]] process.

A recent investigation showed that small groups of fish used consensus decision-making when deciding which fish model to follow. The fish did this by a simple quorum rule such that individuals watched the decisions of others before making their own decisions. This technique generally resulted in the 'correct' decision but occasionally cascaded into the 'incorrect' decision. In addition, as the group size increased, the fish made more accurate decisions in following the more attractive fish model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sumpter | first1 = D. | last2 = Krause | first2 = J | last3 = James | first3 = R. | last4 = Couzin | first4 = I. | last5 = Ward | first5 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Consensus decision making by fish | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 22| pages = 1773–1777 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.09.064 | pmid=19013067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus decision-making, a form of [[collective intelligence]], thus effectively uses information from multiple sources to generally reach the correct conclusion.

Some simulations of collective decision-making use the [[Condorcet method]] to model the way groups of animals come to consensus.

The '''''Conservation Plan''''' is an important publication written by [[James Semple Kerr]] in 1982, and revised many times. It was a landmark in Australian conservation. The document "...outlines the logical processes of the Burra Charter, and how to prepare a Conservation Plan to guide and manage change to a heritage item appropriately''. Subtitled, "a guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' it has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications &gt; The Conservation Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservation Plan is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J.

A '''courtesan''' was originally a [[courtier]], which means a person who attends the [[noble court|court]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] or other powerful person.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary], v. courtesan, -zan, 1, Obs., "One attached to the court of a prince"; courtesan, -zan, 2, "A court-mistress", Etymon "a. F. ''courtisane'', ad. It. ''cortigiana'', in Florio ''cortegiana'' "a curtezane, a strumpet", orig. ''woman attached to the court'', fem. of ''cortigiano''. In quotation 1565 directly from Italian"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[feudalism|feudal society]], the court was the centre of [[government]] as well as the residence of the monarch, and social and political life were often completely mixed together. Prior to the Renaissance, courtesans served to convey information to visiting dignitaries, when servants could not be trusted. In [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], courtiers played an extremely important role in upper-class society. As it was customary during this time for royal couples to lead separate lives—commonly marrying simply to preserve bloodlines and to secure political alliances—men and women would often seek gratification and companionship from people living at court. In fact, the verb 'to court' originally meant "to be or reside at court", and later came to mean "to behave as a courtier" and then '[[courtship]]', or "to pay amorous attention to somebody".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com ''Oxford English Dictionary''], v. court, verb&lt;/ref&gt; The most intimate companion of a ruler was called the ”[[favourite]]”.

In [[Renaissance]] usage, the Italian word ''cortigiana'', feminine of ''cortigiano'' ("courtier") came to refer to a person who attends the court, and then to a well-educated and independent woman, eventually a trained artist or artisan of dance and singing, especially one associated with wealthy, powerful, or upper-class society who was given luxuries and status in exchange for entertainment and companionship.&lt;ref&gt;In Italy, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] in his ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' uses the masculine form ''cortigiano'' ("courtier") but for the feminine form ''cortigiana'' ("courtesan") uses the term ''donna di palazzo'' (literally "palace lady")&lt;/ref&gt; The word was [[loanword|borrowed]] by English from Italian through the French form ''courtisane'' during the 16th century, especially associated to the meaning of ''donna di palazzo''.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"/&gt;

A male figure comparable to the courtesan was the Italian ''[[cicisbeo]]'', the French ''[[chevalier (disambiguation)|chevalier]] servant'', the Spanish ''[[cortejo]]'' or ''estrecho''. It actually seems that the figure of the ''chevalier servant'' (French, literally "serving cavalier", lady's escort) of a married lady was quite common in Europe up to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/110.2/patriarca.html Silvana Patriarca, "Indolence and Regeneration: Tropes and Tensions of Risorgimento Patriotism", The American Historical Review, 110(2), 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810094203/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/110.2/patriarca.html |date=2006-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The courtesans of East Asia, particularly those of the [[Japanese empire]], held a different social role than that of their European counterparts. Examples of Japanese courtesans included the [[oiran]] class, who were more focused on the aspect of entertainment in comparison with European courtesans.&lt;ref name="Geisha Dolls"&gt;[http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/jshoaf/Jdolls/oiran.htm "Geisha Dolls"]. University of Florida. 2012-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term ''courtesan'' has become a [[euphemism]] to designate a comforter, [[call girl|escort]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] or a [[prostitute]], especially one of dignified etiquette who attracts wealthy, powerful, or influential clients.{{why|date=November 2015}}

==Categories==
[[Image:VeronicaFranco.jpg|thumb|right|[[Veronica Franco]], famous Venetian poet and courtesan. Portrait by [[Paolo Veronese]].]]
There were two types of courtesan.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In one category was a type of courtesan known (in Italy) as the ''cortigiana onesta'', or the honest courtesan, who was cast as an intellectual. In the other was the ''cortigiana di lume'', a lower class of courtesan. Although the latter was still considered better than an average courtesan{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, the former was the sort most often romanticized and treated more-or-less equal to women of the nobility. It is with this type of courtesan that the art of "courtisanerie" is best associated.

The ''cortigiane oneste'' were usually well-educated and worldly (sometimes even more so than the average upper-class woman), and often held simultaneous careers as performers or artists. They were typically chosen on the basis of their "breeding"—social and conversational skills, intelligence, common-sense, and companionship—as well as their physical attributes. It was usually their wit and personality that set them apart from regular women.  Sex constituted only a facet of the courtesan's array of services. For example, they were well-dressed and ready to engage and participate in a variety of topics ranging from art to music to politics.

In some cases, courtesans were from well-to-do backgrounds, and were even married—but to husbands lower on the social ladder than their clients. In these cases, their relationships with those of high social status had the potential to improve their spouses' status—and so, more often than not, the husband was aware of his wife's profession and dealings.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt;

==Differences in status==

===As primary employment===
Courtesans from non-wealthy backgrounds provided charming companionship for extended periods, no matter what their own feelings or commitments might have been at the time, and sometimes had to be prepared to do so on short notice. They were also subject to lower social status, and often religious disapproval, because of the immoral aspects of their profession and their reliance upon courtisanerie as a primary source of income. In cases like this, a courtesan was solely dependent on her benefactor or benefactors financially, making her vulnerable; [[Cora Pearl]] is a good example.
[[File:Lancelot Volders - Ladies with their servants.jpg|thumb|280px|''Courtesans with their servants'' by [[Lancelot Volders]]]]
Often, courtesans serving in this capacity began their career as a prostitute, although many came to the "profession" by other means. It was not uncommon for a courtesan to enter into an arranged long-term liaison by contract with a wealthy benefactor. These contracts were written up by and witnessed by lawyers, and were binding. Most included some provision for the financial welfare of the courtesan beyond the end of the relationship in the form of an annuity. Many such women became so powerful socially and financially that they could be particular about the men they associated with; in other words they chose their paramour as would any other mistress, not the other way around. Wealthy benefactors would go to great lengths to court a courtesan as a prize, the ultimate goal being a long-term contract as a mistress. 

Occasionally courtesans were passed from one benefactor to another, thereby resulting in them being viewed in society circles as lower than both their benefactor and those of wealth and power with whom they would socialize. Often, in instances of this sort, if the courtesan had satisfactorily served a benefactor, that benefactor would, when ending the affair, pass them on to another benefactor of wealth as a favor to the courtesan, or set them up in an arranged marriage to a semi-wealthy benefactor. In the event that the courtesan had angered or dissatisfied a benefactor, they would often find themselves cast out of wealthy circles, returning more often than not to street [[prostitution]].

===For social or political benefits===
Those from wealthy backgrounds, either by birth or marriage, and who were acting as courtesans only for the social or political advancement of themselves and/or their spouses were generally treated as equals. They were more respected by their extramarital companions, both placing one another's family obligations ahead of the relationship and planning their own liaisons or social engagements around the lovers' marital obligations.

Affairs of this sort would often be short-lived, ending when either the courtesan or the courtesan's spouse received the status or political position desired, or when the benefactor chose the company of another courtesan, and compensated the former companion financially. In instances like this, it was often viewed simply as a business agreement by both parties involved. The benefactor was aware of the political or social favors expected by the courtesan, the courtesan was aware of the price expected from them for those favors being carried out, and the two met one another's demands, an example being [[Madame de Pompadour]].{{Doubtful|date=December 2016}}

This was generally a safe affair, as both the benefactor's spouse and the courtesan's spouse usually were fully aware of the arrangement, and the courtesan was not solely dependent on the benefactor. It, rather, was simply an affair of benefits gained for both those involved. Publicly and socially, affairs of this sort were common during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as well as the early 20th century, and were generally accepted in wealthy circles.&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;[http://icqurimage.com/Magazine/courtesan.html "A brief history of the Courtesan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319091907/http://icqurimage.com/Magazine/courtesan.html |date=2006-03-19 }}(from icqurimage.com, 2005) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrigues==
Very often, courtesans would betray one another in acts of political intrigue in attempts to climb into higher positions of power within royal courts. There are many cases throughout history where one courtesan would attempt (sometimes successfully) to supplant the mistress to a king or emperor. This was typically preceded by her discrediting the ruler's companion, often by divulging secrets that could lead to her rival being cast aside and replaced by her. However, this was a delicate process, and if a courtesan of "lower status" attempted to replace a courtesan who wielded a substantial amount of power within the court, it would often result in the lower courtesan being exiled from the royal court, or married off to a lesser noble in an arranged marriage, or even murdered. There are also many examples of courtesans who took advantage of their involvement with powerful individuals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Career length==
In later centuries, from the mid-18th century on, courtesans would often find themselves cast aside by their benefactors, but the days of public execution or imprisonment based on their [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] lifestyle were over. There are many examples of courtesans who, by remaining discreet and respectful to their benefactors, were able to extend their careers into or past middle age and retire financially secure; [[Catherine Walters]] is a good example. By the late 19th century, and for a brief period in the early 20th century, courtesans had reached a level of social acceptance in many circles and settings, often even to the extent of becoming a friend and confidant to the wife of their benefactor.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt;

More often than not, a woman serving as a courtesan would last in that field only as long as she could prove herself useful to her companion, or companions. This, of course, excludes those who served as courtesans but who were already married into high society. When referring to those who made their service as a courtesan as their main source of income, success was based solely on financial management and longevity. Many climbed through the ranks of royalty, serving as mistress to lesser nobles first, eventually reaching the role of mistress to a king or prince. Others were able to obtain such a high position early on, but few lasted long, and after serving a prince or king there was nowhere to go but down.

[[Pietro Aretino]], an [[Italian Renaissance]] writer, wrote a series of dialogues (''Capricciosi ragionamenti'') in which a mother teaches her daughter what options are available to women and how to be an effective courtesan. The [[France|French]] novelist [[Balzac]] wrote about a courtesan in his ''[[Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes]]'' (1838–47). [[Emile Zola]] likewise wrote a novel, ''[[Nana (book)|Nana]]'' (1880), about a courtesan in nineteenth-century [[France]].

In addition to the list above, the term "courtesan" has often been used in a political context in an attempt to damage the reputation of a powerful woman, or disparage her importance. Because of this, there is still much historical debate over whether certain women in history can be referred to as courtesans. For example, the title was applied to the Byzantine empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], who had started life as an erotic actress but later became the wife of the Emperor [[Justinian]] and, after her death, an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[saint]]. The term has also been applied to influential women including [[Anne Boleyn]], Umrao Jaan (Amiran) from the novel &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Umrao Jann Ada]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; : She was kidnapped and sold into a Tawaif Kotha. [[Madaline Bishop]], [[Diane de Poitiers]], [[Mathilde Kschessinska]], [[Pamela Harriman]], [[Eva Perón]] and [[Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel]]. The attempt to define such women as courtesans is often intended to draw attention to certain perceived qualities, ambitions or conduct which are held to be courtesan-like.

[[File:Abraham Dharma.png|thumb|right|300px|Distribution of Eastern religions today (yellow), as opposed to [[Abrahamic religions]] (purple).]]
The '''Eastern religions''' are the [[religion]]s originating in [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and thus having dissimilarities with [[Western religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Eastern Religions: Origins, Beliefs, Practices, Holy Texts, Sacred Places |last1= Coogan |first1=Michael David |last2=Narayanan|first2=Vasudha|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]  |year=2005 |isbn=0195221907}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[East Asian religions]] ([[Shintoism]], [[Korean Shamanism|Sindoism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]), [[Indian religions]] ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]]) as well as [[animism|animistic]] [[indigenous religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Readings in Eastern Religions|editor-last1=Coward |editor-first1=Harold G.|editor-last2=Neumaier-Dargyay |editor-first2=Eva K. |editor-last3=Neufeldt |editor-first3=Ronald|publisher=[[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]] |year=1988 |isbn=0889209553|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Religions: Eastern Traditions, Volume 2|last1=Gurdon Oxtoby |first1=Willard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0195407504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This East-West religious distinction, just as with the [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] culture distinction, and the implications that arise from it, is broad and not precise. Furthermore, the geographical distinction has less meaning in the current context of global [[transculturation]].

While many [[Western culture|Western]] observers attempt to distinguish between [[Eastern philosophies]] and religions, this is a distinction that does not exist in some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (2001). Pp 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==
[[File:Temple hindu1.jpg|thumb|170px|A [[Hindu]] temple in [[Sri Lanka]].]]
{{details|Indian religions}}
Religions originating in the [[Indian subcontinent]] include [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;York (2005). Pg 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologies and philosophies of these religions have several concepts in common, such as ''[[dharma]]'', ''[[karma]]'', ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' and ''[[samsara]]''.

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism}}
[[File:Golden Aum.png|thumb|left|140px|[[Om|OM]], a sacred syllable and a quintessential symbol of Hinduism]]
[[File:Museum für Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 036 2.jpg|right|thumb|130px|A 13th century [[Cambodia]]n statue of [[Vishnu]].]]
Hinduism originated on the Indian subcontinent. It is considered by some to be the world's oldest extant major religion. Hinduism contains a vast body of [[scripture]], divided as [[Śruti|revealed]] and [[smriti|remembered]], expounding on dharma, or religious living. Hindus consider the ''[[Vedas]]'' and the ''[[Upanishads]]'' as being among the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{IAST|Bhagavad Gītā}}]]'', a treatise excerpted from the ''{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}'', is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the ''Vedas''. It is difficult to identify any universal belief or practice in Hinduism, although prominent themes include: ''[[Dharma]]'', ''[[Samsara]]'', ''[[Karma]]'', and ''[[Moksha]]''. Hinduism is sometimes called a [[polytheistic religion]], but this is an oversimplification. Hinduism includes a diverse collection of schools whose beliefs span [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[monism]] and even [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism]]. For instance, the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school holds that there is only one causal entity ([[Brahman]]), which manifests itself into all the various living and non-living forms that we observe, whereas traditions such as [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]] worship [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] in a relatively more monotheistic sense (caused by a differentiation between the [[parabrahman]] and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]). A number of scholars even consider the [[Samkhya]] school of thought to have atheistic leanings.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskarananda (1994).&lt;br /&gt;Weightman (1997). Pg 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[File:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|thumb|130px|right|The [[Tian Tan Buddha]] statue in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{main|Buddhism}}
Buddhism is a [[Nontheistic religions|nontheistic]] [[Indian religions|Indian religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Buddhism was founded around the 5th century [[BCE]] in [[India]] by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the Buddha, with the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Eightfold Path]] as its central principles. According to the scriptures, the Four Noble Truths were revealed by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. The schools of Buddhism are typically divided into [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]]. In academic circles, Mahayana is further divided into [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Buddhism teaches that someone who becomes [[bodhi|enlightened]] without instruction is a [[Buddhahood|buddha]]. The primary goal of Buddhism is the liberation of the practitioner from [[samsara]]. Buddhists hold this to be the solution to the problem of suffering.

===Jainism===
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|130px|right|This is the holiest [[Jain symbol]].]]
{{main|Jainism}}
Jainism is the religion of the followers of [[Mahavira]]. He is said to be the 24th [[Tirthankara]], or the 24th in a line of teachers espousing Jain principles. Jains reject the [[Veda]]s and highlight the practice of austerity. Jain philosophy states that the [[jiva]], or soul, can escape the cycle of rebirth and death through strict ethical behavior. When nothing remains but the purity of the jiva, that person is called a ''jina'', or winner, which is the origin of the term Jain. [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]] is viewed as an accumulation that burdens the soul, causing attachment and suffering. [[Ahimsa]], or non-violence, is central to Jain faith, philosophy and practice. It is interpreted very strictly as prohibiting all forms of harm to other living beings. Due to this, Jainism requires a strict [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarian]] lifestyle. ''Ahimsa'' also applies to speaking, as one's words can cause harm and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996). Pg 76.&lt;br /&gt;Fisher (1997). Pp 116-117.&lt;br /&gt;Rausch &amp; Key (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
{{main|Sikhism}}
[[File:Khanda.svg|left|80px]]
Sikhism is a religion which began in Punjab of [[Northern India]]. It is founded on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev]] and the nine human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]] that followed. He received a vision to preach the way to enlightenment and God in Sultanpur. His views rejected the traditional worships and caste of the Hindu faith. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sikhism.htm] Religions of the World Sikhism&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom from reincarnation is tied to remembrance and repetition on one universal God. God is formless and simultaneously in every form. Sikhs believe that there is one universal God who is the ultimate creator, sustainer, and destroyer. The [[Gurū Granth Sāhib]] are the central scriptures intended to preserve hymns and the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and other saints from Hindu and Sufi traditions. Rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship are considered of little use and Sikhs are discouraged from fasting or going on pilgrimages. The tenets of Sikhism include (1) honest living/earning (2) tithing and giving alms (3) chanting on God. Sikhism also has a strong warrior tradition which arose in defense of religious freedom and human rights from a tyrannical [[Moghul]] occupation of India.

==East Asian religions==
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
The group of [[East Asia]]n religions or philosophies share the concept of [[Tao]]. They may be considered as forming a group within [[world religion]]s&lt;ref&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp 71-72, 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] or [[Dharmic religion|Dharmic]] groups. The Taoic faiths claim at least 500 million members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html Religious population statistics]. These statistics are limited and do not reflect the full population of Taoic adherents due to complexities in definition and polling.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
{{main|Taoism}}
Taoism, also known as Daoism, comprises a variety of related religious and philosophical traditions. Categorization of Taoist sects and movements is very controversial. Taoist propriety and ethics places an emphasis on the [[Three Jewels of the Tao]]; love, moderation, humility. Taoist theology focuses on doctrines of [[wu wei]] ("non-action"), spontaneity, [[humanism]], [[relativism]] and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (1999). Pg 111.&lt;br /&gt;Slingerland (2003).&lt;br /&gt;Sharot (2001). Pg 78.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most traditional Chinese Taoists are polytheistic. There are disagreements regarding the proper composition of this pantheon. Popular Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the head [[deity]]. Intellectual, or "elite", Taoism usually presents [[Laozi]] and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the top of the pantheon. Nature and ancestor spirits are common in popular Taoism. But this sort of [[shamanism]] is eschewed for an emphasis on [[internal alchemy]] among the "elite" Taoists. Tao itself is rarely an object of worship, being treated more like the South Asian concept of [[wikt:atman|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal (2006). Pg 50. Maspero (1981). Pg 41. LaFargue (1994). Pg 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinto===
[[File:Priest at Dazaifu Tenmagu shrine 1.JPG|right|thumb|140px|A Shinto priest kneeling before a shrine.]]
{{main|Shinto}}
Shinto is an animistic [[folk religion]] practiced in Japan. Shinto literally means "the way of the gods". Many Japanese Shintoists also identify themselves as Buddhists. Japanese [[Pure Land Buddhism]] is deeply intertwined with the Shinto faith. Shinto practitioners commonly affirm tradition, family, nature, cleanliness and ritual observation as core values. Taoic influence is significant in their beliefs about nature and self-mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Pilgrim (1999). Pg 1.&lt;br /&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp. 161-162.&lt;br /&gt;Ono (2004). Pp 97-99, 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ritual cleanliness]] is a central part of Shinto life. [[Shrines]] have a significant place in Shintoism, reflecting the animistic veneration of the [[kami]]. "Folk", or "popular", Shinto places an emphasis on shamanism, particularly [[divination]], [[spirit possession]] and [[faith healing]]. "Sect" Shinto is a diverse group including mountain-worshippers and Confucian Shintoists.&lt;ref&gt;Ono (2004). Pp 12, 51-52, 108.&lt;br /&gt;Markham (2001). Pp 304-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
[[File:Confuciusstatue.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Statue of Confucius on Chongming Island in Shanghai]]
{{main|Confucianism}}
Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social and political thought, influential in the history of East Asia. It is debatable whether Confucianism is a religion or simply an ethical system. It is commonly associated with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] but it rejects legalism for [[ritualism]]. It also endorses [[meritocracy]] as the ideal of [[nobility]]. Confucianism has a complicated system governing duties and etiquette in relationships. Confucian ethics focus on familial duty, loyalty and humaneness.&lt;ref&gt;Smart (2000). Pp 66.&lt;br /&gt;Yao (2000). pp 191-192&lt;br /&gt;De Bary &amp; Tu (1998). Pg 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Confucianism tolerates the Chinese folk recognition of the existence of animistic spirits, [[ghosts]] and [[deities]]. It approves paying them proper respect, but at a more fundamental level encourages avoiding them. Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic [[Neo-Confucianism]] was built.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp 46, 85.&lt;br /&gt;Huang (1999). Pg 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exoteric''' refers to knowledge that is outside, and independent from, a person's experience and can be ascertained by anyone (related to [[common sense]]). The word is derived from the comparative form of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔξω ''eksô'', "from, out of, outside". It signifies anything which is public, without limits, or [[universalism|universal]]. It is distinguished from internal [[esoteric]] knowledge. "Exoteric" relates to external reality as opposed to a person's thoughts or feelings. It is knowledge that is public as opposed to [[secret]] or [[cabal]]istic.  It is not required that exoteric knowledge come easily or automatically, but it should be referenceable or reproducible.

== Philosophical context ==
Most philosophical and religious belief systems presume that reality must be independent of what an individual makes of it. However, even before the days of [[Plato]], a prominent alternate [[theory of knowledge]] insisted that the perceived outside reality is merely an internal fabrication of the observer and that it has no existence or substance outside the imagination of the observer. The Buddha's statement: "All that we are arises with our thoughts"  ([[Dhammapada]] 1.1) is reminiscent of this.

In his book entitled ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', the Japanese swordsmaster [[Miyamoto Musashi]] noted that when he teaches people martial arts, "since [he] generally makes them learn such things as have actual relevance to addressing [deeper principles], there is no such thing as a distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric." &lt;ref&gt;Miyamoto Musashi. ''The Book of Five Rings.'' Translated by Thomas Cleary. Shambhala Library. Boston &amp; London. 2003. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious context ==
In the same way as the term "esoteric" is often associated with [[esotericism|esoteric spirituality]], the term "exoteric" is mostly used in discussions of religion and spirituality, as when the teachings shift the believer's focus away from an exploration of the inner self and towards an adherence to rules, laws, and an individual God.

The term "exoteric" may also reflect the notion of a divine identity that is outside of, and different from, human identity, whereas the esoteric notion claims that the divine is to be discovered ''within'' the human identity. Going one step further, the pantheistic notion suggests that the divine and the material world are one and the same.

==Government==
The exoteric form of government is one where all actions taken by the government must be both publicly disclosed and ratified by the public. This is often referred to as [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of governance.

==Societies==
Many societies are divided into 2 sections—the ''exoteric'' or "public face" and the ''esoteric'' or "behind closed doors". Such are many [[fraternal organization]]s, such as [[Freemasonry]], which are at some level accessible to the uninitiated but which have higher and higher levels of initiation as one progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavron|first1=John T.

'''Experience''' is the [[knowledge]] or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare various contemporary definitions given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] (2nd edition, 1989): "[...] 3. The actual [[observation]] of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]  4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...]  b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]  6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally. [...]  7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired."
&lt;/ref&gt; Terms in [[philosophy]] such as "[[empirical knowledge]]" or "''a posteriori'' knowledge" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]]. The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]: [[on-the-job training]] rather than book-learning.

The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the [[philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard]]. The [[German language|German]] term ''[[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]]'', often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of [[personal life|life]]'s experiences.

Certain [[religious]] [[traditions]] (such as [[Buddhism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[mysticism]] and [[Pentecostalism]]) and educational [[paradigms]] with, for example, the [[physical exercise|conditioning]] of military [[recruit training|recruit-training]] (also known as "boot camps"), stress the experiential nature of human [[epistemology]]. This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of [[dogma]], [[logic]] or [[reason]]ing. Participants in activities such as [[tourism]], [[extreme sports]] and [[recreational drug use|recreational drug-use]] also tend to stress the importance of experience.

The history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]].

== Types of experience ==
The word "experience" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, both to [[mind|mentally]] unprocessed immediately perceived events as well as to the purported [[wisdom]] gained in subsequent reflection on those events or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

Some wisdom-experience accumulates over a period of [[time]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
though one can also experience (and gain general wisdom-experience from) a single specific momentary event.

One may also [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]] between (for example) [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] and [[virtual reality|virtual]] experience(s).

=== Physical ===

Physical experience occurs whenever an object or environment changes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, physical experiences relate to [[observable]]s. They need not involve [[modal property|modal properties]] nor [[Mind|mental experiences]].

=== Mental ===
{{Main|Mind}}

Mental experience involves the aspect of [[intellect]] and [[consciousness]] experienced as combinations of [[thought]], [[perception]], [[memory]], [[emotion]], [[free will|will]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and [[imagination]], including all unconscious [[cognitive]] processes. The term can refer, by implication, to a thought process. Mental experience and its relation to the physical brain form an area of philosophical debate: some identity theorists originally argued that the identity of brain and mental states held only for a few sensations. Most theorists, however, generalized the view to cover all mental experience.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematicians]] can exemplify cumulative mental experience in the approaches and skills with which they work. [[Mathematical realism]], like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover and experience it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. This point of view regards only one sort of mathematics as discoverable; it sees triangles, right angles, and curves, for example, as real entities, not just the creations of the human mind. Some working mathematicians have espoused mathematical realism as they see themselves experiencing naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (for example: for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but some conjectures, like the [[continuum hypothesis]], might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology such as experience could provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture. With experience, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

=== Emotional ===
{{Main|Emotion}}

Humans can rationalize [[falling in love|falling in (and out) of love]] as "emotional experience". Societies which lack institutional arranged marriages can call on emotional experience in individuals to influence [[mate selection|mate-selection]].&lt;ref&gt;

People can likewise achieve such experiences more deliberately through recognized [[mystical practice]]s such as [[sensory deprivation]] or [[mind control|mind-control]] techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], or [[mystical discipline]]s such as [[mantra meditation]], [[yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[dream yoga]], or [[surat shabd yoga|surat shabda yoga]]. Some practices encourage [[spiritual experience]]s through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as alcohol and opiates, but more commonly with [[entheogen]]ic plants and substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[salvia divinorum]]'', [[psilocybin]] mushrooms, [[peyote]], [[Dextromethorphan|DXM]], [[ayahuasca]], or ''[[datura]]''. Another way to induce spiritual experience through an altered state of consciousness involves [[psychoacoustics]], [[binaural beats]], or light-and-sound stimulation.

[[Role-playing game]]s treat "experience" (and its acquisition) as an important, measurable, and valuable commodity. Many [[role-playing video game]]s, for instance, feature units of measurement used to quantify or assist a player-character's progression through the game - called [[experience point]]s or XP.

=== Subjective ===

Subjective experience can involve a state of [[individual]] [[subjectivity]], [[perception]] on which one builds one's own state of [[reality]]; a reality based on one’s [[interaction]] with one's environment. The ''subjective'' ''experience'' depends on one’s [[individual]] ability to process [[data]], to store and [[internalize]] it. For example: our senses collect data, which we then process according to [[biological]] programming (genetics), [[neurological]] network-relationships and other variables such as [[Cultural relativity|relativity]] etc.,{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} all of which affect our individual experience of any given situation in such a way as to render it subjective.

== Immediacy of experience ==

Someone able to recount an event they witnessed or took part in has "[[wikt:firsthand|first hand]] experience". First hand experience of the "you had to be there" variety can seem especially valuable and privileged, but it often remains potentially subject to errors in [[sense]]-[[perception]] and in personal [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].

[[Second hand|Second-hand]] experience can offer richer resources: recorded and/or summarised from first-hand observers or experiencers or from instruments, and potentially expressing multiple [[Perspective (cognitive)|points of view]].

Third-hand experience, based on indirect and possibly unreliable [[rumour]] or [[hearsay]], can (even given reliable accounts) potentially stray perilously close to blind honouring of [[authority]].

== Changes through history ==

Some [[post-modernism|post-modernist]]s suggest that the nature of human experiencing (quite apart from the details of the experienced surrounds) has undergone qualitative change during transition from the pre-modern through the [[modernity|modern]] to the [[post-modernity|post-modern]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Alternatives to experience ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] contrasted experience with [[reason]]:
:"Nothing, indeed, can be more harmful or more unworthy of the philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to so-called experience. Such experience would never have existed at all, if at the proper time, those institutions had been established in accordance with ideas."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These views of Kant are mirrored in the research of [[ideasthesia]], which demonstrates that one can experience the world only if one has the appropriate concepts (i.e., the ''ideas'') about the objects that are being experienced.

=== Writing ===
American author [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote an essay entitled "[[Experience (Emerson)|Experience]]" (published in 1844), in which he asks readers to disregard [[emotion]]s that could alienate them from the divine; it provides a somewhat [[pessimism|pessimistic]] representation of the [[transcendentalism]] associated with Emerson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9804">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]], the '''Gaussian free field (GFF)''' is a [[Gaussian random field]], a central model of random surfaces (random height functions). {{harvtxt|Sheffield|2007}} gives a mathematical survey of the Gaussian free field.

The discrete version can be defined on any [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], usually a [[lattice graph|lattice]] in ''d''-dimensional Euclidean space. The continuum version is defined on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; or on a bounded subdomain of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. It can be thought of as a natural generalization of [[Wiener process|one-dimensional Brownian motion]] to ''d'' time (but still one space) dimensions; in particular, the one-dimensional continuum GFF is just the standard one-dimensional Brownian motion or [[Brownian bridge]] on an interval.

In the theory of random surfaces, it is also called the '''harmonic crystal'''. It is also the starting point for many constructions in [[quantum field theory]], where it is called the '''Euclidean [[bosonic field|bosonic]] massless free field'''. A key property of the 2-dimensional GFF is [[conformal group|conformal invariance]], which relates it in several ways to the [[Schramm-Loewner Evolution]], see {{harvtxt|Sheffield|2005}} and {{harvtxt|Dubédat|2007}}.

Similarly to Brownian motion, which is the [[scaling limit]] of a wide range of discrete [[random walk]] models (see [[Donsker's theorem]]), the continuum GFF is the scaling limit of not only the discrete GFF on lattices, but of many random height function models, such as the height function of [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform random]] planar [[domino tiling]]s, see {{harvtxt|Kenyon|2001}}. The planar GFF is also the limit of the fluctuations of the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a [[random matrix]] model, the Ginibre ensemble, see {{harvtxt|Rider|Virág|2007}}.

The structure of the discrete GFF on any graph is closely related to the behaviour of the [[Random walk#Random walk on graphs|simple random walk on the graph]]. For instance, the discrete GFF plays a key role in the proof by {{harvtxt|Ding|Lee|Peres|2012}} of several conjectures about the cover time of graphs (the expected number of steps it takes for the random walk to visit all the vertices).

==Definition of the discrete GFF==

[[File:Discrete Gaussian free field on 60 x 60 square grid.png|thumb|This surface plot shows a sample of the discrete Gaussian free field defined on the vertices of a 60 by 60 square grid, with zero boundary conditions. The values of the DGFF on the vertices are linearly interpolated to give a continuous function.]]

Let ''P''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') be the transition kernel of the [[Markov chain]] given by a [[random walk]] on a finite graph&amp;nbsp;''G''(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E''). Let ''U'' be a fixed non-empty subset of the vertices ''V'', and take the set of all real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; with some prescribed values on&amp;nbsp;''U''. We then define a [[Gibbs measure|Hamiltonian]] by

: &lt;math&gt;H( \varphi ) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(x,y)} P(x,y)\big(\varphi(x) - \varphi(y)\big)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

Then, the random function with [[probability density function|probability density]] proportional to &lt;math&gt;\exp(-H(\varphi))&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the [[Lebesgue measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\R^{V\setminus U}&lt;/math&gt; is called the discrete GFF with boundary&amp;nbsp;''U''.

It is not hard to show that the [[expected value]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[\varphi(x)]&lt;/math&gt; is the discrete [[harmonic function|harmonic]] extension of the boundary values from&amp;nbsp;''U'' (harmonic with respect to the transition kernel&amp;nbsp;''P''), and the [[covariance]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}[\varphi(x),\varphi(y)]&lt;/math&gt; are equal to the discrete [[Green's function]]&amp;nbsp;''G''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'').

So, in one sentence, the discrete GFF is the [[Gaussian random field]] on ''V'' with covariance structure given by the Green's function associated to the transition kernel&amp;nbsp;''P''.

==The continuum field==

The definition of the continuum field necessarily uses some abstract machinery, since it does not exist as a random height function. Instead, it is a random generalized function, or in other words, a [[probability distribution|distribution]] on [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s (with two different meanings of the word "distribution").

Given a domain Ω&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, consider the [[Dirichlet energy|Dirichlet inner product]]

: &lt;math&gt;\langle f, g\rangle := \int_\Omega (Df(x), Dg(x)) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

for smooth functions ''&amp;fnof;'' and ''g'' on Ω, coinciding with some prescribed boundary function on &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Df\,(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gradient vector]] at &lt;math&gt;x\in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Then take the [[Hilbert space]] closure with respect to this [[inner product]], this is the [[Sobolev space]] &lt;math&gt;H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

The continuum GFF &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Gaussian random field]] indexed by &lt;math&gt;H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., a collection of [[normal distribution|Gaussian]] random variables, one for each &lt;math&gt;f \in H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle \varphi,f \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, such that the [[covariance]] structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}[\langle \varphi,f \rangle, \langle \varphi,g \rangle] = \langle f,g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f,g\in H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

Such a random field indeed exists, and its distribution is unique. Given any [[orthonormal basis]] &lt;math&gt;\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; (with the given boundary condition), we can form the formal infinite sum

: &lt;math&gt; \varphi := \sum_{k=1}^\infty \xi_k \psi_k,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\xi_k&lt;/math&gt; are [[i.i.d.]] [[standard normal variable]]s. This random sum almost surely will not exist as an element of &lt;math&gt;H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, since its [[variance]] is infinite. However, it exists as a random [[distribution (mathematics)|generalized function]], since for any &lt;math&gt;f \in H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; we have

: &lt;math&gt;f=\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k \psi_k,\text{ with }\sum_{k=1}^\infty c_k^2 &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

hence

: &lt;math&gt;\langle \varphi,f \rangle := \sum_{k=1}^\infty \xi_k c_k&lt;/math&gt;

is a well-defined finite random number.

===Special case: ''n'' = 1===

Although the above argument shows that &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; does not exist as a random element of &lt;math&gt;H^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, it still could be that it is a random function on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; in some larger function space. In fact, in dimension &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, an orthonormal basis of &lt;math&gt;H^1[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\psi_k (t):= \int_0^t \varphi_k(s) \, ds\,,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(\varphi_k)&lt;/math&gt; form an orthonormal basis of &lt;math&gt;L^2[0,1]\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and then &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t):=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \xi_k \psi_k(t)&lt;/math&gt; is easily seen to be a one-dimensional Brownian motion (or Brownian bridge, if the boundary values for &lt;math&gt;\varphi_k&lt;/math&gt; are set up that way). So, in this case, it is a random continuous function. For instance, if &lt;math&gt;(\varphi_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Haar basis]], then this is Lévy's construction of Brownian motion, see, e.g., Section 3 of {{harvtxt|Peres|2001}}.

On the other hand, for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; it can indeed be shown to exist only as a generalized function, see {{harvtxt|Sheffield|2007}}.

===Special case: ''n'' = 2===

In dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the conformal invariance of the continuum GFF is clear from the invariance of the Dirichlet inner product.

The '''GigaMesh''' Software Framework is a modular [[software]] for display, editing and visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|3D]]-data typically acquired with [[structured light]] or [[structure from motion]].

It provides numerous functions for analysis of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] objects like [[clay tablet|cuneiform tablets]], [[ceramics]]&lt;ref name="Thaller_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Survey_3D" /&gt; or converted [[Lidar|LiDAR]] data&lt;ref name="LiDAR_processing" /&gt;. Typically applications are [[unwrapping]]s (or rollouts)&lt;ref name="Abrollung_Silberbecher" /&gt;, [[profile cuts]] (or [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sections]])&lt;ref name="CVA_Beiheft_Wien_1_3D" /&gt; as well as visualizations of [[distance]]s and [[curvature]], which can be exported as [[raster graphics]] or [[vector graphics]].

The retrieval of text in 3D like damaged cuneiform tablets or [[Weathering|weathered]] medieval [[headstones]]&lt;ref name="Spiegel_Heiliger_Sand" /&gt; using [[Multi-scale approaches|Multi Scale]] Integral Invariant (MSII)&lt;ref name="Dissertation_Mara" /&gt; [[Digital_image_processing#Filtering|filtering]] is a core function of the software. Futhermore small or faint surface details like [[fingerprints]] can be visualized.&lt;ref name="GigaMesh_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mara_Vortrag_2017" /&gt; The [[Polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]] of the 3D-models can be inspected, cleaned and repaired to provide optimal filtering results. The repaired datasets are suitable for [[3D printing]] and for [[Electronic publishing|digital publishing]] in a [[dataverse]].&lt;ref name="IWR_Dataverse" /&gt;

== Name and Logo ==
The name "GigaMesh" refers to processing of large 3D-datasets and relates intentional to the mythical [[Sumer|sumerian]] king [[Gilgamesh]] and his heroic epic described on a set of clay tablets.{{r|Dissertation_Mara|p=115}} The central element of the logo is the [[cuneiform]] sign [[wikt:𒆜|𒆜 (kaskal)]] meaning street or [[road junction]], which symbolizes the intersection of the [[humanities]] and [[computer science]]. The surrounding circle refers to the integral [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] computation using a [[sphere|spherical]] [[Domain of a function|domain]]. The color [[red]] is used by the Heidelberg University, where GigaMesh is developed.

== Development and application in research projects ==
The development began in 2009 and was inspired by the edition project ''Keilschrifttexte aus [[Assur]] literarischen Inhalts'' (KAL, cuneiform texts with literary content) of the [[Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref name="GigaMesh_2010" /&gt; In parallel it was applied within the Austrian [[Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum]] of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] for documentation of [[red-figure pottery]].&lt;ref name="CVA_Beiheft_Wien_1_3D" /&gt; Current projects are funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] and the [[Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung|BMBF]] for contextualization and analysis of [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and sealings of the [[Corpus der minoischen und mykenischen Siegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DFG - GEPRIS - Minoische Siegelglyptik zwischen corpusartiger Erfassung und 3D-Forensik.

[[Image:Spartina alterniflora.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' ([[cordgrass]]), a halophyte.]]

A '''halophyte''' is a salt-tolerant [[plant]] that grows in waters of high [[salinity]], coming into contact with saline water through its roots or by salt spray, such as in saline semi-deserts, [[mangrove]] swamps, marshes and sloughs and seashores. These plants do not prefer saline environments but because of their ability to cope with high salinity in various ways they face much less competition in these areas. The word derives from Ancient Greek ἅλας (halas) 'salt' and φυτόν (phyton) 'plant'. An example of a halophyte is the salt marsh grass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' (smooth cordgrass). Relatively few plant species are halophytes—perhaps only 2% of all plant species.

The large majority of plant species are '''glycophytes''', which are not salt-tolerant and are damaged fairly easily by high salinity.&lt;ref name="Glenn99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glenn | first1 = E. P. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1999 | title = Salt tolerance and crop potential of halophytes | url = | journal = Critical Review in Plant Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 227–55 | doi = 10.1080/07352689991309207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Halophytes can be classified in many ways. According to '''Stocker''' (1933), it is mainly of 3 kinds, viz.

1. '''Aqua-halines'''
*''Emerged Halophytes'' (most of the stem remains above the water level)
*''Hydro-halophytes'' (whole or almost whole plant remains under water)
2. '''Terrestro-halines'''
*''Hygro-halophytes'' (grow on swamp lands)
*''Mesohalophytes'' (grow on non-swamp, non-dry lands)
*''Xero-halophytes'' (grow on dry or mostly dry lands)
3. '''Aero-halines'''


Again, according to '''Iversen''' (1936), these plants are classified with respect to the salinity of the soil on which they grow.

1. '''Oligo-halophytes''' (amount of [[NaCl]] in the soil is 0.01 to 0.1%)

2. '''Meso-halophytes''' (amount of NaCl in the soil is 0.1 to 1%)

3. '''Euhalophytes''' (amount of NaCl in the soil is &gt;1%)&lt;ref name=''Halophytes: Classification and Characters of Halophytes''&gt;{{cite web | title=Halophytes: Classification and Characters of Halophytes | url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/plants/halophytes-classification-and-characters-of-halophytes-with-diagram/6932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salt tolerance ==
One quantitative measure of salt tolerance ([[halotolerance]]) is the total dissolved solids in irrigation water that a plant can tolerate. [[Seawater]] typically contains 40&amp;nbsp;grams per litre (g/l) of dissolved salts (mostly [[sodium chloride]]). [[Beans]] and [[rice]] can tolerate about 1–3 g/l, and are considered glycophytes (as are most [[crop plant]]s). At the other extreme, ''[[Salicornia bigelovii]]'' (dwarf glasswort) grows well at 70 g/l of dissolved solids, and is a promising halophyte for use as a crop. 
&lt;ref&gt;
Glenn, E. P.; Brown, J. J.; O'Leary, J. W. (1998). [http://www.miracosta.edu/home/kmeldahl/writing/..%5Carticles/crops.pdf "Irrigating Crops with Seawater",] ''[http://www.sciam.com Scientific American]'', Vol. 279, no. 8, Aug. 1998, pp. 56-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants such as barley (''[[Hordeum vulgare]]'') and the date palm (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]'') can tolerate about 5 g/l, and can be considered as marginal halophytes.&lt;ref name="Glenn99" /&gt;

Adaptation to saline environments by halophytes may take the form of salt tolerance or salt avoidance. Plants that avoid the effects of high salt even though they live in a saline environment may be referred to as facultative halophytes rather than 'true', or obligatory, halophytes.[[File:Pneumatophore overkill - grey mangrove.JPG|thumb|320px|right|[[Pneumatophores]] of [[Grey mangrove]]]]

For example, a short-lived plant species that completes its reproductive life cycle during periods (such as a [[rainy season]]) when the salt concentration is low would be avoiding salt rather than tolerating it. Or a plant species may maintain a 'normal' internal salt concentration by excreting excess salts through its leaves, by way of a [[hydathode]], or by concentrating salts in leaves that later die and drop off.

In an effort to improve agricultural production in regions where crops are exposed to salinity, research is focused on improving understanding of the various mechanisms whereby plants respond to salinity stress, so that more robust crop halophytes may be developed.  Adaptive responses to salinity stress have been identified at molecular, cellular, metabolic, and physiological levels.&lt;ref name=Gupta-2014&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijg/2014/701596/| title=Mechanism of Salinity Tolerance in Plants: Physiological, Biochemical, and Molecular Characterization| first1=Bhaskar| last1=Gupta| first2=Bingru| last2=Huang| journal=[[International Journal of Genomics]]| doi=10.1155/2014/701596| date=3 April 2014| accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some halophytes are:
*''[[Anemopsis californica]]'' (''yerba mansa'', lizard tail)
*''[[Atriplex]]'' (saltbush, orache, orach)
*''[[Attalea speciosa]]'' (babassu)
*''[[Panicum virgatum]]'' (switchgrass)
*''[[Salicornia]] bigelovii'' (dwarf glasswort, pickleweed)
*''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' (smooth cordgrass)
*''[[Tetragonia tetragonoides]]'' (warrigal greens, ''kōkihi'', sea spinach)

==As biofuel==
{{Main|Biofuel}}

Some halophytes are being studied for use as "3rd-generation" biofuel precursors. Halophytes such as ''[[Salicornia bigelovii]]'' can be grown in harsh environments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/fact_sheets/pages/alt-fuels.aspx |publisher=[[IATA]] |title=Fact Sheet: Alternative Fuels |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201191340/https://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/fact_sheets/pages/alt-fuels.aspx |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically do not compete with food crops for resources, making them promising sources of [[biodiesel]]&lt;ref name="Glenn1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glenn |first=Edward P. |author2=Brown, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10950">The term '''high-κ dielectric''' refers to a material with a high [[dielectric constant]] κ (as compared to [[silicon dioxide]]).  High-κ dielectrics are used in [[semiconductor manufacturing]] processes where they are usually used to replace a silicon dioxide [[gate oxide|gate dielectric]] or another dielectric layer of a device.  The implementation of high-κ gate dielectrics is one of several strategies developed to allow further miniaturization of microelectronic components, colloquially referred to as extending [[Moore's Law]].

Sometimes these materials are called "high-k" instead of "high-κ" (high [[kappa]]).

==Need for high-κ materials==

Silicon dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has been used as a gate oxide material for decades.  As transistors have decreased in size, the thickness of the silicon dioxide gate dielectric has steadily decreased to increase the gate capacitance and thereby drive current, raising device performance. As the thickness scales below 2 [[Nanometer|nm]], leakage currents due to [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] increase drastically, leading to high power consumption and reduced device reliability.  Replacing the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with a high-κ material allows increased gate capacitance without the associated leakage effects.

===First principles===

The gate oxide in a [[MOSFET]] can be modeled as a parallel plate capacitor.  Ignoring quantum mechanical and depletion effects from the [[silicon|Si]] substrate and gate, the [[capacitance]] ''C'' of this parallel plate [[capacitor]] is given by
: &lt;math&gt;C=\frac{\kappa\varepsilon_{0}A}{t} &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:High-k.svg|right|thumbnail|upright=1.4|Conventional silicon dioxide gate dielectric structure compared to a potential high-k dielectric structure where κ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;16]] 
[[File:FET cross section.png|thumbnail|upright=1.4|Cross-section of an n-channel [[MOSFET]] transistor showing the gate oxide dielectric]]

Where

*''A'' is the capacitor area
*κ is the [[dielectric constant|relative dielectric constant]] of the material (3.9 for [[silicon dioxide]])
*ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Vacuum permittivity|permittivity of free space]]
*''t'' is the thickness of the capacitor oxide insulator

Since leakage limitation constrains further reduction of ''t'', an alternative method to increase gate capacitance is alter κ by replacing silicon dioxide with a high-κ material. In such a scenario, a thicker gate oxide layer might be used which can reduce the [[subthreshold leakage|leakage current]] flowing through the structure as well as improving the gate dielectric [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].

===Gate capacitance impact on drive current===
The drain current ''I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a [[MOSFET]] can be written (using the gradual channel approximation) as
 
:&lt;math&gt;I_{D,Sat} = \frac{W}{L} \mu\, C_{inv}\frac{(V_{G}-V_{th})^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
*''W'' is the width of the transistor channel
*''L'' is the channel length
*μ is the channel carrier mobility (assumed constant here)
*''C&lt;sub&gt;inv&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the capacitance density associated with the gate dielectric when the underlying channel is in the inverted state
*''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the voltage applied to the transistor gate
*''V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[threshold voltage]]

The term ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' is limited in range due to reliability and room temperature operation constraints, since a too large ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' would create an undesirable, high electric field across the oxide. Furthermore, ''V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot easily be reduced below about 200 mV, because leakage currents due to increased oxide leakage (that is, assuming high-κ dielectrics are not available) and [[subthreshold conduction]] raise stand-by power consumption to unacceptable levels. (See the industry roadmap,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itrs.net/Links/2006Update/FinalToPost/04_PIDS2006Update.pdf |work=International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors: 2006 Update |title=Process Integration, Devices, and Structures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025913/http://www.itrs.net/Links/2006Update/FinalToPost/04_PIDS2006Update.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which limits threshold to 200 mV, and Roy ''et al.'' &lt;ref name=Roy&gt;

==Materials and considerations==
Replacing the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with another material adds complexity to the manufacturing process.  Silicon dioxide can be formed by [[thermal oxidation|oxidizing]] the underlying silicon, ensuring a uniform, conformal oxide and high interface quality.  As a consequence, development efforts have focused on finding a material with a requisitely high dielectric constant that can be easily integrated into a manufacturing process.  Other key considerations include [[electronic band structure|band]] alignment to [[silicon]] (which may alter leakage current), film morphology, thermal stability, maintenance of a high [[electron mobility|mobility]] of charge carriers in the channel and minimization of electrical defects in the film/interface.  Materials which have received considerable attention are [[hafnium silicate]], [[zirconium silicate]], [[hafnium dioxide]] and [[zirconium dioxide]], typically deposited using [[atomic layer deposition]].

It is expected that [[defect states]] in the high-k dielectric can influence its electrical properties. Defect states can be measured for example by using zero-bias thermally stimulated current, zero-temperature-gradient zero-bias thermally stimulated [[dark current spectroscopy|current spectroscopy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.119590|title=Detection of defect states responsible for leakage current in ultrathin tantalum pentoxide (Ta[sub 2]O[sub 5]) films by zero-bias thermally stimulated current spectroscopy|year=1997|last1=Lau|first1=W.

==Use in industry==
The industry has employed [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]] gate dielectrics since the 1990s, wherein a conventionally formed silicon oxide dielectric is infused with a small amount of nitrogen.  The nitride content subtly raises the dielectric constant and is thought to offer other advantages, such as resistance against dopant diffusion through the gate dielectric.

In early 2007, [[Intel]] announced the deployment of [[hafnium]]-based high-k dielectrics in conjunction with a metallic gate for components built on [[45 nanometer]] technologies, and has shipped it in the 2007 processor series codenamed [[Penryn (microarchitecture)|Penryn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/architecture-silicon/45nm-core2/index.htm |title=Intel 45nm High-k Silicon Technology Page |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/oct07/5553 IEEE Spectrum: The High-k Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, [[IBM]] announced plans to transition to high-k materials, also hafnium-based, for some products in 2008.  While not identified, the most likely dielectric used in such applications are some form of nitrided hafnium silicates (HfSiON). HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HfSiO are susceptible to crystallization during dopant activation annealing. [[NEC]] Electronics has also announced the use of a HfSiON dielectric in their 55&amp;nbsp;nm ''UltimateLowPower'' technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.necel.com/process/en/lowpower_overview.html |title=UltimateLowPower Technology&amp;#124;Advanced Process Technology&amp;#124;Technology&amp;#124;NEC Electronics |publisher=Necel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219033938/http://www.necel.com/process/en/lowpower_overview.html |archivedate=2010-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even HfSiON is susceptible to trap-related leakage currents, which tend to increase with stress over device lifetime. This leakage effect becomes more severe as hafnium concentration increases. There is no guarantee however, that hafnium will serve as a de facto basis for future high-k dielectrics. The 2006 [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS]] roadmap predicted the implementation of high-k materials to be commonplace in the industry by 2010.

A '''hydrogen vehicle''' is a [[vehicle]] that uses [[hydrogen]] as its onboard fuel for [[motive power]]. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled [[space rocket]]s, as well as [[automobile]]s and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the [[chemical energy]] of hydrogen to [[mechanical energy]] either by burning hydrogen in an [[internal combustion engine]], or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a [[fuel cell]] to run electric motors.

In Britain, the [[Reaction Engines A2]] has been proposed to use the thermodynamic properties of [[liquid hydrogen]] to achieve very high speed, long distance (antipodal) flight by burning it in a [[precooled jet engine]].

===Fork trucks===
A HICE forklift or HICE lift truck is a hydrogen fueled, [[internal combustion engine]]-powered industrial [[forklift truck]] used for lifting and [[transport]]ing materials.  The first production HICE forklift truck based on the Linde X39 Diesel was presented at an exposition in [[Hannover]] on May 27, 2008. It used a 2.0 litre, {{convert|43|kW|abbr=on}} diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-35668015_ITM |title=Hydrogen engines get a lift |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HyICE"&gt;[https://www.hfpeurope.org/uploads/700/836/2005_HFP_Brussels_HyICE.pdf HyICE]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[fuel cell forklift]] (also called a fuel cell lift truck) is a fuel cell powered industrial forklift truck.

Environmental Leader: Environmental &amp; Energy Management News, 20 July 2011, accessed 2 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Most companies in Europe and the US do not use petroleum powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/forklift_anl_esd.pdf Full Fuel-Cycle Comparison of Forklift Propulsion Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217104928/http://www2.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/forklift_anl_esd.pdf |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel-cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery powered forklifts as they can be refueled in 3 minutes. They can be used in refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The fuel cell units are often designed as drop-in replacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.still.co.uk/fuel-cell-technology-uk.0.0.html|title=Fuel cell technology|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graftechaet.com/getattachment/065811d2-720e-40c6-b236-0440c4d90d76/OFCC-Forklift-Case-Study.aspx|title=Creating Innovative Graphite Solutions for Over 125 Years|work=GrafTech International|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206072419/http://www.graftechaet.com/getattachment/065811d2-720e-40c6-b236-0440c4d90d76/OFCC-Forklift-Case-Study.aspx|archive-date=6 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockets===
Many large [[rocket]]s use [[liquid hydrogen]] as fuel, with [[liquid oxygen]] as an oxidizer (LH2/LOX). An advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high [[effective exhaust velocity]] compared to [[kerosene]]/[[LOX]] or [[UDMH]]/[[Nitrogen tetroxide|NTO]] engines. According to the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], a rocket with higher exhaust velocity uses less propellant to accelerate. Also the [[energy density]] of hydrogen is greater than any other fuel.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;College of the Desert, “Module 1, Hydrogen Properties”, Revision 0, December 2001 [http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/03/f12/fcm01r0.pdf Hydrogen Properties]. Retrieved 2015-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; LH2/LOX also yields the greatest efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed, of any known rocket propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/hydrogen_fuel_of_choice.html|title=NASA - Liquid Hydrogen--the Fuel of Choice for Space Exploration|author=|date=|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disadvantage of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly.  Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due to the constant hydrogen boil-off, the rocket must be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for [[ICBM]]s and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations.

Overall, the delta-v of a hydrogen stage is typically not much different from that of a dense fuelled stage, but the weight of a hydrogen stage is much less, which makes it particularly effective for upper stages, since they are carried by the lower stages. For first stages, dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage, due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, George P. and Oscar Biblarz. [http://web.mit.edu/e_peters/Public/Rockets/Rocket_Propulsion_Elements.pdf ''Rocket Propulsion Elements''], Seventh edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons (2001), p. 257, {{ISBN|0-471-32642-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LH2/LOX were also used in the [[Space Shuttle]] to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/fc_shuttle.html |title=Fuel cell use in the Space Shuttle |publisher=NASA |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the fuel cell is water, which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space.

==Internal combustion vehicle==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ford Motor Company]] --&gt;
{{Main|Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|List of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles}}
Hydrogen internal combustion engine cars are different from hydrogen fuel cell cars. The [[Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|hydrogen internal combustion car]] is a slightly modified version of the traditional gasoline [[internal combustion engine]] car. These hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do; the main difference is the exhaust product. Gasoline combustion results in [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapour|water vapor]], while the only exhaust product of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In 1807 [[Francois Isaac de Rivaz]] designed [[De Rivaz engine|the first hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h2cars.de/1_cardata/c214.htm|title=H2Mobility - Hydrogen Vehicles - netinform|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Roger Billings]], then a high school student, converted a [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]] to run on hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/index.php/1807-1986 "Hydrogen Fuel Cars 1807–1986"], Hydrogen Cars Now, accessed April 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Paul Dieges patented a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen {{Cite patent|US|3844262}}.

===Production===
{{Details|Hydrogen production}}
The molecular hydrogen needed as an onboard fuel for hydrogen vehicles can be obtained through many thermochemical methods utilizing [[natural gas]], [[coal]] (by a process known as coal gasification), [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[biomass]] ([[biomass gasification]]), by a process called [[thermolysis]], or as a microbial waste product called [[biohydrogen]] or [[biological hydrogen production (Algae)|Biological hydrogen production]]. 95% of hydrogen is produced using natural gas,&lt;ref name=Stupendous&gt;Suplee, Curt.

''Washington Post'', November 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and 85% of hydrogen produced is used to remove sulfur from gasoline. Hydrogen can also be produced from [[water]] by [[electrolysis]] at working efficiencies in the 50–60% range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65–70% for the larger plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/w-i-energiew-eng3.html#3.4 |title= Chapter 3: Production of Hydrogen.

===Storage===
{{Details|Hydrogen storage}}
[[Image:Blue diamond compressed hydrogen.jpg|thumb|upright|Compressed hydrogen storage mark]]
Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484_Fuel_cell_electric_vehicles_and_hydrogen_infrastructure_status_2012?ev=prf_pub|last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich|first2=Bernd|last2=Mueller|first3=Rittmar|last3=von Helmolt|publisher=[[Energy &amp; Environmental Science]] |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen has a very low volumetric energy [[density]] at ambient conditions, equal to about one-third that of methane.

The Department of Energy planned to spread a $7.2 million investment among the states of Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee to support projects that fuel vehicles and support power systems. The Center for Transportation and The Environment, Fed Ex Express, Air Products and Chemicals, and Sprint have invested in the development of fuel cells.

And, because ongoing research and development is necessary to develop game-changing technologies, this bill also restores funding for Hydrogen energy research”. In June 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy gave 9 million dollars in grants to speed up technology development, 4.5 million for advanced fuel cell membranes, $3 million to 3M corporation to work on membranes with improved durability and performance, and 1.5 million to the Colorado School of Mines for work on simpler and more affordable fuel cell membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/07/doe-funds-more-hydrogen-fuel-cell-research-with-4-5m-investment/|title=DOE funds more hydrogen fuel cell research with $4.5m investment| author=Jon LeSage|work=Autoblog|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of hydrogen vehicles are presented in the 2006 documentary, ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]''.

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, in 2008, quoted [[Robert Zubrin]], the author of ''[[Energy Victory]]'', as saying: "Hydrogen is 'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel'".&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;Wrigglesworth, Phil.

The revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; The magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation, which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today's gasoline cars. On the other hand, if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, "it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

A 2009 study at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], published in the ''Journal of Power Sources'', similarly found that, over their lifetimes, hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.&lt;ref name=UCDavis&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/cars-lifestyle/hydrogen-cars-lifecycle-emits-more-carbon-than-gas-cars-study-says/ "Hydrogen Cars' Lifecycle Emits More Carbon Than Gas Cars, Study Says",] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106211628/http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/cars-lifestyle/hydrogen-cars-lifecycle-emits-more-carbon-than-gas-cars-study-says/ |date=2010-01-06 }} ''[[Digital Trends]]'', January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with a 2014 analysis.&lt;ref name=Cox2014/&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' asked in 2009, "[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries"?&lt;ref name=Stupendous/&gt;  ''[[The Motley Fool]]'' stated in 2013 that "there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production."&lt;ref&gt;Chatsko, Maxx.

Volkswagen's Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that "no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity." He elaborated: "Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy", but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen "with low efficiencies" where "you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy". You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. "And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss". Krebs continued: "in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent."&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, Sebastian.

If that energy does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure. Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before [[FCEV]]s [fuel cell electric vehicles] become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are "still very, very expensive".&lt;ref name=Davies1&gt;Davies, Alex.

In 2014, Joseph Romm devoted three articles to updating his critiques of hydrogen vehicles. He stated that fuel cell vehicles still have not overcome the following issues: high cost of the vehicles, high fueling cost, and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure. "It would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades."&lt;ref&gt;Romm, Joseph.

[http://cleantechnica.com/2015/03/19/hydrogen-economy-boom-bust/ "Hydrogen Economy: Boom or Bust?"], ''Clean Technica'', March 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study in the November issue of the journal ''[[Energy (journal)|Energy]]'' by scientists at [[Stanford University]] and the [[Technical University of Munich]] concluded that, even assuming local hydrogen production, "investing in all-electric battery vehicles is a more economical choice for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, primarily due to their lower cost and significantly higher energy efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvbuzz.com/electric-cars-better "Battery electric cars are a better choice for emissions reduction"], PVBuzz.com,  November 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 analysis published in ''Green Car Reports'' concluded that the best hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles consume "more than three times more electricity per mile than an electric vehicle ... generate more greenhouse-gas emissions than other powertrain technologies ... [and have] very high fuel costs. ... Considering all the obstacles and requirements for new infrastructure (estimated to cost as much as $400 billion), fuel-cell vehicles seem likely to be a niche technology at best, with little impact on U.S. oil consumption.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The US Department of Energy agrees, for fuel produced by grid electricity via electrolysis, but not for most other pathways for generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/emissions_hydrogen.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Emissions| website=www.afdc.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne National Laboratory developed a model of these emission pathways, to communicate the impact of potential fuel cell vehicle advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=M|date=November 2, 2002|title=Fuel Choices for Fuel-Cell Vehicles: Well-to-Wheels Energy and Emission Impacts|url=https://greet.es.anl.gov/publication-vmuujx18|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=112|pages=307–321|doi=10.1016/s0378-7753(02)00447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Michael Barnard, writing in ''[[Forbes]]'', listed the continuing disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell cars and concluded that "by about 2008, it was very clear that hydrogen was and would be inferior to battery technology as a storage of energy for vehicles.

==Comparison with other types of alternative fuel vehicle==
{{main|alternative fuel vehicle}}

Hydrogen vehicles compete with various proposed alternatives to the modern [[fossil fuel]] powered vehicle infrastructure.&lt;ref name=RSC2/&gt;

===Plug-in hybrids===
{{update|section|date=November 2013|No content is presented about series production PHEVs launched starting with the [[BYD F3DM]] and the [[Chevrolet Volt]]. Figures presented do not reflect current technology available.}}
{{Main|plug-in hybrid}}
[[Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s, or PHEVs, are [[hybrid vehicle]]s that can be plugged into the electric grid and contain an electric motor and also an [[internal combustion engine]]. The PHEV concept augments standard [[hybrid electric vehicles]] with the ability to recharge their batteries from an external source, enabling increased use of the vehicle's electric motors while reducing their reliance on internal combustion engines. The infrastructure required to charge PHEVs is already in place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/news/release.asp?id=204 |title=US government news release |publisher=Pnl.gov |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transmission of power from grid to car is about 93% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerwatch.org.uk/energy/graham.asp |title=Domestic Energy use in the UK |publisher=Powerwatch |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not the only energy loss in transferring power from grid to wheels. AC/DC conversion must take place from the grids AC supply to the PHEV's DC. This is roughly 98% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cr4.globalspec.com/blogentry/434/Transformer-Efficiency-Standards-Proposed |title=CR4 - Blog Entry: Transformer Efficiency Standards Proposed |publisher=Google.co.uk |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery then must be charged. As of 2007, the [[Lithium iron phosphate battery]] was between 80-90% efficient in charging/discharging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginhighway.ca/PHEV2007/proceedings/PluginHwy_PHEV2007_PaperReviewed_Valoen.pdf |title=Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle 2007 Conference - Home |publisher= |accessdate=30 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326150713/http://www.pluginhighway.ca/PHEV2007/proceedings/PluginHwy_PHEV2007_PaperReviewed_Valoen.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery needs to be cooled; the GM Volt's battery has four coolers and two radiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stewart |first=Ben |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4257460.html |title=Chevy Volt Plug-in Car Batteries Ready for 2010 - GM Technical Center |publisher=Popular Mechanics |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604044820/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4257460.html |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, "the total well-to-wheels efficiency with which a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might utilize renewable electricity is roughly 20% (although that number could rise to 25% or a little higher with the kind of multiple technology breakthroughs required to enable a hydrogen economy). The well-to-wheels efficiency of charging an onboard battery and then discharging it to run an electric motor in a PHEV or EV, however, is 80% (and could be higher in the future)—four times more efficient than current hydrogen fuel cell vehicle pathways."&lt;ref name=EnergyCollective/&gt;  A 2006 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' argued that PHEVs, rather than hydrogen vehicles, would become standard in the automobile industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph J. Romm|Romm, Joseph]] and Prof. [[Andrew A. Frank]]. [http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/329.html "Hybrid Vehicles Gain Traction", ''Scientific American'' (April 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginpartners.org |title=Plug-in Hybrid Advocacy Group |publisher=Pluginpartners.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A December 2009 study at UC Davis found that, over their lifetimes, PHEVs will emit less carbon than current vehicles, while hydrogen cars will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.&lt;ref name=UCDavis/&gt;

===Natural gas===
{{Main|natural gas vehicle}}
[[Internal combustion engine]]-based [[compressed natural gas]](CNG), [[HCNG]] or [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] vehicles ([[Natural gas vehicle]]s or NGVs) use methane ([[Natural gas]] or [[Biogas]]) directly as a fuel source. Natural gas has a higher [[energy density]] than hydrogen gas. NGVs using biogas are nearly [[carbon neutral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/ncer/p3/press/04_22_07.html|title=Car Fueled With Biogas From Cow Manure: WWU Students Convert Methane Into Natural Gas|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike hydrogen vehicles, CNG vehicles have been available for many years, and there is sufficient infrastructure to provide both commercial and home refueling stations. Worldwide, there were 14.8 million natural gas vehicles by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngvjournal.dreamhosters.com/en/statistics/item/911-worldwide-ngv-statistics |title=Worldwide NGV Statistics |publisher=NGV Journal |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220030004/http://www.ngvjournal.dreamhosters.com/en/statistics/item/911-worldwide-ngv-statistics |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other use for natural gas is in [[steam reforming]] which is the common way to produce hydrogen gas for use in electric cars with fuel cells.

===All-electric vehicles===
{{main|electric car}}
A 2008 ''Technology Review'' article stated, "Electric cars—and plug-in hybrid cars—have an enormous advantage over hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in utilizing low-carbon electricity.  That is because of the inherent inefficiency of the entire hydrogen fueling process, from generating the hydrogen with that electricity to transporting this diffuse gas long distances, getting the hydrogen in the car, and then running it through a fuel cell—all for the purpose of converting the hydrogen back into electricity to drive the same exact electric motor you'll find in an electric car."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/guest/22087/ "The Last Car You Would Ever Buy – Literally: Why we shouldn't get excited by the latest hydrogen cars"], ''Technology Review'', June 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Thermodynamically, each additional step in the conversion process decreases the overall efficiency of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency of Hydrogen PEFC, Diesel-SOFC-Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles |date=15 July 2003 |url=http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021051748/http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cta.ornl.gov/data/index.shtml |title=Information from |publisher=cta.ornl.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 comparison of hydrogen and [[battery electric vehicle]]s agreed with the 25% figure from Ulf Bossel in 2006 and stated that the cost of an [[electric vehicle battery]] "is rapidly coming down, and the gap will widen further", while there is little "existing infrastructure to transport, store and deliver hydrogen to vehicles and would cost billions of dollars to put into place, everyone's household power sockets are "electric vehicle refueling" station and the "cost of electricity (depending on the source) is at least 75% cheaper than hydrogen."&lt;ref&gt;Dansie, Mark. [http://revolution-green.com/hydrogen-vs-electric/ "Hydrogen vs Electric"], revolution-green.com, July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18264|title=Transitions to Alternative Vehicles and Fuels - The National Academies Press|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOE stated that even under optimistic conditions by 2030 the price for the battery is not expected to go below $17,000 ($200–$250/kWh) on 300 miles of range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/16/toyotas-hydrogen-vs-teslas-batteries-which-car-wil.aspx|title=Toyota’s Hydrogen vs. Tesla’s Batteries: Which Car Will Win?|author=Katie Spence|date=16 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Matthew Mench, from the [[University of Tennessee]] stated: "If we are sitting around waiting for a battery breakthrough that will give us four times the range than we have now, we are going to be waiting for a long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-auto-show-fuel-cell-20131117,0,3678128.story?page=2#axzz2lGKcgiZs|title=L.A. Auto Show: Will fuel cells make battery electric cars obsolete?|author=Los Angeles Times|date=18 November 2013|work=latimes.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navigant Research, (formerly Pike research), on the other hand, forecasts that “lithium-ion costs, which are tipping the scales at about $500 per kilowatt hour now, could fall to $300 by 2015 and to $180 by 2020.”&lt;ref&gt;King, Danny.

Many [[electric car]] designs offer limited driving range causing [[range anxiety]]. For example, the 2013 [[Nissan Leaf]] has a range of {{Convert|75|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2013-nissan-leaf-gets-fuel-econom-range-improvement-says-epa.html "2013 Nissan Leaf Gets Fuel Economy, Range Improvement, Says EPA"], Edmunds.com, May 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the 2014 [[Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive]] has an estimated range of {{Convert|115|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Jablansky, Jeffrey.

European Environment Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''The New York Times'' stated that there are only 10 publicly accessible hydrogen-filling stations in the U.S., eight of which are in Southern California, and that BEVs' cost-per-mile expense in 2013 is one-third as much as hydrogen cars when comparing electricity from the grid and hydrogen at a filling station. The ''Times'' commented: "By the time Toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan, there will be about half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the United States – and tens of thousands of E.V. charging stations."&lt;ref name=Berman2013/&gt; In 2013 John Swanton of the [[California Air Resources Board]], who sees them as complementary technologies, stated that EVs have the jump on fuel-cell autos, which "are like electric vehicles were 10 years ago. EVs are for real consumers, no strings attached. With EVs you have a lot of infrastructure in place.&lt;ref&gt;Scauzillo, Steve.

Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before FCEVs become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are "still very, very expensive", even compared to battery-powered EVs.&lt;ref name=Davies1/&gt;

'''Common User Access''' ('''CUA''') is a standard for [[user interface]]s to [[operating system]]s and [[computer program]]s. It was developed by [[IBM]] and first published in 1987 as part of their [[Systems Application Architecture]]. Used originally in the [[MVS/ESA]], [[VM/CMS]], [[IBM i|OS/400]], [[OS/2]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems, parts of the CUA standard are now implemented in programs for other operating systems, including variants of [[Unix]]. It is also used by [[Java (software platform)|Java]] [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] and [[Swing (Java)|Swing]].

== Motivations and inspirations ==
IBM wanted a standard way to interact with [[text-based user interface]] software, whether the screen was a [[dumb terminal]] connected to a mainframe or a [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] with [[Video Graphics Array|VGA graphics]].{{r|alsop19880118}} CUA was a detailed specification and set strict rules about how applications should look and function. Its aim was in part to bring about harmony among [[DOS]] applications, which until then had independently implemented different user interfaces.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Examples:
* In [[WordPerfect]], the command to open a file was {{keypress|F7}}, {{keypress|3}}.
* In [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a file was opened with {{keypress|/}} (to open the menus), {{keypress|F}} (for File), {{keypress|R}} (for Retrieve).
* In [[Microsoft Word]], a file was opened with {{keypress|Esc}} (to open the menus), {{keypress|T}} (for Transfer), {{keypress|L}} (for Load).
* In [[WordStar]], it was {{keypress|D}}.
* In [[emacs]], a file is opened with {{keypress|Ctrl}}+{{keypress|x}} followed by {{keypress|Ctrl}}+{{keypress|f}} (for find-file).

{{keypress|F1}} was often the [[help key]] (such as [[Volkswriter]] (1982)&lt;ref name="shuford198305"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-05/1983_05_BYTE_08-05_The_Electronic_Office#page/n181/mode/2up | title=Word Tools for the IBM Personal Computer | work=BYTE | date=May 1983 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Shuford, Richard S. | pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but in WordPerfect, help was on {{keypress|F3}} instead. Some programs used {{keypress|Esc}} to cancel an action, while some used it to complete one; WordPerfect used it to repeat a character. Some programs used {{keypress|End}} to go to the end of a line, while some used it to complete filling in a form. {{keypress|Ins}} sometimes toggled between overtype and inserting characters, but some programs used it for "paste".

Thus every program had to be learned individually and its complete user interface memorised. It was a sign of expertise to have learned the UIs of dozens of applications, since a novice user facing a new program would find their existing knowledge of a similar application either of no use or actively a hindrance to understanding as learned behavior might need to be unlearned for the new application.

The detailed CUA specification, published in December 1987, is 328 pages long. It has similarities to [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s detailed [[human interface guidelines]] (139 pages).&lt;ref name="alsop19880118"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alsop |first=Stewart II |date=1988-01-18 |title=Microsoft Windows: Eclectism in UI |url=http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/PC-Letter_19880118.pdf |journal=P.C. Letter |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Apple HIG is a detailed book specifying how software for the 1984 [[Apple Macintosh]] computer should look and function.{{cn|date=October 2012}}  When it was first written, the Mac was new, and [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) software was a novelty, so Apple took great pains to ensure that programs would conform to a single shared look and feel.{{cn|date=March 2014}} CUA had a similar aim, but it faced the more difficult task of trying to impose this retroactively on an existing, thriving but chaotic industry, with the much more ambitious goal of unifying all UI, from personal computers to minicomputers to mainframes; and supporting both character and GUI modes, and both batch and interactive designs. By comparison, the Apple HIG only supported interactive GUI on a standalone personal computer. CUA also attempted to be a more measurable standard than the Apple HIG and had large sections formatted as checklists to measure compliance.

== Description ==

The CUA contains standards for the operation of elements such as [[dialog box]]es, [[menu (computing)|menus]] and [[keyboard shortcut]]s that have become so influential that they are implemented today by many programmers who have never read the CUA.

Some of these standards can be seen in the operation of Windows itself and DOS-based applications like the MS-DOS 5 full-screen [[text editor]] [[MS-DOS Editor|edit.com]]. CUA hallmarks include:
* All operations can be done with either the [[computer mouse|mouse]] or the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]];
* If applicable to the page/screen in question {{keypress|F5}} provides a refresh function; 
* Menus are activated/deactivated with the {{keypress|F10}} key;
* Menus are opened by pressing the {{keypress|Alt}} key plus the underlined letter of the menu name;
* Menu commands that require parameters to proceed are suffixed with an [[ellipsis]] ("…");
* Options are requested using secondary windows (often called dialog boxes);
* Options are divided into sections using notebook tabs;
* Navigation within fields in dialog boxes is by cursor key; navigation between fields is by pressing the {{keypress|Tab}} key; {{keypress|Shift}}+{{keypress|Tab}} moves backwards;
* Dialog boxes have a 'Cancel' button, activated by pressing the {{keypress|Esc}} key, which discards changes, and an 'OK' button, activated by pressing {{keypress|Return}}, which accepts changes;
* Applications have [[online help]] accessed by a Help menu, which is the last option on the menu bar; context sensitive help can be summoned by {{keypress|F1}};

CUA not only covers DOS applications, but is also the basis for the Windows Consistent User Interface standard (CUI), as well as that for OS/2 applications — both text-mode and the [[Presentation Manager]] GUI — and IBM mainframes which conform to the [[Systems Application Architecture]].

CUA was more than just an attempt to rationalise DOS applications — it was part of a larger scheme to bring together, rationalise and harmonise the overall functions of software and hardware across IBM's entire computing range from microcomputers to mainframes. This is perhaps partly why it was not completely successful.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The third edition of CUA took a radical departure from the first two by introducing the [[object-oriented]] [[Workplace Shell|workplace]]. This changed the emphasis of the user's interactions to be the data (documents, pictures, and so on) that the user worked on. The emphasis on applications was removed with the intention of making the computer easier to use by matching users' expectations that they would work on documents using programs (rather than operating programs to work on documents). (See also [[object-oriented user interface]].)

== Influence ==

CUA strongly influenced the early [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system during the period of joint IBM and Microsoft cooperation on OS/2 Presentation Manager. But later releases of IBM's CUA documents were not used for Microsoft products, and so CUA became less significant in the Windows environment. For instance, the [[Start menu]] was introduced. Most of the standard keystrokes and basic GUI widgets specified by the CUA remain available in Windows.

CUA never had significant impact on the design of [[Unix]] terminal (character-mode) applications, which preceded CUA by more than a decade.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, all major Unix GUI environments/toolkits, whether or not based on the [[X Window System]], have featured varying levels of CUA compatibility, with Motif/[[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]] explicitly featuring it as a design goal.  The current major environments, [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]], also feature extensive CUA compatibility. The subset of CUA implemented in [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Motif (software)|OSF/Motif]] is generally considered a [[de facto standard]] to be followed by any new Unix GUI environment.

'''Information space analysis''' is a [[deterministic]] method, enhanced by [[Artificial intelligence|machine intelligence]], for locating and assessing [[resource]]s for team-centric efforts.

Organizations need to be able to quickly assemble teams backed by the support services, information, and material to do the job. To do so, these teams need to find and assess sources of services that are potential participants in the team effort. To support this initial team and resource development, information needs to be developed via analysis tools that help make sense of sets of [[Computer file|data sources]] in an [[Intranet]] or [[Internet]]. Part of the process is to characterize them, partition them, and sort and filter them.

These tools focus on three key issues in forming a collaborative team: 
#Help individuals responsible for forming the team understand what is available.
#Assist team members in identifying the structure and categorize the [[information]] available to them in a manner specifically suited to the task at hand.
#Aid team members to understand the mappings of their information between their [[organization]] and that used by others who might participate.

Information space analysis tools combine multiple methods to assist in this task. This causes the tools to be particularly well-suited to integrating additional [[technology|technologies]] in order to create specialized systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">The '''Jordan–Wigner''' transformation is a transformation that maps [[Spin (physics)|spin]] [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]] onto [[Fermions|fermionic]] [[creation and annihilation operators]]. It was proposed by [[Pascual Jordan]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] for one-dimensional [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice models]], but now two-dimensional analogues of the transformation have also been created. The Jordan–Wigner transformation is often used to exactly solve 1D spin-chains such as the [[Ising model|Ising]] and [[XY model]]s by transforming the spin operators to fermionic operators and then diagonalizing in the fermionic basis. 

This transformation actually shows that the distinction between spin-1/2 particles and fermions is nonexistent. It can be applied to systems with an arbitrary dimension.

==Analogy between spins and fermions==

In what follows we will show how to map a 1D spin chain of spin-1/2 particles to fermions.

Take [[spin-1/2]] [[Pauli operators]] acting on a site &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; of a 1D chain, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{+}, \sigma_{j}^{-}, \sigma_{j}^{z}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the [[anticommutator]] of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, we find &lt;math&gt;\{\sigma_{j}^{+},\sigma_{j}^{-}\} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, as would be expected from fermionic creation and annihilation operators. We might then be tempted to set 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{+} = (\sigma_{j}^{x}+i\sigma_{j}^{y})/2 = f_{j}^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{-} = (\sigma_{j}^{x}-i\sigma_{j}^{y})/2 = f_{j}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{z} = 2f_{j}^{\dagger}f_{j} - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we have the correct same-site fermionic relations &lt;math&gt;\{f_{j}^{\dagger}, f_{j}\}=1&lt;/math&gt;; however, on different sites, we have the relation &lt;math&gt;[f_{j}^{\dagger},f_{k}] = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;j \neq k&lt;/math&gt;, and so spins on different sites commute unlike fermions which anti-commute.  We must remedy this before we can take the analogy very seriously.

A transformation which recovers the true fermion commutation relations from spin-operators was performed in 1928 by Jordan and Wigner. This is a special example of a [[Klein transformation]]. We take a chain of fermions, and define a new set of operators
:&lt;math&gt;a_{j}^{\dagger} = e^{\left(+i\pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\dagger} f_{k}\right)} \cdot f_{j}^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_{j} = e^{\left(-i\pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\dagger} f_{k}\right)} \cdot f_{j}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_{j}^{\dagger} a_{j} = f_{j}^{\dagger} f_{j}.&lt;/math&gt;
They differ from the above only by a phase &lt;math&gt;e^{\pm i\pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\dagger} f_{k}}&lt;/math&gt;. The phase is determined by the number of occupied fermionic modes in modes &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots,j-1&lt;/math&gt; of the field. The phase is equal to &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; if the number of occupied modes is even, and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; if the number of occupied modes is odd. This phase is often expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\left(\pm i\pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}f_{k}^{\dagger} f_{k}\right)}=\prod_{k=1}^{j-1}e^{\pm i\pi f_{k}^{\dagger} f_{k}}=\prod_{k=1}^{j-1}(1-2f_{k}^{\dagger} f_{k})=\prod_{k=1}^{j-1}(-\sigma_{k}^{z}).&lt;/math&gt;
Where the second equality makes use of the fact that &lt;math&gt;f_{k}^{\dagger} f_{k}\in\{0, 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The transformed spin operators now have the appropriate fermionic commutation relations 
:&lt;math&gt;\{a_i^\dagger, a_j\}=\delta_{i,j}, \, \{a_i^\dagger, a_j^\dagger\}=0, \, \{a_i, a_j\}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
 
The inverse transformation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{+} = e^{\left(-i\pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}a_{k}^{\dagger} a_{k}\right)} \cdot a_{j}^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{-} = e^{\left(+i\pi \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}a_{k}^{\dagger} a_{k}\right)} \cdot a_{j}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{j}^{z} = 2a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{j} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the definition of the fermionic operators is nonlocal with respect to the bosonic operators because we have to deal with an entire chain of operators to the left of the site the fermionic operators are defined with respect to. This is also true the other way around. This is an example of a [['t Hooft operator]], which is a [[disorder operator]] instead of an [[order operator]]. This is also an example of an [[S-duality]].

If the system has more than one dimension the transformation can still be applied. It is only necessary to label the sites in an arbitrary way by a single index.

The '''killer whale''' or '''orca''' (''Orcinus orca'') is a [[toothed whale]] belonging to the [[oceanic dolphin]] family, of which it is the largest member. Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt [[marine mammal]]s such as [[pinniped|seals]] and other dolphin species. They have been known to attack [[baleen whale]] calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are [[apex predator]]s, as no animal preys on them.  A [[cosmopolitan species]], they can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] and [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic regions]] to tropical seas, absent only from the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas, and some areas of the Arctic Ocean.

Killer whales are highly [[social animal|social]]; some populations are composed of [[matrilineal]] family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of [[animal culture]].

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] assesses the orca's [[conservation status]] as [[data deficient]] because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are [[Species problem|separate species]]. Some local populations are considered [[threatened species|threatened]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] due to prey depletion, [[habitat loss]], pollution (by [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]), capture for [[marine mammal park]]s, and [[Commercial fishing#Environmental Risk|conflicts with human fisheries]]. In late 2005, the [[southern resident killer whale]]s, which swim in [[British Columbia]] and [[Washington state]] waters, were placed on the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species of mammals and birds|U.S. Endangered Species list]].

Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans,{{sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=19}} but there have been cases of [[Killer whale attacks on humans#Captive orca attacks|captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers]] at marine theme parks. Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.

The killer whale is one of 35 species in the [[delphinidae|oceanic dolphin family]], which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=19}} Although it has [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities with the [[pygmy killer whale]], the [[false killer whale]] and the [[pilot whale]]s, a study of [[cytochrome b]] gene sequences by [[Richard LeDuc]] indicated that its closest extant relatives are the [[Orcaella|snubfin dolphins]] of the genus ''Orcaella''.&lt;ref name=leduc&gt;

===Common names===
Although the term "orca" is increasingly used, English-speaking scientists most often use the traditional name "killer whale". Indeed, the genus name ''Orcinus'' means "of the kingdom of the dead",{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=69}} or "belonging to [[Orcus]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/killer-whale/scientific-classification.htm Killer Whales. Scientific Classification], Seaworld.org, September 23, 2010, Retrieved September 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] originally used ''orca'' (pl. ''orcae'') for these animals, possibly borrowing [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄρυξ}} (''óryx)'', which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, "orca" has steadily grown in popularity. The term "orca" is euphemistically preferred by some to avoid the negative connotations of "killer",&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Ken.

According to some authors, the name ''killer whale'' is a mistranslation of the 18th century Spanish name ''asesina-ballenas'' (''killer of'' ''whales''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.about.com/od/cetaceans/p/orca.htm Orca - Orcinus orca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630040841/http://animals.about.com/od/cetaceans/p/orca.htm |date=June 30, 2007 }} by Klappenbach, Laura in About.com - visited 23-October-2013&lt;/ref&gt; possibly given by [[History of Basque whaling|Basque whalers]] after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.

They are sometimes referred to as "blackfish", a name also used for other whale species. "Grampus" is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of "grampus" should not be confused with the genus ''[[Grampus (genus)|Grampus]]'', whose only member is [[Risso's dolphin]].&lt;ref&gt;Leatherwood, Stephen and Larry J. Hobbs (1988).

Three types have been documented in the [[Antarctic]].

There are seven identified [[ecotype]]s inhabiting isolated [[ecological niche]]s. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on [[minke whale]]s, the second on seals and penguins, and the third on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations described above. Research has supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients as a distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would mean that each new species becomes subject to separate conservation assessments.&lt;ref name="nyt2010"&gt;{{cite news|first=NICHOLAS |last=WADE |date=April 26, 2010 |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27whale.html?src=sch&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Cracking Orca's Code: It Comes in Several Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The killer whale's teeth are very strong, and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed.

An individual killer whale can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=1–27}}

To avoid [[inbreeding]], males mate with females from other pods. [[gestation period|Gestation]] varies from 15 to 18 months. {{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=33}} Mothers usually calve a single offspring about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life, when 37–50% of all calves die.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=35}} [[Weaning]] begins at about 12 months of age, and is complete by two years. According to observations in several regions, all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young.{{sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=35}}

Males sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years.{{sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=26}} One male, known as [[Old Tom (killer whale)|Old Tom]], was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off [[New South Wales]], Australia.

[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]], once thought to occur only in captive killer whales, was observed in wild populations by researchers off British Columbia on Dec. 2, 2016. In this incident, an adult male killed the calf of a female within the same pod, with his mother also joining in the assault. It is theorized that the male killed the young calf in order to mate with its mother (something that [[infanticide in carnivores|occurs in other carnivore species]]), while the male's mother supported the breeding opportunity for her son.  The attack ended when the calf's mother struck and injured the attacking male. Such behavior matches that of many smaller dolphin species such as the [[bottlenose dolphin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/killer-whale-infanticide-1.4586867&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting a large whale usually takes several hours. Killer whales generally attack young or weak animals; however, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother to exhaustion. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, drowning it by keeping it from surfacing. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2001.tb01000.x|author=Pitman, Robert L.|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdeptcommercepub/507/ |title=Killer Whale Predation on Sperm Whales: Observations and Implications|journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=17|issue=3|pages=494–507|year=2001|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Estes |title =Whales, Whaling, and Ocean Ecosystems| year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-520-24884-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of whaling|Prior to the advent of industrial whaling]], great whales may have been the major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of [[Harpoon cannon|exploding harpoons]] indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to the decline of these as well.&lt;ref name="EMM2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Estes|first=James|editor=Perrin, William F.|others=Wursig, Bernd &amp; Thewissen, J.

It has been hypothesised that predation by orcas on whale calves in high-productivity, high-latitude areas is the reason for great whale migrations during breeding season to low-productivity tropical waters where orcas are scarcer.&lt;ref name="EMM2009"/&gt;

Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of [[Earless seal|seal]], [[sea lion]] and [[fur seal]]. [[Walrus]]es and [[sea otter]]s are less frequently taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it.{{sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=45}} Sea lions are killed by [[head-butting]] or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the [[Aleutian Islands]], a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Pinell, Nadine, et al.

Killer whales have also been observed preying on [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial mammals]], such as [[deer]] swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America.{{sfn|Baird|2002|p=23}} Killer whale [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]] has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers.{{sfn|Baird|2002|p=124}} One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot.&lt;ref name="Jefferson et al 1991"/&gt; Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill [[porpoise]]s and [[Pinniped|seals]] for no apparent reason.{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=19}}

===Birds===
Killer whales in many areas may prey on [[cormorant]]s and [[gull]]s.{{sfn|Baird|2002|p=14}} A captive killer whale at [[MarineLand]] discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds.

==Behaviour==
[[File:Albatrosses associating with killer whales.JPG|thumb|Association of killer whales and [[black-browed albatross]]es]]
Day-to-day killer whale behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales frequently engage in [[Whale surfacing behavior|surface behaviour]] such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging [[parasite]]s, or [[play (animal behavior)|play]]. [[Spyhopping]] is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings.{{sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=64}}

Resident killer whales swim alongside [[porpoise]]s, other [[dolphin]]s, [[Earless seal|seals]], and [[sea lion]]s, which are common prey for transient killer whales.

===Social structure===
[[File:Transient Orcas (3727711709).jpg|thumb|left|A pair of killer whales in a transient population in Northwest Pacific]]
Killer whales are notable for their complex societies. Only [[elephant]]s and [[higher primate]]s live in comparably complex [[social structure]]s.{{sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=35}} Due to orcas' complex social bonds, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep [[Captive killer whales|them in captivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepwhaleswild.org/ |title=Keep Whales Wild |publisher=Keep Whales Wild |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216065407/http://www.keepwhaleswild.org/ |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific live in particularly complex and stable social groups. Unlike any other known mammal social structure, resident whales live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on [[matriline]]s consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, a killer whale named [[Luna (Orca)|Luna]], no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}}

[[File:Orca 2.jpg|thumb|left|Killer whales, like this one near Alaska, commonly [[Whale surfacing behaviour|breach]], often lifting their entire bodies out of the water.|alt=A killer whale leaping out of the water is about to land on its back.]]

Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} [[DNA]] testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=39}} Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.{{efn|In the northeast Pacific, three communities of fish-eating killer whales have been identified: the southern community (one clan, three pods, 90 killer whales as of 2006), the northern community (three clans, 16 pods, 214 killer whales as of 2000), and the south Alaskan community (two clans, 11 pods, 211 killer whales as of 2000).}}

Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become "rovers" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=13}} As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=14}}

{{See also|Whale sound}}
Like all [[cetaceans]], killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.&lt;ref name=noaa/&gt;

Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=20}} Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum [[salmon]], species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the [[marine mammal]] prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=20}} They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.

All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a [[dialect]]. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Foote, A. D.|author2=Osborne, R. W.|author3=Hoelzel, A.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2008|title=Temporal and contextual patterns of killer whale (''Orcinus orca'') call type production|journal=Ethology|volume=114|issue=6|pages=599–606|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01496.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines.&lt;ref name=vocal/&gt; Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=14}} Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Filatova, Olga A. |author2=Fedutin, Ivan D. |author3=Burdin, Alexandr M. |author4=Hoyt, Erich |year=2007|url=http://russianorca.com/Doc/Science/structure_repert.pdf |title=The structure of the discrete call repertoire of killer whales ''Orcinus orca'' from Southeast Kamchatka|journal=Bioacoustics|volume=16|pages=261–280|doi=10.1080/09524622.2007.9753581|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.coloradocollege.edu/dept/ev/Research/Faculty/OVALItems/pdf_Papers/SpongCalvesPaper.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527060306/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/dept/ev/Research/Faculty/OVALItems/pdf_Papers/SpongCalvesPaper.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2011 |last1=Weiß |first1=Brigitte M. |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=119 |last2=Ladich |issue=1 |first2=Friedrich |last3=Spong |first3=Paul |last4=Symonds |first4=Helena |year=2006 |pmid=16454316 |title=Vocal behaviour of resident killer whale matrilines with newborn calves: The role of family signatures |doi=10.1121/1.2130934 |pages=627–35 |bibcode=2006ASAJ..119..627W |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=15–16}} When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.&lt;ref name=vocal&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kremers, D.|author2=Lemasson, A.|author3=Almunia, J.|author4=Wanker, R.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2012|title=Vocal sharing and individual acoustic distinctiveness within a group of captive orcas (''Orcinus orca'')|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=126|issue=4|pages=433–445|doi=10.1037/a0028858|pmid=22866769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=15–16}}

Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting and traveling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simon, M.|author2=McGregor, P.

People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from [[longline fishing|longlines]], but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=42}} Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:

{{quote|It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn't even take them an hour to figure it out.

In 2008, the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the killer whale's [[conservation status]] from [[conservation dependent]] to [[data deficient]], recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; [[overfishing|Depletion of prey species]], [[marine pollution|pollution]], large-scale [[oil spill]]s, and [[Disturbance (ecology)|habitat disturbance]] caused by noise and conflicts with boats are the most significant worldwide threats.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

Like other animals at the highest [[trophic level]]s, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from [[bioaccumulation]] of toxins, including [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs).{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=99}} European [[harbour seal|harbor seal]]s have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals.{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=99}} Blubber samples in the [[Arctic Norway|Norwegian Arctic]] show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and [[brominated flame-retardant]]s than in [[polar bear]]s. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize [[blubber]] for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.

Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering [[Marine mammals and sonar#Naval sonar-linked incidents|U.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales]]. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research, located in [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], Washington.&lt;ref name = Pickrell&gt;{{cite news|last=Pickrell|first=John|title=U.S. Navy Sonar May Harm Killer Whales, Expert Says.|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0331_040331_whalesincrisis.html|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=National Geographic News|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to study killer whales from "his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months".&lt;ref name = Pickrell/&gt; In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other [[whale watching|whale watchers]] near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed "agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water" to escape the sound of the sonars.&lt;ref name = Pickrell/&gt; "Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said."&lt;ref name = Pickrell/&gt; The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise.&lt;ref name = Pickrell/&gt; Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and [[CAT scan]]s of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with [[decompression sickness]].&lt;ref name = Pickrell/&gt;

Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the [[Species at Risk Act]] in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the [[British Columbia Coast]] and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats.&lt;ref name = CBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Ottawa Sued over Lack of Legislation to Protect B.C.

The [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]] adversely affected killer whales in [[Prince William Sound]] and Alaska's [[Kenai Fjords]] region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales.

Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests.

===Modern Western attitudes===
{{See also|Killer Whales in popular culture}}
[[File:Woman swims with killer whales in the wild.webm|thumb|[[Ingrid Visser (researcher)|Ingrid Visser]]'s research team filming [[orca]]s in New Zealand]]
Western attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as [[Moby Doll]], a resident harpooned off [[Saturna Island]] in 1964.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1}} So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.{{sfn|Francis|Hewlett|2007|pp=58–59}}

Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in [[aquarium|aquaria]], and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by [[Michael Bigg]] led to the discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through [[wildlife photo-identification|photo-identification]] techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.{{sfn|Baird|2002|pp=73–80}}

Bigg's techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1}} The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained.{{sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=11}} In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.&lt;ref name=Lyke/&gt;

The public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquarium. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film ''[[Free Willy]]'', the movie's captive star [[Keiko (whale)|Keiko]] was returned to the coast of his native [[Iceland]] in 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the [[Earth Island Institute]], David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters.&lt;ref name = Wood&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Daniel|title=Death of Sea World trainer: Do 'killer whales' belong in theme parks?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0224/Death-of-Sea-World-trainer-Do-killer-whales-belong-in-theme-parks|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, the orphan [[Springer (orca)|Springer]] was discovered in [[Puget Sound]], Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behavior and social structure of the region's killer whales.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite news|title=Orphaned orca's reunion with family celebrated|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/07/13/bc-springer.html|date=July 13, 2007|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale named [[Luna (Orca)|Luna]], which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Robert |last=McClure |title=Luna the orca killed by tugboat |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Luna-the-orca-killed-by-tugboat-1198168.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |publisher=Hearst Corporation |location=Seattle, Washington |date=March 11, 2006 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whaling===
{{Main|Whaling}}
[[File:Killer Whale (Old Tom) and whalers.jpeg|thumb|left|The killer whale named [[Old Tom (killer whale)|Old Tom]] swims alongside a [[whaleboat]], flanking a whale calf.

Two men are standing, the harpooner in the bow and a steersman on the aft rudder, while four oarsmen are seated.]]
The earlier of known records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global [[whaling]] industry caught immense numbers of [[baleen whale|baleen]] and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of [[whale oil|recoverable oil]], their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=39}} Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=[[:ja:自然環境局|Nature Conservation Bureau]] of [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)]]|year=1998|title=海域自然環境保全基礎調査 - 海棲動物調査報告書, (2)- 19. シャチ Orcinus orca (Limaeus,1758)マイルカ科|url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/reports2/5th/kaisei_h10/5_kaisei_h10.pdf|page=54|journal=自然環境保全基礎調査|format=PDF|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Norway]] took 987.{{sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=34}} Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] whalers,&lt;ref&gt;

Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although [[Indonesia]] and [[Greenland]] permit small subsistence hunts (see [[Aboriginal whaling]]). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries.

====Cooperation with humans====
Killer whales have helped humans hunting other whales.&lt;ref name="scavenging"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reeves|first1=Randall|last2=Whitehead|first2=Hal|title=Killer whales and whaling: the scavenging hypothesis|journal=Biology Letters|volume=1|issue=4|pages=415–8|year=2005|pmid=17148221|pmc=1626385|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0348}}&lt;/ref&gt; One well-known example was the [[killer whales of Eden, Australia]], including the male known as [[Old Tom (killer whale)|Old Tom]]. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers' catch.&lt;ref name="scavenging"/&gt; Some populations, such as in Alaska's [[Prince William Sound]], may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.&lt;ref name=baird/&gt;

===Captivity===
{{Main|Captive killer whales}}
[[File:Miamiseaquariumlolita.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lolita (orca)|Lolita]], at the [[Miami Seaquarium]], is one of the oldest whales in captivity.|alt=A killer whale rises vertically above the pool surface, except its tail, with a trainer standing on its nose.]]
The killer whale's [[animal intelligence|intelligence]], trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and [[marine mammal park|aquatic theme park]]s. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=43–44}}

Organizations such as [[World Animal Protection]] and the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the [[dorsal fin]] collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s.{{efn|Although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas (Corky II and Lolita) are in their mid-40s.}} In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rose, N.

A 2015 study coauthored by staff at [[SeaWorld]] and the [[Minnesota Zoo]] indicates that there is no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive killer whales. The authors speculate about the future utility of studying captive populations for the purposes of understanding orca biology and the implications of such research of captive animals in the overall health of both wild and marine park populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Todd R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7090">The '''Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study''' brings together researchers from many disciplines to study the phenomenon known as the [[mind]]. A unit of [[George Mason University]], the Institute for Advanced Study also serves as a center for doctoral education in neuroscience. Research at the Institute is funded by agencies such as the [[National Institutes of Health]], the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

==History==

[[Image:Photo the institute.jpg|thumb|Krasnow Institute building front entrance]][http://krasnow.gmu.edu/ The '''Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study'''] of [[George Mason University]] was chartered in 1990 as a result of a bequest from Shelley Krasnow, a long-time resident of the National Capital Area. The work of the Institute began in 1993 with a scientific conference, co-sponsored with The [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) and hosted at George Mason University. This conference on "The Mind, the Brain, and Complex Adaptive Systems" brought together an unusual group of scientists including two [[Nobel laureates]] ([[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]) and produced new approaches to this frontier in addition to a book published by SFI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XJERwCCsLk8C&amp;dq=the+mind+the+brain+and+complex+adaptive+systems&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=q-TFEPJ_t1&amp;sig=XnegZz_u2mPx5OFz1_3Ux-yOfaA&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=The+Mind,+The+Brain+and+Complex+Adaptive+Systems&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail] The Mind, The Brain And Complex Systems, Morowitz and Singer Eds 1993&lt;/ref&gt; 
These efforts set the Institute on the path of human cognition within the context of  the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive psychology and computer sciences.

==Current Institute==
[[Image:MRI 2006 photo2.JPG|thumb|MRI viewed from console room]]The Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study is home to a scientific community of 100 (many of them Ph.D.'s) most of whom are also either faculty or trainees at [[George Mason University]]. The range of their research on cognition spans from molecules to mind.  The Institute is housed in a dedicated {{convert|51,000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility on the Fairfax Campus of George Mason which includes extensive wet-laboratories, computer labs, a 3T MRI human brain imaging center, a cellular imaging facility, as well as faculty offices and breakout space. Additional research space on the Fairfax campus houses the Institute's Center for Social Complexity.

==An Academic Unit of George Mason University==
The Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study is also an academic unit of [[George Mason University]]. It houses the department of Molecular [[Neuroscience]], which plays a key role in the interdisciplinary neuroscience doctoral program.

The Institute hosted several events in the "[[Decade of the Mind]]" initiative, which urged the U.S. Congress to invest in understanding how mind emerges from brain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/21/AR2007092101542.html] What Makes Up My Mind, Joel Achenbach, Washington Post Sept 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute has collaborated closely with the Janelia Farm Campus of [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]] to develop better methods of reconstructing neuronal architectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diademchallenge.org/] Diadem Challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Researchers at the Institute include neuroscientists, bio-engineers, computer scientists, and computational social scientists. The Institute's various research programs are conducted by three centers (described below) and multiple [http://krasnow.gmu.edu/research-groups2/ lab groups]. Many of the programs focus on research that may lead to cures to some of the most devastating brain diseases.

===The Center for Neural Informatics, Neural Structures, and Neural Plasticity (CN3)===
The Center for Neural Informatics, Neural Structures, and Neural Plasticity (CN3) pursues fundamental breakthroughs in neuroscience by fostering neuroinformatic and computational approaches to [[neuroplasticity]] and [[neuroanatomy]]. By bringing together faculty expertise in these multiple disciplines, the Center provides opportunities for cross-training in [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], and [[engineering]], both at the graduate and postdoctoral levels. CN3 researchers investigate the relationship between [[brain]] structure, activity, and function from the subcellular to the network level, with a specific focus on the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of [[learning]] and [[memory]]. In the long term, we seek to create large-scale, biologically plausible network models of entire portions of the mammalian brain, such as the [[hippocampus]], to understand the neural circuits and cellular events underlying the expression, storage, and retrieval of associative [[memory]].

===Center for Neuroeconomics===
Krasnow scientists are using functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain to study human interactions within the context of free-markets. These studies allow, for the first time, the elucidation of a biological basis for economic decisions.

===Center for Social Complexity (CSC)===
Scientific projects at the Center for Social Complexity [http://socialcomplexity.gmu.edu/] focus on investigating social systems and processes on multiple scales: groups, organizations, economies, societies, regions, international systems. Researchers use a variety of interdisciplinary tools, including multi-agent systems and agent-based models (including the MASON toolkit in Java), [[cellular automata]] and other social simulation methods, network and graph-theoretic models, GIS (geographic information systems), events data analysis, complexity-theoretic models and other advanced computational methods.  The Center houses a specialized simulation environment (the Simulatorium), where faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate research assistants collaborate in a variety of projects. Conflict and cooperation, emergent economic systems, network dynamics, and long-term societal adaptation to environmental change are among the current lines of investigation. Funding for the Center is provided by grants from the US National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and other agencies.  (*see also: [http://css.gmu.edu/ Department of Computational Social Science]). The center does work in [[Computational sociology]].

'''Lista de espécies da flora do Brasil''' (List of species of the flora of Brazil, "The Brazilian List"), first produced in 2010 provides a list of [[species]] of [[plants]] found in [[Brazil]]. At that time it listed a total of 40,982 species, including 3,608 [[fungi]], 3,495 [[algae]], 1,521 [[bryophytes]], 1,176 [[pteridophytes]], 26 [[gymnosperms]] and 31,156 [[angiosperm]] species. The list is constantly updated with more than 400 taxonomists working on the online database.{{sfn|Brazilian Flora|2016}}

== Description ==
In addition to the accepted scientific names, the database provides information on geographic distribution, habitat, life forms and images of herbarium specimens and plants in their natural habitats. The species list covers all seven Brazilian [[biomes]]:
* [[Amazônia]] (Amazon tropical rain forest)
* [[Caatinga]] (Thorny scrub)
* Campos Sulinos ([[Pampa]] or grassland)
* [[Cerrado]] (Savanna)
* Manguezal ([[Mangrove]])
* [[Mata Atlântica]] Atlantic tropical semideciduous forest)
* [[Pantanal]] (Wetlands)

== History ==
The Brazilian Flora has been recognized as the richest in the world.{{sfn|Brazilian Flora|2016}} Brazil is a [[signatory]] to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) which implemented the [[Global Strategy for Plant Conservation]] (GSPC), whose goals include the development of "An online flora of all known plants" (Target 1). The ''[[Ministry of the Environment (Brazil)|Ministério do Meio Ambiente]]'' (Ministry of the Environment) then appointed the ''[[Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro]]'' (Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro) to coordinate the preparation of such a list.{{sfn|Brazilian Flora|2016}}

In September 2008 a meeting was held in the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro, in which 17 taxonomists from different institutions across the country participated. At this meeting, the organizing committee was established and the coordinators of each taxonomic group appointed. The first version of this list was then published in 2010. The first phase was completed in November 2015. it is being replaced by a new system known as The Brazilian Flora 2020 project with nearly 700 scientists and institutions world wide as part of the ''Reflora'' programme to create a [[virtual herbarium]], in conjunction with the ''Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira'' (SiBBr) and ''Institutos Nacionais de Ciência e Teconologia'' (INCT). As of May 2016 46,088 species are listed.{{sfn|Brazilian Flora|2016}}

[[File:World Map 1689.JPG|250px|right|thumb|World map by Gerard van Shagen, [[Amsterdam]], 1689]]
[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|250px|thumb|right|World map from 2016 ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'']]

A '''map''' is a [[symbol]]ic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as [[Physical body|objects]], [[region]]s, or themes.

Many maps are static, fixed to [[paper]] or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any [[space]], real or fictional, without regard to [[context (language use)|context]] or [[scale (map)|scale]], such as in [[brain mapping]], [[DNA]] mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.

Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word "map" comes from the medieval Latin ''Mappa mundi'', wherein ''mappa'' meant napkin or cloth and ''mundi'' the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.

==Geographic maps==
[[File:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the  cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]]]]

[[Cartography]] or ''map-making'' is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface (see [[History of cartography]]), and one who makes maps is called a [[cartography|cartographer]].

[[Road atlas|Road maps]] are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and [[nautical chart]]s, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by [[municipality|municipalities]], utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies.  Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance Survey]]: a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.

In addition to location information, maps may also be used to portray [[contour line]]s indicating constant values of [[elevation]], [[temperature]], [[rain]]fall, etc.

==Orientation of maps==
[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|thumb|''The [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]]'' from about 1300, [[Hereford Cathedral]], England, is a classic "T-O" map with Jerusalem at centre, east toward the top, Europe the bottom left and Africa on the right.]]
The orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding [[compass direction]]s in reality. The word "[[orient]]" is derived from [[Latin]] ''oriens'', meaning east. In the [[Middle Ages]] many maps, including the [[T and O map]]s, were drawn with east at the top (meaning that the direction "up" on the map corresponds to East on the compass). The most common cartographic convention is that north is at the top of a map.

Maps not oriented with north at the top:
* Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety of ways. Old maps of [[Edo]] show the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Japanese imperial palace]] as the "top", but also at the centre, of the map. Labels on the map are oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly unless you put the imperial palace above your head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] European [[T and O map]]s such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] were centred on [[Jerusalem]] with East at the top. Indeed, prior to the reintroduction of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West. [[Portolan chart]]s, for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.
* Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.
* Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.
* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Polar maps]] of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] regions are conventionally centred on the pole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian towards the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian towards the top of the page.
* [[Reversed map]]s, also known as ''Upside-Down maps'' or ''South-Up maps'', reverse the ''North is up'' convention and have south at the top.
* [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Dymaxion map]]s are based on a projection of the Earth's [[sphere]] onto an [[icosahedron]]. The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.
* Modern digital [[GIS]] maps such as [[ArcMap]] typically project north at the top of the map, but use math degrees (0 is east, degrees increase counter-clockwise), rather than compass degrees (0 is north, degrees increase clockwise) for orientation of transects. Compass decimal degrees can be converted to math degrees by subtracting them from 450; if the answer is greater than 360, subtract 360.

==Scale and accuracy==

Many maps are drawn to a [[Scale (map)|scale]] expressed as a [[ratio]], such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of [[measurement]] on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the [[curvature]] of the Earth to be neglected, such as a [[city map]]. Mapping larger regions, where curvature cannot be ignored, requires [[map projection|projections]] to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the [[sphere]] to the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] without distortion means that the map cannot have constant scale. Rather, on most projections the best that can be attained is accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as [[scale (map)|point scale]] per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.

Large scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000), cover relatively small regions in great detail and small scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000,000), cover large regions such as nations, continents and the whole [[globe]]. The large/small terminology arose from the practice of writing scales as numerical fractions: 1/10,000 is larger than 1/10,000,000. There is no exact dividing line between large and small but 1/100,000 might well be considered as a medium scale. Examples of large scale maps are the 1:25,000 maps produced for hikers; on the other hand maps intended for motorists at 1:250,000 or 1:1,000,000 are small scale.

It is important to recognize that even the most accurate maps sacrifice a certain amount of accuracy in scale to deliver a greater visual usefulness to its user. For example, the width of roads and small streams are exaggerated when they are too narrow to be shown on the map at true scale; that is, on a printed map they would be narrower than could be perceived by the naked eye. The same applies to computer maps where the smallest unit is the [[pixel]]. A narrow stream say must be shown to have the width of a pixel even if at the map scale it would be a small fraction of the pixel width.
[[File:EU Pop2008 1024.PNG|thumb|Cartogram: The [[European Union|EU]] distorted to show population distributions.]]

Some maps, called [[cartogram]]s, have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map (at the right) of [[Europe]] has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.

Another example of distorted scale is the famous [[Tube map|London Underground map]]. The basic geographical structure is respected but the tube lines (and the [[River Thames]]) are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map stations are spaced out more than near the edges of map.

Further inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely in order to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly (e.g. dashed or dotted lines/outlines) than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.

==Map types and projections==

{{Category see also|Map types}}
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|thumb|Map of large underwater features. (1995, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]])]]
Maps of the world or large areas are often either 'political' or 'physical'. The most important purpose of the political map is to show territorial [[border]]s; the purpose of the physical is to show features of [[geography]] such as mountains, soil type or land use including infrastructure such as roads, railroads and buildings. [[Topographic map]]s show [[elevation]]s and [[Terrain|relief]] with [[contour line]]s or shading. [[Geological map]]s show not only the physical surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, [[fault (geology)|fault]] lines, and subsurface structures.
Maps that depict the surface of the Earth also use a [[map projection|projection]], a way of translating the three-dimensional real surface of the [[geoid]] to a two-dimensional picture. Perhaps the best-known world-map projection is the [[Mercator projection]], originally designed as a form of [[nautical chart]].
Aeroplane pilots use [[aeronautical chart]]s based on a [[Lambert conformal conic projection]], in which a cone is laid over the section of the earth to be mapped. The cone intersects the sphere (the earth) at one or two parallels which are chosen as standard lines. This allows the pilots to plot a great-circle route approximation on a flat, two-dimensional chart.
* [[Map projection#Azimuthal (projections onto a plane)|Azimuthal]] or [[Gnomonic projection|Gnomonic]] [[map projection]]s are often used in planning air routes due to their ability to represent [[great circle]]s as straight lines.
*  Richard Edes Harrison produced a striking series of maps during and after [[World War II]] for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]. These used "bird's eye" projections to emphasise globally strategic "fronts" in the air age, pointing out proximities and barriers not apparent on a conventional  rectangular projection of the world.

===Electronic maps===&lt;!-- Electronic map redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Topographic map example.png|thumb|A [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] [[digital raster graphic]].]]

From the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the [[cartographer]] has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering [[surveying|survey]] level, has been subsumed by [[geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS). The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such [[superimposition]] of data led [[John Snow (physician)|Dr. John Snow]] to identify the location of an outbreak of [[cholera]]. Today, it is used by agencies of the human kind, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world.

[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map Sierra Nevada]]

Even when GIS is not involved, most cartographers now use a variety of computer graphics programs to generate new maps.

Interactive, computerised maps are commercially available, allowing users to ''zoom in'' or ''zoom out'' (respectively meaning to increase or decrease the scale), sometimes by replacing one map with another of different scale, centered where possible on the same point.  In-car [[global navigation satellite system]]s are computerised maps with route-planning and advice facilities which monitor the user's position with the help of satellites. From the computer scientist's point of view, zooming in entails one or a combination of:

# replacing the map by a more detailed one
# enlarging the same map without enlarging the [[pixel]]s, hence showing more detail by removing less information compared to the less detailed version
# enlarging the same map with the pixels enlarged (replaced by rectangles of pixels); no additional detail is shown, but, depending on the quality of one's vision, possibly more detail can be seen; if a computer display does not show adjacent pixels really separate, but overlapping instead (this does not apply for an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]], but may apply for a [[cathode ray tube]]), then replacing a pixel by a rectangle of pixels does show more detail.  A variation of this method is [[interpolation]].

[[File:World.pdf|thumb|A world map in PDF format.]]

For example:
* Typically (2) applies to a [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) file or other format based on [[vector graphics]]. The increase in detail is limited to the information contained in the file: enlargement of a curve may eventually result in a series of standard geometric figures such as straight lines, arcs of circles or [[spline (mathematics)|splines]].
* (2) may apply to text and (3) to the outline of a map feature such as a forest or building.
* (1) may apply to the text as needed (displaying labels for more features), while (2) applies to the rest of the image.  Text is not necessarily enlarged when zooming in. Similarly, a road represented by a double line may or may not become wider when one zooms in.
* The map may also have layers which are partly [[raster graphics]] and partly [[vector graphics]].  For a single raster graphics image (2) applies until the pixels in the image file correspond to the pixels of the display, thereafter (3) applies.

== Climatic maps ==

The maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called climatic maps. These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and for combinations of them at the earth's surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps afford a very convenient overview of the climatic features in a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. Through interpolation the maps can be used to determine the values of climatic features in any particular spot.

Climatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.

Isolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal values of the feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature—that is, the differences between the mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.

Maps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earth's surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.

Climatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.

==Conventional signs==
The various features shown on a map are represented by conventional [[sign]]s or symbols.  For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads.  Those signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey, [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf Explorer Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185303/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf |date=3 April 2016 }}; Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053109/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}; United States Geological Survey, [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ Topographic Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601185821/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ |date=1 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room "outside" the map for information about the map as a whole.
These cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise "blank" region "inside" the map{{mdash}}[[cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]], [[legend (map)|map legend]], title, [[compass rose]], [[bar scale]], etc.
In particular, some maps contain smaller "sub-maps"&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; in otherwise blank regions—often one at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and where the whole map fits on that globe, and a few showing "regions of interest" at a larger scale in order to show details that wouldn't otherwise fit.
Occasionally sub-maps use the same scale as the large map—a few maps of the [[contiguous United States]] include a sub-map&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; to the same scale for each of the two non-contiguous states.

===Labeling===
To communicate spatial information effectively, features such as rivers, lakes, and cities need to be [[Labeling (map design)|labeled]]. Over centuries cartographers have developed the art of placing names on even the densest of maps. Text placement or name placement can get mathematically very complex as the number of labels and map density increases. Therefore, text placement is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so cartographers and GIS users have developed [[automatic label placement]] to ease this process.&lt;ref&gt;Imhof, E., “Die Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,” Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-Füssli Verlag, Zürich, 93–129, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, H., Map data processing and the annotation problem, Proc. 3rd Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis, Chartwell-Bratt Ltd. Copenhagen, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-geographical spatial maps==
Maps exist of the [[Solar System]], and other cosmological features such as [[star map]]s. In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not ''[[geospatial|geo]]''graphical maps.

==Topological maps==
[[File:Inventory Locations Represented as a Map.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In a [[topological map]], like this one showing inventory locations, the distances between locations is not important. Only the layout and connectivity between them matters.]]
Diagrams such as [[schematic diagram]]s and [[Gantt chart]]s and [[treemap]]s display logical relationships between items, rather than geographical relationships. [[Topological]] in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The [[London Underground map]] and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.

==General-purpose maps==
General-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area.  The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.

==Legal regulation==

Some countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding [[border dispute]]s.  For example:
* Within Russia, Google Maps shows [[Crimea]] as part of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/12/302337754/google-maps-displays-crimean-border-differently-in-russia-u-s |title=Google Maps Displays Crimean Border Differently In Russia, U.S. |date=12 April 2014 |work=[[NPR.org]] |first=Bill |last=Chappell |author-link=Bill Chappell |access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China require that all maps show areas subject to the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]] in their own favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/23/us-google-asia-idUSBRE82M0I020120323 |title=Google charts a careful course through Asia's maps |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |first=Jeremy |last=Wagstaff |author-link=Jeremy Wagstaff |access-date=6 September 2018 |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the People's Republic of China began requiring that all online maps served from within China be hosted there, making them subject to Chinese laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guanqun |first=Wang |title=China issues new rules on Internet map publishing |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |access-date=27 July 2016 |date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527193512/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |archive-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6493">'''Microsociology''' is one of the main points (or focuses) of [[sociology]], concerning the nature of everyday human [[social interaction]]s and [[agency (sociology)|agency]] on a small scale: face to face.&lt;ref&gt;Neil J. Smelser, ''Problematics of Sociology'' (1997) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Microsociology is based on interpretative analysis rather than statistical or empirical observation,&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; and shares close association with the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Methods include [[symbolic interactionism]] and [[ethnomethodology]]; ethnomethodology in particular has led to many academic sub-divisions and studies such as micro[[linguistics|linguistic]]al research and other related aspects of human social behaviour. [[Macrosociology]], by contrast, concerns the [[social structure]] and broader systems.

== Theory ==

Microsociology exists both as an umbrella term for perspectives which focus on agency, such as [[Max Weber]]'s theory of [[social action]], and as a body of distinct techniques, particularly in American sociology. The term was conceived by [[Georges Gurvitch]] in 1939, borrowing the term from the micro-physics and referring to the irreducible and unstable nature of everyday forms of sociality. It also provided an extra dimension between the studies of [[social psychology]], sociology, and [[social anthropology]]—focusing more on individual interaction and thinking within groups, rather than just large social group/societal behaviour. At the micro level, [[social status]] and [[social role]]s are the most important components of social structure. Microsociology forms an important perspective in many fields of study, including modern [[psychosocial]] studies, conversational analysis and human-computer interaction. Microsociology continues to have a profound influence on research in all human fields, often under other names.

==Competing frames of reference==

Some have considered that [[face-to-face interaction]] can be studied in at least three distinct (if overlapping) ways: [[psychology]]; [[intersubjectivity]]; and microsociology.&lt;ref&gt;Smelzer, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] however saw a central tension between [[Durkheim]]ian approaches, and those drawn from [[ethology]], especially in respect of interpersonal ritual;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p. 84 and p. 88-9&lt;/ref&gt; while followers of him have seen in a Durkheimian microsociology the key to the understanding of large-scale social conflict as well.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''Interaction Ritual Chains'' (2004) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erving Goffman]]'s Theories of Social Interaction challenged other sociologists to redirect their focus to the questionable aspects of social behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducrion to Sociology|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|publisher=W.W. NORTON|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92223-3|location=|pages=18,10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to [[Erving Goffman]]'s theory, [[David Émile Durkheim]] believed that advanced methodological principles should guide sociologists and that they should research [[Social fact]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Influences==

[[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], in his work on the phenomenology of social dynamics, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', written in the late 1950s, called microsociology the only valid theory of human relations.&lt;ref&gt;George J. Stack, ''Satre's Philosophy of Social Existence'' (1977) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] are two more recent theorists who have put microsociological concepts to good use in their works.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Calhoun et al, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory'' (2012) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous psychiatrist, [[R.D. Laing]], was much influenced by Garfinkel's ideas on "degradation ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''The Politics of Experience'' (1984) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous English writer/polymath who is greatly influenced by the ideas of studying the minutea of human social action is Jonathan Miller.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Scher. [http://www.oikos.org/soliloqu.htm Soliloquy or Psychosis? A Cultural Look at Schizophrenia].&lt;/ref&gt;

==(Humanistic) social work==

Key issues, categories and principles of the microsociology, such as human relations, face-to-face interaction, interpretive/[[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]], [[attachment theory|attachment]] and [[empathy]], micro-level analysis, [[human behavior]], micro-community, everyday human life, human context, [[microculture]],  focus on agency, have influenced and still influences today the [[social work]] theory and practice, having a crucial role in the emergence of [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]] (Petru Stefaroi),&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;Petru Stefaroi, Humanistic Paradigm of Social Work or Brief Introduction in Humanistic Social Work, ''Social Work Review'' (2012) 10(1) pp. 161-174.&lt;/ref&gt; as response to the [[structural]] and [[system]]ic social work, which theoretically originates from [[macrosociology]] or [[mesosociology]]. This is why [[Humanistic psychology|Malcolm Payne]] considers microsociology a fundamental theoretical-methodological source of this [[postmodern]] and innovative orientation from the contemporary social work, especially of the humanistic social work practice.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Malcolm Payne, ''Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice'', Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan (2011) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Research begins by evaluating the social life of the individuals with the goal of showing the reciprocal relationship between events/actions and the nature of the societal context in which they occur.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Scheff, [http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433119_ss1-98 "Microsociology"], Edited by George Ritzer, 2007, {{ISBN|9781405124331}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical evidence from recorded conversations and the microsociology of emotion has proved of particular interest to students of interaction ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">The '''Modified Triadan System''' is a scheme of [[tooth|dental]] nomenculature that can be used widely across different animal [[species]]. It has now gained wide acceptance and is used worldwide among [[veterinary surgeon]]s.

Each [[tooth]] is given a three digit number.

The first number relates to the quadrant of the mouth in which the tooth lies. 

:Upper Right: 1
:Upper Left: 2
:Lower Left: 3
:Lower Right: 4

If it is a deciduous tooth that is being referred to then a different number is used as below.

:Upper Right: 5
:Upper Left: 6
:Lower Left: 7
:Lower Right: 8

The second and third numbers refer to the location of the tooth from front to back (or [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] to [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]]).

This starts at 01 and goes up to 11 for many species depending on the total number of teeth.

For diagrams of the modified triadan system in [[dog]]s see [http://www.rvc.ac.uk/Review/Dentistry/Basics/triadan/dog.html].

Below is a diagram of the modified triadan system in [[horse]]s.

The '''Network for Capacity Development in Nutrition''' is a working group of the [[United Nations]] Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unscn.org|title=Home - UNSCN|website=www.unscn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCN established a set of working groups (WG) on Capacity Development (CD) in close collaboration with [[United Nations University]] (UNU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu|title=United Nations University|website=www.unu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports are available on the Network's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrowebcee.net/ncdn/|title=Home - NCDN|website=www.agrowebcee.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Network had an initial meeting in 2005 and five meetings between 2006 and 2010; its results are published in scientific journals.  SCN formed nine WGs, of which NCDN is one. NCDN CD nutrition includes human resource development, organizational, institutional and legal framework development.CD is a long term, continuing process. It gives primacy to national priorities, plans, policies and processes. Participants came from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Macedonia, Hungary, Poland, Republika  Srpska, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and facilitators came from the Netherlands and Norway.

The Network links to multiple [[European Economic Community|European Community]] projects:

The general objective of the NCDN Network is to initiate and support CD activities in research and training in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries based on country-specific needs. The objectives will be linked to CEE-specific topics of interest. This is to be open for new challenges following the changes in the various countries over time.

The [[European System of Cooperative Research Networks in Agriculture (ESCORENA)]] was established in 1974 by the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and European research institutions. It became an umbrella for cooperation between research institutions focused on food, agriculture and related fields. Since its foundation, ESCORENA has expanded to include 19 networks, including NCDN CEE. In 2009 with the financial support of [http://www.fao.org/europe/en/ FAO REU] and FAO technical support, a new server was set up in Rome to serve as common technical background for the [[AgroWeb Network]], ESCORENA and the Thematic Knowledge Networks.

The '''niche hypothesis''', also known as the '''acoustic niche hypothesis''' ('''ANH'''),&lt;ref&gt;Eric Stonea (2000), "Separating the Noise from the Noise: A Finding in Support of the 'Niche Hypothesis,' That Birds are Influenced by Human-Induced Noise in Natural Habitats" Anthroös, Vol 13, Issue 4, pgs 225-231&lt;/ref&gt; is an early version of the term ''[[biophony]]''. The term describes the acoustic bandwidth partitioning process that occurs in still-wild [[biome]]s by which non-human organisms adjust their vocalizations by frequency and time-shifting to compensate for vocal territory occupied by other vocal creatures. Thus, each species evolves to establish and maintain its own acoustic bandwidth so that its voice is not masked. For instance, notable examples of clear partitioning and species discrimination can be found in the [[spectrogram]]s derived from the biophonic recordings made in most uncompromised tropical and subtropical rain forests. Additional studies with certain insects and amphibians tend to confirm the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Luis J. Villanueva-Rivera (2014)." Eleutherodactylus frogs show frequency but no temporal partitioning: implications for the acoustic niche hypothesis," Forestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Sueur (2001). "Cicada acoustic communication: potential sound partitioning in a multispecies community from Mexico (Hemiptera: Cicadomorpha: Cicadidae)," Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2002, 75, 379–394. France.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first coined by [[soundscape ecology]] early practitioner, [[Bernie Krause]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Orgelkids Doe-orgel leskist.jpg|thumb|200px|The Do-organ of Orgelkids]]
'''Orgelkids''' (Dutch, "organkids") is an [[education]]al project meant to familiarize and educate children with the [[pipe organ]] musical instrument. The project was initiated in the [[Netherlands]] in 2009 by Lydia Vroegindeweij and is directed towards [[cultural heritage|cultural legacy]] and [[music education]].  Initially the project consisted of a website with educational tips and lesson suggestions to organize, among other projects,  an excursion to a large pipe organ.  Since 2013, Orgelkids has at its disposal a speciallly developed educational organ assembly kit.  A complete, craftsman-built organ, in unassembled component parts, is contained in a lesson box.  The instrument can be assembled and subsequently played.  This so-called Do-organ is rented out by Orgelkids to [[organist]]s, [[organ builder]]s or organ teachers who want to organize educational projects for children.

== Justification / Background ==
The classical pipe organ is almost always built in a fixed location in a building and not very accessible for children.  Due to increased [[secularization]] of society, fewer children attend churches, so they have fewer occasions to spontaneously experience a pipe organ.&lt;ref name=secu&gt;an. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many smaller churches in N. America have electronic organs.  &lt;br /&gt;
In the Netherlands there is a wealth of historical organs.  For the preservation and maintenance of this cultural legacy, it is important to encourage a continuing flow of new organists and organ builders.  To prevent that knowledge and enthusiasm for organs continue to decline, Orgelkids has made a special instrument available to schools.  An [[organist]] or [[organ builder]] visits the school with the Do-organ and supervises the students as they build/assemble the organ.

== Orgelkids Do-organ ==
[[File:2013 Orgelkids Doe-orgel pijpen plaatsen.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Children in primary school are assembling the Do-organ]]
An organ in a lesson box is a unique concept, first conceived and built by Dutch organ builder Wim Janssen specially for the goal of educating children with the technology and playing of the organ.  It is not a demonstration organ with just a few keys, but a real instrument with which children can self-discover how it works.  That is the reason it was given the name, "Do-organ."
The Orgelkids instrument is a mechanical, tracker organ with two [[octave]]s (24 keys) and two [[organ stop|registers]] which can be used independently or in combination. Air (wind in organ parlance)  is supplied by a hand-pumped [[bellows]].&lt;ref name=octaves&gt;Verhoeven 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the materials used are identical to those used in a large pipe organ (such as [[oak wood]] and [[sheepskin|sheep leather]]).  Children experience the value and quality of craftsman-made instruments.

The lesson box is supplied with instruction manuals which include many photos, by which children can assemble the organ with a minimum of instructions, in about 45 minutes.  In addition, there are other lesson materials available such as an [[instructional video]] by the builder, an [[e-book]], and a presentation for a digital [[blackboard]].

Ton Stevens, organist of the basilica of St. John in [[Oosterhout]], the Netherlands, works with kids on [[World Animal Day]] in the basilica every year. First they build and play the Do-organ of Orgelkids, and afterwards the children can take a look at the "real" organ built by [[Maarschalkerweerd]] in 1890. Of course songs like ''[[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]]'' are played on the organ on the occasion of that special day.&lt;ref name=stevens&gt;Rodenburg 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== International developments ==
Orgelkids started in the [[Netherlands]] in 2013 with a single lesson box.  The home for this organ is in the [[Amersfoort]] region, which is in the center of the country.  In the first year, 1350 children were reached.
In 2015 it was expanded with a second organ which is based in [[Belgium]], operating out of [[Antwerp]].  In its first year there, 800 children were reached.

The project has attracted more international attention.  In Oregon a sister project, Orgelkids USA, an educational 501c3 nonprofit,&lt;ref name="orgelkidsusa.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orgelkids USA|url=http://www.orgelkidsusa.org|website=orgelkidsusa.org|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2016 with the mission to help grow a nationwide network of independent kits. They helped place five organ kits built by the US builders in their first year. Orgelkids USA kits are being commissioned to serve as regional resources by chapters of the [[American Guild of Organists]] as well as by non-profit organizations whose missions are pipe organ related. 
== Training for organ builders ==
Since 2016, Orgelkids has been supporting the training of organ builders and the passing down of artisanal skills.  Organ building shops can have apprentice builders work on an Orgelkids instrument during their practical training.  In doing so they develop all manner of practical skills which are also needed in the building or restoration of large, monumental organs.  After completion, the organ kit can be made available for educational projects.
For those who wish to build an organ kit themselves, building instructions are available including 20 technical drawings that correspond to the original organ.

== Foundation ==
The Orgelkids project has been brought into the Dutch "Stichting Kerk Muziek Netwerk" (Church Music Network Foundation) since 2013.&lt;ref name=SKMN&gt;Van den Broucke en Vroegindeweij 2016, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This non-profit foundation engages to make relevant aspects of church music accessible to the greater public.

== Orgelkids USA ==

'''Pennsylvania Humanities Council''' (PHC) is a non-profit affiliate of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] based in [[Philadelphia, PA|Philadelphia, PA]]. It is one of 56 [[List of state humanities councils|state humanities councils]] founded in the wake of the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/fedstate/resource/legislation-councils | title=Legislation for councils}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania Humanities Council's office is located at 325 Chestnut Street #715, Philadelphia, PA  19106. The current Executive Director is Laurie Zierer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2017/winter/in-focus/executive-function-laurie-zierer | title=Executive Function with Laurie Zierer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest state councils were organized in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=78#en_0_1 | title=State Humanities Council Revenues}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Pennsylvania’s council founded as a start-up grant at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1973 the Public Committee for the Humanities in Pennsylvania officially incorporated as a nonprofit at [[Bucknell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/the-pennsylvania-humanities-council-applauds-the-confirmation-of-dr-william-d-bro-adams-as-the-10th-chairman-of-the-national-endowment-for-the-humanities-2014-07-11 | title=The Pennsylvania Humanities Council Applauds the Confirmation of Dr. William D. Bro Adams as the 10th Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the name Pennsylvania Humanities Council (PHC) was established and the organization settled in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pahumanities.org/about-us/a-brief-history | title=A Brief History of PHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, PHC’s activity consisted almost exclusively of making grants to nonprofit organizations with funds provided by the NEH. During the 1980s and early 1990s, they incorporated staff-directed special projects and packaged programs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1994, PHC focused on expanding access to the humanities in Pennsylvania beyond groups traditionally interested in cultural events.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They began to support local groups, working to build the programming capacity of small historical societies, museums, art centers, libraries, senior centers, and community groups.

== Current activities ==
Since 2013, Pennsylvania Humanities Council has shifted its focus to civic engagement, education and humanities advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pahumanities.org/initiatives | title=PHC Initiatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pilot Polder Andijk''', or '''Test Polder Andijk''', ''Proefpolder Andijk'' in Dutch, is a [[polder]] established in 1926 - 1927 in the Zuiderzee near the village of [[Andijk]]. The aim of this prototype is to study the embankments and agriculture for future polders in the [[Zuiderzee Works]].&lt;ref name=hoeksema2006&gt;{{cite book |title=Designed for dry feet: flood protection and [[land reclamation]] in the Netherlands |last=Hoeksema |first=R. J. |page=70 |year=2006 |publisher=[[ASCE Publications]] |isbn=978-0-7844-0829-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the pilot polder was inaugurated by [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]].

==Construction==
In 1924 the Lovink Committee published a proposal to build a pilot polder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Land conservation and development: examples of land-use planning projects and programs |last=Steiner |first=Frederick R. |author2=H. N. van Lier  |page=21 |year=1984 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-0-444-42253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This polder could, on a small scale experiment future agriculture. The knowledge would then be used for the [[Wieringermeer]]. For this reason, in 1926-1927 near the village Andijk, {{convert|40|hectare}} of land were reclaimed.&lt;ref name=hoeksema2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 1927, the pilot polder was drained. The cost of the polder, about 1 million guilders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wunderwerke von Menschenhand |last=Karger-Decker |first=Bernt |page=408 |year=1963 |publisher=Koehler &amp; Amelang |oclc=73487630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was relatively high, but the cost of polders to come should be lower.

==Research==
The Directorate of [[Wieringermeer]] wanted to study the behavior of a [[land reclamation|soil recovered from the sea]], and how saline soils can be cultivated. After the draining was completed, a farm was built as well as laboratories for agriculture, soil science and research in microbiology. Different aspects for optimal use of land have been studied, such as desalination, drying and compacting. Experiments were also made to know the best way to cultivate and to select suitable crops. Some species can concentrate the salt and prepare future plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Polderlands |last=Wagret |first=Paul |page=117 |year=1968 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing]] |oclc=462365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
By 1929 the polder was dry. Rain normally washes salt from reclaimed land in six or seven years; to make the soil useful faster, [[gypsum]] was added to the soil with different fertilizers in various parts of the [[experimental farm]]. The land became an ordinary farm on 1 November 1935{{r|ley196110}} after tests showed that the polder could be cultivated. With the experience gained in the pilot, development of the polder Wieringermeer was accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The golden band: Holland's fight against the sea |last=Jenkins |first=Alan C. |page=71 |year=1966 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing]] |oclc=955509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==
In the late twentieth century the polder became a site for holiday homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In praise of common sense: planning the ordinary: a physical planning history of the new towns in the Ijsselmeerpolders |last=van der Wal |first=Coen |page=83 |year=1997 |publisher=010 Publishers |isbn=978-90-6450-302-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Charles Venturi Jr.''' (June 25, 1925 – September 18, 2018) was an American [[architect]], founding principal of the firm [[Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates]], and one of the major architectural figures of the twentieth century.

Together with his wife and partner, [[Denise Scott Brown]], he helped shape the way that architects, planners and students experience and think about architecture and the American-built environment. Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture.

Venturi was awarded the [[Pritzker Prize]] in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner, Brown. Subsequently, a group of women architects attempted to get her name added retroactively to the prize, but the Pritzker Prize jury declined to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/no-pritzker-prize-for-denise-scott-brown/?_r=0 |title=No Pritzker Prize for Denise Scott Brown |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |date=14 June 2013 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/business/denise-scott-brown-pritzker-prize |title=Denise Scott Brown: Architecture favors 'lone male genius' over women |newspaper=CNN |author= Catriona Davies |date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW; Robert Venturi, Gentle Subverter of Modernism |author=Goldberger, Paul|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1338F937A25757C0A967958260|publisher=The New York Times|date=14 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi is also known for having coined the maxim "Less is a bore", a [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] antidote to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe's]] famous [[Modernism|modernist]] dictum "Less is more". Venturi lived in [[Philadelphia]] with Denise Scott Brown. He was the father of James Venturi, founder and principal of ReThink Studio.

He was awarded the [[Rome Prize Fellowship]] at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1954, where he studied and toured Europe for two years.

From 1959 to 1967, Venturi held teaching positions at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he served as Kahn's teaching assistant, an instructor, and later, as associate professor. It was there, in 1960, that he met fellow faculty member, architect and planner [[Denise Scott Brown]]. Venturi taught later at the [[Yale School of Architecture]] and was a visiting lecturer with Scott Brown in 2003 at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]].

==Writings==
A controversial critic of the blithely [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] and symbolically vacuous architecture of corporate modernism during the 1950s, Venturi was considered a [[counterrevolutionary]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} He published his "gentle manifesto", ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' in 1966; in its introduction, [[Vincent Scully]] called it "probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since [[Le Corbusier]]'s [[Towards a New Architecture|''Vers Une Architecture'']] of 1923." The work was derived from course lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and Venturi received a grant from the [[Graham Foundation]] in 1965 to aid in its completion. The book demonstrated, through countless examples, an approach to understanding architectural composition and complexity, and the resulting richness and interest. Citing [[vernacular]] as well as high-style sources, Venturi drew new lessons from the buildings of architects familiar ([[Michelangelo]], [[Alvar Aalto]]) and then-forgotten ([[Frank Furness]], [[Edwin Lutyens]]). He made a case for "the difficult whole" rather than the diagrammatic forms popular at the time, and included examples — both built and unrealized — of his own work to demonstrate the possible application of such techniques. The book has been published in 18 languages to date.

Immediately hailed as a theorist and designer with radical ideas, Venturi went to teach a series of studios at the [[Yale School of Architecture]] in the mid-1960s. The most famous of these was a studio in 1968 in which Venturi and Scott Brown, together with [[Steven Izenour]], led a team of students to document and analyze the [[Las Vegas Strip]], perhaps the least likely subject for a serious research project imaginable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lessons-from-las-vegas/|title=Lessons from Las Vegas - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour published the folio, ''A Significance for A&amp;P Parking Lots, or [[Learning from Las Vegas]].'' It was revised using the student work as a foil for new theory, and reissued in 1977 as ''Learning from Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form''. This second manifesto was an even more stinging rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes.  The book coined the terms "Duck" and "Decorated Shed," descriptions of the two predominant ways of embodying iconography in buildings. The work of Venturi, Scott Brown, and [[John Rauch]] adopted the latter strategy, producing formally simple "decorated sheds" with rich, complex, and often shocking ornamental flourishes. Venturi and his wife co-wrote several more books at the end of the century, but these two have so far proved to the most influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mark Alan Hewitt |title=Venturi, Robert |work=Grove Art Online |publisher=Oxford Art Online |date=28 November 2011 |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T2086166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Guildhouse Philly.JPG|thumb|The [[Guild House (Philadelphia)|Guild House]], completed 1964, on Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia]]
The architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced, often banal, modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/130389/interview-robert-venturi-denise-scott-brown-by-andrea-tamas |title=Interview: Robert Venturi &amp; Denise Scott Brown |date=April 25, 2011 |publisher=Archdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venturi's buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This "inclusive" approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured—and possibly less functional and more simplistic—work of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi's early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with "impure" forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House).

[[File:Espicopal Acad int.JPG|thumb|Chapel at the Episcopal Academy, Newtown Square, PA. (2010)]]
Venturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm's name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married [[Denise Scott Brown]] on July 23, 1967, in [[Santa Monica, California]], and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm's name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch's resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in [[Manayunk, Philadelphia]], was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1985.  The practice's recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, [[Toulouse]], and Japan.

Venturi's architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms.  The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects [[Robert A. M. Stern]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Philip Johnson]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Graham Gund]] and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Venturi was a Fellow of the [[American Academy in Rome]], the [[American Institute of Architects]], [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].

==Death==
Venturi died on September 18, 2018, in Philadelphia from complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/09/robert-venturi-passes-away/|title=Robert Venturi passes away - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/obituaries/robert-venturi-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was 93.

In the wake of Venturi's death, [[Michael Kimmelman]], the current architecture critic for the ''[[New York Times]]'',  tweeted..."RIP the great, inspiring Robert Venturi who opened millions of eyes and whole new ways of thinking about the richness of our architectural environment, and whose diverse work with Denise Scott Brown contains a mix of wit and humanity that continues to transcend labels and time".&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kimmelman/status/1042496869564395521&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rowland Institute for Science''' was founded by [[Edwin H. Land]], founder of [[Polaroid Corporation]], as a nonprofit, privately endowed basic research organization in 1980. It is named for the first head of the [[American Physical Society]], [[Henry Augustus Rowland]].  The Rowland is dedicated to experimental science across a wide range of disciplines. Research subjects at the institute includes chemistry, physics and biology, and focuses on interdisciplinary work and the development of new experimental tools.

The institute merged with [[Harvard University]] on July 1, 2002, and is now called ''The 'Rowland Institute at Harvard'''. It is located near [[Kendall Square]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a few miles away from the main campus.

==Rowland Junior Fellows==
The flagship program at the Rowland Institute is the Junior Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowland Institute at Harvard - Sponsor Information on GrantForward {{!}} Search for federal grants, foundation grants, and limited submission opportunities|url=https://www.grantforward.com/sponsor/detail/rowland-institute-at-harvard-10055|website=Grant Forward|accessdate=11 April 2017|language=en|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program serves as a [[postdoctoral]] research program for early career [[experiment|experimental]] scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Bubnoff|first1=Andreas|title=Superpostdocs Reach for the Stars|journal=Cell|date=23 March 2007|volume=128|issue=6|pages=1023–1026|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867407003169|accessdate=11 April 2017|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows receive funding for salary and research expenses and are allocated their own [[laboratory]] space. The Rowland Institute also provides technical support from permanent staff. The Fellowship lasts for five years, with continuation past three years contingent on a favorable internal review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowland Institute at Harvard -- Rowland Junior Fellows|url=https://researchfunding.duke.edu/rowland-institute-harvard-rowland-junior-fellows|website=Research Funding|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=12 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''savannah hypothesis''' (or '''savanna hypothesis''') is a formerly widely held [[hypothesis]] that human [[bipedalism]] evolved as a direct result of [[human ancestors]] transition from an [[arboreal]] lifestyle to one on the [[savannas]]. It used to be a prominent hypothesis among [[paleoanthropologists]], but has been falling out of favor since the 1990s. According to this hypothesis, between 2 and 5 million years ago [[hominins]] left the [[woodland]]s that had previously been their natural habitat since about 5–6 million years ago, and adapted to their new habitat by learning first to stand, and then to walk upright.

==Overview==
The hypothesis was closely related to the [[knuckle-walking]] hypothesis; the claim that early human ancestors walked on all fours when they first emerged into the savannas. This was based on observations of morphological characteristics found in ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', and posited that knuckle-walking was an example of [[convergent evolution]] in [[chimpanzees]] and [[gorillas]], which was then lost by the genus [[Homo (genus)|Homo]].&lt;ref name="RichmondEvidence" /&gt; Paleoanthropologists also posited that the upright posture would have been advantageous to savanna-dwelling hominids, as it allowed them to peer over tall grasses for predators, or in search of prey.&lt;ref name="FalkDiversity" /&gt; P. E. Wheeler suggested that another advantage lay in reducing the amount of skin exposed to the sun, which helped regulate body temperatures.&lt;ref name="WheelerBipedality" /&gt;

The [[turnover-pulse hypothesis]], first described by [[Elizabeth Vrba]] seemed to support the savanna hypothesis by suggesting that [[climate change]] events resulting in the shrinking of forested areas forced animals out into the open grasslands.&lt;ref name="SunsetSavanna" /&gt;

==History==
Though the fundamental ideas behind it date back to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],&lt;ref name="SunsetSavanna" /&gt; the hypothesis first came to prominence with the discovery of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' by [[Raymond Dart]] in 1924. In an article on the discovery, published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Dart wrote:
{{quote|"For the production of man a different apprenticeship was needed to sharpen the wits and quicken the higher manifestations of intellect – a more open veldt country where competition was keener between swiftness and stealth, and where adroitness of thinking and movement played a preponderating role in the preservation of the species. Darwin has said, "no country in the world abounds in a greater degree with dangerous beasts than Southern Africa." and, in my opinion, Southern Africa, by providing a vast open country with occasional wooded belts and a relative scarcity of water, together with a fierce and bitter mammalian competition, furnished a laboratory such as was essential to this penultimate phase of human evolution."|Raymond Dart|source=''Australopithecus africanus: The Man-Ape of South Africa'' &lt;ref name="DartAfricanus" /&gt;}}

In the decades following Dart's discovery, more hominid fossils were found in Eastern and Southern Africa, leading researches to conclude that these were savanna dwellers, as well. Much of the academic discussion at the time took for granted that the transition to the savannas was responsible for the emergence of bipedalism, and focused instead on determining particular mechanisms by which this happened.&lt;ref name="SunsetSavanna" /&gt;

==Decline==
In the latter parts of the [[20th century]], new fossil evidence began to emerge which called the savanna hypothesis into question. These newly-discovered remains showed indications that they were still well adapted to climbing trees, even after they had begun to walk upright.&lt;ref name="GreenClimbing" /&gt; Both humans and chimpanzees tend to walk upright when moving along long branches of trees, increasing their reach.&lt;ref name="ThorpeBranches" /&gt; Both [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], the famous ''Australopithecus afarensis'' and "[[Little Foot]]," the collection of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' foot bones demonstrated features consistent with tree-climbing as well as an upright gait; the former through curved fingers, and the latter via a divergent big toe. Additionally, ancient pollen found in the soil near where these fossils were discovered suggest that the area used to be much more wet and covered in thick vegetation, only recently becoming the arid desert it is now.&lt;ref name="SunsetSavanna"/&gt;

==Versus sweatshop==

===Sweatshop===
A sweatshop is a factory or workplace, especially in the garment industry, where workers are employed at very low wages for long hours and under poor working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jOaTCNNtbIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=sweatshop&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=93FTVMy0BY_g7QbshoH4Dg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop&amp;f=false|title=Making Sweatshops|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sweatshop factories in developing countries such as India, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh employ low-pay worker or even child labour around 10–14 years old to work in their factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/NLC_childlabor.html|title=Children Found Sewing Clothing For Wal-Mart, Hanes &amp; Other U.S. &amp; European Companies  - National Labor Committee|work=Harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers are forced to work up to 16 hours a day seven days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/sweatshops-in-bangladesh|title=Sweatshops in Bangladesh|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not receive any basic employee benefits such as health care, maternity leave, sick pay and holiday pay from their employers. They sometime make the female workers to take birth control and take regular pregnancy test to stop maternity leave. And these workers only earn 25p an hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/china-sweatshops|title=Sweatshops in China|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is much lower than the legal national [[minimum wage]]. Even labours work long hours everyday, their salaries are usually just enough to cover their basic living cost.

Besides, sweatshop factories usually have harsh working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/business/worldbusiness/05sweatshop.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=In Chinese Factories, Lost Fingers and Low Pay |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, no rest break, no air-conditioning and workers have to stand for their entire shift. Some workers even had to work in unsafe and hazardous conditions which may causes working injuries or even fatal factory incidents. Take China as an example, in 2009 alone, approximately one million workers were injured at work and about 20,000 suffered from diseases due to their occupation. The reason for this is that the sweatshop factories did not provide any safety guidance for their employees. Lots of sweatshop workers are also suffering from labour abuse, sexual harassment and discrimination in their workplaces. To avoid labours organising protests or any campaign against unfair labour practise, many sweatshop factories find ways to prevent the establishment of the trade unions.

===Sweatshop-free===
In sweatshop, labours have to work for long hours but receive very low salary which is only half or even less than the legal [[minimum wage]] under a harsh working condition. The aim of sweatshop-free wish to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and products are made in good working conditions. Sweatshop-free standards include the right to collective bargaining, non-poverty wages, safe workplaces, back wages, and non-harassment.

Take American Apparel as an example, they provide all employees and their families lots of employee benefits including health insurance, parking, subsidised public transport, subsidised lunches, free on site massages, a bike lending program, a program of paid days off as well as opening an onside medical clinic for their employees.&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt; American Apparel make sure that their workers are treated fairly and working in a good working conditions. They pay average skilled-sewers 25,000 US dollar per year and 12 US dollar per hour&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C73D94TwNYC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=sweatshop+free&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWZTVOeiFsOu7AbSzYCwBw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop%20free&amp;f=false|title=Fashion Brands|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that twice the national [[minimum wage]], which is in big contrast to 25p per hour wage commonly found in sweatshop factories abroad.

===Sweatshop-free clothing===
There are a few ways to know that you are buying sweatshop-free clothing:
* Look at the garment label. For example, Unite is an international union which makes sweatshop free clothing.
* Many organisations, for example Green America, publish ethical consumer guides which list their recommendations for sources of sweatshop free clothing.
* The price of sweatshop-free clothing is relatively higher than sweatshop products.

==Sweatshop scandals==

===Apple Inc.===
[[File:Applefactory.jpg|thumb|right| Workers in a China Apple factory. An investigation found some workers had to work 15 hours a day for £27 a month]]
[[File:Iphonee5ss.jpg|thumb|right|The "S" is for Sweatshop]]
[[Apple Inc]]  the world's most valuable technology multinational corporation has been accused that their contractors are forcing workers to do overtime involuntarily at sweatshop working conditions and employing underage workers in its factories. Some labourers are forced to work 24 hours at a time and others are forced to stand for their entire shift. And some workers even had to work at unsafe and hazardous condition. In December 2011, 61 workers in the Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory were injured in a gas explosion whilst trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103798/Revealed-Inside-Apples-Chinese-sweatshop-factory-workers-paid-just-1-12-hour.html|title=Revealed: Inside Apple's Chinese 'sweatshop' factory where workers are paid just £1.12 per hour|work=Mail Online|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the pressurised working conditions, in 2009, 18 workers who work in Foxconn factory, one of the Apple manufacturer, committed suicide after losing an iPhone prototype.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; Over next two years, at least 18 other Apple workers try to commit suicide. Besides, undercover Inspectors have been monitoring Pegatron factory, one of the Apple contractor in Taiwan, for five months and found Apple supplier broke 86 laws and regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2381182/Apple-accused-sweatshop-conditions-Far-Eastern-factories.html|title=Apple accused of sweatshop conditions at Far-Eastern factories - This is Money|work=This is Money|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including workers are forced to work up to 70 hours per week as well as hiring more than 100,000 underage labour to work on the production lines. These sweatshop scandals strongly affected the reputation of the company.

[[File:Portestorr.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters stand outside the Primark shop on Oxford St with SWEATSHOP SHAME banner]]

===Primark===
[[Primark]], a leading high street fashion chain, has been blamed that three of its Indian suppliers are using child labour in their factories. After BBC Panorama’s six months undercover investigation, they discovered the Indian suppliers were sub-contracting middlemen who employed children at Bhavanisagar refugee camp. Investigators found a 9-year-old boy who is working in the refugee camp sweatshop “Sometimes we get major orders in and we have to work double quick. I get paid a few rupees for finishing each garment, but in a good day I can make 40 rupees (60p)” and “The beads we sew are very small and when we work late at night we have to work by candle - the electricity in the camp is poor.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/exposed-primarks-sweatshops-that-pay-children-just-60p-a-day-6875294.html|title=Exposed: Primark's sweatshops that pay children just 60p a day|work=The Evening Standard|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primark sub-contractors hired young children to work under poor working conditions, paying them as little as 13p an hour and they have to work up to 48 hours a week.  After BBC Panorama investigation discovered that the Indian suppliers had used child labour to carry out embroidery and sequin work, Primark then fired the Indian suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7824291.stm|title=BBC News - Primark linked to UK sweatshops|work=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC also reported that TNS Knitwear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosweat.org.uk/story/2009/01/12/primark-clothes-made-sweatshop-labour-uk-factory|title=Primark: clothes made by sweatshop labour in UK factory|work=Nosweat.org.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Manchester-based supplier that provide Primark with about 20,000 garment a week, was not only employing illegal immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, but also paying them as little as £3 per hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/872736/primark-linked-manchester-sweatshop/ |title=Primark linked with Manchester sweatshop |publisher=Managementtoday.co.uk |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is well below than the legal [[minimum wage]] but the company has denied all the allegations.

==Sweatshop-free legislation and activism==
In October 2008, the City of Portland, Oregon passed the "City of Portland Sweatshop Free Procuremenat Policy” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=264837|title=ADM-1.17 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy Administrative Rules|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the pacific northwest’s first city to adopt this policy. Portland Sweatshop-Free Purchasing Policy requires the local apparel manufacturers to guarantee their garments were produced in workplaces free of sweatshop conditions. Local apparel manufacturers have to disclose their manufacturing facility locations and meet ethical souring practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2008/10/20/newscolumn1.html?page=all|title=Portland city officials adopt sweatshop-free policy|work=Portland Business Journal|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from monitoring the local apparel manufacturers, the city also participate and collaborate with public agencies and other non- profit organisation to promote sweatshop free procurement practices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=218021|title=ADM-1.16 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy and Code of Conduct for Apparel Contractors|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is institutionalizing meaningful change. A not-for-profit organisation called SweatsHope &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweatshope.org|title=SweatsHope|work=SweatsHope.org|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to produce ethical factories in Kolkata, India to stop human trafficking (women and children), we also aim to create an ethical place of work for the victims of abuse, freeing them from sex trade. This workplace will become a place of refuge, education, childcare and provide a decent wage. They believe Shutting down one sweatshop, will only create less jobs for people who are already struggling with employment, or that another sweatshop will just open up next door. Retailers are always trying to get cheaper manufacturing costs, this is why we need to stand up and demand ethical treatment and wages for staff. If the consumers demand this, and demand an ‘open book’ of their suppliers, we will create a sweatshop free world.

{{Software development process}}
{{More footnotes|date=February 2009}}
In [[software testing]], '''test automation''' is the use of special [[software]] (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam |author2=Huizinga, Dorota  | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=74| isbn = 978-0-470-04212-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for [[continuous delivery]] and [[continuous testing]].

==Overview==
Some [[software testing]] tasks, such as extensive low-level interface [[regression testing]], can be laborious and time-consuming to do manually. In addition, a manual approach might not always be effective in finding certain classes of defects. Test automation offers a possibility to perform these types of testing effectively. Once automated tests have been developed, they can be run quickly and repeatedly. Many times, this can be a cost-effective method for regression testing of software products that have a long maintenance life. Even minor patches over the lifetime of the application can cause existing features to break which were working at an earlier point in time.

There are many approaches to test automation, however below are the general approaches used widely:

* '''[[Graphical user interface testing]]'''. A testing framework that generates [[Graphical user interface|user interface]] events such as keystrokes and mouse clicks, and observes the changes that result in the user interface, to validate that the observable behavior of the program is correct.
* '''[[API testing|API driven testing]]'''. A testing framework that uses a programming interface to the application to validate the behaviour under test. Typically API driven testing bypasses application user interface altogether. It can also be testing [[public interface|public (usually) interfaces]] to classes, modules or libraries are tested with a variety of input arguments to validate that the results that are returned are correct.

Test automation tools can be expensive, and are usually employed in combination with manual testing. Test automation can be made cost-effective in the long term, especially when used repeatedly in [[regression testing]]. A good candidate for test automation is a test case for common flow of an application, as it is required to be executed (regression testing) every time an enhancement is made in the application. Test automation reduces the effort associated with manual testing. Manual effort is needed to develop and maintain automated checks, as well as reviewing test results.

In automated testing the test engineer or [[software quality assurance]] person must have software coding ability, since the test cases are written in the form of source code which, when run, produce output according to the [[Assertion (computing)|assertion]]s that are a part of it. Some test automation tools allow for test authoring to be done by keywords instead of coding, which do not require programming.

One way to generate test cases automatically is [[model-based testing]] through use of a model of the system for test case generation, but research continues into a variety of alternative methodologies for doing so.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In some cases, the model-based approach enables non-technical users to create automated business test cases in plain English so that no programming of any kind is needed in order to configure them for multiple operating systems, browsers, and smart devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4578383|title=Proceedings from the 5th International Conference on Software Testing and Validation (ICST).

What to automate, when to automate, or even whether one really needs automation are crucial decisions which the testing (or development) team must make.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&amp;ObjectType=ART&amp;ObjectId=2010| title=When Should a Test Be Automated?| author=Brian Marick| publisher=StickyMinds.com| accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multi-vocal literature review of 52 practitioner and 26 academic sources found that five main factors to consider in test automation decision are: 1) System Under Test (SUT), 2) the types and numbers of tests, 3) test-tool, 4) human and organizational topics, and 5) cross-cutting factors. The most frequent individual factors identified in the study were: need for regression testing, economic factors, and maturity of SUT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garousi|first=Vahid|last2=Mäntylä|first2=Mika V.|date=2016-08-01|title=When and what to automate in software testing?

==Unit testing ==
A growing trend in software development is the use of [[unit testing]] frameworks such as the [[xUnit]] frameworks (for example, [[JUnit]] and [[NUnit]]) that allow the execution of unit tests to determine whether various sections of the [[code]] are acting as expected under various circumstances. [[Test case]]s describe tests that need to be run on the program to verify that the program runs as expected.

Test automation mostly using unit testing is a key feature of [[extreme programming]] and [[agile software development]], where it is known as [[test-driven development]] (TDD) or test-first development. Unit tests can be written to define the functionality ''before'' the code is written. However, these unit tests evolve and are extended as coding progresses, issues are discovered and the code is subjected to refactoring.&lt;ref name="Learning TDD"&gt;''Learning Test-Driven Development by Counting Lines''; Bas Vodde &amp; Lasse Koskela; IEEE Software Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Only when all the tests for all the demanded features pass is the code considered complete. Proponents argue that it produces software that is both more reliable and less costly than code that is tested by manual exploration.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is considered more reliable because the code coverage is better, and because it is run constantly during development rather than once at the end of a [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] development cycle. The developer discovers defects immediately upon making a change, when it is least expensive to fix. Finally, [[code refactoring]] is safer when unit testing is used; transforming the code into a simpler form with less [[code duplication]], but equivalent behavior, is much less likely to introduce new defects when the refactored code is covered by unit tests.

==Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing==
{{main article|Graphical user interface testing}}

Many test automation tools provide record and playback features that allow users to interactively record user actions and replay them back any number of times, comparing actual results to those expected. The advantage of this approach is that it requires little or no [[software development]]. This approach can be applied to any application that has a [[graphical user interface]]. However, reliance on these features poses major reliability and maintainability problems. Relabelling a button or moving it to another part of the window may require the test to be re-recorded. Record and playback also often adds irrelevant activities or incorrectly records some activities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A variation on this type of tool is for testing of web sites. Here, the "interface" is the web page. However, such a framework utilizes entirely different techniques because it is rendering [[HTML]] and listening to [[DOM Events]] instead of operating system events. [[Headless browser]]s or solutions based on [[Selenium (Software)#Selenium WebDriver|Selenium Web Driver]] are normally used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Headless Testing with Browsers; https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Headless Testing with Browsers"&gt;Headless Testing with PhantomJS;http://phantomjs.org/headless-testing.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Automated User Interface Testing; https://www.devbridge.com/articles/automated-user-interface-testing/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of this type of test automation tool is for testing mobile applications. This is very useful given the number of different sizes, resolutions, and operating systems used on mobile phones. For this variation, a framework is used in order to instantiate actions on the mobile device and to gather results of the actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Beginner's Guide to Automated Mobile App Testing {{!}} Testmunk Blog|url = http://blog.testmunk.com/tutorial-for-automated-mobile-app-testing-calabash/|website = blog.testmunk.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17|last = Testmunk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2015|reason=this not a reliable source, it's a blog from someone who is not a recognized expert in the field.}}

Another variation is script-less test automation that does not use record and playback, but instead builds a model{{clarify|date=June 2016}} of the application and then enables the tester to create test cases by simply inserting test parameters and conditions, which requires no scripting skills.

==API driven testing==
[[API testing]] is also being widely used by software testers due to the difficulty of creating and maintaining GUI-based automation testing. It involves directly testing [[API]]s as part of [[integration testing]], to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.&lt;ref name="reichart1"&gt;[http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/Testing-APIs-protects-applications-and-reputations Testing APIs protects applications and reputations], by Amy Reichert, SearchSoftwareQuality March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since APIs lack a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], API testing is performed at the [[Communications protocol#Layering|message layer]].&lt;ref name="stickyminds"&gt;[http://www.stickyminds.com/interview/all-about-api-testing-interview-jonathan-cooper All About API Testing: An Interview with Jonathan Cooper], by Cameron Philipp-Edmonds, Stickyminds August 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; API testing is considered critical when an API serves as the primary interface to [[application logic]] since [[Graphical user interface testing|GUI tests]] can be difficult to maintain with the short release cycles and frequent changes commonly used with [[agile software development]] and [[DevOps]].&lt;ref name="forrblog"&gt;[http://blogs.forrester.com/diego_lo_giudice/15-04-23-the_forrester_wave_evaluation_of_functional_test_automation_fta_is_out_and_its_all_about_going_be?cm_mmc=RSS-_-BT-_-63-_-blog_1769 The Forrester Wave™ Evaluation Of Functional Test Automation (FTA) Is Out And It's All About Going Beyond GUI Testing], by Diego Lo Giudice, [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] April 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layers"&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/document/2645817?ref=QuickSearch Produce Better Software by Using a Layered Testing Strategy], by  Sean Kenefick, [[Gartner]] January 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous testing==
[[Continuous testing]] is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate.&lt;ref name="essential"&gt;[https://www.techwell.com/techwell-insights/2015/08/part-pipeline-why-continuous-testing-essential Part of the Pipeline: Why Continuous Testing Is Essential], by  Adam Auerbach, TechWell Insights August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stickym"&gt;[http://www.stickyminds.com/interview/relationship-between-risk-and-continuous-testing-interview-wayne-ariola The Relationship between Risk and Continuous Testing: An Interview with Wayne Ariola], by Cameron Philipp-Edmonds, Stickyminds December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; For Continuous Testing, the scope of testing extends from validating bottom-up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals.&lt;ref name="pnsqc"&gt;[http://uploads.pnsqc.org/2015/papers/t-007_Ariola_paper.pdf DevOps: Are You Pushing Bugs to Clients Faster],  by  Wayne Ariola and Cynthia Dunlop, PNSQC October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==What to test==
Testing tools can help automate tasks such as product installation, test data creation, GUI interaction, problem detection (consider parsing or polling agents equipped with [[test oracle]]s), defect logging, etc., without necessarily automating tests in an end-to-end fashion.

One must keep satisfying popular requirements when thinking of test automation:
* [[Computing platform|Platform]] and [[Operating system|OS]] independence
* Data driven capability (Input Data, Output Data, [[Metadata]])
* Customization Reporting (DB [[Data Base]] Access, [[Crystal Reports]]
* Easy debugging and logging
* [[Version control]] friendly – minimal binary files
* Extensible &amp; Customization (Open [[API]]s to be able to integrate with other tools)
* Common Driver (For example, in the Java development ecosystem, that means [[Apache Ant|Ant]] or [[Apache Maven|Maven]] and the popular [[Integrated Development Environment|IDEs]]). This enables tests to integrate with the developers' [[workflows]].
* Support unattended test runs for integration with build processes and batch runs. [[Continuous integration]] servers require this.
* Email Notifications like [[bounce message]]s
* Support distributed execution environment (distributed [[Testbed|test bed]])
* Distributed application support (distributed [[System Under Test|SUT]])

==Framework approach in automation==
A test automation framework is an integrated system that sets the rules of automation of a specific product. This system integrates the function libraries, test data sources, object details and various reusable modules. These components act as small building blocks which need to be assembled to represent a business process. The framework provides the basis of test automation and simplifies the automation effort.

The main advantage of a [[Software framework|framework]] of assumptions, concepts and tools that provide support for automated software testing is the low cost for [[Software maintenance|maintenance]]. If there is change to any [[test case]] then only the test case file needs to be updated and the [[driver Script]] and [[startup script]] will remain the same. Ideally, there is no need to update the scripts in case of changes to the application.

Choosing the right framework/scripting technique helps in maintaining lower costs. The costs associated with test scripting are due to development and maintenance efforts. The approach of scripting used during test automation has effect on costs.

Various framework/scripting techniques are generally used:
# Linear (procedural code, possibly generated by tools like those that use record and playback)
# Structured (uses control structures - typically ‘if-else’, ‘switch’, ‘for’, ‘while’ conditions/ statements)
# [[Data-driven testing|Data-driven]] (data is persisted outside of tests in a database, spreadsheet, or other mechanism)
# [[Keyword-driven testing|Keyword-driven]]
# Hybrid (two or more of the patterns above are used)
# Agile automation framework

The Testing framework is responsible for:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# defining the format in which to express expectations
# creating a mechanism to hook into or drive the application under test
# executing the tests
# reporting results

===Test automation interface===
Test automation interface are platforms that provide a single [[workspace]] for incorporating multiple testing tools and frameworks for [[system testing|System/Integration testing]] of application under test. The goal of Test Automation Interface is to simplify the process of mapping tests to business criteria without coding coming in the way of the process. Test automation interface are expected to improve the efficiency and flexibility of maintaining test scripts.&lt;ref name = "Interface"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Test Automation Interface.png|thumb|Test Automation Interface Model]]

Test Automation Interface consists of the following core modules:
* Interface Engine
* Interface Environment
* Object Repository

===Interface engine===
Interface engines are built on top of Interface Environment. Interface engine consists of a [[parser]] and a test runner. The parser is present to parse the object files coming from the object repository into the test specific scripting language. The test runner executes the test scripts using a [[test harness]].&lt;ref name = "Interface" /&gt;

===Object repository===
Object repositories are a collection of UI/Application object data recorded by the testing tool while exploring the application under test.&lt;ref name = "Interface" /&gt;

==Defining boundaries between automation framework and a testing tool==
Tools are specifically designed to target some particular test environment, such as Windows and web automation tools, etc. Tools serve as a driving agent for an automation process. However, an automation framework is not a tool to perform a specific task, but rather infrastructure that provides the solution where different tools can do their job in a unified manner. This provides a common platform for the automation engineer.

There are various types of frameworks. They are categorized on the basis of the automation component they leverage. These are:
# [[Data-driven testing]]
# [[Modularity-driven testing]]
# [[Keyword-driven testing]]
# [[Hybrid testing]]
# [[Model-based testing]]
# Code-driven testing
# [[Behavior driven development]]

[[File:TheStoryOfArt.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Story of Art''''', by [[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]], is a survey of the [[art history|history of art]] from ancient times to the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]] (2006), ''The Story of Art'', London: [[Phaidon Press]], 978-0-7148-324-70&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1950 by [[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]], the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the [[visual arts]]. It was originally intended for younger readers. Over seven million copies have been sold, making it the best selling art book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/17/story-of-art-eh-gombrich Picture perfect.] William Skidelsky, ''[[The Observer]]'', 17 May 2009. theguardian.com Retrieved 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in its 16th edition and has been translated into approximately 30 languages.

==Summary==
The book is divided into an introduction, 27 chapters each dealing with a defined time period of art history within one or several cultural/geographic contexts, and a concluding chapter summarizing the latest developments in visual arts. The first chapter starts examining [[prehistoric art]] and native cultures. The next four chapters are dedicated to the greater ancient cultures, especially Greece and Rome. Starting with chapter 8, Gombrich then begins to focus on Central European art, returning to a more global view in chapter 24 that deals with art of the late 18th and early 19th century in England, France and America. A striking property of ''The Story of Art'' is the amount of illustrations it contains, with more than 50% of the book's pages devoted to color photographs of paintings, drawings, architecture and sculptures. In the preface, Gombrich explains that it has been his intention not to mention any work of art that he could not also include as an illustration.

The first two sentences of the book have become famous: ″There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=E. H.|title=The Story of Art|date=1984|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-850066-5|page=4|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gombrich later elaborated on this statement by saying that he defines "art" based on its Latin root, meaning "skill," and that there is "no disembodied skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrier|first1=David|title=Gombrich and Danto on Defining Art|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1996|volume=54|issue=3|page=279|jstor=431629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12591">'''Water potential''' is the [[potential energy]] of [[water]] per unit volume relative to pure water in reference conditions. Water potential quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another due to [[osmosis]], [[gravity]], mechanical [[pressure]], or matrix effects such as [[capillary action]] (which is caused by [[surface tension]]). The concept of water potential has proved useful in understanding and computing water movement within [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[soil]].  Water potential is typically expressed in potential energy per unit volume and very often is represented by the [[Psi (letter)|Greek letter ψ]].

Water potential integrates a variety of different potential drivers of water movement, which may operate in the same or different directions.  Within complex biological systems, many potential factors may be operating simultaneously.  For example, the addition of solutes lowers the potential (negative vector), while an increase in pressure increases the potential (positive vector). If flow is not restricted, water will move from an area of higher water potential to an area that is lower potential.  A common example is water with a dissolved salt, such as sea water or the fluid in a living cell.  These solutions have negative water potential, relative to the pure water reference.  With no restriction on flow, water will move from the locus of greater potential (pure water) to the locus of lesser (the solution); flow proceeds until the difference in potential is equalized or balanced by another water potential factor, such as pressure or elevation.

==Components of water potential==

Many different factors may affect the total water potential, and the sum of these potentials determines the overall water potential and the direction of water flow:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \Psi_0 + \Psi_\pi + \Psi_p + \Psi_s + \Psi_v + \Psi_m &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Taiz|author2=Zeiger|title=Plant Physiology|edition=Fourth|publisher=Sinauer Associates|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;\Psi_0&lt;/math&gt; is the reference correction,
*&lt;math&gt;\Psi_\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solution|solute]] or [[osmosis|osmotic]] potential, 
*&lt;math&gt;\Psi_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] component,
*&lt;math&gt;\Psi_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravity|gravimetric]] component,
*&lt;math&gt;\Psi_v&lt;/math&gt; is the potential due to [[humidity]], and
*&lt;math&gt;\Psi_m&lt;/math&gt; is the potential due to matrix effects (e.g., fluid cohesion and surface tension.)

All of these factors are quantified as potential energies per unit volume, and different subsets of these terms may be used for particular applications (e.g., plants or soils). Different conditions are also defined as reference depending on the application: for example, in soils, the reference condition is typically defined as pure water at the soil surface.

===Pressure potential===

Pressure potential is based on mechanical pressure, and is an important component of the total water potential within plant [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.  Pressure potential increases as water enters a cell. As water passes through the [[cell wall]] and [[cell membrane]], it increases the total amount of water present inside the cell, which exerts an outward pressure that is opposed by the structural rigidity of the cell wall. By creating this pressure, the plant can maintain [[turgor pressure|turgor]], which allows the plant to keep its rigidity.  Without turgor, plants will lose structure and [[wilting|wilt]].

The pressure potential in a plant cell is usually positive. In [[Plasmolysis|plasmolysed cells]], pressure potential is almost zero.  Negative pressure potentials occur when water is pulled through an open system such as a plant [[xylem]] vessel. Withstanding negative pressure potentials (frequently called ''tension'') is an important adaptation of xylem.   This tension can be measured empirically using the [[Pressure bomb]].

===Osmotic potential (solute potential)===

Pure water is usually defined as having an osmotic potential (&lt;math&gt;\Psi_\pi&lt;/math&gt;) of zero, and in this case, solute potential can never be positive. The relationship of solute concentration (in molarity) to solute potential is given by the [[van 't Hoff equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_\pi = - MiRT&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration in molarity of the solute, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[van 't Hoff factor]], the ratio of amount of particles in solution to amount of formula units dissolved, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ideal gas constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute
temperature.

For example, when a [[Solution|solute]] is dissolved in water, water molecules are less likely to [[diffusion|diffuse]] away via [[osmosis]] than when there is no solute. A solution will have a lower and hence more negative water potential than that of pure water.  Furthermore, the more solute molecules present, the more negative the solute potential is.

Osmotic potential has important implications for many living [[organisms]].  If a living cell is surrounded by a more concentrated solution, the cell will tend to lose water to the more negative water potential (&lt;math&gt;\Psi_w&lt;/math&gt;) of the surrounding environment. This can be the case for [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] organisms living in sea water and [[halophytic]] plants growing in [[soil salinity|saline]] environments.  In the case of a plant cell, the flow of water out of the cell may eventually cause the plasma membrane to pull away from the cell wall, leading to [[plasmolysis]].  Most plants, however, have the ability to increase solute inside the cell to drive the flow of water into the cell and maintain turgor.

This effect can be used to power an [[osmotic power plant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/presscentre/press-releases/2007/statkraft-to-build-worlds-firsk-osmotic-power-plant.aspx Statkraft to build world's first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

A soil solution also experiences osmotic potential. The osmotic potential is made possible due to the presence of both inorganic and organic solutes in the soil solution. As water molecules increasingly clump around solute ions or molecules, the freedom of movement, and thus the potential energy, of the water is lowered. As the concentration of solutes is increased, the osmotic potential of the soil solution is reduced. Since water has a tendency to move toward lower energy levels, water will want to travel toward the zone of higher solute concentrations. Although, liquid water will only move in response to such differences in osmotic potential if a [[semipermeable membrane]] exists between the zones of high and low osmotic potential. A semipermeable membrane is necessary because it allows water through its membrane while preventing solutes from moving through its membrane. If no membrane is present, movement of the solute, rather than of the water, largely equalizes concentrations.

Since regions of soil are usually not divided by a semipermeable membrane, the osmotic potential typically has a negligible influence on the mass movement of water in soils. On the other hand, osmotic potential has an extreme influence on the rate of water uptake by plants. If soils are high in soluble salts, the osmotic potential is likely to be lower in the soil solution than in the plant root cells. In such cases, the soil solution would severely restrict the rate of water uptake by plants. In salty soils, the osmotic potential of soil water may be so low that the cells in young seedlings start to collapse ([[plasmolysis|plasmolyze]]).

===Matrix potential (Matric potential)===

When water is in contact with solid particles (e.g., [[clay]] or [[sand]] particles within [[soil]]), [[adhesion|adhesive]] [[intermolecular force]]s between the water and the [[solid]] can be large and important.  The forces between the water molecules and the solid particles in combination with attraction among water molecules promote [[surface tension]] and the formation of [[Meniscus (liquid)|menisci]] within the solid matrix.  Force is then required to break these menisci.  The magnitude of matrix potential depends on the distances between solid particles—the width of the menisci (also [[capillary action]] and differing Pa at ends of capillary)—and the chemical composition of the solid matrix (meniscus, macroscopic motion due to ionic attraction).

In many cases, absolute value of matrix potential can be relatively large in comparison to the other components of water potential discussed above. Matrix potential markedly reduces the energy state of water near particle surfaces. Although water movement due to matrix potential may be slow, it is still extremely important in supplying water to plant roots and in engineering applications. The matrix potential is always negative because the water attracted by the soil matrix has an energy state lower than that of pure water. Matrix potential only occurs in unsaturated soil above the water table. If the matrix potential approaches a value of zero, nearly all soil pores are completely filled with water, i.e. fully [[Water content|saturated]] and at maximum [[Soil water (retention)|retentive capacity]]. The matrix potential can vary considerably among soils. In the case that water drains into less-moist soil zones of similar porosity, the matrix potential is generally in the range of −10 to −30 kPa.

==Empirical examples==
===Soil-plant-air continuum===
{{main article|Soil plant atmosphere continuum}}
At a potential of 0 kPa, soil is in a state of saturation. At [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]], all soil pores are filled with water, and water typically drains from large pores by gravity. At a potential of −33 kPa, or −1/3 bar, (−10 kPa for sand), soil is at [[field capacity]]. Typically, at field capacity, air is in the macropores and water in micropores. Field capacity is viewed as the optimal condition for plant growth and microbial activity. At a potential of −1500 kPa, soil is at its [[permanent wilting point]], meaning that soil water is held by solid particles as a "water film" that is retained too tightly to be taken up by plants.

In contrast, atmospheric water potentials are much more negative—a typical value for dry air is −100 MPa, though this value depends on the temperature and the humidity.  Root water potential must be more negative than the soil, and the stem water potential and intermediate lower value than the roots but higher than the leaf water potential, to create a passive flow of water from the soil to the roots, up the stem, to the leaves and then into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Beerling2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beerling|first1=D.

===Measurement techniques===
A [[tensiometer (soil science)|tensiometer]], electrical resistance gypsum block, [[neutron probe]]s, or [[time-domain reflectometry]] (TDR) can be used to determine soil water potential energy. Tensiometers are limited to 0 to −85 kPa, electrical resistance blocks is limited to −90 to −1500 kPa, neutron probes is limited to 0 to −1500 kPa, and [[Time-domain reflectometer|TDR]] is limited to 0 to −10,000 kPa.  A scale can be used to estimate water weight (percentage composition) if special equipment is not on hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10390">'''Yannis Stavrakakis''' ({{lang-el|Γιάννης Σταυρακάκης}}; born 1970) is a Greek–British political theorist. A member of the [[Essex School of discourse analysis]], he is mainly known for his explorations of the importance of psychoanalytic theory ([[Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]) for contemporary political and cultural analysis.

== Education and academic career ==

Stavrakakis was born in [[Sheffield]], UK. He studied political science at [[Panteion University]] (Athens) and discourse analysis at [[Essex University]]. He received his MA and PhD degrees from the ‘Ideology and Discourse Analysis’ programme at the University of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ideology and Discourse Analysis Programme (IDA) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090608231719/http://www.essex.ac.uk/ida/ | archive-date = 8 June 2009 | url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/ida/ | publisher = [[University of Essex]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis, completed under the supervision of [[Ernesto Laclau]], was entitled ‘New Directions in the Theory of Ideology and the Case of Green Ideology’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stavrakakis | first = Yannis | title = Lacan and the political | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415171878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 onwards he has worked at the Universities of Essex and Nottingham and at the Postgraduate Programme of the Department of Political Science and History of Panteion University. In 2006 he was appointed Associate Professor at the School of Political Sciences of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref name="Thessaloniki"&gt;{{cite web | title = Yannis Stavrakakis, Professor | url = http://www.polsci.auth.gr/index.php?lang=en&amp;rm=118&amp;mn=128&amp;stid=34 | website = polsci.auth.gr | publisher = [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since been promoted to Professor of Political Discourse Analysis and currently serves as deputy Head of School.&lt;ref name="Thessaloniki" /&gt;

Stavrakakis has also been recently elected (2012) in the executive board of the Hellenic Political Science Association, where he now serves as Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Board of Directors (2014-2016) | url = http://hpsa.gr/%CE%95%CE%95%CE%A0%CE%95/%CE%94%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BF/tabid/123/language/el-GR/Default.aspx | publisher = Hellenic Political Science Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the framework of the Association, he has co-founded a Research Network dedicated to the analysis of political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url =http://www.discourse-analysis.gr | publisher = Discourse Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

His research interests include contemporary political theory (with emphasis on psychoanalytic and post-structuralist approaches), the analysis of ideology and political discourse in societies of late modernity (with emphasis on the study of political ecology, [[populism]] and [[post-democracy]]) and the political dimensions of artistic practices and theater. His recent work has focused on the political and psychosocial implications of what he calls "debt societies" of Southern Europe (especially Greece) and on the emerging ideological cleavage between populist and anti-populist discourses within this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stavrakakis | first = Yannis | title = my country is the colony of a larger colony | url = http://www.chronosmag.eu/index.php/y-stavrakakis-my-country-is-the-colony-of-a-larger-colony.html | work = CHRONOS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Stavrakakis | first1 = Yannis | last2 = Sevastakēs | first2 = Nikolas | title = Laïkismos, antilaïkismos kai krise | publisher = Ekdoseis Nephele | location = Athēna | year = 2012 | isbn = 9789605040468 }} [http://www.nnet.gr/downloads/dt-laikismos.pdf Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.anti-pop.gr/ | website = anti-pop.gr | publisher = The "Anti-Pop" Portal }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014-5 period he has served as Principal Investigator of the POPULISMUS research project, co-funded by the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.populismus.gr/ | website = populismus.gr | publisher = POPULISMUS Research Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research focus of the project was on the relationship between populist discourse and democracy and it involved a variety of research and dissemination activities as well as the creation of an international Observatory of populist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://observatory.populismus.gr/ | website = observatory.populismus.gr | publisher = International Observatory of Populist Discourse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has authored and co-edited many books in English and Greek and has published numerous articles in journals such as: ''[[Journal of Political Ideologies]]''; ''Journal for Lacanian Studies''; ''Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society''; ''Philosophy and Social Criticism''; ''[[Constellations (journal)|Constellations]]''; ''[[South European Society and Politics]]''; ''[[Journal of Modern Greek Studies]]''; ''[[Theory, Culture and Society]]''; ''[[Third Text]]''; ''[[Organization Studies (journal)|Organization Studies]]''; ''[[Planning Theory]]''. Many of his publications have been translated to a variety of other languages including Spanish, German, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Russian, Bulgarian, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, for his books in Spanish: via [http://www.fce.com.ar/ar/libros/detalles.aspx?IDL=6716 Fondo de Cultura Económica] and via [http://www.prometeoeditorial.com/catalogo/detalle.php?id_libro=276 Promoeteo Editorial].&lt;/ref&gt; He is contributing editor of the journal ''Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society'' (Palgrave) and member of the editorial boards of ''Subjectivity'' (Palgrave), ''Journal for Lacanian Studies'' and ''Synchrona Themata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Publications in Greek | url = http://www.biblionet.gr/main.asp?page=showauthor&amp;personsid=6858 | website = biblionet.gr | publisher = Biblionet }}&lt;/ref&gt;
