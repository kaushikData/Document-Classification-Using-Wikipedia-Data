The competition spans more than 20 major ACM conferences, hosting special poster sessions to showcase research at the undergraduate and graduate level. Selected semi-finalists add a slide presentation and compete for prizes in both undergraduate and graduate categories based on their knowledge, contribution, and quality of presentation.  Those taking first place at the second-level competitions are invited to compete in the annual Grand Finals. Three top students in each category are selected as winners each year, representing approximately the top 1-2% of competing students.&lt;ref name="src"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Student Research Competition|url=http://src.acm.org/|website=ACM Student Research Competition|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1988">On the basis of the General Rules for Archives published in 1983, historical archives were being expanded at the provincial and county levels. Two of the most important archives were the [[First Historical Archives of China]] (FHAC), located in Beijing containing the archives of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, and the [[Second Historical Archives of China]] (SHAC), located in Nanjing containing the archives of the [[Kuomintang]] period. And the Central Archives (the State Archives Administration) contains the archives of the Communist Party and the People's Republic. A number of foreign scholars have been granted access to these archives. In 1987 public and research libraries still faced serious space, management, and service problems. Even with the special efforts being made to solve these problems, it was clear that they would not be quickly resolved.

In the late 1980s, China was experiencing an active educational and cultural life. Students were staying in school longer, educational standards were being raised, and facilities were being improved. Intellectuals were encouraged to develop their [[expertise]], especially in the scientific and technical spheres, and a wide variety of traditional and modern literary and art forms were allowed to flourish. This situation was likely to continue as long as it served the interest of economic [[modernization]] and posed no threat to the political establishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">'''Career Clusters'''  provide students with a context for studying traditional academics and learning the skills specific to a career, and provide U.S. schools with a structure for organizing or restructuring curriculum offerings and focusing class make-up by a common theme such as interest.

In the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] model, 16 Career Clusters link to 70+ more specific Career Pathways – each have their own knowledge and skills requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |publisher=States' Career Clusters Initiative 
 |year=2007 
 |title=What are Career Clusters? 
 |url=http://careerclusters.org/whatis.cfm 
 |accessdate=2007-06-27 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623215748/http://www.careerclusters.org/whatis.cfm

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the 70+ career pathways, 1800 Career Specialties are defined.  The structure has evolved over time and may vary by state.  The U.S. DOE Career Clusters framework is useful for connecting students with courses of study and careers via [[Career Assessments]], and allows them to learn general, more transferable skills at the cluster level, with more specific skills and knowledge acquired at the career pathways and specialty levels.  The nonprofit Vocational Research Institute adapted an interest and [[aptitude]] assessment, [[Careerscope]], to help students choose curriculum and careers for which they have both interest and aptitude - at the cluster, pathway and career specialty levels.  A concept related to Career Clusters, [[Small Learning Community]] is primarily concerned with restructuring secondary schools, in many cases using a career clusters framework.

==Background==
The Career Cluster initiative began in 1996 in the U.S. as the Building Linkages Initiative and was a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), the National School-to-Work Office (NSTWO) and the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). The purpose of the Initiative was to establish linkages among State educational agencies, secondary and post-secondary educational institutions, employers, industry groups, other stakeholders and Federal agencies. The goal was to create curricular frameworks in broad career clusters, designed to prepare students to transition successfully from high school to post-secondary education and employment in a career area.

The creation of curricular models within the context of broad career clusters ensures the alignment of academic and technical instructional strategies with the requirements of post-secondary education and the expectations of employers in increasingly academic and technologically demanding careers.  The vocational education field has historically responded to the needs of the national economy by preparing individuals for in-demand jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/announcements/2000-4/120600a.html  Federal Register  December 6, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 1, 1950. He is a political sociologist of education, a published poet and short story author. He did his undergraduate work in sociology in Argentina (B.A. honors and teaching credential in Sociology, Universidad del Salvador), his graduate work in Mexico (M.A. Political Science. FLACSO) and the United States (Master of Arts and Ph.D. in International Development Education, Stanford University), and post-doctoral studies in educational foundations in Canada (University of Alberta). He is a Professor of Social Science and Comparative Education at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies.

In 1991, in partnership with several colleagues, he created the Paulo Freire Institute, PFI, and is currently serving as its Founding Director at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA. He also served as director of the UCLA Latin American Center. Dr. Torres has been a Visiting Professor in universities in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. He has lectured throughout Latin America and the United States, and in universities in England, Japan, Italy, Spain, Tanzania, Finland, Mozambique, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Portugal, Taiwan, Korea, Sweden and South Africa.

== Educational background ==
* B.A. in [[Sociology]] with teaching credentials, [[Universidad del Salvador]], Argentina (1974)
* M.A. in [[Political Science]], [[Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales]], Mexico (1978)
* M.A. in [[International Development Education]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]], United States (1982)
* Ph.D. in International Development Education, Stanford Graduate School of Education, United States (1983)
* Post-doctoral studies in Education Foundations, [[University of Alberta]], [[Canada]] (1988)

== Research Agenda ==
Dr. Torres' areas of theoretical research focus on the relationship between culture and power, the interrelationships of economic, political, and cultural spheres, and the multiple and contradictory dynamics of power among and within social movements that make education a site of permanent conflict and struggle.

His empirical research focuses on the impact of globalisation in Latin America, especially on higher education in Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico.  Dr. Torres' theoretical and empirical research has resulted in the development of a political sociology of education, highlighted in his much-heralded book with Raymond Morrow, Social Theory and Education. He is considered one of the world's leading authorities on Latin American Studies, and the principal biographer of Brazilian philosopher and critical social theorist, Paulo Freire.

Over the last thirty years,  Dr. Torres has contributed to three fields: Latin American Studies, Sociology of Education and Comparative and International Education. In his theoretical work, Dr. Torres has accounted for the major shifts and transformations, national and global, that deeply impacted these fields. A book he wrote with Raymond Morrow, Social Theory and Education, is considered the standard text on theories and meta-theories in Sociology of Education. A book he edited with Robert Arnove, Comparative Education: The Dialectics of the Global and the Local, now in its third edition, is the textbook of choice for more than fifty Comparative Education programmes in the English-speaking world. Another of his books, Education, Democracy and Multiculturalism: Dilemmas of Citizenship in a Global World, translated in several languages, suggested new agendas for these fields. All three books contain critical interpretations of cultural and social reproduction theory, theories of the state, analyses of multiculturalism, feminism and other approaches to social diversity, inequality, and the struggle for social justice education.

For the last decade, Dr. Torres has been working from a global perspective that encompasses human rights, pluralism and citizenship, wresting education away from state dominance, and the globalization of economies, communications and labour forces. The question of educating the global citizen is at the top of his research agenda. Understanding the educational policies of the new social democratic governments in Brazil and Argentina, and the impact of the [[new social movements]] constitutes the next empirical phase of his research.

== Published work ==
Dr. Torres has authored more than 62 books, and more than 250 research articles, chapters in books and entries in encyclopedias in several languages—he speaks fluently in Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://carlosatorres.com/curriculum-vitae/publications-cv-2/|title=Publications|date=2013-05-15|work=Carlos Alberto Torres|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has participated and presented papers and has been a keynote speaker regularly for the last twenty-five years in national and world congresses of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), Asociación Latinoamericana de Sociología (ALAS), Comparative International Educational Society (CIES), International Council of Comparative Education Societies, International Political Science Association (IPSA), International Sociological Association (ISA), and Latin American Studies Association (LASA).

He has been Vice-President, Research Committee on Political Education, IPSA (1983–1997), Past-President, Comparative International Education Society, CIES (1994–1998), and he has been elected President, Research Committee on Sociology of Education, International Sociological Association (1998–2002, and 2002–2006). He is the editor of the prestigious series of Routledge/TayorandFrancis (New York)  on Education, Social Theory and Cultural Change.

== Academic Responsibilities ==
He has Chaired (1998–2003) the Commission on Education and Society of the Latin American Council of Social Sciences(CLACSO), a federation of 148 elite research centers in Latin America. He has served as an evaluator for the Fulbright Programs, and the program for Gifted and Talented Children, US. Department of Education. At UCLA he has served as Assistant Dean for Students Affairs, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies; Head of the Division of Social Sciences and Comparative Education, Department of Education; Chair, Committee of Academic Personnel, Department of Education, and in the Advisory Committees of International Studies and Overseas Programs (ISOP), the Chicano Studies Research Center, the Pacific Rim Center, the Latin American Studies Inter-Departmental  Program (IDP), and, as ''ex officio'', the Latin American Center.

He served on the Committee for the establishment of the César Chavez Center. He was an Educational Adviser (ad honorem) of the Argentine National Congress and was a member of the Scientific Commission that worked with the Secretary of State of Science and Technology in Argentina, which provided the guidelines for a new law of science and technology in the country passed by the Argentinean Congress (2000–2001).

From 1995 until 2005 he has served as Director of the UCLA Latin American Center, an Organized Research Unit of the University of California. In this capacity he conducted systematic research, lecturing and writing on Latin American politics and society, with a focus on Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. He has also written several op end pieces in newspapers in Argentina, his native country. Currently he is the Founding Director of the Paulo Freire Institute at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies (GSEIS-UCLA). He was featured in the Newspaper La Opinion as one of the most successful Spanish leaders in California.  See “La Vocación de Educar. El argentino Carlos Alberto Torres es uno de los profesores de mayor rango en UCLA”. Journal La Opinión, Monday, March 13, 2006, pages 1, 12A.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Milwaukee]], Horngren joined the U.S. Army after high school graduation in 1946. Back in Milwaukee, he obtained his BA in accounting at the [[Marquette University]] in 1949. In 1952 he obtained his MBA from [[Harvard Business School]], and in 1955 his PhD from [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="CC 2011"/&gt;

After his Marquette University graduation, Horngren had started his career as accountant, and started lecturing accounting at a business college. In 1952 he joined the University of Chicago faculty as lecturer. After his doctorate graduation he taught at [[Marquette University]] and at [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], and returned to the [[University of Chicago]] as Professor of Accounting. In 1966 he moved to the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], where he spent the rest of his academic career.&lt;ref name="CC 2011"/&gt;

Inspired by the work of [[William J. Vatter]], Horngren published the influential textbook ''Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis,'' in 1962. This was the first of a number of books on financial and cost accounting Horngren co-authored, which shaped the theory of modern-day management accounting.&lt;ref name="CC 2011"/&gt; Horngren was inducted into the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/charles-thomas-horngren/ Charles Thomas Horngren], The Accounting Hall of Fame.

The '''Chinese Text Project''' (CTP; {{zh|t=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}) is a [[digital library]] project that assembles collections of [[Chinese classics|early Chinese texts]]. The name of the project in Chinese literally means "The Chinese Philosophical Book Digitization Project", showing its focus on books related to [[Chinese philosophy]]. It aims at providing accessible and accurate versions of a wide range of texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.princeton.edu/chinese-historiography/electronic-resources/databases-electronic-text/ | title = Classical Historiography for Chinese History: Databases &amp; electronic texts | last = Elman | first = Benjamin A. | publisher = Princeton University | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those relating to Chinese philosophy, and the site is credited with providing one of the most comprehensive and accurate collections of classical Chinese texts on the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpa-net.org/scholarship.html Association of Chinese Philosophers in North America (北美中国哲学学者协会)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cjfraser.net/links/#etext Chris Fraser], Department of Philosophy, University of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being one of the most useful textual databases for scholars of early Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;http://warpweftandway.com/support-the-chinese-text-project/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://languagehat.com/chinese-text-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site contents==

Texts are divided into pre-Qin and Han texts, and post-Han texts, with the former categorized by [[Hundred Schools of Thought|school of thought]] and the latter by [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]]. The ancient (pre-Qin and Han) section of the database contains over 5 million Chinese characters, the post-Han database over 20 million characters, and the publicly editable [[wiki]] section over 5 billion characters.&lt;ref name="ctext.org"&gt;http://ctext.org/system-statistics&lt;/ref&gt; Many texts also have English and Chinese translations, which are paired with the original text paragraph by paragraph as well as phrase by phrase for ease of comparison; this makes it possible for the system to be used as a useful scholarly research tool even by students with little or no knowledge of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Connolly | first = Tim | date = 2012 | title = Learning Chinese Philosophy with Commentaries | url = https://www.pdcnet.org/teachphil/content/teachphil_2012_0035_0001_0001_0018 | journal = Teaching Philosophy | publisher = Philosophy Documentation Center | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | access-date= March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5598">'''College transfer''' is the anticipated movement students consider between education providers and the related institutional processes supporting those [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[Higher education|post-secondary]] learners who actually do move with completed coursework or training that may be applicable to a degree pathway and published requirements.

==Overview==
Student movements between different education providers spanning secondary and post-secondary institutions of [[higher education]] are varied. College transfer covers the exploratory effort, [[self-assessment]] and enrollment steps students take considering their prior learning credentials - which could include [[coursework]] grades, credit recommendations or exams reflecting their prior leaning investment and efforts. The application, applicability and articulation of prior course credits from one college or university to another culminates in a student's transfer and enrollment in a program of study, aspiring to complete a college level credential. The assessment of prior learning and the articulation of credit offered to a prospective student varies based upon institutional practices and the enforcement of government policies enacted through [[Legislature|legislative]] or [[Negotiated rulemaking|negotiated]] rules.

College Transfer also describes the general institutional support services including the academic, enrollment and advising required to help steer students through the complexity of changing institutions or programs of study and to help them understand the impact on requirements for degree completion. College transfer not only spans educational providers and their [[Academia|academic]] policies, it defines the new normal for the majority of students enrolled in [[higher education]] across many countries.

==Background==

According to the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES), in 2005 nearly 60% of [[college]] graduates in the [[United States]] who completed [[undergraduate degree]]s had attended two or more institutions prior to [[graduation]]. In the United States, roughly 2.5 million [[students]] explore college transfer which may involve re-entry from the workforce as students stop and start along their degree pathway. Student mobility spans institutions and regions, differing policies and practices often extending college degree completion by an average of one semester according to the GAO in a report to Congress in October 2005.&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0622.pdf''Postsecondary Institutions Could Promote More Consistent Consideration of Coursework by Not Basing Determinations on Accreditation'', United States Government Accountability Office  website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Student mobility is not just in the United States. By mid-2010, 2.2 million students will have experienced what it means to do an [[ERASMUS]] term in one of more than 4 000 higher education institutions in 33 participating countries.&lt;ref name="ERASMUS"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/erasmus/doc1051_en.htm''Mobility and lifelong learning instruments'', European Commission Education &amp; Training website]&lt;/ref&gt; These include all the [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]] as well as [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], [[Turkey]], [[Croatia]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. The [[Erasmus Programme]] (European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students), a.k.a. [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus]] Project is a [[European Union]] (EU) student exchange programme established in 1987. It forms a major part of the EU Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013, and is the operational framework for the [[European Commission]]'s initiatives in higher education.

==Criticism==

Typically, the application deadline is March 1, and undergraduate institutions will often respond to the applicants within a few months at a time later than normal [[freshman]] college acceptances. The Common Application questions focus on the student's motivation to switch to a different university, in addition to college specific questions, rather than emphasizing high school senior's personal statements. Although this decision is incredibly important, the time between receiving acceptances and notifying the institutions of your plans is very slim.

Following the [[Thirty Years' War]], the education in [[Moravia]] was firmly in the hands of [[Jesuits]]. [[Moravian nobility]] were keen to expand the range of areas taught at the [[University of Olomouc]] beyond just theology and philosophy. Despite opposition from the Jesuits, the Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] authorized the introduction of [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Law|secular legal studies]] in 1679. However, the quarrels with the Jesuits became so intense that soon the law Professors had to leave the University and continued their lectures first in private premises, later in the building of Olomouc court. They were paid by the Moravian nobility, and since 1709 the Professors were appointed directly by the Emperors. While in the next decade the Jesuits accepted the Professorate within the University, the Nobility was seeking to enlarge the education opportunities.

In 1725 the Moravian nobility forced the establishment of the '''Collegium Nobilium''' — the Academy of Nobility — by the decree of [[Emperor Charles VI]] in [[Olomouc]]. The lectures were provided by Professor of Law (since 1732 there were two of them, since 1735 three), who was teaching also at the University,  Professor of Engineering (who taught both civil and military engineering and architecture, mathematics, geometry and cartography), lecturer of languages (initially French, since 1815 also Italian, since 1829 also Czech), and teachers of dance, gymnastics, swordsmanship and equitation.&lt;ref name="sisma"&gt;{{cite book

|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778 both the University and the Academy were relocated to [[Brno]], however by 1782 both of them were back in Olomouc. In 1783 [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] merged it with the [[Theresian Academy]] in [[Vienna]], which was however closed in 1784. The Olomouc Academy itself was closed in 1787. However, only four years later [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]] decided to restore the Academy in Olomouc, and it was reopened in 1793.&lt;ref name="sisma"/&gt;

In 1810 the Department of Agriculture was established, and since 1815 there was also Professor of Natural Science. There were efforts to introduce also lectures of geometry, mechanics and practical chemistry, however they succeeded only after the establishment of the Brno Technical College.&lt;ref name="sisma"/&gt;

The Academy remained in Olomouc until 1847, when it was relocated to [[Brno]]: here it became the basis for what was later to become the [[Brno University of Technology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10899">The '''Dwight H. Terry Lectureship''', also known as the '''Terry Lectures''', was established at [[Yale University]] in 1905&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/ Yale University - "Dwight H. Terry Lectureship"]&lt;/ref&gt; by a gift from Dwight H. Terry of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Its purpose is to engage both scholars and the public in a consideration of religion from a [[humanitarian]] point of view, in the light of modern science and philosophy.  The subject matter has historically been similar to that of the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Scotland, and several lecturers have participated in both series.

==Establishment of the Lectureship==
The 1905 deed of gift establishing the lectureship states:

{{cquote|The object of this foundation is not the promotion of scientific investigation and discovery, but rather the assimilation and interpretation of that which has been or shall be hereafter discovered, and its application to human welfare, especially by the building of the truths of science and philosophy into the structure of a broadened and purified religion. The founder believes that such a religion will greatly stimulate intelligent effort for the improvement of human conditions and the advancement of the race in strength and excellence of character. To this end it is desired that a series of lectures be given by men eminent in their respective departments, on ethics, the history of civilization and religion, biblical research, all sciences and branches of knowledge which have an important bearing on the subject, all the great laws of nature, especially of evolution ... also such interpretations of literature and sociology as are in accord with the spirit of this foundation, to the end that the Christian spirit may be nurtured in the fullest light of the world’s knowledge and that mankind may be helped to attain its highest possible welfare and happiness upon this earth.&lt;ref name="yup"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=81 Yale University Press - "The Terry Lectures Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although commitment to the gift was made in 1905 it did not mature until 1923, which is when the first Terry lectures were held.

==Lecture format==
The lectures are free and open to the public.  A single installment generally consists of four lectures by the same visiting scholar, given over the course of a month or less.  Many of the lectures have been edited into books published by the [[Yale University Press]], and remain in print to this day (see below)  Since 1999, the lectures have been recorded and archived on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100411232503/http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/past_00-04.html Terry Lectures website] as audio and/or video streams.

The '''''gwageo''''' or '''''kwago''''' were the national '''civil service examinations''' under the [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasties of [[Korea]]. Typically quite demanding, these tests measured candidates' ability of writing composition and knowledge of the [[Chinese classics]]. The form of writing varied from literature to proposals on management of the state. Technical subjects were also tested to appoint experts on medicine, interpretation, accounting, law etc. These were the primary route for most people to achieve positions in the bureaucracy.

Based on the [[Imperial examination|civil service examinations]] of imperial [[China]], the ''gwageo'' first arose in [[Unified Silla]], gained importance in [[Goryeo]], and were the centerpiece of most [[education in the Joseon Dynasty]]. The tutelage provided at the [[hyanggyo]], [[seowon]], and [[Seonggyungwan]] was aimed primarily at preparing students for the gwageo and their subsequent career in government service.  Under Joseon law, high office was closed to those who were not children of officials of the second full rank or higher, unless the candidate had passed the gwageo. Those who passed the higher literary examination came to monopolize all of the dynasty's high positions of state.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silla==
The first national examinations were administered in the kingdom of [[Silla]] beginning in 788, at the suggestion of Confucian scholar [[Choe Chiwon]]. However, due to Silla's entrenched [[bone rank system]], which dictated that appointments be made on the basis of birth, these examinations did not have a strong effect on the government.

==Goryeo==
Under the Goryeo dynasty, the national examinations became more systematic and powerful than they had been under Silla.  However, they remained only one among several avenues to power. A man who had reached a position of the fifth rank or higher could automatically have one son placed in a position of rank.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, pp. 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The examinations were established in 958, during the reign of [[Gwangjong of Goryeo|Gwangjong]] as a means of breaking the hold which a few powerful families held over the government.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), pp. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the dynasty, they retained this character of strengthening the throne against the aristocracy.  This also took the form of aligning the throne with the provincial elites, and the kings of Goryeo strove to extend educational opportunities to the local elites throughout the country. In fact, any member of the ''[[yangin]]'' freeborn class was permitted to take the examination, although the descendants of monks, criminals and [[cheonmin]] were excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 118; SNUERI, p.&lt;/ref&gt; However, over time government-run educational institutions such as the [[hyanggyo]] and [[Gukjagam]] lost ground to private institutions like the [[Twelve Assemblies]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major examinations were literary, and came in two forms:  a composition test (''jesul eop''), and a test of classical knowledge (''myeonggyeong eop''). These tests were officially to be held every three years, but in practice it was common for them to be held at other times as well.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  The composition test came to be viewed as more prestigious, and its successful applicants were divided into three grades. On the other hand, successful candidates on the classical examination were not ranked. In the course of the dynasty, some 6000 men passed the composition examination, while only about 450 passed the classics examination.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The classics examination was revised in 1344, under the reign of [[Chunghye of Goryeo|Chunghye]], on the model of the [[examination system]] then employed in [[Yuan Dynasty]]. The earlier system based directly on the classics was replaced with one based on [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] interpretations of the classics.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Military examinations were established briefly under the reign of [[Yejong of Goryeo|Yejong]], and again in the reign of [[Gongyang of Goryeo|Gongyang]] just before the dynasty's fall; however, for most of the dynasty, there was no military examination and thus no educational path to military rank.  This may have reflected the relative strength of the military elites during this period.

Miscellaneous examinations (''jabeop'') were administered in various fields. One among these was Buddhism; monks who passed received a special clerical title, beginning with ''daeseon'', or "monk designate."&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Separate tests were administered for the [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon and Gyo]] sects, which dominated the Buddhism of the Goryeo period.

==Joseon==
Under the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), the examinations fell under three broad categories: the literary examinations (''mun-gwa'': 文科), military examinations (''mugwa'': 武科), and miscellaneous examinations (''japgwa'': 雜科) covering topics such as medicine, geography, astronomy, and translation. As other roads to advancement were much more closed than during the Goryeo period, the gwageo became virtually the only pathway to a position of rank.&lt;ref&gt;Byeon (1996), pp. 277-278.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, anyone other than slaves and lowest class called ''chunmin'' (those who worked in despised occupations such as butchers) could take gwageo examinations, but in reality only yangban who had the luxury of spending much of their childhood and early adulthood  studying could hope to pass the exam. In the case of literary administration, children of remarried women, concubines, and officials who were dismissed for corruption were excluded from taking the exam. Gwageo examinations were very important not only for an individual but for his family because a [[yangban]] family that did not produce a government official for four generations lost their status as yangban.  
   
When writing the examination, candidates had to record the names and positions of their four great-grandfathers. The higher literary examination was restricted to those who either were already in a position of rank, or who had already passed the lower examination. The miscellaneous examinations were looked down upon by the yangban, and were generally restricted to the [[chungin]] class of hereditary technical workers. Criteria for the military examination varied, but over time it became open even to members of the lowest class (the [[cheonmin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

The gwageo provided a basis for various forms of [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]]. Due to the strength of regional factions in [[Joseon Dynasty politics]], scholars from out-of-favor factions often did not bother to take the examination at all. In addition, for much of the dynasty candidates from [[Hamgyong]] were forbidden to attempt the gwageo. In the late Joseon Dynasty, an increasing percentage of successful candidates came from the northern province of [[Pyongan]], and the small county of [[Chŏngju]] came to produce more successful candidates than any other county.

===Administration===
The gwageo were originally administered every three years; these regular examinations were known as the ''singnyeonsi'' (식년시). However, the ''singnyeonsi'' became less important over time, and an increasing percentage of candidates took the ''gwageo'' on special occasions. These included the ''alseongsi'' (visitation examinations), which were administered when the king visited the Shrine of Confucius at the [[Seonggyungwan]] royal academy, the ''jeunggwangsi'' (augmented examinations) held during national celebrations, and the ''byeolsi'' (special examinations) held on other special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;These translations are taken from Lee (1984), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these special examinations were usually limited to the literary and military examinations.  Over the course of the dynasty, a total of 581 irregular examinations were held, in comparison to 163 of the triennial ''singneonsi'' examinations.

The literary and military examinations were administered in three stages: an initial qualifying test (''chosi'') administered in the provinces, a second examination (''hoesi'') conducted in the capital (in which the qualifying candidates were selected), and a third examination (''jeonsi'') in the presence of the king, in which the successful candidates were ranked in order.  Each stage was [[norm-referenced]], with a set number of successful applicants. The candidate who received the highest score (''jangwon'') in the literary examination was given a post of the 6th junior (''jong'') rank.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; If the ''jangwon'' was already employed in a position of rank, he was raised 4 levels.&lt;ref&gt;Byeon (1999), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The candidate with second and third highest scores were given a post of the 7th junior rank.  The rest were not guaranteed a post, but had to wait until one became vacant. The miscellaneous examinations had only the first two stages; their candidates were not ranked.

Testing procedures were a frequent flashpoint of controversy, with various factions vying for control of the examination criteria. In particular, the question of whether the first phase of the higher examination should be oral or written became a hot topic of debate in early Joseon.

===Literary examinations===
The literary examination was divided into a lower and higher examination. In turn, in the lower literary examination some candidates applied for a "classics licentiate" (or ''saengwon'') and others for a "literary licentiate" (or ''jinsa''). After passing these lower examinations (''saengjin-gwa''), they could proceed to the higher examination. This lower examination may have originated in the [[entrance examination]]s for the [[Gukjagam]] of Goryeo.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower examination, the literary licentiate tested compositional skill in various forms of Chinese poetry and prose, including [[shi (poetry)|shi]] poetry, ''[[fu (literature)|fu]]'' rhyming prose, piao documentary prose, and [[ts'e]] problem-essays.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The classics licentiate tested knowledge of the [[Four Books and Five Classics]] from an orthodox [[Neo-Confucian]] interpretation. From each regular administration of the test, a total of 100 successful candidates were selected for each licentiate. These were drawn from a pool of 600 (for each licentiate), of which 200 were chosen from the capital and 400 were apportioned from the various provinces.&lt;ref&gt;These figures are given by SNUERI, but Byeon (1996, p. 278) says that the total number from the provinces was 700.&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher literary examination was administered every three years, and a total of 33 successful candidates were selected from a pool of 240. These 240, in turn, were sent from the Seonggyungwan (50), the capital (40), and the [[Eight Provinces of Korea|Eight Provinces]] (the number sent from each province varied, with [[Hwanghae]] and [[Yeongan]] sending only 10 while [[Gyeongsang]] sent 30).&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the first two of the higher examination was in turn divided into three parts: in the first section, the candidates showed their understanding of the Confucian canon, in the second part they demonstrated their ability to compose in various literary forms, and in the last portion they wrote a problem-essay which was intended to show their political aptitude.&lt;ref name="SNUERI, loc. cit"&gt;SNUERI, loc. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the Joseon Dynasty, a total of 14,620 men passed the literary examination. The triennial ''singneonsi'' passed roughly 41% of these; the remainder passed in the course of irregular examinations.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; This proportion shifted over time; as the dynasty progressed, the irregular examinations became increasingly important.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may in part have been because the number of candidates in triennial examinations was fixed, while the number in the irregular examinations was not fixed.

===Military examination (Mugwa)===
The military examination selected 190 candidates in the first stage, of whom 28 were allowed to pass the second stage.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 110. Byeon (1996, p. 279) gives 200 for the initial stage, but agrees with 28 for the second stage.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 70 came from the capital and the remainder from the various provinces, with Gyeongsang contributing 30, Chungcheong and Jeolla contributing 25, and the remaining provinces 10 candidates each.&lt;ref name="SNUERI, loc. cit"/&gt;

The military examinations tested a mixture of military and literary criteria. The first stage of the test was a practical test of various military skills, focused on [[Korean archery]] but the second stage, in which the successful applicants were selected, was an oral examination of applicants' knowledge of the Confucian canon and certain classics of military thought.  Of importance were Sun Tzu's Art of War, as well as Hanbizi and Wutzu.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage, in which the candidates were ranked, was again based on practical military skills. These include horsemanship, and mounted archery.  The story of [[Yi Sunshin]] failing the Mugwa the first time due to falling off his horse during this phase, at which point he applied a hasty tourniquet using willow branches, and finishing his mounted archery portion is well known.

===Miscellaneous examinations===
The miscellaneous examinations, or ''japgwa'', were divided into four parts: translation, medicine, natural science (astrology, geography, and others), and recordkeeping. These examinations were overseen by the government office which employed specialists in the field. They were closely connected to the Sahak royal technical academies, which were overseen by the same offices.

In the case of translation, the languages tested were the four which the Joseon court maintained translators in: contemporary Chinese, Mongolian, Jurchen/Manchu, and Japanese. This examination was overseen by the Office of Translators, which maintained translators in the capital and in the major border-ports and cities. At the first level, 45 candidates were accepted in spoken Chinese and 4 in each of the other languages; the second level selected 13 successful applicants in Chinese and 2 in each of the other languages.&lt;ref&gt;SNUEI, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical examination selected 18 finalists, narrowed to 9 successful applicants in the second round. These were then given positions in the Bureau of Medicine, which sent some of them to the palace and others to each provincial division down to the ''[[hyeon]]'' level.&lt;ref&gt;SNUERI, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who passed the ''japgwa'' were originally given a crimson certificate, the same color obtained by those who passed the literary examination. However, pressure from the yangban eventually changed this color to white, signifying a lower level of achievement and entitling the bearer to a position of lower rank. Those who passed this examination became known as [[chungin]].

===Historical change===
The gwageo were supplemented in the reign of [[Jungjong of Joseon]] (1506-1544), at the suggestion of the high official [[Jo Gwang-jo]]. The supplementary examination was called an "examination for the learned and the virtuous" (''hyeollanggwa''). This was an abbreviated examination, held in the presence of the king. The candidates had to be recommended by their local magistrate as men of the highest integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''gwageo'' system became increasingly corrupt in the later years of the Joseon Dynasty. Scholars who were unable to pass the examination began to form a class of disaffected yangban; notable among these was early 19th-century rebel leader [[Hong Gyeong-nae]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 254)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the later [[Silhak]] scholars also turned away from state service.

The gwageo were finally abolished in the [[Gabo Reforms]] of 1894, along with legal class discrimination and the old rank system.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tradition continues in the form of university entrance examinations and civil service examinations in modern-day South Korea.

'''''It Gets Better: Coming Out, Overcoming Bullying, and Creating a Life Worth Living''''' is a [[non-fiction]] [[Anthology|compilation]] book, edited by [[Dan Savage]] and his husband, Terry Miller. It was published March 22, 2011 by Dutton. The book includes selections of essays inspired by the [[It Gets Better Project]], founded by Savage. He decided to start the project after a series of incidents of [[suicide among LGBT youth]]. Individuals were encouraged to submit videos with a message of hope and optimism for teenagers who were victims of [[bullying]] due to their [[sexual orientation]]. Over 100 essays are contained in the book. Contributors include finance advisor, [[Suze Orman]]; comedic writer, [[David Sedaris]]; [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Hillary Clinton]]; and [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="betterself" /&gt;

Sales of the book were successful, and [[IndieBound]] reported it reached a list of bestsellers in the United States less than one week after publication.&lt;ref name="books" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; It reached [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] in April 2011.&lt;ref name="newyorktimesbest" /&gt; The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' noted that the book "features handpicked and heartfelt essays from contributors famous and obscure, gay and straight."&lt;ref name="betterself" /&gt;

==Background==
{{Details|It Gets Better Project}}
[[File:President Obama - It Gets Better.webm|thumb|left|upright|[[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] contributed a video to the ''It Gets Better Project'' (2010) &amp;mdash; and is included in the book.]]
Dan Savage started the [[It Gets Better Project]] in September 2010 in order to address incidents of [[suicide among LGBT youth]].&lt;ref name="rothaus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothaus|first=Steve|date=February 25, 2011|title=Sex columnist Dan Savage reaches out to gay youth|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt impacted by suicides of youths, including [[Tyler Clementi]], who were tormented because of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="breeding"&gt;{{cite news|title=Driven to suicidal thoughts by anti-gay taunts, a boy summons the strength to survive. |work=[[Denton Record-Chronicle]]|location=[[Denton, Texas]]|date=March 27, 2011|first=Lucinda|last=Breeding|page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the project is to reach out to teenagers and to provide them with hope and optimism in the face of [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|page=7|title=Bullying of gay students gets attention at forum|first=Elaine|last=Markowitz|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I was just stewing on the kids, and the reaction you always have as a gay adult is 'I wish I could have talked to that kid,' to have been able to tell him it gets better," explained Savage.&lt;ref name="rothaus" /&gt; The project intended to inform teenagers that "it gets better", through video submissions to the organization.&lt;ref name="rothaus" /&gt; Savage commented, "When a 15-year-old or a 13-year-old kills himself because he is gay, what he’s saying is that he can’t picture a future with enough joy in it to compensate for the pain he’s in now, to make enduring this and getting through it worth it. We gay adults know adult gay life is pretty awesome....You can have a totally wonderful, rewarding adult gay life. A lot of gay kids don’t know that. You wish you could tell him that it gets better and that was the phrase rattling around in my head."&lt;ref name="rothaus" /&gt;

Savage's initial goal was to compile 100 videos.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; By February 2011, approximately 10,000 people had submitted videos, which were watched 30 million times on video sharing websites, including [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="rothaus" /&gt; Video submissions included a speech addressed to youth from the [[President of the United States]], as well as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="rothaus" /&gt; [[The Trevor Project]], an organization which provides services to LGBT youth, noted that after the foundation of the It Gets Better Project, the group saw a 50% increase in telephone calls to their [[suicide hotline]].&lt;ref name="colgate" /&gt; Contributors to the book wrote essays after receiving inspiration from the It Gets Better Project.&lt;ref name="rothaus" /&gt; Savage donated his profits from the book to charitable organizations dedicated to assisting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender young people.&lt;ref name="betterself"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=March 20, 2011|title=His 'Better' self|first=Mike|last=Thomas|page=1|publisher= Chicago Sun-Times, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Savage writes of his own life in the book, "Eight years after coming out, I would stumble into a rewarding and unlikely career as a sex-advice columnist, of all things, and somehow leverage that into a side gig as a potty-mouthed political pundit. And fifteen years after coming out, I would adopt a son with the love of my life — the man I would marry — and, with him at my side, present my parents with a new grandchild, my siblings with a new nephew."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; He emphasizes the positive nature of his life in reflection on his past experiences, "Things didn't just get better for me. All of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender adults I knew were leading rich and rewarding lives. We weren't the same people and we didn't have or want the same things — gay or straight, not everyone wants kids or marriage; people pursue happiness in different ways — but we all had so much to be thankful for, and so much to look forward to. Our lives weren't perfect; there was pain, heartbreak, and struggle. But our lives were better. Our lives were joyful."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

[[Civil rights]] activist [[Urvashi Vaid]] writes in the book, "The only reason big changes happen is when people like you and me decide to fight for things to change, when we take action to make things different. ... Social activism is all about optimism, even when you lose. The process of doing something about it all ... makes you feel better, like a sweaty dance to music you love."&lt;ref name="inthesetimes"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[In These Times]]|title=Action makes it better|volume=35|issue=4|date=April 2011|page=50|issn=0160-5992|publisher=Institute for Public Affairs, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical student Jake Kleinman contributed an essay, "From Scared to Proud: The Journey of a Gay Medical Student", about his experiences which led to his decision to [[coming out|come out to his friends]] whilst a senior at [[Colgate University]].&lt;ref name="colgate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colgate grad contributes to book that aims to help gay teens|date=April 10, 2011|first=Laura T.|last=Ryan|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|work=[[The Post-Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

24-year-old Taylor Bailey of [[Denton, Texas]] wrote of his experiences during seventh grade, and his period of depression when he contemplated suicide: "The thing that really saved me was my sister - my little sister. She was only about two or three at the time and I loved her so much. She was my biggest fan. And she's who I would think about when I thought about killing myself.

'''Jan H. Blits''' (born April 6, 1943) is an American educational researcher and professor emeritus in the [[University of Delaware]] School of Education. He is also the president of the [[Delaware]] chapter of the [[National Association of Scholars]] (NAS). He received the Prometheus Award from the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] in 2009, and the [[Jeane Kirkpatrick Academic Freedom Award]] from the [[Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation]] in 2011. He is known for, along with his colleague [[Linda Gottfredson]], helping to expose a controversial Residence Life Program at the University of Delaware in 2007. After critics described the program as "appalling" and an attempt at indoctrination, the program was quickly shut down by the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/NAS_Delaware_Head_Jan_Blits_Keynotes_Tomorrow_at_FIRE_Conference|title=NAS Delaware Head Jan Blits Keynotes Tomorrow at FIRE Conference  |website=National Association of Scholars|date=2011-07-15|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/NAS_Delaware_Affiliate_President_Jan_Blits_Receives_Academic_Freedom_Award|title=NAS Delaware Affiliate President Jan Blits Receives Academic Freedom Award |website=National Association of Scholars|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blits also fought alongside Gottfredson against the University's attempts to ban them from receiving research funding from the [[Pioneer Fund]] in the early 1990s. Ultimately, they were successful in their attempts to be allowed to accept such funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/12397/title/U--Delaware-Reaches-Accord-On-Race-Studies/|date=1992-07-06|title=U.

The '''''Khersones''''' or '''''Chersones''''' is a [[Russia]]n three-mast [[tall ship]], a [[full rigged ship]].  It was built in 1989 in [[Gdańsk Shipyard]], [[Poland]], in a series of six sister ships (among which also the [[STS Mir|Mir]]), after the designs of [[Poland|Polish]] [[Naval architect#The naval architect|naval architect]] [[Zygmunt Choreń]]. The ship is named after the city of [[Chersonesus]] an ancient city and archaeological site near [[Sevastopol]].

Today Khersones was a training ship for the [[Admiral Ushakov Maritime State University]]. She partakes in many [[windjammer]] [[regattas]].&lt;ref name="Benavente"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caphorniers.cl/cuentos/cabo_vela_ING.htm |title=Across the Cape Horn by Sail |accessdate=2008-08-06 |first=Roberto |last=Benavente |date=October 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514094510/http://www.caphorniers.cl/cuentos/cabo_vela_ING.htm |archivedate=2009-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeds SCITT developed as a bottom-up initiative, with its origins in 2002 at a departmental level.  Design technology teachers in two schools initially considered ways of supporting local teacher training and teacher recruitment into their [[curriculum]] area and investigated the [[School Centred Initial Teacher Training]] model.  Subsequently, other schools were approached and the group sought the involvement of [[Leeds Trinity University]], as the regional HEI with whom they had a close working relationship.  The first group of teachers completed the Leeds SCITT programme in July 2005.

== Organisation ==
Leeds SCITT is based on a combination of four lead and a number of associate schools.  Lead schools are responsible for initial subject application tuition and teaching placement training. Associate schools provide opportunities for complementary and contrasting school-based training. The schools in the SCITT include [[denominational school|denominational]] and non-denominational schools; inner-city, suburban and semi-rural; and 11-16 and 11-19 age ranges.  The combination of lead and associate schools enables trainees to work with trainees from diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.

[[File:Herzog1983stand.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Whitey Herzog]] managed the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the 1980s]]

In [[baseball]], the '''field manager''' (commonly referred to as the '''manager''') is the equivalent of a [[head coach]] who is responsible for overseeing and making final decisions on all aspects of on-field team strategy, lineup selection, training and instruction. Managers are typically assisted by a staff of assistant [[coach (baseball)|coaches]] whose responsibilities are specialized. Field managers are typically not involved in off-field personnel decisions or long-term club planning, responsibilities that are instead held by a team's [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]].

== Duties ==
The manager chooses the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]] and [[starting pitcher]] before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game &amp;ndash; among the most significant being those decisions regarding when to bring in a [[relief pitcher]]. How much control a manager takes in a game's strategy varies from manager to manager and from game to game. Some managers control [[pitcher|pitch]] selection, [[baseball positions|defensive positioning]], decisions to [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]], [[stolen base|steal]], [[pitchout|pitch out]], etc., while others designate an assistant coach or a player (often the [[Catcher (baseball)|catcher]]) to make some or all of these decisions. 

Some managers choose to act as their team's [[first base]] or [[third base]] coach while their team is batting in order to more closely communicate with [[baserunning|baserunners]], but most managers delegate this responsibility to an assistant. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches.

== In professional baseball ==
In many cases, a manager is a former professional, semi-professional or college player. A high proportion of current and former managers played the central position of catcher during their playing days, including [[Yogi Berra]], [[Bruce Bochy]], [[Joe Girardi]], [[Mike Scioscia]], [[Joe Torre]], and [[Ned Yost]].

The manager's responsibilities normally are limited to in-game decisions, with off-field roster management and personnel decisions falling to the team's [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]]. The term ''manager'' used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager (essentially equivalent to the head coach in other North American professional sports leagues), while the general manager is often called the GM. This usage dates back to the early days of professional baseball when it was common practice for teams to have just one "manager" on their staff, and where GM duties were performed either by the field manager or (more commonly) by the owner of the team. Some owners (most famously, [[Connie Mack]] of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]) carried out both GM and field managerial duties themselves.

Major League Baseball managers differ from the head coaches of most other professional sports in that they dress in the same uniform as the players and are assigned a jersey number. The wearing of a matching uniform is frequently practiced at other levels of play, as well. The manager may be called "skipper" or "skip" informally by his players.

His theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]].

Mao was the son of a wealthy farmer in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]]. He had a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. He later adopted Marxism–Leninism while working at [[Peking University]], and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), China's civil war resumed after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender]] and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government]], which withdrew to [[Taiwan]].

On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a [[single-party state]] controlled by the CPC. In the following years he solidified his control through [[land reform]]s and through a [[psychological]] victory in the [[Korean War]], as well as through campaigns [[Landlord Classicide under Mao Zedong|against landlords]], people he termed "[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]", and other perceived enemies of the state. In 1957 he launched a campaign known as the [[Great Leap Forward]] that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] to [[Industrial society|industrial]]. This campaign led to the [[Great Chinese Famine|deadliest famine in history]] and the deaths of 20–45 million people between 1958 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bramall|first=Chris|date=December 2011|title=Agency and Famine in China's Sichuan Province, 1958–1962|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s030574101100110x|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=208|pages=990–1008|doi=10.1017/s030574101100110x|issn=0305-7410}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wemheuer|first=Felix|last2=Dikötter|first2=Frank|date=July 2011|title=SITES OF HORROR: MAO'S GREAT FAMINE [with Response]Mao's Great Famine: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958-1962.

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of Mao Zedong}}

===Youth and the Xinhai Revolution: 1893–1911===
Mao Zedong was born on December 26, 1893, in [[Shaoshan]] village, [[Hunan Province]], China.{{sfnm|1a1=Schram|1y=1966|1p=19|2a1=Hollingworth|2y=1985|2p=15|3a1=Pantsov|3a2=Levine|3y=2012|3p=11}} His father, [[Mao Yichang]], was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan. Growing up in rural Hunan, Mao described his father as a stern disciplinarian, who would beat him and his three siblings, the boys [[Mao Zemin|Zemin]] and [[Mao Zetan|Zetan]], as well as an adopted girl, [[Mao Zejian|Zejian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=19–20}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=4–5, 15}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=13–14}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=13–nnb nbvhjbu;bn b'7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's mother, [[Wen Qimei]], was a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude.&lt;ref name="Schram1966 p20 Terrill 1980 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=14, 17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao too became a Buddhist, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years.&lt;ref name="Schram1966 p20 Terrill 1980 11"/&gt; At age 8, Mao was sent to Shaoshan Primary School. Learning the value systems of [[Confucianism]], he later admitted that he didn't enjoy the [[Chinese classics|classical Chinese texts]] preaching Confucian morals, instead favouring popular novels like ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and ''[[Water Margin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=20–21}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=15, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, Mao finished primary education, and his father united him in an [[arranged marriage]] to the 17-year-old [[Luo Yigu]], thereby uniting their land-owning families. Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic of arranged marriage and temporarily moving away.

While working on his father's farm, Mao read voraciously&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=15}} {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a "political consciousness" from [[Zheng Guanying]]'s booklet which lamented the deterioration of Chinese power and argued for the adoption of [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=12–13}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in history, Mao was inspired by the military prowess and nationalistic fervour of [[George Washington]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=20–21}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political views were shaped by [[Gelaohui]]-led protests which erupted following a famine in [[Changsha]], the capital of Hunan; Mao supported the protesters' demands, but the armed forces suppressed the dissenters and executed their leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famine spread to Shaoshan, where starving peasants seized his father's grain. He disapproved of their actions as morally wrong, but claimed sympathy for their situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, Mao moved to a higher primary school in nearby Dongshan,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was bullied for his peasant background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Mao began middle school in Changsha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=22–23}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary sentiment was strong in the city, where there was widespread animosity towards Emperor [[Puyi]]'s [[absolute monarchy]] and many were advocating [[republicanism]]. The republicans' figurehead was [[Sun Yat-sen]], an American-educated Christian who led the [[Tongmenghui]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Changsha, Mao was influenced by Sun's newspaper, ''The People's Independence'' (''Minli bao''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=27}};{{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for Sun to become president in a school essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=26–27}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=22–24}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a symbol of rebellion against the [[Manchu]] monarch, Mao and a friend cut off their [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] pigtails, a sign of subservience to the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Sun's republicanism, the army rose up across southern China, sparking the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. Changsha's governor fled, leaving the city in republican control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=30–32}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting the revolution, Mao joined the rebel army as a [[private soldier]], but was not involved in fighting. The northern provinces remained loyal to the emperor, and hoping to avoid a civil war, Sun—proclaimed "provisional president" by his supporters—compromised with the monarchist general [[Yuan Shikai]]. The monarchy was abolished, creating the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], but the monarchist Yuan became president. The revolution over, Mao resigned from the army in 1912, after six months as a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Mao discovered [[socialism]] from a newspaper article; proceeding to read pamphlets by [[Jiang Kanghu]], the student founder of the Chinese Socialist Party, Mao remained interested yet unconvinced by the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=34–35}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Normal School of Changsha: 1912–19===
Over the next few years, Mao Zedong enrolled and dropped out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school, an economics school, and the government-run Changsha Middle School.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=35–36}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=22, 25}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying independently, he spent much time in Changsha's library, reading core works of [[classical liberalism]] such as [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Rousseau]], and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=35–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=36–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by [[Friedrich Paulsen]], whose liberal emphasis on individualism led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for the greater good, and that the "end justifies the means" conclusion of [[Consequentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father saw no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, cut off his allowance and forced him to move into a hostel for the destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mao Zedong 1913.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Mao Zedong in 1913]]

Mao desired to become a teacher and enrolled at the Fourth Normal School of Changsha, which soon merged with the First Normal School of Changsha, widely seen as the best in Hunan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=36–37}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Befriending Mao, professor [[Yang Changji]] urged him to read a radical newspaper, ''[[La Jeunesse|New Youth]]'' (''Xin qingnian''), the creation of his friend [[Chen Duxiu]], a dean at [[Peking University]]. Although a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]], Chen argued that China must look to the west to cleanse itself of superstition and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao published his first article in ''New Youth'' in April 1917, instructing readers to increase their physical strength to serve the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Society for the Study of Wang Fuzhi (''Chuan-shan Hsüeh-she''), a revolutionary group founded by Changsha literati who wished to emulate the philosopher [[Wang Fuzhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=40–41}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|pp=30–31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first school year, Mao befriended an older student, [[Xiao Zisheng]]; together they went on a walking tour of Hunan, begging and writing literary couplets to obtain food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=43}}; see also Hsiao Yu (Xiao Yu, alias of Xiao Zisheng). ''Mao Tse-Tung and I Were Beggars.'' (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; A popular student, in 1915 Mao was elected secretary of the Students Society. He organized the Association for Student Self-Government and led protests against school rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=42–43}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1917, he was elected to command the students' volunteer army, set up to defend the school from marauding soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=43}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=49–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly interested in the techniques of war, he took a keen interest in [[World War I]], and also began to develop a sense of solidarity with workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=49–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao undertook feats of physical endurance with Xiao Zisheng and [[Cai Hesen]], and with other young revolutionaries they formed the Renovation of the People Study Society in April 1918 to debate Chen Duxiu's ideas. Desiring personal and societal transformation, the Society gained 70–80 members, many of whom would later join the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=44}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=50–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao graduated in June 1919, ranked third in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early revolutionary activity==
{{Main|Early revolutionary activity of Mao Zedong}}

===Beijing, Anarchism, and Marxism: 1917–19===

Mao moved to [[Beijing]], where his mentor Yang Changji had taken a job at Peking University.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=47, 56–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yang thought Mao exceptionally "intelligent and handsome",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; securing him a job as assistant to the university librarian [[Li Dazhao]], an early Chinese Communist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Li authored a series of ''New Youth'' articles on the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, during which the Communist [[Bolshevik Party]] under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]] had seized power. Lenin was an advocate of the socio-political theory of [[Marxism]], first developed by the German sociologists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], and Li's articles brought an understanding of Marxism to the Chinese revolutionary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=59–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming "more and more radical", Mao was influenced by [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s [[anarchism]], but joined Li's Study Group and "developed rapidly toward Marxism" during the winter of 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=48–49}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=62–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paid a low wage, Mao lived in a cramped room with seven other Hunanese students, but believed that Beijing's beauty offered "vivid and living compensation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=57–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the university, Mao was widely snubbed by other students due to his rural Hunanese accent and lowly position. He joined the university's Philosophy and Journalism Societies and attended lectures and seminars by the likes of [[Chen Duxiu]], [[Hu Shi]], and [[Qian Xuantong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=62, 66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's time in Beijing ended in the spring of 1919, when he travelled to [[Shanghai]] with friends who were preparing to leave for France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=50–52}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not return to Shaoshan, where his mother was terminally ill. She died in October 1919, with her husband dying in January 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Culture and political protests, 1919–20===
On May 4, 1919, students in Beijing gathered at the Gate of Heavenly Peace to protest the Chinese government's weak resistance to Japanese expansion in China. Patriots were outraged at the influence given to Japan in the [[Twenty-One Demands]] in 1915, the complicity of [[Duan Qirui]]'s [[Beiyang Government]], and the betrayal of China in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], wherein Japan was allowed to [[Shandong Problem|receive territories in Shandong]] which had been surrendered by [[German Empire|Germany]]. These demonstrations ignited the nationwide [[May Fourth Movement]] and fueled the [[New Culture Movement]] which blamed China's diplomatic defeats on social and cultural backwardness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=68–70}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Changsha, Mao had begun teaching history at the Xiuye Primary School&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and organizing protests against the pro-Duan Governor of Hunan Province, [[Zhang Jingyao]], popularly known as "Zhang the Venomous" due to his corrupt and violent rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In late May, Mao co-founded the Hunanese Student Association with [[He Shuheng]] and [[Deng Zhongxia]], organizing a student strike for June and in July 1919 began production of a weekly radical magazine, ''Xiang River Review'' (''Xiangjiang pinglun''). Using vernacular language that would be understandable to the majority of China's populace, he advocated the need for a "Great Union of the Popular Masses", strengthened trade unions able to wage non-violent revolution.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} His ideas were not Marxist, but heavily influenced by Kropotkin's concept of [[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|mutual aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=53–54}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=71–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beijing students protesting the Treaty of Versailles (May 4, 1919).jpg|thumb|Students in Beijing rallied during the May Fourth Movement.]]

Zhang banned the Student Association, but Mao continued publishing after assuming editorship of the liberal magazine ''New Hunan'' (''Xin Hunan'') and offered articles in popular local newspaper ''Justice'' (''Ta Kung Po''). Several of these advocated [[feminism|feminist]] views, calling for the liberation of women in Chinese society; Mao was influenced by his forced arranged-marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=55}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=76–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1919, Mao helped organise a general strike in Hunan, securing some concessions, but Mao and other student leaders felt threatened by Zhang, and Mao returned to Beijing, visiting the terminally ill Yang Changji.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=55–56}}; {{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao found that his articles had achieved a level of fame among the revolutionary movement, and set about soliciting support in overthrowing Zhang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Coming across newly translated Marxist literature by Thomas Kirkup, [[Karl Kautsky]], and Marx and Engels—notably ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''—he came under their increasing influence, but was still eclectic in his views.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=81–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao visited Tianjin, [[Jinan]], and [[Qufu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to Shanghai, where he worked as a laundryman and met [[Chen Duxiu]], noting that Chen's adoption of Marxism "deeply impressed me at what was probably a critical period in my life". In Shanghai, Mao met an old teacher of his, [[Yi Peiji]], a revolutionary and member of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), or Chinese Nationalist Party, which was gaining increasing support and influence. Yi introduced Mao to General [[Tan Yankai]], a senior KMT member who held the loyalty of troops stationed along the Hunanese border with Guangdong. Tan was plotting to overthrow Zhang, and Mao aided him by organizing the Changsha students. In June 1920, Tan led his troops into Changsha, and Zhang fled. In the subsequent reorganization of the provincial administration, Mao was appointed headmaster of the junior section of the First Normal School. Now receiving a large income, he married Yang Kaihui in the winter of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=56–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding the Communist Party of China: 1921–22===
[[File:Location of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Xintiandi Shanghai July 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Location of the first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921, in [[Xintiandi]], former [[French Concession]], Shanghai]]

The [[Communist Party of China]] was founded by Chen Duxiu and [[Li Dazhao]] in the [[French concession]] of Shanghai in 1921 as a study society and informal network. Mao set up a Changsha branch, also establishing a branch of the Socialist Youth Corps. Opening a bookstore under the control of his new Cultural Book Society, its purpose was to propagate revolutionary literature throughout Hunan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=23, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in the movement for Hunan autonomy, in the hope that a Hunanese constitution would increase [[civil liberty|civil liberties]] and make his revolutionary activity easier. When the movement was successful in establishing provincial autonomy under a new warlord, Mao forgot his involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=63–64}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=23–24, 28, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1921, small Marxist groups existed in Shanghai, Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Jinan; it was decided to hold a central meeting, which began in Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The first session of the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China]] was attended by 13 delegates, Mao included. After the authorities sent a police spy to the congress, the delegates moved to a boat on South Lake near [[Jiaxing]], in Zhejiang, to escape detection. Although Soviet and [[Comintern]] delegates attended, the first congress ignored Lenin's advice to accept a temporary alliance between the Communists and the "bourgeois democrats" who also advocated national revolution; instead they stuck to the orthodox Marxist belief that only the urban proletariat could lead a socialist revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=64–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao was now party secretary for Hunan stationed in Changsha, and to build the party there he followed a variety of tactics.&lt;ref name="Schram1966 p68"&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1921, he founded the Self-Study University, through which readers could gain access to revolutionary literature, housed in the premises of the Society for the Study of [[Wang Fuzhi]], a Qing dynasty Hunanese philosopher who had resisted the Manchus.&lt;ref name="Schram1966 p68"/&gt; He joined the [[Y.C. James Yen#Biography|YMCA]] Mass Education Movement to fight illiteracy, though he edited the textbooks to include radical sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued organizing workers to strike against the administration of Hunan Governor [[Zhao Hengti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet labor issues remained central. The successful and famous [[Anyuan Coal Mine Strike|Anyuan coal mines strikes]] (contrary to later Party historians) depended on both "proletarian" and "bourgeois" strategies. [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Li Lisan]] and Mao not only mobilised the miners, but formed schools and cooperatives and engaged local intellectuals, gentry, military officers, merchants, Red Gang dragon heads and even church clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth J. Perry,[http://apjjf.org/2013/11/1/Elizabeth-Perry/3882/article.html "Anyuan: Mining China's Revolutionary Tradition]," ''The Asia-Pacific Journal'' 11.1 (January 14, 2013), reprinting Ch 2 of Elizabeth J. Perry. ''Anyuan: Mining China's Revolutionary Tradition.'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-520-27189-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao claimed that he missed the July 1922 Second Congress of the Communist Party in Shanghai because he lost the address. Adopting Lenin's advice, the delegates agreed to an alliance with the "bourgeois democrats" of the KMT for the good of the "national revolution". Communist Party members joined the KMT, hoping to push its politics leftward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mao enthusiastically agreed with this decision, arguing for an alliance across China's socio-economic classes. Mao was a vocal anti-imperialist and in his writings he lambasted the governments of Japan, UK and US, describing the latter as "the most murderous of hangmen".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=73–74}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with the Kuomintang: 1922–27===
[[File:Chairman Mao-1.webm|thumb|Mao giving speeches to the masses]]

At the Third Congress of the Communist Party in Shanghai in June 1923, the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to working with the KMT. Supporting this position, Mao was elected to the Party Committee, taking up residence in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the First KMT Congress, held in [[Guangzhou]] in early 1924, Mao was elected an alternate member of the KMT Central Executive Committee, and put forward four resolutions to decentralise power to urban and rural bureaus. His enthusiastic support for the KMT earned him the suspicion of Li Li-san, his Hunan comrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=76–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1924, Mao returned to Shaoshan, perhaps to recuperate from an illness. He found that the peasantry were increasingly restless and some had seized land from wealthy landowners to found communes. This convinced him of the revolutionary potential of the peasantry, an idea advocated by the KMT leftists but not the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to [[Guangzhou]] to run the 6th term of the KMT's [[Peasant Movement Training Institute at Guangzhou|Peasant Movement Training Institute]] from May to September 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |p=465 |last=Mao |first=Zedong |authormask=Mao Zedong |editor-last=Schram |editor-first=Stuart Reynolds |editor2=Nancy Jane Hodes |display-editors=1 |ref={{harvid|Schram &amp; al.|1992}} |series=''Mao's Road to Power'', Vol. II |title=National Revolution and Social Revolution, December 1920 – June 1927 |publisher=M.E.

The Peasant Movement Training Institute under Mao trained cadre and prepared them for militant activity, taking them through military training exercises and getting them to study basic left-wing texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=82, 90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1925, Mao fled to [[Guangzhou]] after his revolutionary activities attracted the attention of Zhao's regional authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When party leader Sun Yat-sen died in May 1925, he was succeeded by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who moved to marginalise the left-KMT and the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=84,89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao nevertheless supported Chiang's [[National Revolutionary Army]], who embarked on the [[Northern Expedition]] attack in 1926 on warlords.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=87, 92–93}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this expedition, peasants rose up, appropriating the land of the wealthy landowners, who were in many cases killed. Such uprisings angered senior KMT figures, who were themselves landowners, emphasizing the growing class and ideological divide within the revolutionary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1927, Mao appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing [[Wang Jingwei]] leader. There, Mao played an active role in the discussions regarding the peasant issue, defending a set of "Regulations for the Repression of Local Bullies and Bad Gentry", which advocated the death penalty or life imprisonment for anyone found guilty of [[counter-revolution]]ary activity, arguing that in a revolutionary situation, "peaceful methods cannot suffice".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1927, Mao was appointed to the KMT's five-member Central Land Committee, urging peasants to refuse to pay rent. Mao led another group to put together a "Draft Resolution on the Land Question", which called for the confiscation of land belonging to "local bullies and bad gentry, corrupt officials, militarists and all counter-revolutionary elements in the villages". Proceeding to carry out a "Land Survey", he stated that anyone owning over 30 ''mou'' (four and a half acres), constituting 13% of the population, were uniformly counter-revolutionary. He accepted that there was great variation in revolutionary enthusiasm across the country, and that a flexible policy of land redistribution was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting his conclusions at the Enlarged Land Committee meeting, many expressed reservations, some believing that it went too far, and others not far enough. Ultimately, his suggestions were only partially implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh from the success of the Northern Expedition against the warlords, Chiang turned on the Communists, who by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China. Chiang ignored the orders of the Wuhan-based left KMT government and marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by Communist militias. As the Communists awaited Chiang's arrival, he loosed the [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]], massacring 5000 with the aid of the [[Green Gang]].&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=106}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Beijing, 19 leading Communists were killed by [[Zhang Zuolin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=106–109, 112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p62"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; That May, tens of thousands of Communists and those suspected of being communists were killed, and the CPC lost approximately {{formatnum:15000}} of its {{formatnum:25000}} members.&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p62"/&gt;

The CPC continued supporting the Wuhan KMT government, a position Mao initially supported,&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p62"/&gt; but by the time of the CPC's Fifth Congress he had changed his mind, deciding to stake all hope on the peasant militia.&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p63"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question was rendered moot when the Wuhan government expelled all Communists from the KMT on July 15.&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p63"/&gt; The CPC founded the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army of China, better known as the "[[History of the People's Liberation Army#From the founding of the People's Liberation Army to the Korean War|Red Army]]", to battle Chiang. A battalion led by General [[Zhu De]] was ordered to take the city of [[Nanchang]] on August 1, 1927, in what became known as the [[Nanchang Uprising]]. They were initially successful, but were forced into retreat after five days, marching south to [[Shantou]], and from there they were driven into the wilderness of [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p63"/&gt; Mao was appointed commander-in-chief of the Red Army and led four regiments against Changsha in the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]], in the hope of sparking peasant uprisings across Hunan. On the eve of the attack, Mao composed a poem—the earliest of his to survive—titled "Changsha". His plan was to attack the KMT-held city from three directions on September 9, but the Fourth Regiment deserted to the KMT cause, attacking the Third Regiment. Mao's army made it to Changsha, but could not take it; by September 15, he accepted defeat and with 1000 survivors marched east to the [[Jinggang Mountains]] of [[Jiangxi]].&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p64"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=122–125}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung Chang and Jon Halliday claim that the uprising was in fact sabotaged by Mao to allow him to prevent a group of KMT soldiers from defecting to any other CPC leader.&lt;ref name="ChangHalliday"&gt;Chang, Halliday; Mao, Chapt.5&lt;/ref&gt; Chang and Halliday also claim that Mao talked the other leaders (including Russian diplomats at the Soviet consulate in Changsha who, Chang and Halliday claim, had been controlling much of the CPC activity) into striking only at Changsha, then abandoning it. Chang and Halliday report a view sent to Moscow by the secretary of the Soviet Consulate in Changsha that the retreat was "the most despicable treachery and cowardice."&lt;ref name="ChangHalliday" /&gt;

The CPC Central Committee, hiding in Shanghai, expelled Mao from their ranks and from the Hunan Provincial Committee, as punishment for his "military opportunism", for his focus on rural activity, and for being too lenient with "bad gentry". They nevertheless adopted three policies he had long championed: the immediate formation of [[Workers' council]]s, the confiscation of all land without exemption, and the rejection of the KMT. Mao's response was to ignore them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established a base in [[Jinggangshan City]], an area of the Jinggang Mountains, where he united five villages as a self-governing state, and supported the confiscation of land from rich landlords, who were "re-educated" and sometimes executed. He ensured that no massacres took place in the region, and pursued a more lenient approach than that advocated by the Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=130}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=67–68}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proclaimed that "Even the lame, the deaf and the blind could all come in useful for the revolutionary struggle", he boosted the army's numbers,&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p69"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating two groups of bandits into his army, building a force of around {{formatnum:1800}} troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=126–127}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; He laid down rules for his soldiers: prompt obedience to orders, all confiscations were to be turned over to the government, and nothing was to be confiscated from poorer peasants.

In spring 1928, the Central Committee ordered Mao's troops to southern Hunan, hoping to spark peasant uprisings. Mao was skeptical, but complied. They reached Hunan, where they were attacked by the KMT and fled after heavy losses. Meanwhile, KMT troops had invaded Jinggangshan, leaving them without a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=131}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wandering the countryside, Mao's forces came across a CPC regiment led by General [[Zhu De]] and [[Lin Biao]]; they united, and attempted to retake Jinggangshan. They were initially successful, but the KMT counter-attacked, and pushed the CPC back; over the next few weeks, they fought an entrenched guerrilla war in the mountains.&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p70"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=128, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee again ordered Mao to march to south Hunan, but he refused, and remained at his base. Contrastingly, Zhu complied, and led his armies away. Mao's troops fended the KMT off for 25 days while he left the camp at night to find reinforcements. He reunited with the decimated Zhu's army, and together they returned to Jinggangshan and retook the base. There they were joined by a defecting KMT regiment and [[Peng Dehuai]]'s Fifth Red Army. In the mountainous area they were unable to grow enough crops to feed everyone, leading to food shortages throughout the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=133–137}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 50"&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jiangxi Soviet Republic of China: 1929–1934===

In January 1929, Mao and Zhu evacuated the base with 2,000 men and a further 800 provided by Peng, and took their armies south, to the area around [[Tonggu County|Tonggu]] and [[Xinfeng County, Jiangxi|Xinfeng]] in [[Jiangxi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=138}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evacuation led to a drop in morale, and many troops became disobedient and began thieving; this worried [[Li Lisan]] and the Central Committee, who saw Mao's army as ''[[lumpenproletariat]]'', that were unable to share in proletariat [[class consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=138, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p72"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with orthodox Marxist thought, Li believed that only the urban proletariat could lead a successful revolution, and saw little need for Mao's peasant guerrillas; he ordered Mao to disband his army into units to be sent out to spread the revolutionary message. Mao replied that while he concurred with Li's theoretical position, he would not disband his army nor abandon his base.&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Li and Mao saw the Chinese revolution as the key to [[world revolution]], believing that a CPC victory would spark the overthrow of global imperialism and capitalism. In this, they disagreed with the official line of the Soviet government and Comintern. Officials in Moscow desired greater control over the CPC and removed Li from power by calling him to Russia for an inquest into his errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=146–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p75"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 51"&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; They replaced him with Soviet-educated Chinese Communists, known as the "[[28 Bolsheviks]]", two of whom, [[Bo Gu]] and [[Zhang Wentian]], took control of the Central Committee. Mao disagreed with the new leadership, believing they grasped little of the Chinese situation, and he soon emerged as their key rival.&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p75"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mao1931.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mao in 1931]]

In February 1930, Mao created the Southwest Jiangxi Provincial Soviet Government in the region under his control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, he suffered emotional trauma after his wife and sister were captured and beheaded by KMT general He Jian.&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schram1966 p153"&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao then married [[He Zizhen]], an 18-year-old revolutionary who bore him five children over the following nine years.&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 51"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schram p208"/&gt; Facing internal problems, members of the Jiangxi Soviet accused him of being too moderate, and hence anti-revolutionary. In December, they tried to overthrow Mao, resulting in the [[Futian incident]], during which Mao's loyalists tortured many and executed between 2000 and 3000 dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p76"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPC Central Committee moved to Jiangxi which it saw as a secure area. In November it proclaimed Jiangxi to be the [[Soviet Republic of China]], an independent Communist-governed state. Although he was proclaimed Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Mao's power was diminished, as his control of the Red Army was allocated to [[Zhou Enlai]]. Meanwhile, Mao recovered from [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p77"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=154–155}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KMT armies adopted a policy of [[Encirclement Campaigns|encirclement and annihilation]] of the Red armies. Outnumbered, Mao responded with guerrilla tactics influenced by the works of ancient military strategists like [[Sun Tzu]], but Zhou and the new leadership followed a policy of open confrontation and conventional warfare. In doing so, the Red Army successfully defeated [[First Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|the first]] and [[Second Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|second encirclements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=155–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p78"&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angered at his armies' failure, Chiang Kai-shek personally arrived to lead the operation. He too faced setbacks and retreated to deal with the [[Mukden Incident|further Japanese incursions into China]].&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p77"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=161–165}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the KMT's change of focus to the defence of China against Japanese expansionism, the Red Army was able to expand its area of control, eventually encompassing a population of 3 million.&lt;ref name="Carter1976 p78"/&gt; Mao proceeded with his land reform program. In November 1931 he announced the start of a "land verification project" which was expanded in June 1933. He also orchestrated education programs and implemented measures to increase female political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=166–168}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang viewed the Communists as a greater threat than the Japanese and returned to Jiangxi, where he initiated the [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|fifth encirclement campaign]], which involved the construction of a concrete and barbed wire "wall of fire" around the state, which was accompanied by aerial bombardment, to which Zhou's tactics proved ineffective. Trapped inside, morale among the Red Army dropped as food and medicine became scarce. The leadership decided to evacuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=175–177}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=80–81}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Long March: 1934–1935===
On October 14, 1934, the Red Army broke through the KMT line on the Jiangxi Soviet's south-west corner at Xinfeng with {{formatnum:85000}} soldiers and {{formatnum:15000}} party cadres and embarked on the "[[Long March]]". In order to make the escape, many of the wounded and the ill, as well as women and children, were left behind, defended by a group of guerrilla fighters whom the KMT massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=180}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{formatnum:100000}} who escaped headed to southern Hunan, first crossing the [[Xiang River]] after heavy fighting,&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 57"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=180–181}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the [[Wu River (Yuan River, north)|Wu River]], in [[Guizhou]] where they took [[Zunyi]] in January 1935. Temporarily resting in the city, they [[Zunyi Conference|held a conference]]; here, Mao was elected to a position of leadership, becoming Chairman of [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|the Politburo]], and ''de facto'' leader of both Party and Red Army, in part because his candidacy was supported by Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]]. Insisting that they operate as a guerrilla force, he laid out a destination: the Shenshi Soviet in [[Shaanxi]], Northern China, from where the Communists could focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao believed that in focusing on the anti-imperialist struggle, the Communists would earn the trust of the Chinese people, who in turn would renounce the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=181}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=84–86}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Zunyi, Mao led his troops to [[Loushan Pass]], where they faced armed opposition but successfully crossed the river. Chiang flew into the area to lead his armies against Mao, but the Communists outmanoeuvred him and crossed the [[Jinsha River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=183}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the more difficult task of crossing the [[Tatu River]], they managed it by fighting a battle over the [[Luding Bridge]] in May, taking [[Luding County|Luding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=184–186}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=88–90}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marching through the mountain ranges around [[Ma'anshan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Moukung, Western Szechuan, they encountered the {{formatnum:50000}}-strong CPC Fourth Front Army of [[Zhang Guotao]], and together proceeded to Maoerhkai and then [[Gansu]]. Zhang and Mao disagreed over what to do; the latter wished to proceed to Shaanxi, while Zhang wanted to retreat east to [[Tibet]] or [[Sikkim]], far from the KMT threat. It was agreed that they would go their separate ways, with [[Zhu De]] joining Zhang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=186}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=91–92}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's forces proceeded north, through hundreds of kilometres of [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland|Grasslands]], an area of quagmire where they were attacked by [[Manchu people|Manchu tribesman]] and where many soldiers succumbed to famine and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|pp=187–188}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 61"&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally reaching [[Shaanxi]], they fought off both the KMT and an Islamic cavalry militia before crossing the [[Min Mountains]] and Mount Liupan and reaching the Shenshi Soviet; only 7-8000 had survived.&lt;ref name="Feigon 2002 61"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schram|1966|p=188}}; {{harvnb|Carter|1976|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Long March cemented Mao's status as the dominant figure in the party. In November 1935, he was named chairman of the Military Commission.

===Resuming civil war: 1940–1949===
In 1944, the Americans sent a special diplomatic envoy, called the [[Dixie Mission]], to the Communist Party of China. According to Edwin Moise, in ''Modern China: A History 2nd Edition'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most of the Americans were favourably impressed. The CPC seemed less corrupt, more unified, and more vigorous in its resistance to Japan than the KMT. United States fliers shot down over North China&amp;nbsp;... confirmed to their superiors that the CPC was both strong and popular over a broad area. In the end, the contacts with the USA developed with the CPC led to very little.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the end of World War II, the U.S. continued their military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and his KMT government forces against the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) led by Mao Zedong during the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]]. Likewise, the [[Soviet Union]] gave quasi-covert support to Mao by their occupation of north east China, which allowed the PLA to move in en masse and take large supplies of arms left by the Japanese's [[Kwantung Army]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

To enhance the Red Army's military operations, Mao as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China, named his close associate General [[Zhu De]] to be its Commander-in-Chief.

In 1948, under direct orders from Mao, the People's Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying the city of [[Changchun]]. At least {{formatnum:160000}} civilians are believed to have perished during [[Siege of Changchun|the siege]], which lasted from June until October. PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, who documented the siege in his book ''[[White Snow, Red Blood]]'', compared it to [[Hiroshima]]: "The casualties were about the same.

==Leadership of China==
[[File:Mao Proclaiming New China.JPG|thumb|left|Mao Zedong declares the founding of the modern People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949.]]

The People's Republic of China was established on October 1, 1949. It was the culmination of over two decades of civil and international wars. Mao's famous phrase "The Chinese people have stood up" ({{zh|c=中國人民從此站起來了}}) associated with the establishment of the People's Republic of China was not used in the speech he delivered from the [[Tiananmen|Gate of Heavenly Peace]] on October 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote = The phrase is often mistakenly said to have been delivered during the speech from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, but was first used on September 21, at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, then repeated on several occasions | editor = Cheek T | title = Mao Zedong and China's Revolutions: A Brief History with Documents | location = New York | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | year = 2002 | page = 125 | isbn = 0-312-25626-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao took up residence in [[Zhongnanhai]], a compound next to the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing, and there he ordered the construction of an indoor swimming pool and other buildings. Mao's physician [[Li Zhisui]] described him as conducting business either in bed or by the side of the pool, preferring not to wear formal clothes unless absolutely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|1994|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li's book, ''[[The Private Life of Chairman Mao]]'', is regarded as controversial, especially by those sympathetic to Mao.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, {{cite book |title= Manufacturing History: Sex, Lies and Random House's Memoirs of Mao's Physician |editors= DeBorja, Q.M. and Xu L.

In October 1950, Mao made the decision to send the [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA), a special unit of the [[People's Liberation Army]], into the [[Korean war|war in Korea]] and fight as well as to reinforce the armed forces of North Korea, the [[Korean People's Army]], which had been in full retreat. Historical records showed that Mao directed the PVA campaigns to the minutest details. As the Chairman of the CPC's Central Military Commission (CMC), he was also the Supreme Commander in Chief of the PLA and the People's Republic and Chairman of the ruling CPC. The PVA was under the overall command of then newly installed Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], with General [[Peng Dehuai]] as field commander and political commissar.&lt;ref name="Burkitt"&gt;{{Cite book

During the [[Landlord Classicide under Mao Zedong|land reform, a significant numbers of landlords and well-to-do peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings]] organised by the Communist Party as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants, which significantly reduced [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2001|pp=436–437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0-691-16502-8 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|page=226|quote= "In Zhangzhuangcun, in the more thoroughly reformed north of the country, most "landlords" and "rich peasants" had lost all their land and often their lives or had fled.

The Mao government is generally credited with eradicating both consumption and production of [[opium]] during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform.{{Citation needed| reason=who conducted a survey that concludes "generally credited"?| date=August 2013}} Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops.

Starting in 1951, Mao initiated two successive movements in an effort to rid urban areas of corruption by targeting wealthy capitalists and political opponents, known as the [[three-anti/five-anti campaigns]]. Whereas the three-anti campaign was a focused purge of government, industrial and party officials, the five-anti campaign set its sights slightly broader, targeting capitalist elements in general.&lt;ref&gt;John Fairbank and Merle Goldman, ''China: A New History'', (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2002), 349.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses, and children informed on their parents; the victims were often humiliated at [[Struggle Session|struggle sessions]], a method designed to intimidate and terrify people to the maximum. Mao insisted that minor offenders be criticised and reformed or sent to labour camps, "while the worst among them should be shot". These campaigns took several hundred thousand additional lives, the vast majority via suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mao Zedong sitting.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Photo of Mao Zedong sitting, published in "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung", ca. 1955]]

Following the consolidation of power, Mao launched the First [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] (1953–1958), which aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become a world power. With the [[Soviet Union]]'s assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell{{clarify|date=May 2016}} to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] in 1958. Mao also launched a phase of rapid [[collectivization]]. The CPC introduced price controls as well as a [[Simplified Chinese character|Chinese character simplification]] aimed at increasing literacy. Large-scale industrialization projects were also undertaken.

Programs pursued during this time include the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], in which Mao indicated his supposed willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed. Given the freedom to express themselves, liberal and intellectual Chinese began opposing the Communist Party and questioning its leadership. This was initially tolerated and encouraged. After a few months, however, Mao's government reversed its policy and persecuted those who had criticised the party, totaling perhaps {{formatnum:500000}},{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} as well as those who were merely alleged to have been critical, in what is called the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]]. Authors such as [[Jung Chang]] have alleged that the Hundred Flowers Campaign was merely a ruse to root out "dangerous" thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Li Zhisui, Mao's physician, suggested that Mao had initially seen the policy as a way of weakening opposition to him within the party and that he was surprised by the extent of criticism and the fact that it came to be directed at his own leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|1994|pp=198, 200, 468–469}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only then that he used it as a method of identifying and subsequently persecuting those critical of his government. The Hundred Flowers movement led to the condemnation, silencing, and death of many citizens, also linked to Mao's Anti-Rightist Movement, resulting in deaths possibly in the millions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Great Leap Forward===
{{Main|Great Leap Forward}}
[[File:Nikita Khrushchev, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh and Soong Ching-ling.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Soong Ching-ling]] during a state dinner in Beijing, 1959]]

In January 1958, Mao launched the second [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]], known as the [[Great Leap Forward]], a plan intended as an alternative model for economic growth to the Soviet model focusing on heavy industry that was advocated by others in the party. Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.

Under the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. The combined effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.&lt;ref name="Spence1999 p553"&gt;{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;!-- Book has only 188 pages, so page 553 does not look right --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based upon the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of that fictitious harvest for state use, primarily for use in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that rural peasants were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. The famine was a direct cause of the death of some 30 million Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The extent of Mao's knowledge of the severity of the situation has been disputed. Mao's physician believed that he may have been unaware of the extent of the famine, partly due to a reluctance to criticise his policies, and the willingness of his staff to exaggerate or outright fake reports regarding food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|1994|pp=283–4, 295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning of the extent of the starvation, Mao vowed to stop eating meat, an action followed by his staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|1994|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong-based historian [[Frank Dikötter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/opinion/16iht-eddikotter16.html | title=Mao's Great Leap to Famine | author=Dikötter, Frank | newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the notion that Mao did not know about the famine throughout the country until it was too late:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea that the state mistakenly took too much grain from the countryside because it assumed that the harvest was much larger than it was is largely a myth—at most partially true for the autumn of 1958 only. In most cases the party knew very well that it was starving its own people to death. At a secret meeting in the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai dated March 25, 1959, Mao specifically ordered the party to procure up to one third of all the grain, much more than had ever been the case. At the meeting he announced that "To distribute resources evenly will only ruin the Great Leap Forward. When there is not enough to eat, people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill."&lt;ref name=Dikottersite&gt;{{cite web|title=Famine 2|url=http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|website=web.mac.com|accessdate=28 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809001243/http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|archivedate=August 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jasper|title=A utopian nightmare|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/8659581/a-utopian-nightmare/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Emeritus Thomas P. Bernstein of [[Columbia University]] offered his view on Mao's statement on starvation in the March 25, 1959, meeting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some scholars believe that this shows Mao's readiness to accept mass death on an immense scale. My own view is that this is an instance of Mao's use of hyperbole, another being his casual acceptance of death of half the population during a nuclear war. In other contexts, Mao did not in fact accept mass death. Zhou's Chronology shows that in October 1958, Mao expressed real concern that 40,000 people in Yunnan had starved to death (p. 173). Shortly after the March 25 meeting, he worried about 25.2 million people who were at risk of starvation.&lt;ref name="wilfulness"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas P.|first1=Bernstein|title=Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness|journal=The China Quarterly|date=June 2006|volume=186|pages=421–445|doi=10.1017/S0305741006000221|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/20192620?sid=21105082252081&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739808|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But from late summer on, Mao essentially forgot about this issue, until, as noted, the "Xinyang Incident" came to light in October 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Thomas P.|title=Book Reviews: Zhou Xun (ed), The Great Famine in China, 1958–1962: A Documentary History|journal=China Perspectives|volume=2013/2|issue=Real Estate Speculation and its Social Consequences|url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/6196|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:People's commone canteen3.jpg|thumb|Early in the Great Leap Forward, commune members were encouraged to eat their fill in communal canteens,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dikötter|2010|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later many canteens shut down as they ran out of food and fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dikötter|2010|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the article "Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness", published in 2006 in ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', Professor Thomas P. Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths. At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of "production at the expense of livelihood." While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed. After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned. Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them. Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price. Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals.&lt;ref name="wilfulness" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that [[rightists]] and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,&lt;ref name="Becker81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead launched a series of "anti-grain concealment" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the cause of the disaster, Mao lost esteem among many of the top party cadres. He was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, and he lost political power to moderate leaders such as [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Mao, however, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.

The Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the "Conference of the Seven Thousand", State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.&lt;ref name="Chang"/&gt; Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Consequences===
[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], Beijing, 1972]]

At the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as "right opportunists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,&lt;ref name="Yang Jisheng"/&gt; exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.&lt;ref name="Becker81"/&gt;

Censuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958–61, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths, as given by [[Hu Yaobang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.&lt;ref name="Yang Jisheng"&gt;Mark O'Neill.

===Split from Soviet Union===
{{Main|Sino-Soviet split}}
[[File:Kissinger, Ford and Mao, 1975 A7912.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] watches as Henry Kissinger shakes hands with Mao during their visit to China, December 2, 1975]]

On the international front, the period was dominated by the further isolation of China. The [[Sino-Soviet split]] resulted in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s withdrawal of all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of [[world communism]]. The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out for local control of the left in numerous countries.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Scalapino, "Sino-Soviet Competition in Africa", ''Foreign Affairs'' (1964) 42#4 pp. 640–654 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20029719 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz M. Lüthi argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement. The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorenz M. Lüthi|title=The Sino-Soviet Split: Cold War in the Communist World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dl4TRDxqexMC|year=2010|publisher=Princeton UP|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The split resulted from [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s more moderate Soviet leadership after the death of Stalin in March 1953. Only [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] openly sided with China, thereby forming an alliance between the two countries which would last until after Mao's death in 1976. Warned that the Soviets had nuclear weapons, Mao minimized the threat. Becker says that "Mao believed that the bomb was a 'paper tiger', declaring to Khrushchev that it would not matter if China lost 300 million people in a nuclear war: the other half of the population would survive to ensure victory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jasper|last=Becker|title=The Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyGtw4cXJjMC&amp;pg=PA271|year=2002|publisher=Oxford UP|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin had established himself as the successor of "correct" Marxist thought well before Mao controlled the [[Communist Party of China]], and therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps because of seniority) that the leadership of Marxist doctrine would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favoured Soviets were now denounced as "revisionists" and listed alongside "American imperialism" as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Partly surrounded by hostile American military bases (in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]]), China was now confronted with a new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat from the north and west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of the People's Republic were in hostile confrontation with each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution===
{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}
During the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old ruling elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the "ruling class" and keep China in a state of "perpetual revolution" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power as China's head of state and government but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role as Chairman of the Communist Party of China, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalise Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966. Some scholars, such as [[Mobo Gao]], claim the case for this is overstated.&lt;ref&gt;For a full treatment of this idea, see {{Harvnb|Gao|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Frank Dikötter]], hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Mirsky. [http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/mirsky_09_10.html ''Livelihood Issues.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906144248/http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/mirsky_09_10.html |date=September 6, 2010 }} [[Literary Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that certain liberal bourgeois elements of society continued to threaten the socialist framework, groups of young people known as the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] struggled against authorities at all levels of society and even set up their own tribunals. Chaos reigned in much of the nation, and millions were persecuted. During the Cultural Revolution, nearly all of the schools and universities in China were closed, and the young intellectuals living in cities were ordered to the countryside to be "re-educated" by the peasants, where they performed hard manual labour and other work.

The Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of much of China's traditional cultural heritage and the imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as the creation of general economic and social chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined during this period, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into every part of Chinese life, depicted by such Chinese films as ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'', ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]''. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps millions, perished in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name="maostats"/&gt;

When Mao was informed of such losses, particularly that people had been driven to suicide, he is alleged to have commented: "People who try to commit suicide&amp;nbsp;— don't attempt to save them!&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. China is such a populous nation, it is not as if we cannot do without a few people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacFarquhar|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities allowed the Red Guards to abuse and kill opponents of the regime. Said [[Xie Fuzhi]], national police chief: "Don't say it is wrong of them to beat up bad persons: if in anger they beat someone to death, then so be it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacFarquhar|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in August and September 1966, there were a reported 1,772 people murdered by the Red Guards in Beijing alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacFarquhar|2006|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this period that Mao chose [[Lin Biao]], who seemed to echo all of Mao's ideas, to become his successor. Lin was later officially named as Mao's successor. By 1971, however, a divide between the two men had become apparent. Official history in China states that Lin was planning a military coup or an assassination attempt on Mao. Lin Biao died in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures. The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] described his conversation with [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who told him about a plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organised by the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name="Pacepa0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ= |title=The Kremlin's Killing Ways |author=Ion Mihai Pacepa |work=National Review |date=November 28, 2006 |accessdate=August 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808171854/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ%3D |archivedate=August 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being considered a [[feminist]] figure by some and a supporter of women's rights, documents released by the [[US Department of State]] in 2008 show that Mao declared women to be a "nonsense" in 1973, in conversation with Kissinger, joking that "China is a very poor country. We don't have much. What we have in excess is women... Let them go to your place. They will create disasters. That way you can lessen our burdens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nipa Piboontanasawat|title=China's Mao Offered to Send 10 Million Women to U.S. in 1973|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=atXZLzWsle9Y|accessdate=July 28, 2015|work=Bloomberg|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mao offered 10 million women, Kissinger replied by saying that Mao was "improving his offer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mao offered US 10 million women|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/mao-offered-us-10-million-women/story-e6frg6t6-1111115542823|accessdate=July 28, 2015|work=The Australian|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao and Kissinger then agreed that their comments on women be removed from public records, prompted by a Chinese official who feared that Mao's comments might incur public anger if released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Jackson|title=Papers reveal Mao's view of women|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7243500.stm|accessdate=July 28, 2015|work=BBC News|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Mango fever"====
When Mao first tasted [[mangoes]] in 1968 he was enthused, describing them as a "spiritual time bomb".&lt;ref name="Thuma2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Thuma|title=The Mongo Mango Cookbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqSbC4f7YdoC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2001|publisher=Pineapple Press Inc|isbn=978-1-56164-239-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of his enthusiasm made it to the Pakistani foreign office, and on August 4, 1968, Mao was presented with about 40 mangoes by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Pakistani foreign minister]], [[Sharifuddin Pirzada|Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada]],&lt;!-- Name not mentioned in sources but dates appear to be correct --&gt; in an apparent diplomatic gesture.&lt;ref name="Murck2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfreda Murck|title=Mao's Golden Mangoes and the Cultural Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mymWMQEACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-3-85881-732-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mao had his aide send the box of mangoes to his Mao Zedong Propaganda Team at [[Tsinghua University]] on August 5, the team stationed there to quiet strife among Red Guard factions.&lt;ref name="Walder2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew G.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the afternoon of the fifth, when the great happy news of Chairman Mao giving mangoes to the Capital Worker and Peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team reached the Tsinghua University campus, people immediately gathered around the gift given by the Great Leader Chairman Mao. They cried out enthusiastically and sang with wild abandonment. Tears swelled up in their eyes, and they again and again sincerely wished that our most beloved Great Leader lived then thousand years without bounds ...

Subsequent articles were also written by government officials propagandizing the reception of the mangoes,&lt;ref name="Schrift2001"&gt;{{citation|author=Melissa Schrift|title=Biography of a Chairman Mao Badge: The Creation and Mass Consumption of a Personality Cult|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQFBcWSPRdYC&amp;pg=PA98|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2937-0|pages=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another poem in the ''People's Daily'' said: "Seeing that golden mango/Was as if seeing the great leader Chairman Mao ...

One of the mangoes was sent to the Beijing Textile Factory,&lt;ref name="Walder2015" /&gt; whose revolutionary committee organised a rally in the mangoes' honour.&lt;ref name="Schrift2001" /&gt; Workers read out quotations from Mao and celebrated the gift. Altars were erected to prominently display the fruit; when the mango peel began to rot after a few days, the fruit was peeled and boiled in a pot of water. Workers then filed by and each was given a spoonful of mango water. The revolutionary committee also made a wax replica of the mango, and displayed this as a centrepiece in the factory. There followed several months of "mango fever", as the fruit became a focus of a "boundless loyalty" campaign for Chairman Mao. More replica mangoes were created and the replicas were sent on tour around Beijing and elsewhere in China. Many revolutionary committees visited the mangoes in Beijing from outlying provinces; approximately half a million people greeted the replicas when they arrived in [[Chengdu]]. Badges and wall posters featuring the mangoes and Mao were produced in the millions.&lt;ref name="Walder2015" /&gt; The fruit was shared among all institutions that had been a part of the propaganda team, and large processions were organised in support of the ''zhengui lipin'' ("precious gift"), as the mangoes were known as.&lt;ref name="Leese2011"&gt;{{citation|author=Daniel Leese|title=Mao Cult: Rhetoric and Ritual in China's Cultural Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqjviY6aFloC&amp;pg=PA221|date=October 31, 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49811-1|pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; One dentist in a small village compared a mango to a sweet potato; he was put on trial for malicious slander and executed.&lt;ref name=Moore2013 /&gt;

It has been claimed that Mao used the mangoes to express support for the workers who would go to whatever lengths necessary to end the factional fighting among students, and a "prime example of Mao's strategy of symbolic support".&lt;ref name="Schrift2001" /&gt; Even up until early 1969, participants of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Beijing would return with mass-produced mango [[facsimiles]] and still gain media attention in the provinces.&lt;ref name="Leese2011" /&gt;

====End of the Cultural Revolution====
In 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution to be over, although various historians in and outside of China mark the end of the Cultural Revolution – as a whole or in part – in 1976, following Mao's death and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]].&lt;ref&gt;Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution lasting until 1976:

&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years of his life, Mao was faced with declining health due to either [[Parkinson's disease]]&lt;ref name=Parkinsons /&gt; or, according to his physician, [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]],&lt;ref name=LouGehring /&gt; as well as lung ailments due to smoking and heart trouble.&lt;ref name=KissengerTrans /&gt; Some also attributed Mao's decline in health to the betrayal of Lin Biao. Mao remained passive as various factions within the Communist Party mobilised for the power struggle anticipated after his death.

The Cultural Revolution is often looked at in all scholarly circles as a greatly disruptive period for China. While one-tenth of Chinese people—an estimated 100 million—did suffer during the period,&lt;ref name="Chirot 1996 198"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chirot|1996|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars, such as Lee Feigon and Mobo Gao, claim there were many great advances, and in some sectors the Chinese economy continued to outperform the West.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gao|2008}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}; {{harvnb|Feigon|2002}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hold that the Cultural Revolution period laid the foundation for the spectacular growth that continues in China. During the Cultural Revolution, China detonated its [[Test No. 6|first H-Bomb]] (1967), launched the [[Dong Fang Hong]] satellite (January 30, 1970), commissioned its first nuclear submarines and made various advances in science and technology. Healthcare was free, and living standards in the countryside continued to improve.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In comparison, the Great Leap probably did cause a much larger loss of life with its flawed economic policies which encompassed even the peasants.&lt;ref name="Chirot 1996 198"/&gt;

Estimates of the death toll during the Cultural Revolution, including civilians and Red Guards, vary greatly. An estimate of around 400,000 deaths is a widely accepted minimum figure, according to [[Maurice Meisner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpV7vbvclfgC&amp;pg=PA354#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic |edition= 3rd  |author= Maurice Meisner |page=354 |publisher=Free Press |year= 1999 |isbn=978-0684856353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarquhar and Schoenhals assert that in rural China alone some 36&amp;nbsp;million people were persecuted, of whom between 750,000 and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million were killed, with roughly the same number permanently injured.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', [[Jung Chang]] and [[Jon Halliday]] claim that as many as 3&amp;nbsp;million people died in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jung and Halliday, Jon. ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]].'' [[Jonathan Cape]], London, 2005. p. 569&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Daniel Leese notes that in the 1950s Mao's personality was hardening:
:The impression of Mao's personality that emerges from the literature is disturbing. It reveals a certain temporal development from a down-to-earth leader, who was amicable when uncontested and occasionally reflected on the limits of his power, to an increasingly ruthless and self-indulgent dictator. Mao's preparedness to accept criticism decreased continuously.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leese, "Mao the Man and Mao the Icon" in {{cite book|author=Timothy Cheek, ed.|title=A Critical Introduction to Mao|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ru90WzwzlfYC&amp;pg=PA233|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his leadership, Mao traveled outside China on only two occasions, both state visits to the Soviet Union. When Mao stepped down as head of state on April 27, 1959, further diplomatic state visits and travels abroad were undertaken by president [[Liu Shaoqi]] rather than Mao personally.

Mao's last public appearance—and the last known photograph of him alive—was on May 27, 1976, when he met the visiting Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] during the latter's one-day visit to Beijing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Mao suffered two major heart attacks in 1976, one in March and another in July, before a third struck on September 5, rendering him an invalid. Mao Zedong died nearly four days later just after midnight, at 00:10, on September 9, 1976, at age 82. The Communist Party of China delayed the announcement of his death until 16:00 later that day, when a radio message broadcast across the nation announced the news of Mao's passing while appealing for party unity.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0909.html#article|title=Mao Tse-Tung Dies In Peking At 82; Leader Of Red China Revolution; Choice Of Successor Is Uncertain|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Tiananmen Mao.jpg|thumb|A large portrait of Mao by [[Zhang Zhenshi]] at [[Tiananmen]]]]

Mao remains a controversial figure and there is little agreement over his legacy both in China and abroad. Supporters generally credit and praise him for having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war. He is also credited for having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education. His policies caused the deaths of tens of millions of people in China during his 27-year reign, more than any other 20th century leader; the number of people who died under his regime range from 40 million to as many as 70 million.&lt;ref name="Fenby"/&gt; However, supporters point out that in spite of this, life expectancy improved during his reign. His supporters claim that he rapidly industrialised China; however, others have claimed that his policies such as the "Great Leap Forward" and the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution", were impediments to industrialisation and modernisation. His supporters claim that his policies laid the groundwork for China's later rise to become an economic superpower, while others claim that his policies delayed economic development and that China's economy underwent its rapid growth only after Mao's policies had been widely abandoned. Mao's revolutionary tactics continue to be used by insurgents, and his political ideology continues to be embraced by many Communist organizations around the world.

In mainland China, Mao is still revered by many members and supporters of the Communist Party and respected by the majority of the general population as the "[[List of national founders|Founding Father]] of modern China", credited for giving "the Chinese people dignity and self-respect."&lt;ref name="Biography 2005"&gt;[[Biography (TV series)]] [https://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi3081083673/ Mao Tse Tung: China's Peasant Emperor] [[A&amp;E Network]] 2005, ASIN B000AABKXG {{time needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobo Gao in his 2008 book ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'', credits Mao for raising the average life expectancy from 35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing "unity and stability to a country that had been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions", and laying the foundation for China to "become the equal of the great global powers".&lt;ref name = "MoboGao" /&gt; Gao also lauds Mao for carrying out massive [[land reform]], promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, and positively "transform(ing) Chinese society beyond recognition."&lt;ref name = "MoboGao"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gao|2008|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars outside of China also credit Mao for boosting literacy (only 20% of the population could read in 1949, compared to 65.5% thirty years later), doubling life expectancy, a near doubling of the population, and developing China's industry and infrastructure, paving the way for its position as a world power.&lt;ref name="China 2010, pp. 327"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Galtung|first1=Marte Kjær|last2= Stenslie|first2=Stig|date=2014 |title=49 Myths about China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqqDBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|page=189 |isbn=978-1442236226|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Mao has many Chinese critics, both those who live inside and outside China. Opposition to Mao is subject to restriction and censorship in mainland China, but is especially strong elsewhere, where he is often reviled as a brutish ideologue. In the West, his name is generally associated with tyranny and his economic theories are widely discredited—though to some political activists he remains a symbol against [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]] and western influence. Even in China, key pillars of his economic theory have been largely dismantled by market reformers like [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]], who succeeded him as leaders of the Communist Party.

Though the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which Mao led to power, has rejected in practice the economic fundamentals of much of Mao's ideology, it retains for itself many of the powers established under Mao's reign: it controls the Chinese army, police, courts and media and does not permit multi-party elections at the national or local level, except in Hong Kong. Thus it is difficult to gauge the true extent of support for the Chinese Communist Party and Mao's legacy within mainland China. For its part, the Chinese government continues to officially regard Mao as a national hero. On December 25, 2008, China opened the Mao Zedong Square to visitors in his home town of central Hunan Province to mark the 115th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-12/25/content_7341714.htm |title= Chairman Mao square opened on his 115th birth anniversary |work= [[China Daily]] |date= December 25, 2008 |accessdate= January 2, 2013 }}; {{cite news|title = Mao Zedong still draws crowds on 113th birth anniversary |url= http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200612/27/eng20061227_336033.html |date= December 27, 2006 |accessdate= January 2, 2013 |work= [[People's Daily]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There continue to be disagreements on Mao's legacy. Former Party official Su Shachi, has opined that "he was a great historical criminal, but he was also a great force for good."&lt;ref name="Biography 2005"/&gt; In a similar vein, journalist [[Liu Binyan]] has described Mao as "both monster and a genius."&lt;ref name="Biography 2005"/&gt; Some historians argue that Mao Zedong was "one of the great tyrants of the twentieth century", and a dictator comparable to [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name = "tyrant"&gt;{{Harvnb|MacFarquhar|2006|p=471}}: "''Together with Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler, Mao appears destined to go down in history as one of the great tyrants of the twentieth century''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "compare"&gt;Michael Lynch.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=mCKPmUzKeZUC&amp;pg=PA428 428].&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech to party cadre in 1958, Mao said he had far outdone Qin Shi Huang in his policy against intellectuals: "What did he amount to? He only buried alive 460 scholars, while we buried 46,000. In our suppression of the counter-revolutionaries, did we not kill some counter-revolutionary intellectuals? I once debated with the democratic people: You accuse us of acting like Ch'in-shih-huang, but you are wrong; we surpass him 100 times."&lt;ref&gt;''Mao Zedong sixiang wan sui!'' (1969), p. 195.

{{quote|The People's Republic of China under Mao exhibited the oppressive tendencies that were discernible in all the major absolutist regimes of the twentieth century. There are obvious parallels between Mao's China, [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]].

Others, such as [[Philip Short]], reject such comparisons in ''Mao: A Life'', arguing that whereas the deaths caused by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia were largely systematic and deliberate, the overwhelming majority of the deaths under Mao were unintended consequences of famine.&lt;ref name="short"&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short noted that landlord class were not exterminated as a people due to Mao's belief in redemption through thought reform.&lt;ref name="short"/&gt; He instead compared Mao with 19th-century Chinese reformers who challenged China's traditional beliefs in the era of China's clashes with Western colonial powers. Short argues, "Mao's tragedy and his grandeur were that he remained to the end in thrall to his own revolutionary dreams&amp;nbsp;... He freed China from the straitjacket of its Confucian past, but the bright Red future he promised turned out to be a sterile purgatory.&lt;ref name="short"/&gt;

[[File:Mausoleo de Mao Zedong-Tianang Mei-Pekin-China8452.JPG|thumb|Sculptures in front of the Mausoleum of Mao, [[Beijing]]]]

Mao's English interpreter [[Sidney Rittenberg]] wrote in his memoir ''The Man Who Stayed Behind'' that whilst Mao "was a great leader in history", he was also "a great criminal because, not that he wanted to, not that he intended to, but in fact, his wild fantasies led to the deaths of tens of millions of people."&lt;ref name="Reut09" /&gt; [[Li Rui (Communist Party of China)|Li Rui]], Mao's personal secretary, goes further and claims he was dismissive of the suffering and death caused by his policies: "Mao's way of thinking and governing was terrifying. He put no value on human life. The deaths of others meant nothing to him."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Watts. "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/02/china.jonathanwatts China must confront dark past, says Mao confidant]" ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 832-page biography, ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', [[Jung Chang]] and [[Jon Halliday]] take a very critical view of Mao's life and influence. For example, they note that Mao was well aware that his policies would be responsible for the deaths of millions; While discussing labour-intensive projects such as waterworks and making steel, Mao said to his inner circle in November 1958: "Working like this, with all these projects, half of China may well have to die. If not half, one-third, or one-tenth—50 million—die."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|p=458}} [Chang's source (p.725): *Mao CCRM, vol. 13, pp. 203–4 (E: MacFarquhar et al., pp. 494–5)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Bernstein of [[Columbia University]] argues that this quotation is taken out of context, claiming:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chinese original, however, is not quite as shocking. In the speech, Mao talks about massive earthmoving irrigation projects and numerous big industrial ones, all requiring huge numbers of people. If the projects, he said, are all undertaken simultaneously "half of China's population unquestionably will die; and if it's not half, it'll be a third or ten percent, a death toll of 50 million people." Mao then pointed to the example of Guangxi provincial Party secretary, {{lang|zh-Latn|Chén Mànyuǎn}} ({{lang|zh-hant|陳漫遠}}) who had been dismissed in 1957 for failing to prevent famine in the previous year, adding: "If with a death toll of 50 million you didn't lose your jobs, I at least should lose mine; whether I should lose my head would also be in question. Anhui wants to do so much, which is quite all right, but make it a principle to have no deaths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1017/S0305741006000221 |last= Bernstein |first= Thomas III |title= Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness |journal= [[The China Quarterly]] |volume= 186 |date=July 2006 |pages= 421–445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jasper Becker]] notes, "archive material gathered by Dikötter&amp;nbsp;... confirms that far from being ignorant or misled about the famine, the Chinese leadership were kept informed about it all the time. And he exposes the extent of the violence used against the peasants":&lt;ref&gt;[[Jasper Becker]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mass killings are not usually associated with Mao and the Great Leap Forward, and China continues to benefit from a more favourable comparison with Cambodia or the Soviet Union. But as fresh and abundant archival evidence shows, coercion, terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap, and between 1958 to 1962, by a rough approximation, some 6 to 8 per cent of those who died were tortured to death or summarily killed—amounting to at least 3 million victims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dikötter argues that CPC leaders "glorified violence and were inured to massive loss of life. And all of them shared an ideology in which the end justified the means. In 1962, having lost millions of people in his province, [[Li Jingquan]] compared the Great Leap Forward to the [[Long March]] in which only one in ten had made it to the end: 'We are not weak, we are stronger, we have kept the backbone.'"&lt;ref name="Dikotter299"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dikötter|2010|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the large-scale irrigation projects, Dikötter stresses that, in spite of Mao being in a good position to see the human cost, they continued unabated for several years, and ultimately claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of exhausted villagers. He also notes that "In a chilling precursor of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, villagers in Qingshui and Gansu called these projects the 'killing fields'."&lt;ref name="Dikotter33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dikötter|2010|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mao Zedong, Zhang Yufeng et Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|Mao greets U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] during his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to China in 1972]].]]

The United States placed a trade embargo on the People's Republic as a result of its involvement in the [[Korean War]], lasting until [[Richard Nixon]] decided that developing relations with the PRC would be useful in dealing with the Soviet Union.

The television series [[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] stated: "[Mao] turned China from a feudal backwater into one of the most powerful countries in the World&amp;nbsp;... The Chinese system he overthrew was backward and corrupt; few would argue the fact that he dragged China into the 20th century. But at a cost in human lives that is staggering."&lt;ref name="Biography 2005"/&gt;

In the book ''China in the 21st Century: What Everyone Needs to Know'' published in 2010, Professor [[Jeffrey Wasserstrom|Jeffrey N. Wasserstrom]] of the [[University of California, Irvine]] compares China's relationship to Mao Zedong to Americans' remembrance of [[Andrew Jackson]]: both countries regard the leaders in a positive light, despite their respective roles in devastating policies. Jackson [[Trail of Tears|forcibly moved Native Americans]], resulting in thousands of deaths, while Mao was at the helm during the violent years of the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BOOK REVIEWS: What Everyone Needs to Know about China and Burma|url=http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2010/04/21/what-everyone-needs-to-know-about-china-and-burma/book-reviews/|website=Zocalo Public Square|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though admittedly far from perfect, the comparison is based on the fact that Jackson is remembered both as someone who played a significant role in the development of a political organization (the Democratic Party) that still has many partisans, and as someone responsible for brutal policies toward Native Americans that are now referred to as genocidal.

Both men are thought of as having done terrible things yet this does not necessarily prevent them from being used as positive symbols. And Jackson still appears on $20 bills, even though Americans tend to view as heinous the institution of slavery (of which he was a passionate defender) and the early 19th-century military campaigns against Native Americans (in which he took part).

At times Jackson, for all his flaws, is invoked as representing an egalitarian strain within the American democratic tradition, a self-made man of the people who rose to power via straight talk and was not allied with moneyed interests. Mao stands for something roughly similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some China Book Notes|url=http://mattschiavenza.com/2010/10/08/some-china-book-notes/|website=Matt Schiavenza.com|accessdate=8 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209022723/http://mattschiavenza.com/2010/10/08/some-china-book-notes/|archivedate=February 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao's military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in manners of guerrilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} As an example, the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] followed Mao's examples of guerrilla warfare to considerable political and military success even in the 21st century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Mao's major contribution to the military science is his theory of [[People's War]], with not only guerrilla warfare but more importantly, [[Mobile Warfare]] methodologies. Mao had successfully applied Mobile Warfare in the Korean War, and was able to encircle, push back and then halt the UN forces in Korea, despite the clear superiority of UN firepower.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Mao also gave the impression that he might even welcome a [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1226.html Mao Tse-Tung: Father of Chinese Revolution]". ''The New York Times''. September 10, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us imagine how many people would die if war breaks out. There are 2.7 billion people in the world, and a third could be lost. If it is a little higher, it could be half&amp;nbsp;... I say that if the worst came to the worst and one-half dies, there will still be one-half left, but imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist. After a few years there would be 2.7 billion people again"&lt;ref name="Dikotter13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dikötter|2010|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:MaoStatueinLijang.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Mao in [[Lijiang, Yunnan|Lijiang]]]]

But historians dispute the sincerity of Mao's words. [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] says that Mao "was deadly serious,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Frgm5QodnFoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=editions%3AFrgm5QodnFoC&amp;pg=PA321 ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism.''] [[Harvard University Press]], 2007. p. 321. {{ISBN|0-674-02530-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Frank Dikötter claims that "He was bluffing&amp;nbsp;... the sabre-rattling was to show that he, not Khrushchev, was the more determined revolutionary."&lt;ref name="Dikotter13"/&gt;

Mao's poems and writings are frequently cited by both Chinese and non-Chinese. The official Chinese translation of President [[Barack Obama]]'s inauguration speech used a famous line from one of Mao's poems.&lt;ref&gt;

The ideology of Maoism has influenced many Communists, mainly in the [[Third World]], including revolutionary movements such as [[Cambodia]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jackson Alexander. ''International Maoism in the developing world.'' Praeger, 1999. p 200.; {{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Karl D |title=Cambodia, 1975–1978: Rendezvous with Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02541-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=h27D3EYGwzgC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=Radical+Left-wing+Chinese+Communist+Underpinnings+of+Cambodian+Communism |page=219 |date=March 17, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peru]]'s [[Shining Path]], and the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Nepalese revolutionary movement]]. Under the influence of Mao's agrarian socialism and [[Cultural Revolution]], Cambodia's [[Pol Pot]] conceived of his disastrous [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]] policies which purged the nation of its teachers, artists and intellectuals and emptied its cities, resulting in the [[Cambodian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Biography (TV series)]]: Pol Pot; [[A&amp;E Network]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]] also claims Marxism–Leninism-Maoism as its ideology, as do other Communist Parties around the world which are part of the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]]. China itself has moved sharply away from Maoism since Mao's death, and most people outside of China who describe themselves as Maoist regard the Deng Xiaoping reforms to be a betrayal of Maoism, in line with Mao's view of "[[Capitalist roader]]s" within the Communist Party.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

As the Chinese government instituted free market economic reforms starting in the late 1970s and as later Chinese leaders took power, less recognition was given to the status of Mao. This accompanied a decline in state recognition of Mao in later years in contrast to previous years when the state organised numerous events and seminars commemorating Mao's 100th birthday. Nevertheless, the Chinese government has never officially repudiated the tactics of Mao. Deng Xiaoping, who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, has to a certain extent rejected Mao's legacy, famously saying that Mao was "70% right and 30% wrong".

In the mid-1990s, Mao Zedong's picture began to appear on all new [[renminbi]] currency from the People's Republic of China. This was officially instituted as an anti-counterfeiting measure as Mao's face is widely recognised in contrast to the generic figures that appear in older currency. On March 13, 2006, a story in the ''[[People's Daily]]'' reported that a proposal had been made to print the portraits of [[Sun Yat-sen]] and Deng Xiaoping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200603/13/eng20060313_250192.html|work=People's Daily|title=Portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Deng Xiaoping proposed adding to RMB notes|date=March 13, 2006|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the government in Shanghai issued a new set of high school history textbooks which omit Mao, with the exception of a single mention in a section on etiquette.

Mao gave contradicting statements on the subject of [[Cult of personality|personality cults]]. In 1955, as a response to the [[Khrushchev Report]] that criticised [[Joseph Stalin]], Mao stated that personality cults are "poisonous ideological survivals of the old society", and reaffirmed China's commitment to [[collective leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mao Zedong: A Political and Intellectual Portrait|first=Maurice|last=Meisner|publisher=Polity|year=2007|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at the 1958 Party congress in Chengdu, Mao expressed support for the personality cults of people whom he labelled as genuinely worthy figures; not those that expressed "blind worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.thinkquest.org/26469/cultural-revolution/cult.html | title = Cult of Mao | publisher = library.thinkquest.org | accessdate = August 23, 2008 | quote = This remark of Mao seems to have elements of truth but it is false.

In 1962, Mao proposed the Socialist Education Movement (SEM) in an attempt to educate the peasants to resist the "temptations" of feudalism and the sprouts of capitalism that he saw re-emerging in the countryside from Liu's economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/resources/landsberger-paint-it-red.php|title=Stefan Landsberger, Paint it Red. Fifty years of Chinese Propaganda Posters|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of politicised art were produced and circulated&amp;nbsp;— with Mao at the centre. Numerous posters, [[Chairman Mao badge|badges]] and musical compositions referenced Mao in the phrase "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts" ({{zh|labels=no |t=毛主席是我們心中的紅太陽 |p=Máo Zhǔxí Shì Wǒmen Xīnzhōng De Hóng Tàiyáng}})&lt;ref name="WangMaoBadgesChapter5"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/2%20-%20Part%202%20-%20Mao%20badges%20with%20low%20res%20image%20of%20poster.pdf Chapter 5: "Mao Badges – Visual Imagery and Inscriptions"] in: [[Helen Wang]]: ''Chairman Mao badges: symbols and Slogans of the Cultural Revolution'' (British Museum Research Publication 169).

In October 1966, Mao's ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]]'', which was known as the ''Little Red Book'' was published. Party members were encouraged to carry a copy with them and possession was almost mandatory as a criterion for membership. Over the years, Mao's image became displayed almost everywhere, present in homes, offices and shops. His quotations were [[Emphasis (typography)|typographically emphasised]] by putting them in boldface or red type in even the most obscure writings. Music from the period emphasised Mao's stature, as did children's rhymes. The phrase "Long Live Chairman Mao for [[ten thousand years]]" was commonly heard during the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lu|first=Xing|title=Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: the impact on Chinese thought, Culture, and Communication|year=2004|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=1-57003-543-1|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=Long+Live+Chairman+Mao+for+ten+thousand+years#v=onepage&amp;q=Long%20Live%20Chairman%20Mao%20for%20ten%20thousand%20years&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao also has a presence in China and around the world in popular culture, where his face adorns everything from T-shirts to coffee cups. Mao's granddaughter, Kong Dongmei, defended the phenomenon, stating that "it shows his influence, that he exists in people's consciousness and has influenced several generations of Chinese people's way of life.

*{{lang|zh-Latn|Máo Zǔrén}} ({{lang|zh|毛祖人}}), paternal great-grandfather

===Wives===
[[File:Mao Jiang Qing and daughter Li Na.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Jiang Qing]] and daughter [[Li Na (daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Na]], 1940s]]

Mao Zedong had four wives who gave birth to a total of 10 children. They were:

#[[Luo Yixiu]] (October 20, 1889 – 1910) of [[Shaoshan]]: married 1907 to 1910
#[[Yang Kaihui]] (1901–1930) of [[Changsha]]: married 1921 to 1927, executed by the KMT in 1930; mother to [[Mao Anying]], Mao Anqing, and Mao Anlong
#[[He Zizhen]] (1910–1984) of Jiangxi: married May 1928 to 1939; mother to Mao Anhong, [[Li Min (daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Min]], and four other children
#[[Jiang Qing]] (1914–1991), married 1939 until Mao's death; mother to [[Li Na (daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Na]]

===Siblings===
He had several siblings:

*[[Mao Zemin]] (1895–1943), younger brother, executed by a warlord
*[[Mao Zetan]] (1905–1935), younger brother, executed by the KMT
*[[Mao Zejian]] (1905–1929), adopted sister, executed by the KMT

: Mao Zedong's parents altogether had five sons and two daughters. Two of the sons and both daughters died young, leaving the three brothers Mao Zedong, Mao Zemin, and Mao Zetan. Like all three of Mao Zedong's wives, Mao Zemin and Mao Zetan were communists. Like Yang Kaihui, both Zemin and Zetan were killed in warfare during Mao Zedong's lifetime.

Note that the character ''zé'' ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|澤}}}}) appears in all of the siblings' given names. This is a common [[Chinese_name#Given_names|Chinese naming convention]].

From the next generation, Zemin's son, [[Mao Yuanxin]], was raised by Mao Zedong's family. He became Mao Zedong's liaison with the Politburo in 1975. In Li Zhisui's ''[[The Private Life of Chairman Mao]]'', Mao Yuanxin played a role in the final power-struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|1994|p=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

[[File:Mao Anying and wife Liu Songlin.jpg|thumb|[[Mao Anying]] with his wife Liu Songlin]]

Mao Zedong had a total of ten children,&lt;ref name=Spence&gt;{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
*[[Mao Anying]] (1922–1950): son to Yang, married to {{lang|zh-Latn|Liú Sīqí}} ({{lang|zh-hant|劉思齊}}), [[killed in action]] during the [[Korean War]]
*[[Mao Anqing]] (1923–2007): son to Yang, married to [[Shao Hua]], son [[Mao Xinyu]], grandson Mao Dongdong
*Mao Anlong (1927–1931): son to Yang, died during the [[Chinese Civil War]]
*Mao Anhong: son to He, left to Mao's younger brother [[Mao Zetan|Zetan]] and then to one of Zetan's guards when he went off to war, was never heard of again
*[[Li Min (daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Min]] (b. 1936): daughter to He, married to {{lang|zh-Latn|Kǒng Lìnghuá}} ({{lang|zh-hant|孔令華}}), son {{lang|zh-Latn|Kǒng Jìníng}} ({{lang|zh-hant|孔繼寧}}), daughter {{lang|zh-Latn|Kǒng Dōngméi}} ({{lang|zh|孔冬梅}})
*[[Li Na (Daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Na]] (b. 1940): daughter to Jiang (whose birth surname was Lǐ, a name also used by Mao while evading the KMT), married to {{lang|zh-Latn|Wáng Jǐngqīng}} ({{lang|zh|王景清}}), son {{lang|zh-Latn|Wáng Xiàozhī}} ({{lang|zh-hant|王效芝}})

Mao's first and second daughters were left to local villagers because it was too dangerous to raise them while fighting the [[Kuomintang]] and later the Japanese. Their youngest daughter (born in early 1938 in Moscow after Mao separated) and one other child (born 1933) died in infancy. Two English researchers who retraced the entire Long March route in 2002–2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/23/content_283948.htm|title= Stepping into history|work=China Daily|date=November 23, 2003|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; located a woman whom they believe might well be one of the missing children abandoned by Mao to peasants in 1935.

==Personal life==
[[File:Mao Zedong and Zhang Yufeng in 1964.jpg|thumb|Mao and Zhang Yufeng in 1964]]

Mao's private life was very secretive at the time of his rule. However, after Mao's death, [[Li Zhisui]], his personal physician, published ''[[The Private Life of Chairman Mao]]'', a memoir which mentions some aspects of Mao's private life, such as chain-smoking cigarettes, addiction to powerful sleeping pills and large number of sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Li94|Li]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars and some other people who also personally knew and worked with Mao, however, have disputed the accuracy of these characterisations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#De96|DeBorga and Dong 1996]]. p. 04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having grown up in [[Hunan]], Mao spoke [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with a marked Hunanese accent.&lt;ref name="Hollingworth1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Hollingworth|1985|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ross Terrill]] noted Mao was a "son of the soil&amp;nbsp;... rural and unsophisticated" in origins,&lt;ref name="Terrill 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Terrill|1980|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Clare Hollingworth]] asserted he was proud of his "peasant ways and manners", having a strong Hunanese accent and providing "earthy" comments on sexual matters.&lt;ref name="Hollingworth1985" /&gt; [[Lee Feigon]] noted that Mao's "earthiness" meant that he remained connected to "everyday Chinese life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinologist [[Stuart Schram]] emphasised Mao's ruthlessness, but also noted that he showed no sign of taking pleasure in torture or killing in the revolutionary cause.&lt;ref name="Schram1966 p153"/&gt; Lee Feigon considered Mao "draconian and authoritarian" when threatened, but opined that he was not the "kind of villain that his mentor Stalin was".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Pantsov and Steven I. Levine wrote that Mao was a "man of complex moods", who "tried his best to bring about prosperity and gain international respect" for China, being "neither a saint nor a demon."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that in early life, he strived to be "a strong, wilful, and purposeful hero, not bound by any moral chains", and that he "passionately desired fame and power".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantsov|Levine|2012|pp=42, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao had learned some English language, particularly through [[Zhang Hanzhi]], who was his English teacher, interpreter and diplomat who later married [[Qiao Guanhua]], Foreign Minister of China and the head of China's UN delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/world/asia/29zhang.html|title=Zhang Hanzhi, Mao’s English Tutor, Dies at 72|first=David|last=Barboza|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his spoken English was limited to a few single words, phrases, and some short sentences. He first chose to systematically learn English in the 1950s, which was very unusual as the main foreign language first taught in Chinese schools at that time was Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.people.com.cn/n/2015/0709/c372327-27277288-3.html 揭秘毛泽东为什么学英语："这是斗争的需要"]. people.com.cn.

Mao was a prolific writer of political and philosophical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/themes/mao-thought.php |title=Mao Zedong Thought – Part 1 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the attributed author of ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]]'', known in the West as the "Little Red Book" and in Cultural Revolution China as the "Red Treasure Book" ({{lang|zh-hant|紅寶書}}): first published in January 1964, this is a collection of short extracts from his many speeches and articles, edited by [[Lin Biao]] and ordered topically. Mao wrote several other philosophical treatises, both before and after he assumed power. These include:
*''[[On Guerrilla Warfare]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《游擊戰》}}); 1937
*''[[On Practice]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《實踐論》}}); 1937
*''[[On Contradiction]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《矛盾論》}}); 1937
*''[[On Protracted War]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《論持久戰》}}); 1938
*''[[Norman Bethune#Legacy|In Memory of Norman Bethune]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《紀念白求恩》}}); 1939
*''On [[New Democracy]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《新民主主義論》}}); 1940
*''[[Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《在延安文藝座談會上的講話》}}); 1942
*''[[Serve the People]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《為人民服務》}}); 1944
*''The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains'' ({{lang|zh|《愚公移山》}}); 1945
*''On the Correct Handling of the Contradictions Among the People'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《正確處理人民內部矛盾問題》}}); 1957

Mao was also a skilled [[Chinese calligrapher]] with a highly personal style. In China, Mao was considered a master calligrapher during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiawind.com/art/callig/modern.htm#Contemporary%20Chinese%20Calligraphy |title=100 years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His calligraphy can be seen today throughout mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yen |first=Yuehping |title=Calligraphy and Power in Contemporary Chinese Society |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?visbn=0415317533 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work gave rise to a new form of Chinese calligraphy called "Mao-style" or ''Maoti'', which has gained increasing popularity since his death. There currently exist various competitions specialising in Mao-style calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.people.com.cn/GB/41132/41137/4802132.html|work=People|script-title=zh:首屆毛體書法邀請賽精品紛呈|date=September 11, 2006|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As did most Chinese intellectuals of his generation, Mao's education began with [[Chinese classic texts|Chinese classical literature]]. Mao told Edgar Snow in 1936 that he had started the study of the Confucian [[Analects]] and the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Four Books]] at a village school when he was eight, but that the books he most enjoyed reading were ''[[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.&lt;ref name="Barnstone"&gt;Willis Barnstone, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1SCD3xwYwJ0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Poems of Mao Zedong]'' (1972; rpr. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0520935004}}), p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao published poems in classical forms starting in his youth and his abilities as a poet contributed to his image in China after he came to power in 1949. His style was influenced by the great [[Tang dynasty]] poets [[Li Bai]] and [[Li He]].&lt;ref&gt;Ng Yong-sang. "The Poetry of Mao Tse-tung". ''China Quarterly'' 13 (1963): 60–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his most well-known poems are ''[[Changsha (poem)|Changsha]]'' (1925), ''[[The Double Ninth]]'' (1929.10), ''Loushan Pass'' (1935), ''The Long March'' (1935), ''[[Poetry of Mao Zedong#Snow (1936.02)|Snow]]'' (1936), ''[[Poetry of Mao Zedong#The PLA Captures Nanjing (1949.04|The PLA Captures Nanjing]]'' (1949), ''Reply to Li Shuyi'' (1957.05.11) and ''Ode to the Plum Blossom'' (1961.12).

==Portrayal in film and television==
Mao has been portrayed in film and television numerous times. Some notable actors include: Han Shi, the first actor ever to have portrayed Mao, in a 1978 drama ''Dielianhua'' and later again in a 1980 film ''Cross the Dadu River'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Being Mao Zedong|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2011-07/04/content_22917108.htm|work=Global Times|accessdate=March 15, 2013|date=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gu Yue]], who had portrayed Mao 84 times on screen throughout his 27-year career and had won the Best Actor title at the [[Hundred Flowers Awards]] in 1990 and 1993;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous actor playing Mao Zedong dies|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/05/eng20050705_194191.html|work=People's Daily|accessdate=March 15, 2013|date=July 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actor famous for playing Mao Zedong dies of miocardial infarction|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/05/eng20050705_194076.html|work=People's Daily|accessdate=March 15, 2013|date=July 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]], who played a young Mao in ''[[The Founding of a Party]]'' (2011);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Wei|title=The reel Mao|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2011-06/03/content_12636667.htm|publisher=China Daily European Weekly|accessdate=March 15, 2013|date=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tang Guoqiang]], who has frequently portrayed Mao in more recent times, in the films ''The Long March'' (1996) and ''[[The Founding of a Republic]]'' (2009), and the television series ''[[Huang Yanpei (TV series)|Huang Yanpei]]'' (2010), among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Xiong|first=Qu|title=Actors expect prosperity of Chinese culture|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/cultureexpress/20111126/104783.shtml|publisher=CCTV News|accessdate=March 15, 2013|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao is a principal character in American composer [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]' opera ''[[Nixon in China]]'' (1987).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2667">'''''Mittelschule''''' is a [[German language|German]] term literally translating to "Middle School" (i.e. a level "intermediate" between elementary and higher education). It is used in various senses in the education systems of the various parts of German-speaking Europe, not necessarily equivalent the English term [[middle school]] (which is itself used in various meanings in various parts  of the English-speaking world).

Examples of such use include:
*[[Austria]], lower secondary education for pupils aged 10–14, see [[education in Austria]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3419">The '''National Institute of Chemistry''' (in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''Kemijski Inštitut'') in [[Ljubljana]] is the second largest [[natural sciences]] research institute in [[Slovenia]] (the country's largest being the [[Jožef Stefan Institute]]). Research at the National Institute is divided into two major fields: life sciences and materials science. Among its 17 departments,&lt;ref name="KIdepartments"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ki.si/en/departments/ |title=National Institute of Chemistry: Departments |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Kemijski inštitut Ljubljana |access-date=15 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Materials Chemistry (D10) is the biggest department in the field of materials science.&lt;ref name="Alistore"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alistore.eu/national-institute-of-chemistry |title=National Institute of Chemistry |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=alistore.eu |publisher=Alistore European Research Institute |access-date=23 October 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was established in 1946 as part of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] with the purpose of developing technologies for processing coal into coke that was needed in the [[History of Slovenia#1950s: heavy industrialization|heavy industrialisation period]] of [[history of Slovenia|Slovenia's history]] after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="KIhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ki.si/en/about-the-institute/history/ |title=National Institute of Chemistry: History |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Kemijski inštitut Ljubljana |access-date=23 October 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 it was renamed the ''Boris Kidrič Institute of Chemistry'' in honour of the first president of the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenian socialist]] government, [[Boris Kidrič]] (1912–1953).

In 1956 the institute's first infrared spectrometer (a Perkin Elmer 21) was purchased, which made it possible to begin in-depth research in various fields of the Institute’s activities.

In 1992, following the country’s independence Slovenia's ''National Centre for High-resolution NMR Spectrometry'' (known as the NMR Centre) was established at the institute.

==Employees and equipment==
The institute's ~300 employees, of which 136 have PhD degrees, perform cutting edge research work using equipment such as a Karl Zeiss Supra 35 VP Electronic Microscope with EDX analysis, a high resolution powder [[x-ray diffractometer]], and an 800&amp;nbsp;MHz [[NMR spectrometer]]; these are the only ones of their kind in Slovenia. The NMR spectrometer is the first of this kind of instrument to be found in the [[Enlargement of the European Union|new member states of EU]].&lt;ref name="KIhistory"/&gt;

==Major achievements==
One of the institute's major achievements of recent years is a 2013 synthetic [[protein]] that folds itself into a tetrahedron — a pyramid with a triangular base measuring just 5 [[nanometres]] along each edge - which can be used as container for delivering drugs on a [[nanoscopic scale]]. It was synthesized by [[Roman Jerala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/protein-gets-in-on-dna-s-origami-act-1.12882 Protein gets in on DNA's origami act: Engineered bacteria make self-assembling tetrahedra], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 28 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Air Force Educational Service''' was a civilian-manned service within the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] which provided instruction for [[aircraft apprentice]]s and airmen, mainly in engineering, but also in other subjects.

The service was established shortly after the formation of the Royal Air Force in 1918. Preference for recruitment as Civilian Education Officers was given to men who had served as [[commissioned officer]]s in the armed forces during the [[First World War]]&lt;ref&gt;"Public Appointments", ''[[The Times]]'', 31 December 1927&lt;/ref&gt; until 1930, when it was extended to all ex-servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Appointments", ''[[The Times]]'', 9 January 1930&lt;/ref&gt; From 1937 advertisements no longer stated that ex-servicemen would be given preference.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Appointments", ''[[The Times]]'', 8 January 1937&lt;/ref&gt; From 1930 a [[academic degree|degree]] was required.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Appointments", ''[[The Times]]'', 9 January 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1946, the Educational Service was disbanded and replaced by the commissioned officers of the new RAF Education Branch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%202058.html ''Flight'', 10 October 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Education Officers had already been commissioned during the [[Second World War]].

'''Saif al-Islam Gaddafi''' ({{lang-ar|سيف الإسلام معمر القذافي}}; born 25 June 1972) is a [[Libya]]n political figure. He is the second son of the Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] (who was overthrown and killed in 2011) and his second wife [[Safia Farkash]]. Gaddafi was awarded a [[PhD]] from the [[London School of Economics]].

He was a part of his father's inner circle, performing public relations and diplomatic roles on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/02/2011227192852808945.html|title=Inside Gaddafi's inner circle|work=Al Jazeera |date=27 February 2011|accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He publicly turned down his father's offer of the country's second highest post and held no official government position. According to [[United States Department of State|American State Department]] officials in Tripoli, during his father's reign, he was the second most widely recognized person in Libya, being at times the "de facto" Prime Minister,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/28/world/20101128-cables-viewer.html#report/libya-09TRIPOLI208|work=New York Times|first1=Alan|last1=McLean|first2=Scott|last2=Shane|first3=Archie|last3=Tse|title=A Selection From the Cache of Diplomatic Dispatches|date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was mentioned as a possible successor, though he rejected this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Politics of Blackmail|date=13 September 2008|work=Newsweek|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/40280/output/print|accessdate=9 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519043522/http://www.newsweek.com/id/40280/output/print|archivedate=19 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An arrest warrant was issued for him by the [[International Criminal Court]] for charges of [[crimes against humanity]] against the Libyan people, for torturing and killing civilians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War crimes court issues Gaddafi arrest warrant|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/muammar-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-hague}}&lt;/ref&gt; a charge he denied.&lt;ref name="rt_interview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi's son: Libya like McDonald's for NATO – fast war as fast food|url=http://rt.com/news/interview-gaddafi-libya-usa/|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=1 July 2011|agency=[[Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi was captured in southern Libya by the [[Zintan]] militia on 19 November 2011, after the end of the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]], and flown by plane to Zintan. He was sentenced to death on 28 July 2015 by a court in Tripoli for crimes during the civil war, in a widely criticised trial conducted ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]''. He remained in the custody of the ''de facto'' independent authorities of Zintan.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33688391  |title=Libya trial: Gaddafi son sentenced to death over war crimes |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 July 2015 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |access-date=28 July 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2017, he was released from  prison in Zintan, according to a statement from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/saif-al-islam-gaddafi-freed-prison-zintan-170610190700610.html|title=Saif al-Islam Gaddafi freed from prison in Zintan|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same month, his full amnesty was declared by the Tobruk-based government led by [[Khalifa Haftar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xypolia|first1=Ilia|title=News of Saif al-Islam's release: regional politics fuels rumour mill in Libya|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/news-of-saif-al-islams-release-regional-politics-fuels-rumour-mill-in-libya-20170703|website=News24|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi graduated with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from [[Tripoli]]'s [[Al Fateh University]] in 1994. However, there is another report stating that he is an architect.&lt;ref name=alarab&gt;{{cite news|last=Afiouni|first=Nevine|title=Qaddafi's children as controversial as father|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/23/138886.html|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Vienna]]'s [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec]] business school in 2000.

His paintings made up the bulk of the international Libyan art exhibit, "The Desert is Not Silent" (2002–2005),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/*/http://thedesertisnotsilent.com The Desert Is Not Silent], [https://archive.org/web/web.php Internet Archive] record, Historical index.&lt;/ref&gt; a show which was supported by a host of international corporations with direct ties to his father's government, among them the [[ABB Group]] and [[Siemens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093129/http://www.thedesertisnotsilent.com/home/partners.asp Commercial partners of "The Desert Is Not Silent"], [https://archive.org/web/web.php Internet Archive] record, 29 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi was awarded a [[PhD]] degree in 2008 from the [[London School of Economics]], where he attended amid a [[LSE Gaddafi links|series of contacts]] between the school and the Libyan political establishment. He presented a thesis on "The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from 'soft power' to collective decision-making?"&lt;ref&gt;Alqadhafi, Saif Al-Islam, ''[https://catalogue.lse.ac.uk/Record/1187568 The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from "soft power" to collective decision-making?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728002526/https://catalogue.lse.ac.uk/Record/1187568 |date=28 July 2011 }}'', [[London School of Economics]] Library, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8258617.stm Gaddafi son calls for democracy]'', [[BBC News]], 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Examined by [[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai|Meghnad Desai]] (London School of Economics) and Anthony McGrew ([[University of Southampton]]), among the LSE academics acknowledged in the thesis as directly assisting with it were [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]], [[David Held]] and Alex Voorhoeve (the son of former Dutch minister [[Joris Voorhoeve]]). Professor [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] is also thanked for having read portions of the manuscript and providing advice and direction.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Meghnad (2011) LSE is paying a heavy price for Saif Gaddafi's PhD: When it comes to Saif Gaddafi and his PhD, hindsight is indeed a wonderful thing, The Guardian, Friday 4 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alqadhafi, Saif Al-Islam (2008) The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from "soft power" to collective decision-making? A thesis submitted to the Department of Philosophy of the London School of Economics for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, London, September 2007, and published 2008, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, allegations abound that Saif's thesis was in many parts ghost-written by consultants from Monitor Group, which earned $3 million per year in fees from Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/gaddafi-son-plagiarised-his-degree-thesis-at-lse-2229620.html|title=Gaddafi son plagiarised his thesis at LSE.|work=The Independent |date=2 March 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011|location=London|first=Adam|last=Sherwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]] on 20 August 2008, Gaddafi said that he would no longer involve himself in state affairs. He noted that he had previously "intervene[d] due to the absence of institutions",&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/22/mideast/libya.php "Qaddafi's son declares he's leaving politics"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but said that he would no longer do so. He dismissed any potential suggestion that this decision was due to disagreement with his father, saying that they were on good terms. He also called for political reforms within the context of the [[Jamahiriya]] system and rejected the notion that he could succeed his father, saying that "this is not a farm to inherit".&lt;ref name=IHT/&gt;

===Charity and social affairs===
Gaddafi was the president of the Libyan National Association for Drugs and Narcotics Control (DNAG). In 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhand.org/en/browse/regions/Middle+East/all/organisation/22312|title=Listing on Global Hand|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he founded the official charity, the [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]], which intervened in various hostage situations involving Islamic militants and the crisis of the [[HIV trial in Libya]] and the resulting [[European Union]]-Libyan rapprochement.

In 2009, both [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] were allowed entry to Libya, via Gaddafi's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde19/003/2009/en/|title=LIBYA: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL COMPLETES FIRST FACT-FINDING VISIT IN OVER FIVE YEARS|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/12/12/libya-repressive-atmosphere-pockets-improvement|title=Libya: In Repressive Atmosphere, Pockets of Improvement|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While AI and HRW reported that there were concerns about the "repressive atmosphere," both felt there were signs of "improvement" and HRW said that one should not "underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far" by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/05/26/tripoli_spring|title=Tripoli Spring - How Libya's behind-the-scenes reformer is actually, well, reforming.|work=Foreign Policy|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Gaddafi announced that his charity foundation "will no longer be involved in promoting human rights and political change in the North African country," and that instead, it "will focus on its 'core charitable mission' of delivering aid and relief to sub-Saharan Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/16/gaddafi-son-human-rights-libya|title=Gaddafi's son retreats on human rights in Libya|author=Ian Black|work=the Guardian|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International diplomacy==
Gaddafi was instrumental in negotiations that led to Libya's abandoning a [[weapons of mass destruction]] programme in 2002–2003. He arranged several important business deals on behalf of the Libyan regime in the period of [[rapprochement]] that followed. He was viewed as a reformer, and openly criticised the regime:&lt;ref name=NYmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/print/?/news/politics/saif-qaddafi-2011-5/index3.html|title=The Good Bad Son|author=James Verini|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[a] congressional aide asked him what Libya needed most. His one-word answer: democracy.

"You mean Libya needs more democracy?" the aide asked.

"No. 'More democracy' would imply that we had some," Gaddafi said.}}

In 2003, he published a report critical of Libya's record on human rights.

On 10 December 2004, shortly before a trip by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] to Tripoli, in an interview with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' Gaddafi requested a formal apology from the Canadian government, for joining U.S.-led sanctions against Libya after the [[Lockerbie bombing]], and for denying him a student visa to study in Canada in 1997. His request was met with incredulity in Canada, and the Canadian government announced that no apology would be forthcoming.

===HIV trial===
{{main|HIV trial in Libya}}

[[File:Notes from Hell 2014 eBook edition.jpg|thumb|In her book ''[[Notes from Hell]]'' Chervianashka confirms torture during the HIV trial, and describes Saif al-Islam's role in the process]]

Gaddafi played an important role in the HIV trial in Libya. At first he rejected information the medics were tortured. "''During this time we saw Gaddafi's son on a television broadcast categorically denying that Libya still tortured suspected criminals"'', claims Valya Chervianashka, one of the accused nurses in her auto-biography. Later he admitted in interviews that the Bulgarian nurses, charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, had been tortured and that the government had denied them a fair trial. His admissions were said to have badly damaged his reputation in Libya.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The torture process is confirmed and described in details in the book ''[[Notes from Hell]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/story/show/265237-notes-from-hell&lt;/ref&gt; co-written by one of the nurses, Valya Chervianashka. Saif al-Islam was mentioned several times in the book. According to her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day, the executive director of Muammar al-Gaddafi's son's foundation, the [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] (GICDF), arrived at the prison, inviting us to the director's office of the women's wing for a meeting. We were in our pyjamas, dishevelled and unprepared. We hastily put on some clothes and hurried to meet the director. A Libyan man along with Ambassador Lyudmil Spassov and Roumen Petrov waited for us outside the office. The Ambassador told us, "This is a very important person. He will help you; he is on your side." Saleh Abdel Salam, executive director of GICDF, was intimidating. We didn't realise it then, but this Libyan man would indeed help us in the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Isratine proposal===
Saif introduced the [[Isratine proposal]] to permanently resolve the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] through a [[secular state|secular]], [[federalist]], [[republicanism|republican]] [[one-state solution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Book (ISRATIN)|date=8 May 2003|url=http://www.algathafi.org/html-english/cat_03_03.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530213120/http://www.algathafi.org/html-english/cat_03_03.htm |archivedate=30 May 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever opinion poll survey to be undertaken in both Pakistani and Indian-controlled [[Kashmir]], conducted by [[King's College London|King's College]], London, and the polling organisation IPSOS-[[MORI]], was also Gaddafi's brainchild,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?265666 The Survey In Kashmir Was Saif Gaddafi's Idea], ''Outlook'', 14 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; having arisen out of discussions he had with British academic Robert Bradnock, the author of the 2010 [[Chatham House]] report on the survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/research/asia/papers/view/-/id/881/ Kashmir: Paths to Peace], [[Chatham House]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine peace process===
Gaddafi served as Chairman of the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charitable Associations. In this role, he was involved in a number of humanitarian initiatives. Notably, he hosted peace talks between the [[Government of the Philippines]] and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] in Tripoli.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Agreement on Peace between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front dated 2 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In the resulting peace agreement concluded on 22 June 2001, Gaddafi was expressly thanked for his involvement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was also the witness to the signing of the peace agreement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The peace agreement forms a part of the [[Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro]] concluded in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 agreement with Italy===
Gaddafi was involved in negotiating compensation from Libya's former colonial power, [[Italy]], and on 30 August 2008 a Friendship, Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was signed in [[Benghazi]] by his father and [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italy's prime minister]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Compensation for American terror victims===
He was also negotiating with the United States in order to conclude a comprehensive agreement making any further payments for American victims of terror attacks that have been blamed on Libya – such as the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]], the 1988 [[Lockerbie bombing]] and the 1989 [[UTA Flight 772]] bombing – conditional upon U.S. payment of compensation for the 40 Libyans killed and 220 injured in the 1986 [[Operation El Dorado Canyon|United States bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi]]. On 14 August 2008, the U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement was signed in [[Tripoli]]. Former British Ambassador to Libya [[Oliver Miles]] described the agreement as "a bold step, with political cost for both parties" and wrote an article in the online edition of ''[[The Guardian]]'' querying whether the agreement is likely to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title=The long road to normalisation|date=16 August 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/16/libya.usa |accessdate=17 August 2008 |work=The Guardian| location=London | first=Oliver | last=Miles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2008 [[BBC]] TV interview, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said that Libya had admitted responsibility (but not "guilt") for the Lockerbie bombing simply to get trade sanctions removed. He further admitted that Libya was being "hypocritical" and was "playing on words", but said Libya had no other choice on the matter. According to Gaddafi, a letter admitting "responsibility" was the only way to end the economic sanctions imposed on Libya. When asked about the $10m (£5.3m) compensation that Libya was paying to each victims' family, he again repeated that Libya was doing so because it had no other choice. He went on to describe the families of the Lockerbie victims as "trading with the blood of their sons and daughters" and being very "greedy", saying, "They were asking for more money and more money and more money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lockerbie evidence not disclosed|date=28 August 2008|work=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/7573244.stm |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy for extraditing Libyans===
Interviewed by French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on 7 December 2007, Gaddafi said that the seven Libyans convicted for the [[Pan Am Flight 103]] and the [[UTA Flight 772]] bombings "are innocent".&lt;ref name="Le Figaro"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2007/12/07/01003-20071207ARTFIG00487-seif-el-islam-kadhafi-la-libye-sera-un-pays-heureux.php Seif el-Islam Kadhafi : "La Libye sera un pays heureux"], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if Libya would therefore seek reimbursement of the compensation paid to the families of the victims (US$2.33 billion), Gaddafi replied: "I don't know."&lt;ref name="Le Figaro"/&gt;
Gaddafi led negotiations with Britain for the [[release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]], the convicted Pan Am 103 conspirator.&lt;ref name=NYmag/&gt;

In 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi met with [[President of France|French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in Tripoli, with whom it is alleged he helped broker an arms deal, including missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=70876 "Sarkozy denies weapons deals to Libya"], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]''. 4 August 2007.

Retrieved 27 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Gaddafi made a high-profile visit to the United States where he met with US Secretary of State, [[Condoleezza Rice]]. During the meeting, Rice raised the case of Libya's jailed political dissident and democracy activist, [[Fathi El-Jahmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Forbes]] article in 2009, Fathi's brother wrote that "for nearly a year, both [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] hesitated to advocate publicly for Fathi's case, because they feared their case workers might lose access to Libyan [[Visa (document)|visas]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/15/fathi-eljahmi-libya-opinions-contributors-human-rights.html |title=Don't Let My Brother's Death Be In Vain|author=Mohamed Eljahmi |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Saif al-Islam welcomed [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], director of [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Middle East division, into Libya, accompanying her in meeting with many government officials and others during her visit. She wrote of her official visit that "the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization, the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development" chaired by Gaddafi. She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country's two semi-private newspapers, and said "it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far. Let's hope this spring will last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/05/26/tripoli_spring|title=Tripoli Spring|work=Foreign Policy|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-off with US officials===
In 2009, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi claimed that Libya's opinion of him was shaped largely by his role in Libya's engagement with the West, saying "If something goes wrong, people will blame me, whether I am in a certain official position or not." He expressed frustration with the US, saying Libya's decision to give up its Weapons of Mass Destruction programs was contingent upon "compensation" from the US, including the signing of the [[Trade and Investment Framework Agreement]], economic cooperation, and cooperation in purchasing conventional weapons and military equipment. He stated, "We share rich natural resources – oil and gas – along the borders, yet we have no capacity to defend that wealth." Because of a US legal embargo, Libya cannot purchase weapons from the United States, Sweden, or Germany, and has been disallowed from buying "Tiger" vehicles with American-manufactured engines from Jordan. He asked for greater military assistance, as Libya had committed itself to destroying chemical stockpiles, but would require at least $25 million to do so. Gaddafi said the United States had "humiliated" his father during his visit to New York in 2009, and said that his father's tent and residence issues were disappointing and his UN speech had been misinterpreted. Gaddafi said that his father was barred from visiting [[Ground Zero]], which also frustrated him. Gaddafi held a standoff with US officials in November 2009, refusing to send a shipment of [[Highly Enriched Uranium]] back to Russia unless the United States renewed its commitment to cooperation with Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/28/world/20101128-cables-viewer.html#report/libya-09TRIPOLI941 | work=New York Times | first1=Alan | last1=McLean | first2=Scott | last2=Shane | first3=Archie | last3=Tse | title=A Selection From the Cache of Diplomatic Dispatches | date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
On 19 February, several days after the conflict began, Saif al-Islam announced the creation of a commission of inquiry into the violence, chaired by a Libyan judge, as reported on [[state television]]. He stated that the commission was intended to be "for members of Libyan and foreign organizations of human rights" and that it will "investigate the circumstances and events that have caused many victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libye: de nouveaux morts lors d'une opération des forces libyennes|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2011/02/19/1019008-libye-de-nouveaux-morts-lors-d-une-operation-des-forces-libyennes.html|accessdate=30 October 2011|newspaper=[[La Dépêche du Midi]]|date=19 February 2011|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ladepeche.fr%2Farticle%2F2011%2F02%2F19%2F1019008-libye-de-nouveaux-morts-lors-d-une-operation-des-forces-libyennes.html&amp;act=url Translation])&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, he went on state television to deny allegations that the government had launched airstrikes against Libyan cities and stated that the number of protesters killed had been exaggerated.&lt;ref name="dailymail_gaddafi"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Williams, Davis |author2=Greenhill, Sam |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1360343/Libya-Gaddafi-blames-Osama-bin-Laden-hallucinogenic-pills-Nescafe-uprising.html |title=Now Gaddafi Blames Hallucinogenic Pills Mixed with Nescafe and bin Laden for Uprisings...

On 20 February, he made an extemporaneous speech on Libyan state TV, where he blamed the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|civil war]] on tribal factions and [[Islamist]]s acting on their own agendas, drunken and drugged.{{clarify|date=December 2016}} He promised reforms, and said the alternative would be civil war causing no trade, no oil money, and the country taken over by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/2011220232725966251.html Gaddafi's son talks of conspiracy], [[Al Jazeera]], 20 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He closed by saying, "We will not let [[Al Jazeera]], [[Al Arabiya]] and [[BBC]] trick us." Many analysts disagreed with his assessment, including [[Oliver Miles]], a former British Ambassador to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/20/libya-protests-oliver-miles How will Libya's protests play out?], [[Oliver Miles]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/20/libya-defiant-protesters-feared-dead Libya on brink as protests hit Tripoli], Ian Black, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[ABC News]] reporter [[Christiane Amanpour]], Saif al-Islam denied that his father's regime is killing civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-saif-al-islam-saadi-gadhafi/story?id=13012239&amp;page=4 'This Week' Transcript: Saif al-Islam and Saadi Gadhafi], [[ABC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Saif al-Islam and his father, Muammar, announced that they were willing to hold elections and that Muammar Gaddafi would step aside if he lost. Saif al-Islam stated that the elections could be held within three months and transparency would be guaranteed through international observers. NATO and the rebels rejected the offer, and NATO soon resumed their bombardment of Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Nick|title=Rebels dismiss election offer, NATO pounds Tripoli|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/16/us-libya-idUSTRE7270JP20110616|accessdate=27 October 2011|date=16 June 2011|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June, an arrest warrant was issued by the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13927208 |work=BBC News | title=Libya: Muammar Gaddafi subject to ICC arrest warrant | date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July, Saif al-Islam had an interview with ''[[RT (TV Network)|Russia Today]]'', where he denied the ICC's allegations that he, or his father, ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He pointed out that he is not a member of the government or the military, and therefore has no authority to give such orders. According to Saif al-Islam, he made recorded calls to General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]], who later defected to the rebel forces, in order to request not to use force against protesters, to which Younis responded that they are attacking a military site, where surprised guards fired in self-defence. Saif al-Islam also condemned NATO for bombing Libyan civilians, including his family members and their children, under the false pretence that their homes were military bases. He also stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his father if they accept a secret deal, an offer they rejected. He thus criticised the ICC as "a fake court" that is controlled by the NATO nations.&lt;ref name="rt_interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Gaddafi's son claims Nato wants deal with Libya|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/01/gaddafi-son-nato-libya-deal|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, Saif al-Islam gave an interview to the ''[[New York Times]]'' stating that Libya was becoming more closely aligned to Islamists and would likely resemble Iran or Saudi Arabia. Saif al-Islam said that his father was working closely with Islamists within the rebellion to splinter the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/world/africa/04seif.html|work=New York Times | first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|title=Libya Allying With Islamists, Qaddafi Son Says | date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August, the [[National Transitional Council]] claimed that Saif al-Islam was arrested by the [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|National Liberation Army]], pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/21/explosions-rock-tripoli-amid-reports-rebel-advances-in-capital-116547133/ |title=Libya Rebels in Tripoli as Qaddafi's Defenses Collapse|agency=Associated Press|work=Fox News |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the early morning of 23 August, Saif al-Islam was seen by Western journalists apparently moving around under his own free will outside the [[Rixos Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/22/reports-saif-al-islam-qaddafi-capture-false-appears-in-tripoli/ | work=Fox News | title=Reports of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi's Capture False, Appears in Tripoli | date=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16054331 |title=Col Gaddafi Son Saif Free And In Tripoli|work=Sky News |date=23 August 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Tripoli, Saif al-Islam went to [[Bani Walid]].{بني وليد} His brother, [[Al-Saadi Gaddafi|Al-Saadi]] contacted [[CNN]], stating that he had the authority to negotiate on behalf of loyalist forces, and wished to discuss a ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/08/24/libya.saadi.gadhafi/index.html | work=CNN | title=Gadhafi son offers to broker Libya cease-fire |accessdate=4 September 2011|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September, Al-Saadi said in an interview with CNN that an "aggressive" speech by his brother Saif al-Islam had led to the breakdown of the negotiations between NTC forces and Gaddafi loyalists in [[Bani Walid]]. Saif al-Islam stayed in Bani Walid until the town was captured by NTC forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/26/173784.html|title=Insider describes Saif al-Islam Qaddafi escape from Bani Walid|work=Al Arabia News |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture===

With the death of [[death of Muammar Gaddafi|Muammar]] and [[Mutassim Gaddafi]] in [[Sirte]] on 20 October 2011, Saif al-Islam was the only member of the [[Gaddafi family]] left in Libya. He appeared on Syrian pro-Gaddafi television on 22 October claiming "I am in Libya, I am alive and free and willing to fight to the end and take revenge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/313227 |title=Libya's NTC claim Saif al-Islam Gaddafi captured alive, uninjured |publisher=Digital Journal |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his whereabouts were unknown and subject to many rumours.

An international team of lawyers representing the interests of Saif al-Islam wrote to US leaders demanding that he be protected from assassination and holding the United States and NATO responsible for the Libyan leader's "brutal assassination" and repeated attacks on Libya's civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiavision.com/news/article/topnews/241923/international-legal-team-demands-protection-for-saif-gaddafi-from-planned-nato-assassination/|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171012004845/http://www.indiavision.com/news/article/topnews/241923/international-legal-team-demands-protection-for-saif-gaddafi-from-planned-nato-assassination/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 October 2017|title=International legal team demands protection for Saif Gaddafi from planned NATO assassination|date=25 October 2011|work=Indiavision news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2011, as Saif al-Islam was trying to flee from Libya, he and four aides were captured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiavision.com/news/article/international/243165/gaddafis-son-hires-mercenaries-to-flee/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130419025236/http://www.indiavision.com/news/article/international/243165/gaddafis-son-hires-mercenaries-to-flee/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 April 2013|title=Gaddafi's son hires mercenaries to flee|date=31 October 2011|work=[[Indiavision News]]|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and detained about {{convert|50|km}} west of the town of [[Ubari]] near [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]] in southern Libya, {{convert|640|km}} from Tripoli.&lt;ref name=bbccapture/&gt; Sources say that it was the betrayal by a Libyan nomad, Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani, that finally led to his capture. Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani told the interviewers that he was hired to guide a man to Niger and that he was offered €1 million for the job. Being offered such a huge sum of money, he suspected foul play as Saif's agent did not tell him whom he was going to guide. He contacted the rebel fighters and told them where a two vehicle convoy would pass through southern Libya on the night of 18 November and this allowed the rebel fighters to ambush the convoy. Saif was taken to Zintan by plane and, pending trial, he was kept in detention by the Zintan-militia that captured him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8902994/Libya-conflict-brewing-over-trial-of-Saif-al-Islam-Gaddafi.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Richard | last=Spencer | title=Libya: conflict brewing over trial of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi | date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his outstanding warrant the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) asked the new government about Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's detention.&lt;ref name=bbccapture&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15804299|title=Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam captured in Libya|work=BBC|date=19 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was unable or unwilling to comply with the ICC's information requests regarding Saif al-Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'No Libyan response' on Gaddafi son as deadline nears|work=BBC News|date= 10 January 2012|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16479494|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; New deadlines for information requests from the ICC were also missed. A brief filed by the Office of Public Counsel for the Defence on behalf of Gaddafi claimed that "there is no basis for asserting that the ICC should defer the case to Libya".&lt;ref name=icc_feb_2012&gt;http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1326934.pdf page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The brief requested the court to order Libya to immediately implement Gaddafi's rights, and report Libya to the Security Council if it does not.&lt;ref name=icc_feb_2012/&gt;

In August 2012, the Libyan government announced that Saif al-Islam would stand trial in the western Libyan town of [[Zintan]], in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saif al-Islam Gadaffi to go on trial in September|url=http://presstv.com/detail/2012/08/23/257733/gadaffi-son-to-go-on-trial-in-september/|publisher=Press TV|accessdate=23 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823215301/http://presstv.com/detail/2012/08/23/257733/gadaffi-son-to-go-on-trial-in-september/|archivedate=23 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the trial was subsequently delayed. On 17 January 2013, Saif al-Islam appeared in court in Zintan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =Ali Shuaib| title =Gaddafi's son appears in Libyan court for first time| quote =| newspaper =[[Reuters]]| date = January 17, 2013| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/17/us-libya-gaddafi-idUSBRE90G0QR20130117| accessdate = July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, trial was again delayed, and it wasn't until April 2014 that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared in court in Tripoli, via video link for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Libya court reopens trial of Gaddafi regime figures|date=28 April 2014|newspaper=Daily India Mail|url=http://m.dailyindiamail.com/newsdetails.aspx?id=17151|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521220533/http://m.dailyindiamail.com/newsdetails.aspx?id=17151|archivedate=21 May 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libya appealed his extradition to the Hague Court (ICC), but the court affirmed the indictments.&lt;ref name="ICC-2"&gt;{{Cite web|date=21 May 2014|title=Libya must immediately surrender Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi to the ICC|publisher=Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/libya-must-immediately-surrender-saif-al-gaddafi-international-criminal-court-2014-05-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521213733/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/libya-must-immediately-surrender-saif-al-gaddafi-international-criminal-court-2014-05-21|archivedate=21 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the Libyan government failed to show that Saif al-Islam is facing the same charges in Libya as he is in the Hague.&lt;ref name="ICC-2" /&gt;

On July 28, 2015, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was [[death sentence|sentenced to death]] [[Trial in absentia|in absentia]] for [[war crimes]] by the "self-declared government" in Tripoli, Libya (he was being held in Zintan, not where the trial was held). However, the Zintan authorities have consistently refused to either hand him over to the Tripoli authorities or to implement their sentence. The trial and the sentence have been criticised by the United Nations human rights office ([[OHCHR]]) and by [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libya trial: Gaddafi son sentenced to death over war crimes|accessdate={{date|2015-07-28}}|website=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33688391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =David D.

In July 2016, one of his lawyers Karim Khan claimed that his client had been freed on 12 April of that year and transferred to a secret location after the government quashed his sentence, and that he would now petition the ICC to drop all charges against him. The claim hasn't been independently verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephen|first1=Chris|title=Gaddafi son Saif al-Islam freed after death sentence quashed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/gaddafi-son-saif-al-islam-freed-after-death-sentence-quashed|website=The Guardian|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Zintan military source denied that he had been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/gaddafis-son-saif-still-prison-western-libya-military-080156929.html|title=Gaddafi's son Saif still in prison in western Libya, military source says|publisher=Yahoo News|date=8 July 2016|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 it was reported he had survived an assassination attempt in Zintan by local militias.&lt;ref name="assassination-attempt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/News/2017/5/9/Libyas-Saif-al-Islam-survives-assassination-attempt-in-Zintan|title=Libya's Saif al-Islam survives 'assassination attempt' in Zintan|publisher=The News Arab|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
On 10 June 2017, he was released from  prison in Zintan, according to a statement from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"/&gt; The militia chose not to transfer him to the custody of the International Criminal Court, saying "We are not concerned with the international tribunal as the ICC did not ask us to hand him over".&lt;ref name="assassination-attempt" /&gt; The UN-backed Libyan government based in Tripoli has condemned his release while an ICC prosecutor was still trying to verify the release, and called on Libya and other states to arrest and surrender him, stating "Libya is obliged to immediately arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi [...] regardless of any purported amnesty law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40278385|title=Saif al-Islam Gaddafi case: ICC calls for arrest of ex-Libya leader's son|publisher=BBC|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=170614-otp-stat|date=14 June 2017|title=ICC Prosecutor calls for the immediate arrest and surrender of the suspects, Mssrs Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled to the Court|publisher=International Criminal Court|accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links with the London School of Economics==
{{main|LSE Libya Links}}
Saif al-Islam received his PhD from the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2011/03/director_steps_down.aspx |title=LSE Director steps down – 03 – 2011 – News archive – News – News and media – Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations|Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation]] (GICDF), Saif pledged a donation of £1.5&amp;nbsp;million to support the work of the LSE's Centre for the Study of Global Governance on civil society organisations in North Africa. Following the [[LSE Libya Links]] affair, the LSE issued a statement indicating that it would cut all financial ties with the country and would accept no further money from the GICDF, having already received and spent the first £300,000 instalment of the donation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2011/02/libya_funding.aspx Statement on Libya], [[London School of Economics]], February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The School of Ecclesiastic Music''' (SEM) is a school of [[Byzantine music]] in [[Matn District|Matn]], [[Lebanon]].

The school opened in 1997, as a project of the [[Antiochian Greek Orthodox]] [[Archdiocese]] of [[Mount Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldmusiclebanon.org/index_files/Page498.htm|title=SEM|publisher=World Music Lebanon|accessdate=2009-05-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two campuses at [[Mkalles]] and [[Jal el Dib]], which presently have more than 200 students. Now the school central classes are held in the [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts]]- Alba, where a full accreditation of the school curricula with The [[Hellenic Conservatory]] in [[Athens]] has been established&lt;ref name=archdio/&gt;

The school introduced several new revisions of academic Byzantine music books and reference methodologies, replacing an archaic curriculum dating back to 1814.&lt;ref name=archdio&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ortmtlb.org.lb/SEM_files/frame.htm |title=The School of Ecclesiastic Music |publisher=Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of Mount Lebanon |accessdate=2009-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725000840/http://www.ortmtlb.org.lb/SEM_files/frame.htm |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also hosts an Orthodox liturgical choir: The [[Mount Lebanon Orthodox Choir]] with more than 100 professional chanters, and publishes recordings of liturgical music on CDs and cassettes.&lt;ref name=archdio/&gt;

''Simutrans'' was originally written by Hansjörg Malthaner in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A short History of Simutrans Development |url=http://www.funkelwerk.de/site/index.php/projects/simutrans/years-1997-2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031184339/http://www.funkelwerk.de/site/index.php/projects/simutrans/years-1997-2001 |archivedate=October 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2004 he retired from development,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simutrans.com/en/about/ about - History] on simutrans.com&lt;/ref&gt; and an international community of volunteers took over the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simutrans Tikiwiki : Thanks|url=http://simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Thanks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227123033/http://www.simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Thanks|archivedate=2011-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simutrans'' was developed internally as a [[closed source]] game until 2007,&lt;ref name="license"&gt;{{cite web|title=Simutrans's Artistic License, SourceForge|url=http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/?&amp;fq&amp;#91;&amp;#93;=trove:17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706053607/http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/#91;&amp;|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the software was [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] under the [[Artistic License]].&lt;ref name="license"/&gt;

Simutrans is [[Source port|ported]] to [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BeOS]]/[[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4.x]] which make use of several graphics libraries such as [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] only), [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] (all versions) or [[Allegro library|Allegro]] (BeOS only). It is portable to any architecture using [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and one of the aforementioned libraries. ''Simutrans'' has also [[multilingual]] support.

Currently the stable release of ''Simutrans'' is version 120.2.2 as of April 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?topic=16909.0|title=Simutrans 120.2.2 r8163|last=|first=|date=|website=forum.simutrans.com|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a popular branch of the code called Simutrans-Extended, which aims to extend the basic game.&lt;ref name="experimental"&gt;[http://blog.simutrans.com/?tag=simutrans-experimental Simutrans Experimental]&lt;/ref&gt; Simutrans-Extended was formerly called Simutrans-Experimental, but changed its name to Simutrans-Extended on February 13, 2017 to make clear that it is a distinct [[Fork (software)|fork]] of Simutrans and not a testing branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?topic=16685|title=Simutrans-Extended is the new name for Simutrans-Experimental|website=forum.simutrans.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daily build|Nightly builds]] for ''Simutrans'' and the main PakSets are also released for both standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simutrans Nightly|url=http://simutrans-germany.com/~nightly/simutrans/index.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106124757/http://simutrans-germany.com/~nightly/simutrans/index.php|archivedate=2008-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Extended&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bridgewater-brunel.me.uk/downloads/nightly/|title=Index of /downloads/nightly|website=bridgewater-brunel.me.uk|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; versions.

==Overview and features==
[[File:Simutrans_101_map.png|thumb|Map of a Simutrans game world, showing cities and factories]]
The main goal in ''Simutrans'' is to provide an efficient transport system for passengers, mail and goods to be transported to their desired destinations fast and with minimal transfers and at the same time making the company grow avoiding [[bankruptcy]] or [[administration (law)|administration]].

''Simutrans'' has a number of factory chains that are interconnected with other chains, for example, a coal mine produces coal for a coal power plant, and an oil rig produces oil for an oil power plant. The goods produced by these factories may be distributed to smaller factories or shops, such as gasoline to a gas station, coming from a gas storage facility, which retrieves the gas from an oil refinery, and so on.

Supplying a factory with electric power will increase the production and allows for fine-tuning the economy. Passengers and mail are transported between different cities and tourist attractions, and may use several methods of transportation to reach their destinations.

The ''Simutrans'' executable can run many different paksets, which is a package containing files called paks. Paks are files with graphic and data files that Simutrans uses to determine the objects in the game, it determines things like their resolution, appearance and behaviors. Gaming experience is therefore very dependent on the PakSet used.

''Simutrans'' currently features 12 [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] players, and has an online capability similar to ''OpenTTD'' since version 110.0. The terrain in ''Simutrans'' is freely-modifiable, and different layers like tunnels and bridges can be stacked, allowing for subways or highways to be possible. It has a day and night cycle, different [[climate]]s and [[season]]s. Nearly all modes of transportation exist in ''Simutrans''. At least [[bus]]es/[[truck]]s, [[train]]s, and [[ship]]s are always provided. If defined in the PakSet, [[aircraft]], [[monorail]]s and/or [[maglev]]s can also be used.

==Customization==
[[File:Fuzzy bigundergroundhub.jpg|thumb|250px|Underground mode (pak128)]]
The ''Simutrans'' executable must load a PakSet which contains the game's objects. Over the years several PakSets have been created, an overview is given on the official page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PakSets|url=http://www.simutrans.com/paksets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simutrans'' can easily be expanded or modified. Simple modification can be done via editing the personal config file. Since the objects in the game just consist of a simple image and a short description file, it is very easy to create a house or add a train. Thus many contributed objects for all graphic sizes exist. The user can also add height maps and citylists which add city names into the game. Even deep modifications of the game mechanics are possible via the config file, like a setting to prevent stockpiling at factories or changing the economic model simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Release of Simutrans 120.1.1|url=http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?topic=14942.0|website=forum.simutrans.com|date=2015-11-20|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[GameDaily]]'s Big Download considered ''Simutrans'' to be one of the best [[freeware]] games, highlighting the logical system of routing passengers and freight to their destinations, decent AI opponents and the support for custom aesthetics or rules-sets. However, the sometimes unreliable vehicle pathfinding was criticized, particularly with respect to alternate routes and switches for train lines. The sound effects were deemed to be unengaging, and new players may be baffled by the range of transportation possibilities.&lt;ref name="ff" /&gt;

Another review from [[Amiga Future]] came to very similar conclusions (apart from the lack of sound support on [[Amiga OS]]). In particular the depth of simulation and the stability were highlighted.&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amiga Future review|journal=Amiga Future|date=December 21, 2009|issue=82|pages=20–21|url=http://www.amigafuture.de/album_page.php?pic_id=14785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and June 2017 Simutrans was downloaded from [[Sourceforge]] over 5.6 million times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/simutrans/files/stats/timeline?dates=2001-07-10+to+2017-07-16 Simutrans - stats] on [[sourceforge.net]] (June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Social software]]''' is used in '''[[education]]'''. This use of social software is discussed here, with an emphasis on how research results can inform the practice of teachers and learners.

==Background==

===Software for Learning Becoming Social===

Stereotypical views of software suggest that it is written by [[nerd]]s and used by individuals, but the reality may be different.  Any significant or established piece of software is likely to be the result of a collaborative effort by software developers {{Harv|Brooks|1995}}, working together or building on someone's previous work. Figure 1 appears to show students working individually at their computers.
At face value, this use of software does not seem to be very social but the reality could be different, with students engaging in online chats, sending emails, posting in discussion forums with friends and acquaintances, near and far.  Even where only one person is using the computer, everyone around can be joining in and having fun, as in Figure 2.

Software on a single computer being used in a classroom can be seen as an activity in a social setting. The student using the computer may talk to the teacher and other students, asking for help, sharing information and reactions to their experiences of the software in use.
A study of young children’s use of a program for drawing and writing found that they were not only reading printed texts and writing on paper but also engaging in multimedia, computer-based composition {{Harv|Labbo|1996}}.  This effect has also been observed with students using a shared system.  An experiment with Group Decision Support Systems revealed university students’ appreciation of and benefit from the information structuring and sharing features of the system (Alavi, 1994).

A more recent exploratory video study into young people's use of games consoles reveals that individual use takes places in a rich social context.

“''Games intended to engage a single player were shown to incorporate cooperation with, and the contribution of, others.''” (Schott &amp; Kambouri, 2006).

This study found examples where collaborative play was more effective for learning than explicit instruction.

Others believe that software can enable the engineering of social interaction. One approach to using software for learning aligns with a [[Social Software|programmatic]], step by step approach to learning that fits with learning as instruction, knowledge as transmission (see Table 1). The claim is that learning and other social activities can be programmed just like a computer.  The "Games, Action, and Social Software" group at Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS):

“''argue that the issue of constructing and verifying social procedures, which Professor Rohit Parikh suggestively calls social software, be pursued as systematically as computer software is constructed and analysed by computer scientists.'' (see "What is Social Software? ,")” (NIAS, 2006) [http://www.nias.knaw.nl/en/press_releases/rohit_parikh/].

This [[Social Software|programmatic]] approach is evident in variants of online course design.   others being described in the context of Web 2.0 technologies that view the trend towards great [[social networking]] online as simply an evolution of [[elearning]] rather than a major paradigm shift. The utilisation of social software, however, is not simply a new way to teach content, it is method that shifts our relationship with knowledge to include a greater emphasis on peer-to-peer sharing of knowledge, towards more flexible sharing (favouring wikis and web sites over formal journals and copyright) and more ephemeral knowledge (the constantly updating world of blogs and RSS feeds (Mason and Rennie, 2008). Researchers have consequently explored a changing educational landscape where social networking (using a whole variety of new applications) is no longer the one-way transmission of knowledge, but a collaborative process of research and sharing that is no longer linear, not necessarily under the full control of the tutor, and places a higher value on the co-creation, sharing, and re-purposing of educational resources, and above all on increased ''interaction'' between the learning participants (Mason and Rennie, 2006).

The term ''social software'' (see later at [http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/Using_social_software_in_learning#Social_Software]) came into popular use from 2003 after Clay Shirky’s influential article on social software and groups (Shirky, 2003) [http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html].  It is fairly straightforward to trace the evolution of social software in parallel with the development of tele-communications and the Internet/WWW (Allen, 2006)[http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html].  The spread of tele-communications networking in the late 1970s was a trigger that led to an increase in ‘social’ uses where users could interact remotely through networked software. Usenet, group chat, and MUDs all developed within the space of 18 months (Shirky, 2003)[http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html].

Text-based games were played on local networks, Arpanet and other networks that preceded the Internet as we know it now. Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) are text-based games that allow players to adopt roles on a complex virtual environment that exists mainly in the players’ imaginations. They rely on text-based communication and invocation of rules programmed into the MUD.  MOOs, introduced in the 1990s are MUDs that can be configured using their own built-in object-oriented language (Bartle, n.d.) [http://www.livinginternet.com/d/di_major.htm].   Though many links to MUDs and MOOs are now dead, you can find some useful information and examples at this site (Jobe, 2000)[http://www.education-world.com/a_tech/tech010.shtml] .  There are links to some useful examples, such as this one where students collaborated online to learn and produce resources ("Water Pollution in Brazil and California," 2002)[http://www.garlic.com/~lullah/brazilus/water.html] . Computer users could get in touch with each other: talk, argue, play, get to know each other. In the 1980s, the possibilities for the use of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) in education became clear (Hiltz &amp; Wellman, 1997). The WELL, Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, an early example of virtual community, started in 1985, forming a meaningful community for members, some of whom met face to face, and others who never met (Rheingold, 1994) (see links at [http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/On-line_communities]). With the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, new opportunities opened up for learning.

===Learning Becoming Social===
[[Informal learning]] has always been social, but trends in education and technology have led to a growth in social learning, even in formal education. Formal institutions for learning, [[schools]], [[colleges]] and [[universities]] have a fairly long history but limited to an elite.  Most of the population of Europe and the United States had no schooling whatsoever until the first half of the nineteenth century (Giddens, 1993), and education for all children has yet to be achieved in all countries.  Education statistics published in May 2008 show that 75 million children were out of school in 2006, down from 103 million in 1999 [http://www.uis.unesco.org/ev.php?ID=7194_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC UNESCO, 2008]. Learning within the family setting, socialisation, is a large part of most children’s learning experiences, it being where they first learn about roles, relationships and responsibilities within the family, the wider community and society, (Alexander &amp; Clyne, 1995).
We also learn about our culture through social groups and through work, by experience and social interaction, sometimes called [[enculturation]].  Young children also learn through [[Play (activity)|play]], often in a social setting with their friends. This is in contrast with formal learning in academic environments that focuses on learning from descriptions of the real world, rather than from direct experience of it.

''“Learning in naturalistic contexts is synergistic with the context; the learning outcome is an aspect of the situation, an aspect of the relation between learner, activity and environment, so it is learning about that world and how it works.”'' (Laurillard, 1993)

As education became a goal of industrial societies, in turn it became the object of study itself.  The twentieth century saw the development of a rich variety of [[Learning theory (education)|learning theories]]  (many outlined in the useful [http://tip.psychology.org/ Theory into Practice database]). It is impossible to categorise these theories but we can identify three themes broadly based on how they interpret and theorise about learning and teaching (see Table 1), and link these to developments in learning technology. We do not suggest that these themes developed in any sequence but rather they are interconnecting strand of thought. Each of these themes has developed over time and enjoyed variable popularity at different times.  In practice, tutors may incorporate elements from any or all of these themes in designing and conducting learning activities with students.

====Instruction – teaching and learning of explicit knowledge and skills====
The first theme is that of instruction, where learning is seen as pre-planned, determined by a teacher or instructor.  Knowledge is understood as something that can be transmitted from teacher to student.  Techniques include programmed learning, tutorials, lectures, and drill-and-practice (Cronje, 2000)[http://itech1.coe.uga.edu/itforum/paper48/paper48.htm].  This approach is seen as traditional, founded on behavioural psychology, e.g. behaviourism "Operant Conditioning  (B.F. Skinner)" (Kearsley, 1994)  [http://tip.psychology.org/skinner.html].  Rather than being superseded by later approaches, we can see ''instruction'' as an ongoing theme, evident in elements of much of the current practice, even where a ''social constructivist'' approach is being adopted.  For example, a UK undergraduate will almost certainly receive some formal lectures, alongside more active learning activities such as simulations and group work.

====Social Constructivism====
Social and experiential theories of learning were increasingly applied to technology-enhanced learning in the third quarter of the twentieth century.  Exponents regard truth as testable in action with observable outcomes, hence always open to criticism and revision (Dewey, 1991).
Constructivism asserts that although humans possess some innate cognitive potentialities, human knowledge is largely constructed (Phillips, 1995). Early constructivist work, e.g. Piaget’s emphasised the individual, but interest grew in social constructivism.  This is an approach, based on phenomenology, that places a greater emphasis on the importance of social interactions in affecting the individual's generation of knowledge or facts about the world.
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:goodyear2.png]] --&gt;

Figure 3 - The Constructivist Shift, after (Goodyear et al., 2001)

Another challenge to theories of rational action was the emphasis on situated action, with plans being formulated pre or post-hoc but abandoned in the messy reality of embodied action.  Two examples of social constructivist approaches are situated cognition, (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989) and situated learning, (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991).

''"Situated cognition theorists suggest that knowledge and the conditions under which is it used are inextricably linked. Social cognitivists indicate that learning is a goal-directed activity that is connected to the social contexts, including people, in which it occurs or is ultimately applied. Both views promote learning in realistically complex contexts that do not decontextualize knowledge and skills from the circumstances in which they are applied."'' (Hannafin, 1997).

Vygotsky’s work, from much earlier in the twentieth century, has been re-appraised in the new context of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Vygotsky’s emphasis on language as a tool for mediation in the social process of education, and the agency of the teacher and more experienced peers in the educational development of the individual, assumed new significance in the use of CMC in education (Bacalarski, 1994) [http://psych.hanover.edu/vygotsky/bacalar.html]. Like Dewey, Vygotsky viewed meaning and experience as primarily social.

Moore's transactional distance theory is characterised along three axes
''"There are three key variables to consider regarding transactional distance: structure, dialogue, and learner autonomy. Structure is determined by the actual design of the course, the organization of the instruction, and the use of various media of communications. There are also different forms of dialogue: two-way, real-time communication versus dialogue internalized within the student. Finally, learner autonomy depends upon the individual learner's sense of personal responsibility and self-directedness. "''  (Transactional Distance Theory, 2002) [http://cde.athabascau.ca/cmc/transactional.html]

====Critical pedagogy – learning as empowerment====
In critical pedagogies, knowledge is seen as inseparable from the power relations that exist in its context. Paolo Freire and Ivan Illich have been key 20th Century influences on those who challenge societal and power relations that underpin institutions such as schools and universities, formal education systems

Illich promoted the idea of '''Deschooling''' in a critique of education that had four aspects:

•	The process of '''institutionalization''' that can undermine people’s autonomy and creativity

•	'''Experts and expertise''' that can control knowledge production and can remove power from individuals to decide on what is knowledge and how they can shape their environment

•	'''Commodification''', whereby learning is treated as a commodity that can be controlled and priced above the means of many, making it scarce rather than available – “a thing rather than an activity”.

•	The '''principle of counterproductivity''',  the means by which a fundamentally beneficial process or arrangement is turned into a negative one. 'Once it reaches a certain threshold, the process of institutionalization becomes counterproductive'.  In schools that have reached a certain threshold of institutionalization, students can stop learning and even unlearn (Smith, 1997a) [http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-illic.htm].

These ideas are particularly interesting in societies where the Internet is widely diffused. The Internet offers people opportunities to access vast amounts of data, but on the other hand the data can be structured in highly commodified ways.

Freire’s work has had significant influence on informal education, and his emphasis on conversational rather than curricular forms of education can give insights into the effective use of social software in learning.  His work was practical and his ‘pedagogy of the oppressed’ was concerned with how people’s experience of education could help them to change their lives (Smith, 1997b)[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-freir.htm].

Lundin has characterized as feral learning, the learning that people engage in to satisfy learning needs that emerge in their day-to-day lives, using search engines, networks of contacts (Lundin,1998)  [http://science.uniserve.edu.au/newsletter/vol13/lundin.html].

In Open Source Software (OSS) Development communities, developers, testers and users work collaboratively to create a common good, software whose licence is open to further adaptation and improvement.  Examples in education can be found at School Forge (Schoolforge.net, 2008)[http://www.schoolforge.net/].
There is also a growing Open Content (OC) movement that seeks to make educational resources freely available, through information and communication technologies as they become globally diffused.  The Cape Town Declaration (not without its detractors) encapsulates some of the lofty goals of this movement (The Cape Town Open Education Declaration, 2007)[http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/].  “The Open Data Commons – Public Domain Dedication &amp; Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions.” (Open Data Commons, n.d.) [http://www.opendatacommons.org/]. In both OSS and OC, social software is key to the creation, improvement and dissemination of the products of these communities.

====Formal and Informal Learning====
We all continue to learn throughout our lives, mostly outside of formal education programmes and institutions. Even where education is formally organized, as in schools, colleges and universities, student learning undertaken under the control or initiative of the learner can be seen as informal.  The following examples illustrate the variety of sectors and contexts:

•	Students from different countries engaging in collaboration online to solve a problem: formally they learn about problem-solving and informally they learn about each other’s cultures, see http://www.cabweb.net, and http://tlgplace.ning.com

•	Older people with coronary heart disease engaging in a virtual community to learn more about their condition and how to live with it, see http://www.heartsofsalford.net

•	Trades union members, see http://www.workersliberty.org/

•	Genealogy enthusiasts joining list servers and discussion forums to get answers to questions, and incidentally from learning about search techniques, software and approaches to data organization, see http://www.genesreunited.com/  and http://www.freebmd.org.uk/ that is engaged in the collaborative transcription of Civil Registration index of births, marriages and deaths for England and Wales

====Summary====
Two trends emerge in learning, particularly within the context of technology use. The first trend is the towards the social, often in formal group work or informal study groups or associations that may extend way beyond a class cohort. The social construction of knowledge relies heavily on dialogue, and this may be between students and possibly a teacher within a group.  Social software can give very effective support to, not only dialogue, but also non-verbal and non-direct forms of communication . The second is the rise in informal learning, where the potential for power shifts to occur and for learners to form their own groups and associations is very important.  This too can be supported by social software.  How social software supports these two themes for educational purposes has recently been reviewed by Mason and Rennie (2008).

==Definitions==

===Social Presence===
Rourke, Anderson, Garrison &amp; Archer (1999) define '''social presence''' as the ability of learners to project themselves socially and affectively into an online community of inquiry. Three categories of response are identified:

'''Affective''' - the expression of emotion, feelings, and mood

'''Interactive'''  - those that show that someone else is attending to the poster

'''Cohesive''' - those that draw the community together (sometimes called weaving)

They offer social presence density calculation as an important quantitative description of computer conferencing environments (Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, &amp; Archer, 1999)
[http://cade.athabascau.ca/vol14.2/rourke_et_al.html].
Research has also shown that communication richness may be revealed by the application of critical social theory. [People communicating via electronic media] "''perform social acts in action situations that are normatively regulated by, and already have meaning within the organisational context''" (Ngwenyama &amp; Lee, 1997) [http://www.coba.usf.edu/departments/isds/faculty/abhatt/rm/Ngwenyama97-CST.pdf].
An example of this could the power relations that underpin a set of text messages between a group of young people where meaning could only be understood within that social context. A bullying text from a stranger would have a very different impact.

===Social Network Sites===
In a recent review paper, boyd and Ellison define social network sites “as web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system. The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary from site to site” (boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007)[http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html].
This Commoncraft video gives an excellent explanation of Social Networking (LeFever, 2007) [https://www.youtube.com/v/x66lV7GOcNU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1].

===Social Software===
Social software can be defined as software that supports group communication (Shirky, 2003)[http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_politics.html].  In its current manifestations, there are three key activities that social software supports: ''conversational interaction'' between individuals and groups; ''social feedback'' where groups rate the contributions of members; and ''social networks'' where the links between individuals and groups are made visible (S. Boyd, 2006)[http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2006/10/are_you_ready_f.html].It also has the capacity for control and structure to emerge from user interaction rather than solely by design (Dron,2006). For example, in a VLE such as Blackboard, a group is determined and allocated by the instructor or teacher.  In contrast, in a social networking environment, such as elgg, individual users can make many groups and form networks of association by "[[friending]]".  Students told to engage in discussion on a forum visible to their teacher may set up a backchannel (on Instant messaging or mobile phone) to help them manage their 'viewed' discussion.

===Social Translucence===
Erickson and [[Wendy Kellogg|Kellogg]] define socially translucent systems as ones that exhibit three properties - visibility, awareness, and accountability - in supporting social interaction. They make social information visible to help participants to understand what is happening; and to be held accountable for their own actions. They say "In socially translucent systems we believe it will be easier for users to carry on coherent discussions; to observe and imitate others' actions; to engage in peer pressure; to create, notice, and conform to social conventions. We see social translucence as a fundamental requirement for supporting all types of communication and collaboration."  An implication is that participants need to be aware of all three properties and what they mean within the context for the interactions (Erickson &amp; Kellogg, 2002) [http://www.pliant.org/personal/Tom_Erickson/st_TOCHI.html].

===Web 2.0===
Social software predated Web 2.0 and the concept was being used interchangeably with [[social computing]] before this Internet technology construct emerged. However, once introduced, some experts consider the social software as a mere subset of Web 2.0, describing the technology as more current and encompassing since it includes a broad range of web technologies, services, and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Web 2.0-Based E-Learning: Applying Social Informatics for Tertiary Teaching: Applying Social Informatics for Tertiary Teaching|last=Lee|first=Mark|publisher=Information Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781605662947|location=Hershey, PA|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its dominant characteristic involves the use of social software constituted of tools that enable a new wave of online behavior, distributed collaboration, and social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emerging Technologies in Distance Education|last=Veletsianos|first=George|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=2010|isbn=9781897425763|location=Edmonton, AB|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web 2.0 is sometimes called the read/write web, evident through technologies such as Blogs ("What is blogging?," n.d.) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/askbruce/articles/browse/blogging_1.shtml], Wikis ("What is Wiki?," n.d.) [http://www.wiki.com/whatiswiki.htm] and media sharing sites, such as [[YouTube]] and [[Flickr]]. O'Reilly stresses the business opportunities offered by a move to the Internet as platform, harnessing its network effects.  Software is seen as a process of engagement with users, rather than as an artefact that resides on a single device [http://radar.oreilly.com/2006/12/web-20-compact-definition-tryi.html]. Web 2.0 has many applications in education (Anderson, 2005)[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/techwatch/tsw0701b.pdf].

Specific learning frameworks based on Web 2.0 include the so-called [[Computer-supported collaborative learning|E-learning 2.0]], which also draws from the [[Semantic Web]] (SW) hybrid learning technology. This model adds semantic elements to the existing array of Web 2.0 social software applications with the expectation that such combination leverages [[collective intelligence]] and collective knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Web-Based Education: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools and Applications|last=Management Association|first=|publisher=Information Science Reference|year=2010|isbn=9781615209637|location=Hershey, PA|pages=1765}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several examples that demonstrate the efficacy of Web 2.0 when it comes to learning. For instance, there is the case of [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]'s I-Zone forum, which provides Web 2.0 tools such as wikis and blogs, accessible to its employees. According to the company, this platform was able to generate 600 ideas from 10,000 of Cisco's 61,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Software and Web 2.0 Technology Trends|last=Deans|first=Candace|publisher=Information Science Reference|year=2009|isbn=9781605661223|location=Hershey, PA|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Current state of the art==
Social software is evident in commercial and open source services, software and packages.  Examples include:

1. '''reviewing and recommender functions''', such as in the e-commerce site, Amazon

2. 'free' but commercial '''social network services''', such as Facebook and Bebo through their basic functionality and add-on applications

3. '''commercially licensed software''', such as commercial virtual learning environments, that contain elements of support for social interaction e.g. Blackboard, and specific packages such as First Class for communication and collaboration, and Elluminate for online 'live' classrooms

4. '''open source software''' packages that may be free-standing tools, such as forums, or virtual learning environments (also called learning management systems), the most notable of which is Moodle .  Open Source Development projects may have educational support communities or networks associated with them, for example Moodle and Eduspaces (that sprang from the elgg OSS community).

Educators will be looking for appropriate software that can support the three key activities from our definition of social software: conversational interaction between individuals and groups; social feedback where groups rate the contributions of members; and social networks where the links between individuals and groups are made visible.

===Conversational Interaction between Individuals and Groups===
Any virtual learning environment is likely to support conversational interaction through email and discussion forums, within class cohorts and other groups, defined by the institution. Students may use multiple channels  to support social and work-related communication, each occupying its niche, e.g. forums for class-wide discussion, private messaging for personal contact, and email for intra-team communication (Haythornthwaite, 2001.  However, support for social feedback and learner-led groupings like personal social networks is likely to be thin in widely used commercial VLEs, see examples here [http://francesbell.com/2008/03/08/wearing-my-students-shoes/].  Well-established VLEs were predicated on top-down control and organisation, and will need to make radical changes to their architectures to accommodate true social networking features. Blackboard has pursued a policy of adding to functionality by acquiring software that is then incorporated as 'building blocks' but the integration is often superficial. For example, the link to a person's name is more likely to pull up an email form, rather than to their 'linkable' profile and on to their blog, wikis, etc.  Blackboard has ProjectNG on the horizon [http://www.blackboard.com/projectNG/], and promises to incorporate Web 2.0 functionality and OSS content (but not the other way around).  One advantage of an institutional implementation of conversational tools (as a by-product of a VLE) is that student enrolment is managed, and the teacher can concentrate on structuring the activity for pedagogic purposes.

===Social feedback===
Social feedback may come in the form of conversational responses, from students and teachers who are effective communicators and facilitators.  Salmon's 5 Stage model puts facilitating, supporting and responding in the last two stages (Salmon, 2000)[http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml], implying that these are more advanced skills for students.

Emoticons may be used to express a wider range of responses, usually expressed by non-verbal communication: for example to soften negative statements, or to express enthusiastic approval or humour (Bell &amp; Zaitseva, 2005) [http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/viewpdf.asp?j=elea&amp;vol=2&amp;issue=4&amp;year=2005&amp;article=4_Bell_ELEA_2_4_web&amp;id=146.87.255.19].  On the other hand, emoticons may be perceived as childish, or not appropriate in formal education. Emoticons are routinely available in chat rooms and forums in the public domain, but are not currently embedded in every VLE.  For example, Moodle has emoticons but they are not available in current versions of Blackboard.

Social feedback may also be given through the commenting on and rating of contributions, e.g. blog or discussion forum postings, or uploads to photo or video sharing sites.  In Moodle, a teacher can set up scales in Forums, Glossaries and Assignments for students and teachers to rate a student's activity [http://docs.moodle.org/en/Scales].

However, extrinsic rewards can be counter-productive, especially with complex activities, where too much emphasis on the outcome can de-motivate and reduce intrinsic satisfaction (Kohn, n.d.)[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/motivation.html].

Feedback on learning processes can be encouraged through reflective threads in discussion forums, or through the use of reflective journals (offered in Moodle as an activity, and through personal development planning software).  This is not particularly social, as journals are usually one to one between student and teacher.

===Social Networks===
Where social software exhibits 'social translucence', personal social networks may be visible '''implicitly'''.  For example, Moodle offers the chance for participants to see who is in their space or course, and who else is online at the same time, as this screen shot shows.

This knowledge of who is in their course and whether or not they are online may provoke multi-channel communications such as private messages, forum posts and emails that can strengthen participants' personal social networks.  Clicking on Frances Bell's name in the example above would allow logged in users to send her a private message, access her profile (where she may have provided links to other channels such as Skype), and check forum posts she has made.

Free commercial social networks such as Facebook allow individuals to make their personal networks visible '''explicitly''' by use of 'friending' and other relationship management features.

Facebook was started by Mark Zuckerberg and co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes when they were students at Harvard. University networks still use a valid email address to establish membership of a Facebook University network.  Universities have made use of Facebook for social and marketing purposes but there are obstacles to the incorporation of its use into 'official' educational activities. Students may object to academics entering what they see as 'their space', sometimes called the '[[Creepy Treehouse]]' effect (Stein,2008) [http://flexknowlogy.learningfield.org/2008/04/09/defining-creepy-tree-house/].  Institutions may also be wary of their staff instigating dialogue in spaces where they have no control over blocking users or deleting offensive posts, yet being found guilty by association when problems occur.
There is a subtle difference between Blackboard's Sync Facebook application [http://wiki.blackboardsync.com/display/SYNC/About+Blackboard+Sync] that pushes course information out to students and the Open University's Course Profiles
application [http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogarchive/010855.html] that is based on  student self-reporting and open information-sharing of recommendations on course. University of Leicester used Facebook to encourage socialisation between students on an online course.
[http://www.topuniversities.com/student_survival_guide/features/article/face_to_face_or_facebook/]

Two examples of social networking software that takes account of educational needs are elgg and Ning.  Elgg [http://elgg.org/] is an OSS package that facilitates social networks for learning, with v1.0 released in August 2008 [http://news.elgg.org/pg/blog/Dave/read/47/elgg-v10-has-left-the-building], for example the University of Brighton's social network for students and staff Community@Brighton [http://community.brighton.ac.uk/] http://community.brighton.ac.uk/.

Ning is a social networking service that allows users to set up their own networks, all hosted on Ning servers,  usually based around a common interest. There is a 'free' service, funded by advertisements, and a paid-for service with some additional features [http://www.ning.com/].
http://education.ning.com

Drupal [http://drupal.org/], an OSS Content Management System (CMS) is also used for educational purposes, and offers modules to support social networking [http://groups.drupal.org/social-networking-sites].  Implementing your own site using Drupal or elgg gives institutions maximum control over data and functionality but requires an investment of resources in customising, installing and maintaining the site. A Ning network allows a teacher (or anyone) to set up and manage a network fairly easily, but the data resides on a Ning server.

==Implications for practice==
There are four key areas of implications for practice on the use of social software in formal education: academic development; curriculum, delivery and technology design; decisions on what is provided by educational institutions; and digital literacy for social learning.

===Academic Development===
Teachers and Learning Technologists have a challenging task to keep up to date with the results of research and emerging technologies themselves. This can be done through formal channels, such as workshops, training and conferences; or through online networks deploying social software and social networking services. Increasingly, social software is being included in academic delivery to help with both formal assessments and with formative and/or self-help assessments that encompass peer-to-peer learning.

==Critical success factors==
Maximising success in the use of state of the art social software in learning is currently more of an art than a science, given the relative newness of much of the social software and social networking services currently available.  However, teachers and students using social software can be guided by research results from earlier results from the social use of computer-mediated communication.

===Teachers Understanding of Social Software===
Teachers establishing learning activities for students will be guided by social theories of learning and by their knowledge of what different social software packages and services offer in the support of learning.

===ICT Literacy Skills===
Students (and teachers) need to develop ICT literacy skills that enable them to create and engage critically with digital media artifacts, and offer social feedback to their peers.

===Support for Co-Construction of Knowledge===
To enable learning to be constructed (in part at least) by online interaction within a social group, participants should be able to engage in dialogue, through discussion forums, chats and other tools.  Dialogue can focus around ideas or artifacts (such as images, videos and texts).  Knowledge can also be co-constructed through collaborative tools such as Wikis and group blogs.

===Social Networks for Learning===
Both students and teachers can become independent managers of their own learning by seeking, exploring and testing ideas with others within their own social network, beyond the constraints of a classroom.  Each student has their own social network for learning including classmates and others, and that will persist (though changing) beyond the period of their formal education.  Social networking services can assist in this persistence.

==Issues and future directions==
Anderson asserts that social software, and the emerging educational semantic web will deliver cost savings and improvements in the effectiveness of distance learning (Anderson 2005) [http://www.unisa.edu.au/odlaaconference/PPDF2s/13%20odlaa%20-%20Anderson.pdf].
Social software is emergent and offered through a variety of tools and services.  This means that VLEs may lag behind Web 2.0 offerings in terms of features, tempting teachers to utilize non-institutional implementations.  Such a decision represents a trade off between reliability and richness: a risk that is more easily managed by an autonomous student than a teacher with professional responsibilities of care.  Teachers and students will negotiate delicate division of responsibilities between the formal, teacher-directed learning supported by institutional software and learning initiated by the learner using tools and in environments most suited to what and how they wish to learn.

==Conclusions==
Teachers experience and reflect on their own use of social software to help them plan and evaluate use with their students. As for students social software is also a vehicle for teachers learning about technology innovations that emerge from design research and human innovation.  The evaluative research on how these innovations become embedded in practice tends to lag behind the innovation itself.  There is, however, a growing body of work on the student experience to ascertain what is appropriate and likely to be effective.

The '''Sounds of Australia''' (formerly known as the National Registry of Recorded Sound), founded in 2007 is the [[National Film and Sound Archive]]'s selection of sound recordings with cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance, which inform or reflect life in Australia.
 
Each year, the Australian public nominates new sounds to be added with final selections determined by a panel of industry experts.

==Recordings==

In this table, '2007a' refers to the 2007 Foundation List (entries chosen before official voting began), while '2007b' refers to the first of the annual registry additions, also in 2007.

Alumni of the Stella Adler-Los Angeles school include [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Benicio Del Toro]], [[Brion James]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[Clifton Collins Jr.]], and [[Sean Astin]].

== Early life ==
Stella Adler was born in the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City.&lt;ref name=note&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSaMu4F06AQC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Stella+Adler+-inauthor:%22Stella+Adler%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA9,M1 Adler Stella] ''Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century'', by Susan Ware, Stacy Lorraine Braukman, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Harvard University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-674-01488-X}}. pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; She was the youngest daughter of [[Sara Adler|Sara]] and [[Jacob P. Adler]],&lt;ref name=ny /&gt; the sister of [[Luther Adler|Luther]] and [[Jay Adler]], and half-sister of Charles Adler and Celia Adler, star of the Yiddish Theater. All five of her siblings were actors. The Adlers comprised the Jewish-American Adler acting dynasty, which had its start in the [[Yiddish Theater District]] and was a significant part of the vibrant ethnic theatrical scene that thrived in New York from the late 19th century to the 1950s. Adler became the most famous and influential member of her family. She began acting at the age of four as a part of the Independent Yiddish Art Company of her parents.

== Career ==

Adler began her acting career at the age of four in the play ''Broken Hearts'' at the Grand Street Theatre on the Lower East Side, as a part of her parents' [[Yiddish theatre#Yiddish theater in the Americas|Independent Yiddish Art Company]].&lt;ref name=stel /&gt;&lt;ref name=rich&gt;{{cite book
 |title=The Great Acting Teachers and Their Methods |last=Brestoff |first=Richard
 |authorlink=Richard Brestoff |year=1995 |publisher=[[Smith &amp; Kraus]] |isbn=978-1-57525-012-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up acting alongside her parents, often playing roles of boys and girls. Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible, she studied at public schools and [[New York University]]. She made her London debut, at the age of 18, as Naomi in ''Elisa Ben Avia'' with her father's company, in which she appeared for a year before returning to New York. In London, she met her first husband, Englishman Horace Eliashcheff; their brief marriage, however, ended in a divorce.

Adler made her English-language debut on Broadway in 1922 as the Butterfly in ''The World We Live In'', and she spent a season in the [[vaudeville]] circuit. In 1922–23, the renowned [[Russians|Russian]] actor-director [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] made his only U.S. tour with his [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. Adler and many others saw these performances, which had a powerful and lasting impact on her career and the 20th-century American theatre.&lt;ref name=note /&gt; She joined the [[American Laboratory Theatre]] in 1925; there, she was introduced to Stanislavski's theories, from founders and Russian actor-teachers and former members of the [[Moscow Art Theater]]—[[Richard Boleslavsky]] and [[Maria Ouspenskaya]]. In 1931, with [[Sanford Meisner]] and [[Elia Kazan]], among others, she joined the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], New York, founded by [[Harold Clurman]], [[Lee Strasberg]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]], through theater director and critic, Clurman, whom she later married in 1943. With Group Theatre, she worked in plays such as ''Success Story'' by John Howard Lawson, two [[Clifford Odets]] plays, ''[[Awake and Sing!]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and directed the touring company of Odets's ''Golden Boy'' and ''More to Give to People''. Members of Group Theatre were leading interpreters of the method acting technique based on the work and writings of Stanislavski.

In 1934, Adler went to Paris with Harold Clurman and studied intensively with Stanislavski for five weeks. During this period, she learned that Stanislavski had revised his theories, emphasizing that the actor should create by imagination rather than memory. Upon her return, she broke away from Strasberg on the fundamental aspects of method acting.&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;''Twentieth Century Actor Training: Principles of Performance'', by Alison Hodge. Routledge, 2000. {{ISBN|0-415-19451-2}}. p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1937, Adler moved to Hollywood. There, she acted in films for six years under the name Stella Ardler, occasionally returning to the Group Theater until it dissolved in 1941. Eventually, she returned to New York to act, direct, and teach, the latter first at [[Erwin Piscator]]'s [[Dramatic Workshop]] at the [[New School for Social Research]], New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oR_4rVfE438C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Stella+Adler+-inauthor:%22Stella+Adler%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA15,M1 Stella Adler] ''Great Jewish Women'', by Elinor Slater, Robert Slater. Published by Jonathan David Company, Inc., 1994. {{ISBN|0-8246-0370-2}}. pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; before founding [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting]] in 1949. In the following  years, she taught [[Marlon Brando]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Manu Tupou]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Melanie Griffith]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], and [[Warren Beatty]], among others, the principles of characterization and script analysis. She also taught at the New School,&lt;ref name=book&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D81E3AF937A3575AC0A96E948260 Theater; Stella Adler In Her Latest Role: Author] ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Yale School of Drama]]. For many years, Adler led the undergraduate drama department at New York University,&lt;ref name=stel /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/fa/adler.stella.bio.html Stella Adler (1901–1992) – Biographical Sketch] ''[[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]], University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of America's leading acting teachers.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stella Adler was much more than a teacher of acting. Through her work she imparts the most valuable kind of information—how to discover the nature of our own emotional mechanics and therefore those of others. She never lent herself to vulgar exploitations, as some other well-known so-called "methods" of acting have done. As a result, her contributions to the [[Presentational acting and Representational acting|theatrical culture]] have remained largely unknown, unrecognized, and unappreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Stella.

:—Marlon Brando&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1988, she published ''The Technique of Acting'' with a foreword by Marlon Brando.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; From 1926 until 1952, she appeared regularly on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Her later stage roles include the 1946 revival of ''He Who Gets Slapped'' and an eccentric mother in the 1961 black comedy ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad''. Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green/Kurt Weill antiwar musical ''Johnny Johnson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwVlkTBSCugC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Stella%20Adler%20-inauthor:%22Stella%20Adler%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA1,M1|title=Acting Now: Conversations on Craft and Career|first=Edward|last=Vilga|date=January 1, 1997|publisher=Rutgers University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in only three films: ''Love on Toast'' (1937), ''[[Shadow of the Thin Man]]'' (1941), and ''My Girl Tisa'' (1948). She concluded her acting career in 1961, after 55 years. During that time, and for years after, she became a renowned acting teacher.&lt;ref name=rich /&gt;

== Stanislavski and the method ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
Adler was one of the few American actors to study with Konstantin Stanislavski. She was a prominent member of the Group Theatre, but differences with [[Lee Strasberg]] over the [[Stanislavski's system]] (later developed by Strasberg into [[method acting]]) made her leave the group. She once said: "Drawing on the emotions I experienced — for example, when my mother died — to create a role is sick and schizophrenic. If that is acting, I don't want to do it."

Adler met with Stanislavski again later in his career and questioned him on Strasberg's interpretation. He told her that he had abandoned emotional memory, which had been Strasberg's dominant paradigm, but that they both believed that actors did not have what is required to play a variety of roles already instilled inside them, and that extensive research was needed to understand the experiences of characters who have different values originating from different cultures.

Like Stanislavski, Adler understood the "gold hidden" inside the circumstances of the text. Actors should stimulate emotional experience by imagining the scene's "given circumstances," rather than recalling experiences from their own lives. She also understood that 50% of the actors job is internal (imagination, emotion, action, will) and 50% is externals (characterization, way of walking, voice, fencing, sports). To find what works for the character, the actors must study the circumstances of the text and make their choices based on what one gets from the material.

For instance, if a character talks about horse riding, one needs to know something about horse riding as an actor, otherwise one will be faking. More importantly, one must study the values of different people to understand what situations would have meant to people, when those situations might mean nothing in the actor's own culture. Without this work, Adler said that an actor walks onto the stage "naked". This approach is one for which both Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro became famous.

Adler also trained actors' sensory imagination to help make the characters' experiences more vivid. She believed that mastery of the physical and vocal aspects of acting was necessary for the actor to command the stage, and that all body language should be carefully crafted and voices need to be clear and expressive. She often referred to this as an actor's "size" or "worthiness of the stage". Her biggest mantra was perhaps "in your choices lies your talent", and she encouraged actors to find the most grand character interpretation possible in a scene; another favorite phrase of hers regarding this was "don't be boring".

Singer-songwriter [[Janis Ian]] studied under Adler in the early 1980s to help her feel more comfortable on stage, and the two women remained close friends until Adler's death.  In her autobiography ''Society's Child'' (2008), Ian recalled that Adler had little patience for students who weren't progressing as she wanted, going so far on one occasion as to give one of her students a dime and tell her to call her mother to pick her up because "she had no business in the theater." On another occasion, Ian relates, Adler forcibly ripped a dress off another actress's body to get the actress to play a scene a different way.

Devo Cutler-Rubenstein credits Stella Adler for inspiring her that a character is made real through one's imagination.  She cites a story when she studied with Stella Adler who slowly peeled her bra off under her clothes, while lecturing about Tennessee Williams in Los Angeles, "You listened to me, didn't you, because you were fascinated with what I was doing with my bra?" Devo says Stella insisted on the truth living in our imagination and that was "unending pool of information and research to be accessed."

== Personal life ==
Adler married three times, first to Horace Eliascheff, the father of her only child Ellen, then from 1943 to 1960 to director and critic [[Harold Clurman]], one of the founders of the Group Theatre. She was finally married to [[physics|physicist]] and novelist [[Mitchell A. Wilson]], who died in 1973. From 1938 to 1946, she was sister-in-law to actress [[Sylvia Sidney]]. Sidney was married to her brother Luther at the time and provided Stella with a nephew. Even after Sidney and Luther divorced, she and Sylvia remained close friends.

== Death ==
On December 21, 1992, Adler died from [[heart failure]] at the age of 91 in Los Angeles. She was survived by her daughter Ellen, her sister Julia, and two grandchildren, including Tom Oppenheim, current president and artistic director of the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York.&lt;ref name="ny" /&gt; She was interred in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in [[Glendale, Queens|Glendale, New York]].

== Legacy ==

Adler's technique, based on a balanced and pragmatic combination of imagination and memory, is hugely credited with introducing the subtle and insightful details and a deep physical embodiment of a character.&lt;ref name="barton" /&gt; Elaine Stritch once said: "What an extraordinary combination was Stella Adler—a goddess full of magic and mystery, a child full of innocence and vulnerability."&lt;ref name="barton" /&gt; In the book ''Acting: Onstage and Off'', [[Robert Barton (actor)|Robert Barton]] wrote: "[Adler] established the value of the actor putting himself in the place of the character rather than vice versa ... More than anyone else, Stella Adler brought into public awareness all the close careful attention to text and analysis Stanislavski endorsed."&lt;ref name="barton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barton|first=Robert|title=Acting: Onstage and Off|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-89886-4|pages=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Stella Adler was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/06/theater/on-stage-and-off.html|title=On Stage, and Off|publisher=New York Times|date=December 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] acquired Adler's complete archive along with a small collection of her papers from her former husband [[Harold Clurman]]. The collection includes correspondence, manuscripts, typescripts, lecture notes, photographs, and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00504|title=Stella Adler and Harold Clurman: An Inventory of their Papers in the Performing Arts Collection at the Harry Ransom Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,100 audio and video recordings of Adler teaching from the 1960s to the 1980s have been digitized by the Center and are accessible on site. The archive traces her career from her start in the New York [[Yiddish Theater District]] to her encounters with Stanislavski and the Group Theatre to her lectures at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting.&lt;ref name=hansom&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/news/2004/04/26/nr_hrc-2/ Ransom Center acquires Stella Adler archive] The University of Texas at Austin, April 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, she was honored with a posthumous [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in front of the Stella Adler Theatre at 6773 Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Aug04/0,4670,PeopleStellaAdler,00.html Adler Gets Posthumous Hollywood Walk Star] ''[[Fox News]]'', Friday, August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Student Police Cadet (SPC) Project''' is a school-based initiative by [[Kerala Police]], implemented jointly by the Departments of Home and Education, and supported by Departments of Transport, Forest, Excise and Local Self-Government. The project trains high school students to respect the law, practice discipline and civic sense, and develop empathy for vulnerable sections of society. It also strengthens commitment towards family, community, and the environment, enabling them to resist negative tendencies such as substance abuse, deviant behavior, intolerance, and other social evils.

The Project was launched on 2 August 2010 in 127 high schools/higher secondary schools across [[Kerala]],&lt;ref&gt;Biju Govind [http://www.hindu.com/2010/08/02/stories/2010080257040700.htm] "VS to launch Student Police Cadet Project" ''The Hindu'' 2 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with 11176 students, both boys and girls, enrolled as Cadets and 254 teachers trained as school-level Community Police Officers (CPOs).&lt;ref&gt;"126 teachers to become Community Police Officers" [http://www.hindu.com/2010/11/14/stories/2010111458400300.htm], "The Hindu" 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the project was expanded to cover a total of 249 high schools across Kerala,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralacm.gov.in/index.php/home/34-frontslider/711-student-police-cadet-to-be-extended-to-100-more-schools-cm]"student-police-cadet-to-be-extended-to-100-more-schools" ''Official website of Chief Minister of Kerala''&lt;/ref&gt; with a combined strength of nearly 16,000 SPCs and 500 CPOs.

==Genesis==
The program has its roots in Janakeeyam, a community-level initiative by [[Kochi]] City police, in 2006. During the event, more than 400 high school students from 30 local schools interacted with police officers, engaging in wide-ranging discussions on community issues and visiting police stations. During these discussions, the students expressed a desire to have a permanent arrangement for ongoing communication with the police. Accordingly, a pilot Student-Police project was launched on an experimental basis in a few selected schools .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/12/07/stories/2009120754320400.htm] "State mulling Student Police Cadet", N J Nair, ''The Hindu'', 7 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, at Kozhikode in January 2010, a squad of specially trained high school students was entrusted with the responsibility of crowd management at [[Kerala School Youth Festival]], Asia's largest youth-focused cultural festival involving more than 10,000 participants. Following the successful execution of this task by the cadets, and in light of the success stories from project-implemented schools, a detailed proposal for a statewide school-based training programme was prepared under the guidance of Sri '''[[Jacob Punnoose]]''' IPS (DGP-Kerala) and submitted to the Government of Kerala. On the basis of this report, Government of Kerala issued GO (P)121/2010/Home dated 29 May 2010, with the stated objective of moulding a generation of law-abiding, socially committed and service-oriented youth. A state-level Advisory Committee was constituted with Sri. Jacob Punnoose IPS (DGP-Kerala) as chairman, senior Government officials as members, and Sri '''[[P Vijayan]]''' IPS as State Nodal Officer for the SPC Project.

==Features==
* The SPC Project is an association between the educational and law enforcement authorities in a community.
* The project is composed of a structured two-year training programme to develop students as responsible citizens who manifest respect for the law, civic sense, empathy for vulnerable sections of society, and resistance to social evils as lifelong personal habits.
* The project creates youth willing to react against social evils by ensuring safe and healthy academic environments, drug-and narcotic-free premises and reinforcement of positive values among students in schools.
* The project stimulates parents and community leaders to work in cooperation with law enforcement authorities to create safe and healthy communities
* The project catalyses community-level activities to promote better use of natural resources, by encouraging habits that are minimally harmful to the environment.
* The project makes use of existing law enforcement infrastructure to promote the physical, psychological and educational development of youth.

The SPC project seeks to deepen the social democratic fabric of communities by evolving young minds into enlightened citizens who obey laws not by enforcement but rather as a natural and rational act. The Student Police Cadet Project does not create more policemen, instead it seeks to grow the policeman within each young member of their communities. The SPC project can be expected to generate significant long-term benefits such as greater internal security, healthier and safer communities, and responsible future citizens of a stable democracy.

==Vision==
A humane and just society where citizens respect and follow laws willingly, practice responsible behavior towards others, demonstrate empathy for weaker sections of society, participate in tackling community issues and resist threats to the natural environment.

==Mission==
To unlock the potential of youth by systematic training and make them capable of becoming social leaders with global vision guided by humanitarian values.

== Objectives ==
* To mould a generation of youth who willingly respect and abide by Law, and who practice civic sense, democratic behavior and selfless service to society as the natural way of life.
* To facilitate development of good health, physical and mental fitness, self-control and discipline in youth, thereby enhancing their capacity for hard work and personal achievement.
* To enable youth to work with police and other enforcement authorities including Forest, Transport, and Excise in preventing crime, maintaining law and order, promoting road safety, and improving internal security and disaster management.
* To develop social commitment in youth and empower them against deviant behavior in themselves and others, thereby preventing growth of social evils such as drug and alcohol abuse, intolerance, vandalism, separatism, and terrorism in society.
* To enable youth to explore and develop their inner potential in achieving success, by inculcating in them leadership, teamwork skills, innovative thinking and problem solving ability.
* To increase knowledge and understanding of effective use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) among youth, preventing its negative influence and enabling them to benefit from the vast potential of ICT.
* To motivate youth to develop secular outlook, respect for other's fundamental rights and willingness to carry out their fundamental duties as enshrined in the Constitution of India by developing in them qualities of Patriotism, Open-mindedness, Large-heartedness, Inclusiveness, Capability and Effectiveness (POLICE)

The objectives of the Student Police Cadet project are synchronous with the goals of the National Youth Policy of India which seeks to involve youth in the noble work of nation-building.

== SPC training programme ==

SPC training consists of a two-year programme with a focus on developing health and physical fitness, instilling social values, exploring inner capability and inculcating community living skills within students. There are five components of the programme, viz. Physical (Outdoor) Training, Indoor Training (Study Classes), Field Visits, Practical Training Projects, and Camps.

===Community Projects===

Leadership capabilities of SPCs are strengthened through awareness classes and self-development workshops, and through community activities targeting issues such as road safety,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-18/kochi/31361098_1_red-cards-violators-zebra-lines] "Student police cadets nab traffic violators", ''Times of India'' 18 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/article3359818.ece]''The Hindu'', 27 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; drug and substance abuse, environmental protection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/article3874163.ece] "Student Police Cadets to be roped in to help boot out waste", Anand Haridas, "The Hindu", 8 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and aspects of law and crime.

==Executive Hierarchy==

SPC Project implementation machinery is made up of a three-tier structure of specially designated officials at State, District and School-levels. The highest ranking executive official of the project is the State Nodal Officer – SPC Project. [[P Vijayan]] IPS, a senior police officer of the 1999 Kerala cadre, is the first (and current) State Nodal Officer of the SPC Project.

In each District, a police officer of suitable rank appointed as District Nodal Officer. Wherever there are SPC schools, the local Police Inspector with jurisdiction is designated as Police Student Liaison Officer (PSLO), with field-level responsibility of project implementation in the school(s) falling in that jurisdiction. PSLO reports to DNO on project implementation on a regular basis.
 
== Project administration ==

Project administration is carried out by Committees at the State, District and School levels. The State-level Advisory Committee is the highest policy-making body in the SPC hierarchy, with authority to approve selection of schools, formulate guidelines for project implementation, issue directions to SPC programme officials, and ensure adherence to project guidelines by all stakeholders. The Committee consists of senior Government officials from the various associating Departments, and is chaired by the State Police Chief. There are also district-level Advisory Committees, and school-level Advisory Committee

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11088">'''Universal Design for Learning''' ('''UDL''') is an educational framework based on research in the learning sciences, including cognitive neuroscience, that guides the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate individual learning differences.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, DH, &amp; Meyer, A (2002) ''Teaching Every Student in the Digital Age: Universal Design for Learning'' Alexandria, VA: ASCD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing that the way individuals learn can be unique, the UDL framework, first defined by David H. Rose, Ed.D. of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Orkwis, R, &amp; McLane, K (1998). A curriculum every student can use: Design principles for student access. ERIC/OSEP Topical Brief No. ED423654. Reston, VA: ERIC/OSEP Special Project.&lt;/ref&gt; calls for creating curriculum from the outset that provides:

* ''Multiple means of representation'' to give learners various ways of acquiring information and knowledge,
* ''Multiple means of expression'' to provide learners alternatives for demonstrating what they know, and
* ''Multiple means of engagement'' to tap into learners' interests, challenge them appropriately, and motivate them to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002, p. 75;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CAST (2008) Universal design for learning guidelines 1.0. Wakefield, MA: CAST. Retrieved July 1, 2008 from {{cite web |url=http://www.cast.org/publications/UDLguidelines/version1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518032704/http://cast.org/publications/UDLguidelines/version1.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curriculum, as defined in the UDL literature, has four parts: instructional goals, methods, materials, and assessments.&lt;ref name="Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002"&gt;Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; UDL is intended to increase access to learning by reducing physical, cognitive, intellectual, and organizational barriers to learning, as well as other obstacles. UDL principles also lend themselves to implementing inclusionary practices in the classroom.

Universal Design for Learning is referred to by name in American legislation, such as the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008 (Public Law 110-315),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udlcenter.org/advocacy/referencestoUDL/HEOA Legislative Overview, Universal Design for Learning Task Force ]&lt;/ref&gt; the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Assistive Technology Act of 1998. The emphasis being placed on equal access to curriculum by all students and the accountability required by IDEA 2004 and No Child Left Behind legislation has presented a need for a practice that will accommodate all learners.&lt;ref&gt;Karger, J. (2005). What IDEA and NCLB suggest about curriculum access for students with disabilities. In DH Rose, A Meyer, &amp; C Hitchcock, Eds. ''The Universally Designed Classroom: Accessible Curriculum and Digital Technologies.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The concept and language of Universal Design for Learning was inspired by the [[universal design]] movement in architecture and product development, originally formulated by [[Ronald L. Mace]] at [[North Carolina State University]].&lt;ref name="Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002"/&gt; Universal design calls for "the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciples.htm |title=Center for Universal Design, NCSU |access-date=2008-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513071023/http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciples.htm |archive-date=2008-05-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; UDL applies this general idea to learning: that curriculum should, from the outset, be designed to accommodate all kinds of learners.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer &amp; Rose, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Educators have to be deliberate in the teaching and learning process in the classroom (e.g Preparing class learning profiles for each student). This will enable grouping by interest. Those students that have challenges will be given special assistance. This will enable specific multimedia to meet the needs of all students. 
However, recognizing that the UD principles created to guide the design of things (e.g., buildings, products) are not adequate for the design of social interactions (e.g., human learning environments), researchers at CAST looked to the neurosciences and theories of progressive education in developing the UDL principles.&lt;ref&gt;Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002; CAST, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] and, less directly, [[Benjamin Bloom]] informed the three-part UDL framework.&lt;ref&gt;CAST, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Some educational initiatives, such as [[Universal design for instruction|Universal Design for Instruction]] (UDI) and [[Universal Instructional Design]] (UID), adapt the Mace principles for products and environments to learning environments, primarily at the postsecondary level. While these initiatives are similar to UDL and have, in some cases, compatible goals, they are not equivalent to UDL and the terms are not interchangeable; they refer to distinct frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, JM, Scott, SS, &amp; Shaw, SF (2006). Universal design and its applications in educational environments. ''Remedial and Special Education 27''(3), 166-175&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, UDI practices promoted by the [[The DO-IT Center|DO-IT Center]] operationalize both UD and UDL principles to help educators maximize the learning of all students.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, S., "Equal Access: Universal Design of Instruction", 2011, "[http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/equal_access_udi.html]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation initiatives in the US==
In 2006, representatives from more than two dozen educational and disability organizations in the US formed the National Universal Design for Learning Taskforce. The goal was to raise awareness of UDL among national, state, and local policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;National Taskforce on UDL, www.udl4allstudents.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizations represented in the National Task Force on UDL include the National School Boards Association, the National Education Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the National Association of State Directors of Special Education (NASDSE), the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), the Council for Learning Disabilities (CLD),the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), the National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCLD), the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), Easter Seals, American Foundation for the Blind (AFB), Association on Higher Education and Disability, Higher Education Consortium for Special Education (HECSE), American Occupational Therapy Association, National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE), National Down Syndrome Congress (NDSC), Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA), TASH, the Arc of the United States, the Vocational Evaluation and Career Assessment Professionals Association (VECAP), the National Cerebral Palsy Association, and the Advocacy Institute.&lt;ref&gt;National Task Force on UDL, www.udl4allstudents.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities have included sponsoring a Congressional staff briefing on UDL in February 2007 and supporting efforts to include UDL in major education legislation for both K-12 and postsecondary.

==Research==
Despite the popularity of UDL among educators and disability support professionals, little research has been conducted to evaluate its effectiveness as a model of good pedagogy. 

UDL can be used in the support of students with disabilities and as well as learning differences.  In actual case studies conducted by Elizabeth McAra-Craford (Araford Education 2015, Halifax, Nova Scotia), applying Universal Design principles expands the ability of students to access needed supports in post-secondary settings.

'''University Without Walls, UMass Amherst''' (UWW) is a department at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (UMass) which provides [[degree completion program|degree completion coursework]], primarily for [[non-traditional students]]. Established in 1971, as of 2013 approximately five-percent of UMass graduates were receiving their undergraduate degrees through the program annually.

==History==
The University of Massachusetts' University Without Walls was one of a number of similar programs founded at 17 American universities in 1971 with the help of a grant from the United States [[Office of Education]] (other participating institutions included the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of South Carolina]], and [[Howard University]]). [[Samuel Baskin]] was considered the "driving force" behind the nationwide initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Hechinger |last=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Education Without Walls |url= |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=28 December 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Mark Cerasuolo became the first University of Massachusetts graduate from the University Without Walls program to deliver the University of Massachusetts' student commencement address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/uww/how-it-works/course-delivery UWW website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, an average of 250 students were annually receiving bachelor's degrees through the UMass University Without Walls program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taras |first=Elizabeth |date=28 January 2014 |title=Opening Doors |url=http://businesswest.com/blog/opening-doors/ |newspaper=Business West |location= |publisher= |accessdate=30 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; out of approximately 5,000 total undergraduate degrees annually awarded by the University of Massachusetts. Between 1971 and 2015, the University of Massachusetts had awarded approximately 3,000 degrees to students through the UWW program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roman|first1=Elizabeth|title=UMass 'University Without Walls' offers informational session in Springfield|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/08/umass_university_without_walls.html|accessdate=24 December 2015|work=The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program enrolls more students who are veterans of the [[U.S. armed forces]] than any other academic department at the University of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umass.edu/uww/welcome-military-families |title=Welcome Military Families |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=umass.edu/uww |publisher=University of Massachusetts |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The UMass University Without Walls program only admits students who have already completed a minimum number of undergraduate university credits at the University of Massachusetts, or at another accredited institution, and have a minimum cumulative [[grade point average]] in those credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schramm|first1=Michael|title=Parents benefit from specialized degree program at UMass Amherst|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/06/09/umass-amherst-parent-degree-program/|accessdate=24 December 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once enrolled, students are required to take four program-specific courses, plus additional classes equal to the difference between their accumulated university credits and the University of Massachusetts' 120-credit graduation requirement. Program-specific courses are taught by dedicated UMass University Without Walls faculty and deal with academic writing, critical thinking, research skills, and issues analysis. Students who require additional courses to meet the 120-credit requirement make up the deficit through standard University of Massachusetts classes taken from the school's other academic departments.

Because the University Without Walls program functions as a regular academic department within the University of Massachusetts, students do not undertake an [[academic major]] (baccalaureate degrees are awarded in "University Without Walls"). Instead, nine interdisciplinary areas of study are offered - including applied psychology, arts administration, and journalism - each consisting of courses from several academic fields drawn from both the student's previously completed credits as well as University of Massachusetts courses he or she completes while enrolled in the program.

===Social justice residency===
Beginning in 2012, the UWW program began offering a "social justice residency," a one-credit, three-day, intensive course held at the University of Massachusetts' Springfield Center that teaches the "theory and practice of social justice activism, particularly as related to racial and economic inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UWW Hosts 3rd Annual Social Justice Residency|url=https://www.umass.edu/uww/node/2067|accessdate=24 December 2015|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts]]|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9687">A '''university counseling center''' ('''UCC''') provides [[mental health]] and other services within a [[university]] or college environment. The need for these services is on the rise. Counseling center directors and other student affairs personnel have reported an increase in the mental health needs of college students, with issues like [[Eating disorder|eating disorders]], [[Substance abuse|alcohol and drug abuse/dependence]], severe [[Mood disorder|depression]]/[[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[Suicidal ideation|suicidality]], and [[sexual assault]] becoming more prevalent in this environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzrow, M. A. (2003). The mental health needs of today’s college students: Challenges and recommendations. The National Association of Student Personnel Administrators Journal, 41, 167-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Big Ten Conference]] universities, directors report a 42% increase in the number of students seen at their counseling centers.&lt;ref&gt;Voelker, R. (2003). Mounting student depression taxing campus mental health services. Journal of the American Medical Association, 289, 2055-2056.&lt;/ref&gt; In a summary of recent survey data, Duenwald also reports that the use of [[psychiatric medication]] has increased almost 10% among college students since the year 2000.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duenwald|first= M. |date=October 2004|title=The dorms may be great, but how's the counseling?|work= [[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/health/psychology/26cons.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; May (2003) finds that a UCC will typically work with 15-20% of students at colleges and 8-12% at a university.&lt;ref name="May"&gt;May, R. (2003). How much is enough?: Reflections on the Report of the Harvard provost's committee on student mental health services. Journal of College Student Psychotherapy, 17, 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Given these numbers, May recommends 1 counselor per 600 students in colleges and a 1:1000 ratio in universities with an average of 5 to 6 sessions per student.&lt;ref name="May"/&gt;

UCCs generally offer a variety of services including individual and group [[counseling]], psychodiagnostic testing, alcohol and other drug counseling/evaluation, crisis assistance, campus outreach programs, consultation services, and graduate student training. Though services primarily target mental health problems (i.e., anxiety, depression), students also utilize counseling services to enhance areas of their life, including relationships, career/vocational choices, academic and athletic performance, and exploring psychological strengths. [[Lehigh University]] Counseling and Psychological Services (UCPS) is an example of a university counseling center.

Another example of a university counseling center is the [[University of California, Irvine]] Counseling Center. In addition to the services mentioned above, the center also offers Peer Programs. Peer Programs offered by the UCI Counseling Center include C.O.A.C.H, The Peer Educator Program, and the LGBTQ Mentorship Program. In these programs, students receive services not from licensed health professionals, but from other students at UCI who have assumed these helping roles. This is a different approach to counseling for students who find more comfort in speaking with fellow peers who they can more easily relate with. Each program has a different focus, whether it be group-based, individual-based, or special needs-based; but all have the same goal—to promote student mental health and well-being in all aspects of life.

== History ==

Early to mid 1940's: University counseling centers began formal operations, responding to the increasing educational and vocational needs of returning [[Veteran|veterans]] of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="AUCCCD"&gt;{{cite web|website=www.aucccd.org|year= 2005|title= About AUCCCD|url=http://www.aucccd.org/about-aucccd-new}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1950: The Association of College Counseling Center Directors (AUCCCD) was established in 1950 by a group of mid-western college and university counseling directors. Dr. Ralph Birdie, director of the Student Counseling Bureau at the [[University of Minnesota, Minneapolis]] hosted the first conference on the UM campus. Annual meetings were hosted throughout the 1950s by several universities including the [[University of Illinois system|University of Illinois]], [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]], [[University of Iowa|State University of Iowa]], [[University of Missouri]], and the [[University of Minnesota]]. In the early days, the organization was referred to as the Annual Conference of College and University Counseling Directors. Conference attendance was based on invitation from participants and grew over time as directors around the country developed collegial relationships with each other. Initially membership was primarily drawn from mid-western institutions, but eventually the annual conference became a national affiliation of directors.

Following World War II, counseling centers were established in response to the educational and vocational needs of returning veterans. Directors were pioneering the development of organized counseling units and recognized their need to "talk shop" - to exchange information with each other and to develop a practical knowledge base on how to best to serve students. They gathered to discuss organizational issues, to share experience about how to work effectively with campus administration, and to discuss the nature of the work with students. An integral part of the annual meeting was the opportunity to develop and nourish collegial friendships through work and recreation in a restful setting.

Directors valued the opportunity to discuss confidential matters with their colleagues and trusted one another with sensitive details that they could not process with fellow administrators on their own campus. Directors were challenged with issues such as managing relations with campus administration and faculty who could be skeptical of the value of counseling students as well as issues related to the management of their staff. Conference attendance was restricted to directors with staffs of at least three [[Full-time equivalent|full-time equivalents]] (FTE) in order to create a confidential environment for consultation.

The annual conference provided the opportunity for both formal and ad hoc presentations, roundtable discussions, and individual consultation. The group was loosely organized as a "non-organization" with a minimum of bureaucracy, and the pivotal activity was the annual meeting. A steering committee was elected annually to manage routine business, and a conference host was chosen from among competing institutions during the conference business meeting.

The formal structure of AUCCCD as we now know it developed slowly through the 1980s with the decision to revise the organization's By-laws and to incorporate as a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]]. Throughout the 1990s several initiatives have been undertaken to develop a formal organizational structure to advance the business of AUCCCD as a national [[Professional association|professional organization]], and to put significant emphasis on advocating on behalf of counseling and psychological issues in higher education. Conference membership increased considerably after the 3 FTE restriction was lifted in the 1990s.

Membership in AUCCCD is institutional, with one director being selected to represent the member college or university. The group has experienced significant growth, with a current membership of 836 universities and colleges throughout the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="AUCCCD"/&gt;
 
1960s: As outpatient psychiatric clinics and services became more accessible to the general public, university counseling centers also began to provide standard psychological services to college students, including individual, couples, and group [[psychotherapy]]; vocational and personality assessment; consultative services to college administration, faculty, parents, and students; and [[crisis management]] among other services to the campus community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The George Washington University Counseling Center|year=2008|title= History of the UCC|url=http://gwired.gwu.edu/counsel/AboutTheUCC/HistoryOfUCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1968: The Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) began formally coordinating pre-doctoral and post doctoral [[Internship|internships]] and jobs. Currently, there are 444 pre-doctoral internships listed through APPIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appic.org/|title=APPIC - Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers|website=www.appic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1978: The Association of Counseling Center Training Agencies (ACCTA) was established to coordinate the training objectives of university counseling centers, including creation and maintenance of pre-doctoral internship and [[practicum]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner, P. P., Casas, J. M., Carter, J., &amp; Stone, G. L. (2000). The maturation of counseling psychology: Multifaceted perspectives, 1978-1998. In S. D. Brown &amp; R. W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5699">The '''University of Timbuktu''' is a collective term for the teaching associated with three mosques in the city of [[Timbuktu]] in what is now [[Mali]]: the masajid ([[mosque]]s) of [[Sankore Madrasah|Sankore]], [[Djinguereber]], and [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]].&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wonders/Episodes/Epi5/5_wondr6.htm |title=Wonders: Sankore Mosque |publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a [[university]] in the modern sense, but a loosely organized scholastic community that endured for many centuries during the medieval period.
{{TOC right}}

==History==
Timbuktu quickly grew in importance by the start of the 12th century, with a thriving economy based on trading salt, gold, spices and dyes. As the wealth of the city grew, it also became a center of learning, attracting scholars and manuscripts.&lt;ref name=LS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/26451-timbuktu.html |title=Timbuktu: History of Fabled Center of Learning |author=Owen Jarus |publisher=[[Live Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It acquired a reputation for learning and scholarship across the Muslim world.

According to African scholar Shamil Jeppie in ''The Meanings of Timbuktu'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...Timbuktu is a repository of history, a living archive which anybody with a concern for African history should be acquainted with. Timbuktu may be hard to get to but it played an essential role as a centre of scholarship under the [[Songhai Empire|Songhay state]] until the invasion from the rulers of Marrakesh in 1591, and even thereafter it was revived.&lt;ref&gt;Shamil Jeppie &amp; Souleymane Bachir Diagne (eds). ''The Meanings of Timbuktu''. HSRC Pess: Cape Town, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Timbuktu was occupied because of the 1591 [[Battle of Tondibi]], the university went into decline.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; In 1593, [[Ahmad al-Mansur|Ahmad I al-Mansur]] cited "disloyalty" as the reason for arresting, and subsequently killing or exiling, many of Timbuktu's scholars, including [[Ahmad Baba al Massufi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hunwick | first= John O.| year=2003 |title= Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire: Al-Sadi's Tarikh al-Sudan down to 1613 and other contemporary documents | publisher=Brill| place=Leiden | |pages=lxii–lxiii | isbn=90-04-12560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The university==
The University of Timbuktu was unlike the modern [[university]] in that there was no central organization or formal course of study. Instead, there were several independent schools, each having its own principal instructor. Students chose their teachers, and instruction took place in mosque courtyards or private residences. The primary focus was on study of the [[Quran]] and Islamic subjects, but academic subjects were also taught,&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; such as "medicine and surgery, astronomy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, language and linguistics, geography, history, as well as art."&lt;ref name=FSTC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/university-sankore-timbuktu |title=The University of Sankore, Timbuktu |publisher=Foundation for Science, Technology and Civilisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers associated with the Sankore mosque and the mosque itself were especially respected for learning.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;

It boasted up to 25,000 students out of a total city population of 100,000.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/119 |title=Timbuktu |publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted scholars associated with the institution include:&lt;ref name=FSTC/&gt;
* [[Mohammed Bagayogo]] (1523-1593), associated with the Sankore masajid
* [[Ahmad Baba al Massufi]] (1556-1627), a student of Mohammed Bagayogo and the author of more than 40 books; deported to Morocco in 1594

==Manuscripts==
{{Main|Timbuktu Manuscripts}}
Of the tens or hundreds of thousands of manuscripts written or copied in Timbuktu, some were taken by the French, the former colonial masters, but many surviving examples had been stored in the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Islamic Studies and Research, Timbuktu's main library, which was completed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/28/timbuktu-library-centuries-african-history |title=Timbuktu library – a treasure house of centuries of Malian history |date=28 January 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM), a terrorist group, took control of the city&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/28/mali-timbuktu-library-ancient-manuscripts |title=Timbuktu mayor: Mali rebels torched library of historic manuscripts |date=28 January 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012. They were forced out by French and Malian government troops the next year, but not before setting fire to two buildings housing many of the manuscripts, including the Ahmed Baba Institute.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Most of the manuscripts had been removed and hidden before the AQIM takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walt |first=Vivienne |url=http://world.time.com/2013/01/28/mali-timbuktu-locals-saved-some-of-their-citys-ancient-manuscripts-from-islamists/ |title=Mali: Timbuktu’s Ancient Manuscripts Are Safe, Preservationists Say &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=World.time.com |date=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victor Mosele''' was a [[Catholic]] [[Xaverian Brothers|Xaverian]] [[missionary]] [[priest]].  He spent 30 years in [[Sierra Leone]] building [[schools]], [[clinics]], and promoting his [[religion]].  At one point, he was in charge of 33 different schools, including 6,000 children.

According to a Xaverian Missionary Newsletter of 1999, Mosele was captured by the rebel army in [[Kambia (Sierra Leone)|Kambia]] near [[Guinea]] on February 11, 1999.  He had turned back in an effort to acquire medicine for the wounded when he was met by the [[Revolutionary United Front|RUF]] rebels and taken to [[Makeni]].

On September 6 he was captured again along with Fr. [[Franco Manganello]] at [[Pamelap]] near the border of [[Guinea]].  In one of Mosele's accounts of his experiences in Sierra Leone, he recalls that the people who captured him had been part of the schools he established.  On October 4, 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] made an appeal at his general audience to the rebel army for peace and for the release of Victor Mosele and Franco Manganello.

==From 2009==
Mosele was at the campus ministry center, [http://www.uwcatholic.org] in [[Madison, WI]], and was then stationed at [[Illinois State University]]'s [http://www.isucatholic.org St. Robert Bellarmine Catholic Center] during the 2009-10 school year. He wrote a book about his experiences titled '''Running For My Life''', which was published in Fall 2006. He died on August 23, 2012 and was buried on August 28, 2012.
