      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10127">Countries regulate the marketing and sale of [[beef]] by observing criteria of [[Cattle]] [[Cadaver|Carcasses]] at the [[Abattoir]] and classifying the carcasses. This classification, sometimes optional, can suggest a market demand for a particular animal's attributes and therefore the price owed to the producer.

== United States grading system ==
In the United States, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA's) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) operates a voluntary beef grading program that began in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United States Standards for Grades of carcass Beef|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meat processor pays for a trained AMS meat grader to grade whole carcasses at the [[abattoir]]. Such processors are required to comply with Food Safety and Inspection Service ([[FSIS]]) grade labeling procedures. The official USDA grade designation can appear as markings on retail containers, individual bags,  or on USDA shield stamps, as well as on legible roller brands appearing on the meat itself.  

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] grading system uses eight different grades to represent various levels of marbling in beef: Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner. The grades are based on two main criteria: the degree of marbling ([[intramuscular fat]]) in the beef, and the maturity (estimated age of the animal at [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]).  Prime has the highest marbling content when compared to other grades, and is capable of fetching a premium at [[restaurant]]s and [[supermarket]]s. As of June 2009, about 2.9% of carcasses grade as Prime.&lt;ref&gt;Salvage, B. (2009) "Leading the Herd", Meat Processing, June 2009, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Choice is the most common grade sold in retail outlets, and represents roughly half of all graded beef.  Select is sold as a cheaper, leaner option in many stores and is the lowest grade typically found for consumer purchase as a steak. Younger cattle (under 42 months of age) tend to be graded as Prime, Choice, Select or Standard, while older cattle are more likely to be graded Commercial, Utility, Canner or Cutter.  These latter grades of beef are used for ground products rather than for consumer sale or food service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beef inspection USDA.jpg|thumb|Inspected carcasses tagged by the USDA]]
Some [[meat science|meat scientists]] {{Who|date=September 2010}} object to the current scheme of USDA grading since it is not based on direct measurement of tenderness, although marbling and maturity are indicators of tenderness. Most other countries' beef grading systems mirror the U.S. model, except for those in the European Union (EU). The EU employs a grading scheme that emphasizes carcass shape and amount of fat covering&lt;ref&gt;Council Regulation (EEC) No 1208/81 of 28 April 1981 determining the Community scale for the classification of carcases of adult bovine animals (OJ L 123, 7 May 1981, p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; instead of marbling and aging. The differences in grading yield incompatible value judgments of beef value in the United States and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrasting appraisals of quality and value of beef carcasses in Spain and the United States|author=Beriain, M. J. |journal=Revue Méd. Vét. Vét.|year= 2013|volume= 164|issue= 7|pages= 337–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most beef offered for sale in [[supermarket]]s in the United States is graded U.S. Choice or Select. U.S. Prime beef is sold to hotels and upscale restaurants, and usually marketed as such.

In 1997, the official standards were revised to restrict the Select grade to A maturity carcasses, and to raise the minimum marbling score to qualify for Choice to modest for B maturity cattle.  These changes were implemented to improve the uniformity and consistency of the grading system.
Yield grades are intended to estimate the pounds of boneless closely trimmed retail cuts from the carcass. Closely trimmed refers to approximately ¼ inch of external fat. Yield grade is determined by considering 4 carcass characteristics: external fat, Kidney, pelvic and heart fat (KPH), Ribeye area (REA), and Hot carcass weight (HCW). The amount of external fat is measured at the ribbed surface between the 12th and 13th ribs. The ribbing of carcasses is described in the U.S. standards for beef grading.  External fat is measured at a distance of ¾ the length of the ribeye from the chine bone end.  This initial number can be adjusted up or down depending on any abnormal fat deposits. As the amount of external fat increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases.

Kidney fat is assessed subjectively and is expressed as a percentage of the carcass weight. As the percentage of KPH increases, the percent of retail cuts decreases. The ribeye area is measured at the ribbed surface, it can be estimated subjectively or measured with a device approved by the AMS.  As ribeye area increase, percent retail cuts increases.  Hot carcass weight is used to determine yield grade. As carcass weight increases, percent retail cuts decrease. The following equation is used to determine yield grade:

:&lt;math&gt;{\text{YG} = 2.5
+ \left(2.5 \times \text{adjusted fat thickness}\right)
+ \left(0.2 \times \text{percent KPH}\right)
+ \left(0.0038 \times \text{HCW}\right)
- \left(0.32 \times \text{REA}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

There are five grades, 1-5.  Yield grade one carcasses are of the highest cutability, while yield grade 5 yields the lowest cutability.

Beef sold in U.S. restaurants and supermarkets is usually described by its USDA grade; however, in the early twenty-first century many restaurants and retailers began selling beef on the strength of [[brand name]]s and the reputation of a specific breed of cattle, such as [[Angus cattle|black Angus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== European Union EUROP Classification ==
The  [[EUROP grid]] method of carcass classification was implemented in 1981. European Economic Community Regulations (EEC) No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R1208:19910429:EN:PDF 1208/81] and No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R2930:19910730:EN:PDF 2930/81] were enacted to facilitate the application of a community scale for the classification of carcases of adult bovine animals. This was to ensure the uniform classification of the carcases of adult bovine animals in the EEC and make the definitions of conformation classes and fat classes more precise. The need arose for a common grading scale when member states of the EEC began operating in the common beef market in 1968 (EEC) No. 805/68 and price reporting to the EC became mandatory.

In the UK, the Meat and Livestock Commission ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101127052714/http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/ MLC Services Ltd]) is responsible for the classification of over 80% of the cattle slaughtered in Britain. The EUROP grid consists of a 5-point scale in which each conformation and fat class is subdivided into low medium and high classes resulting in 15 classes. In the UK, the fat classes range from 1-5 with classes 4 and 5 having a high and low sub-class which results in a seven-point scale for fatness (figure 1). It is argued by the MLC that this subdivision allows a more precise description of the carcase.

The price a farmer receives for a beast sent for slaughter is calculated by multiplying the carcase weight by the classification price for a particular category of animal (heifer, steer, bull, cow etc.). This classification is subjectively assigned by the meat grader according to the EUROP system where E is excellent, U is Very Good, R is Good, O is Fair and P is Poor. Likewise for the fat class, where 1 is Low, 2 is Slight, 3 is Average, 4 is High, and 5 is Very High. A typical classification would be R4L where the R refers to a "Good” carcass with an “Average” to “High” covering of fat according to the [http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/pdf/Beef%20Carcase%20Classification%2021Apr.pdf MLC].

The grader is usually an independent classifier who also monitors carcass dressing specification. Most classifiers are employed by MLC services and they are audited quarterly by the [[Rural Payments Agency|Rural Payments Agency (RPA)]] which is a government organisation. More recently Video [[Image analysis]] has been used to classify beef carcasses according to the EUROP scale. There are several machines that can do this, several of which were [http://www.teagasc.ie/research/reports/foodprocessing/4659/eopr-4659.asp trialled in Ireland]. The [[Republic of Ireland]] has used video image analysis for assignment of the EUROP classification grid since 2004.

Two main problems that are often cited in reference to the EUROP grid are its subjective application and its lack of consideration for meat eating quality.{{Citation needed |date= August 2013}}

In [[German language|German]] linguistics, the '''Benrath line''' (German: ''Benrather Linie'') is the ''maken–machen'' [[isogloss]]: dialects north of the line have the original {{IPA|/k/}} in ''maken'' (to make), while those to the south have the innovative {{IPA|/x/}} (''machen''). The Line runs from Benrath (part of [[Düsseldorf]]) and [[Aachen]] to eastern [[Germany]] near [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in the area of [[Berlin]] and [[Dessau]] and later in Prussian dividing [[Low Prussian dialect]] and [[High Prussian dialect]].

The [[High German consonant shift]] (3rd to 9th centuries AD), in which the (northern) [[Low German]] dialects for the most part did not participate, affected the southern varieties of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] [[dialect continuum]]. This shift is traditionally seen to distinguish the [[High German languages|High German]] varieties from the other [[West Germanic languages]]. 

The impact of the High German consonant shift increases gradually to the South. The Benrath line does not mark the northernmost effect of the High German consonant shift, since the [[Uerdingen line]], the ''ik–ich'' isogloss, lies slightly further north; and some of the peripheral changes associated with the shift did affect Low German.

'''Bindschadler Ice Stream''' ({{Coord|81|00|S|142|00|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is an [[ice stream]] between [[Siple Dome]] and [[MacAyeal Ice Stream]]. It is one of several major ice streams draining from [[Marie Byrd Land]] into the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. The ice streams were investigated and mapped by [[U.S. Antarctic Research Program]] personnel in a number of field seasons from 1983–84 and named Ice Stream A, B, C, etc., according to their position from south to north.

The name of this ice stream was changed from '''Ice Stream D''' by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] (ACAN) in 2001 or 2002 to honor [[Robert A. Bindschadler]] of the [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]], a U.S. Antarctic Project investigator of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] including the dynamics of the Marie Byrd Land ice streams and their interaction with the Ross Ice Shelf, from about 1983 to 1998. In January 2003 the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] accepted this recommendation, revising its 2000 decision; the geographic coordinates were also updated.

[[Shabtaie Ice Ridge]] sits between the MacAyeal and Bundschadler ice streams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1803">In [[fluid mechanics]], '''capillary length''' is a characteristic length scale for an [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] between two fluids which is subject both to [[gravitation]]al acceleration and to a surface force due to [[surface tension]] in the interface.

The capillary length is defined as:&lt;ref name="Batchelor"&gt;G.K. Batchelor, 'An Introduction To Fluid Dynamics', Cambridge University Press (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{c} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\rho g}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitation]]al acceleration and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface tension]] of the fluid-fluid interface.

*For pure [[water]] and [[air]] at standard temperature and pressure, the capillary length is calculated as 2.73&amp;nbsp;mm &lt;ref name="CAH"&gt; {{cite journal|last1= Shi| first1= Z. | last2=et al. | title= Dynamic contact angle hysteresis in liquid bridges.| journal= Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects  | year=2018 | volume=555  | pages= 365-371.|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092777571830606X| doi=10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.004}} &lt;/ref&gt;.
*For a [[soap bubble#Stability|soap bubble]] in [[air]], the capillary length is around 4&amp;nbsp;meters (13 feet).

A [[capillary surface]] that has a characteristic length smaller than the capillary length can be considered a low [[Bond number]] surface. A [[sessile drop]] whose largest dimension is smaller than the capillary length, for example, will take the shape of [[spherical cap]], which is the solution to the [[Young-Laplace equation]] with gravity completely absent.

Materials such as [[stanchion]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Berka | first = Justin | date = 2007-06-21 | title = AT&amp;T's terrible secret of &lt;s&gt;space&lt;/s&gt; crowd control | publisher = Ars Technica | url = https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2007/06/atts-crowd-control-secret.ars}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crowd control barrier]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Aschoff | first = Susan | date = 2005-07-15 | title = Barricades at BayWalk make protesters wary | publisher = St. Petersburg Times | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2005/07/15/Southpinellas/Barricades_at_BayWalk.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; fences and decals painted on the ground can be used to direct a crowd. A common method of crowd control is to use high visibility fencing to divert and corral pedestrian traffic to safety when there is any potential threat for danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.omegaindl.com/blog/portable-pedestrian-barriers|title=Portable Pedestrian Barriers: 15 Uses for the Roll-Up-Fence|date=2017-06-01|work=Omega Industrial Products|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping the crowd comfortable and relaxed is also essential, so things like [[awning]]s, [[cooling fan]]s (in hot weather), and [[entertainment]] are sometimes used as well. Thus, restrictive measures and the application of force can actually make crowding more dangerous, for instance during the [[Hillsborough disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-35473732|title=Five Hillsborough myths rejected by jury|last=Turner|first=Richard|date=2016-04-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; For controlling riots and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], see [[riot control]].

Specific products that are used to implement line management and public guidance in high traffic areas include [[retractable belt]] systems (which incorporate a stanchion post and the retractable tape) and wall mount systems (also incorporating a retractable belt but are surface mounted). Post and rope systems are also popular, especially in banks and theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crowd-control-management-solving-queue-problems-suha-abu-ghosh/|title=Crowd Control Management Solving Queue problems in Banking Industry|last=Abughosh|first=Suha|date=|website=LinkedIn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204093854/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crowd%2Dcontrol%2Dmanagement%2Dsolving%2Dqueue%2Dproblems%2Dsuha%2Dabu%2Dghosh/|archive-date=2018-02-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History ====
The History of crowd control starts back in the 1920s, where there was no official crowd control unit. There would be ten to 20 officers lined up. Behind one line there would be another line about twenty feet back. The Officers were armed with batons and axe handles. There job is to simply hold the crowd back, which would just end in a free for all and resulting in multiple officer injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.policemag.com/blog/patrol-tactics/story/2012/08/the-history-of-crowd-management.aspx|title=The History of Crowd Management|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in the 1950s the first actual riot control teams armed with riot shields and batons. The goal was for the riot shield officers to hold up the lines. When they came to actual contact with the crowd the officers with the batons were supposed to help the riot shield officers. However if deadly forced was used against them there was no training or procedure to counter this.The officers at this point were left to fend for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.policemag.com/blog/patrol-tactics/story/2012/08/the-history-of-crowd-management.aspx|title=The History of Crowd Management|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in the 60s and 70s we first see the use of [[Tear gas|tear gas.]] However with this new innovation the officers were not used to operating in an environment where visibility was limited. The armor that they wore at the time was not as mobile. This resulting in that type of armor being rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.policemag.com/blog/patrol-tactics/story/2012/08/the-history-of-crowd-management.aspx|title=The History of Crowd Management|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A crowd controller is also another name for a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Burgess | first = Matthew | date = 2008-06-02 | title = Police probe bouncer attack | publisher = The Age | url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/police-probe-bouncer-attack-20080602-2kow.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Bouncer (doorman)|doorman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Crosse | first = Mark | date = 1992-04-05 | title = NIGHTCLUB BOUNCERS OF THE 90S IT'S NO LONGER THE GOON BY THE DOOR | publisher = Fresno Bee | url = http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/FB/lib00075,0EAE85C4749AFB81.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diffraction tomography''' is an [[Inverse scattering problem|inverse scattering]] technique used to find the shape of a scattering object by illuminating it with probing waves and recording the reflections. It is based on the [[diffraction slice theorem]] and assumes that the scatterer is weak. It is closely related to [[X-ray tomography]].

'''Dryad''' is an international [[disciplinary repository]] of data underlying scientific and medical publications. Dryad is a curated general-purpose repository that makes data discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. The scientific, educational, and charitable mission of Dryad is to promote the availability of data underlying findings in the scientific literature for research and educational reuse.

The vision of Dryad is a scholarly communication system in which learned societies, publishers, institutions of research and education, funding bodies and other stakeholders collaboratively sustain and promote the preservation and reuse of data underlying the scholarly literature.

Dryad aims to allow researchers to validate published findings, explore new analysis methodologies, re-purpose data for research questions unanticipated by the original authors, and perform synthetic studies such as formal meta-analyses.  For many publications, existing data repositories do not capture the whole data package. As a result, many important datasets are not being preserved and are no longer available, or usable, at the time that they are sought by later investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Vision, T.J. (2010) Open Data and the Social Contract of Scientific Publishing. BioScience 60(5):330-330. {{doi|10.1525/bio.2010.60.5.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryad serves as a repository for tables, spreadsheets, flat files, and all other kinds of published data for which specialized repositories do not already exist.  Optimally, authors submit data to Dryad in conjunction with article publication, so that links to the data can be included in the published article.  All data files in Dryad are associated with a published article, and are made available for reuse under the terms of a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Zero]] waiver.

Dryad is also a non-profit membership organization registered in the US, providing a forum for all stakeholders to set priorities for the repository, participate in planning, and share knowledge and coordinate action around data policies.

Dryad is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dryad Entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100000044|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

[[File:Embargoes chosen by Dryad data authors - journal.pbio.1001779.g002.png|thumb|Embargoes chosen by Dryad data authors]]
Dryad enables authors, journals, societies and publishers to facilitate data archiving at the time of publication, when the data are readily available.  Data in Dryad receives a permanent, unique [[Digital object identifier]] (DOI), which can be included in the published article so that readers are able to access the data.   Authors can archive data in Dryad and be assured of its preservation, while satisfying journals' and research funding agencies' mandates to disseminate their research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Data Archiving. Michael C. Whitlock, Mark A. McPeek, Mark D. Rausher, Loren Rieseberg and Allen J. Moore, The American Naturalist, Vol. 175, No. 2 (February 2010), pp. 145-146 {{doi|10.1086/650340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors submit data to Dryad either when the associated article is under review or has been accepted for publication.  The choice depends on whether the journal includes data within the scope of peer reviewer.  Authors may also submit data after an article has been published.

Data submission is facilitated by journals sending notices of new manuscripts to Dryad.  This saves authors from having to re-enter the bibliographic details when they upload their data files.

Dryad curators review submitted data files and perform quality control on metadata descriptions before inclusion of new content in the repository. Dryad’s metadata approach emphasizes simplicity and interoperability, supported by a [[Dublin Core]] metadata [[application profile]]. The [http://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/ Metadata Research Center] now at the [http://cci.drexel.edu College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University], serves as Dryad’s central curation hub, with curation activity also taking place via the non-profit in North Carolina. &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, J., White, H., C, Carrier, C. and Scherle, R. (2009). A Metadata Best Practice for a Scientific Data Repository. Journal of Library Metadata, 9:3, 194—212. {{doi|10.1080/19386380903405090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryad coordinates data submission to specialized repositories where in order to (a) lower user burden by streamlining the submission workflow and (b) allow Dryad and specialized repositories to exchange identifiers and other metadata in order to enable cross-referencing of the different data products associated with a given publication.  The first two handshaking partners are TreeBASE and [[GenBank]], which Dryad's partner journals have previously identified as required points of deposition for phylogenetic tree data and DNA sequences, respectively.

==Governance, history and funding==

Dryad is governed by a twelve-member [[Board of Directors]], elected by its Members. Members may be independent journals, societies, publishers, research and educational institutions, libraries, funders, or other organizations that support Dryad's mission. The organization coordinates data sharing policies and promotes the long-term sustainability of the repository.

Dryad began charging submission fees in September 2013.  Dryad is a nonprofit organization that provides long-term access to its contents at no cost to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad’s submission fees are designed to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data.

Dryad emerged from a [[National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent)]] workshop entitled "Digital data preservation, sharing, and discovery: Challenges for Small Science Communities in the Digital Era" in May 2007.  Initial funding for Dryad was provided by the [[National Science Foundation]] to the [[National Evolutionary Synthesis Center]] and other partners in the US.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708122322/http://datadryad.org/dryaduk DryadUK] was a [[Jisc]]-funded project run from the [[British Library]] and the [[University of Oxford]], in partnership with NESCent, the [[Digital Curation Centre]], and Charles Beagrie Ltd.  The project led to a UK mirror of the Dryad repository based at the British Library.  The project also improved the tools available for the publication and citation of data, expanded the disciplinary range of participating journals, and further developed the business framework for an international organization dedicated to long-term data preservation.

Dryad is a member of the Data Observation Network for Earth ([[DataONE]]).

==Software==
Dryad is built upon the open source [[DSpace]] repository software, developed by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Many customizations have been integrated into the main DSpace codebase; customizations specific to Dryad are maintained in the open source Dryad code repository.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Eliticide''' or '''elitocide''' refers to "the killing of the leadership, the educated, and the clergy of a group." It is usually carried out during the beginning of a [[genocide]] and done to cripple a possible resistance against perpetrators. Examples include the [[Armenian genocide]], [[Cambodian genocide]], [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|German-Soviet occupation of Poland]],{{sfn|Pakulski|2016|p=40}} and instances in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].{{sfn|Totten|Bartrop|2008|p=129}} The term was first used in 1992 by British reporter [[Michael Nicholson]] to describe the [[Bijeljina massacre]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{sfn|Gratz|2011|pp=409-410}} During the [[Bosnian War]] local [[Serbs]] would point out prominent [[Bosniaks]] to be killed afterwards by Serb soldiers.{{sfn|Totten|Bartrop|2008|p=130}}{{sfn|Bartrop|Jacobs|2014|p=2232}}

'''Explorer 21''', also called '''IMP-B''' and '''Interplanetary Monitoring Platform IMP-B''', was an [[United States|American]] [[satellite]] launched as part of [[Explorers program]]. Explorer 21 as launched on 27 November 1964 on [[Cape Canaveral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19641005&amp;id=AGYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JrcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2453,1341098|title=Explorer-21 Satellite Falls Far Short Of Orbital Goal|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|date=October 5, 1964|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Florida]], [[United States]], with an [[Delta rocket]]. Explorer 21 was the second satellite of the '''Interplanetary Monitoring Platform'''.

==Mission==
Explorer 21 was a [[solar cell]] and chemical-battery powered spacecraft instrumented for [[Interplanetary space|interplanetary]] and distant magnetospheric studies of energetic particles, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and plasmas. Each normal telemetry sequence of 81.9 s in duration consisted of 795 data bits. After every third normal sequence there was an 81.9-s interval of rubidium vapor magnetometer analog data transmission. Initial spacecraft parameters included a local time of apogee at noon, a spin rate of 14.6 rpm, and a spin direction of 41.4-deg right ascension and 47.4-deg declination. The significant deviation of the spin rate and direction from the planned values and the achievement of an apogee of less than half the planned value adversely affected data usefulness. 

Otherwise, spacecraft systems performed well, with nearly complete data transmission for the first 4 months and for the sixth month after launch. Data transmission was intermittent for other times, and the final transmission occurred on October 13, 1965&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

In the course of analogical reasoning, figurative analogies become weak if the [[disanalogies]] of the entities being compared are relevant—in the same way that literal analogies become weak.  Consider the disanalogies involving two cars in a literal analogy (the same principle concerning disanalogies is true for a figurative analogy):  The day they were purchased isn't relevant whereas the previous accidents of the two cars would be relevant.  If car A has been in five accidents while car B has been in no accidents, then the conclusion drawn about the future performance of the two cars is affected.

[[Image:Dense Tule fog in Bakersfield, California.jpg|thumb|right|Dense [[Tule fog]] in [[Bakersfield, California]]. Visibility in this photo is less than 500 feet.]]

The '''fog season''' is a [[season]] of [[fog]] that occurs in some places, because of special meteorological and topographical characteristics, after a rainy period. The fog season is usually based in the cooler months (late autumn, winter and early spring).

An example is found in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and [[Sacramento Valley]] areas of [[California]]'s [[California Central Valley|Great Central Valley]], where a thick ground fog, known as [[Tule fog]], may form, in particular in the months from November through March. In the [[Tampa Bay]] area of [[Florida]], the fog season is from December to February. [[Sydney]]'s fog season is longer, starting from April through to October. Though it's more frequent in June due to more [[rain]].

It is not generally true that fog season in a given area is during Fall or [[Winter]] (the cooler months); for example, the [[Japan]]ese coast of the [[Pacific Ocean]] has a dense fog season from May to August. The [[June Gloom]], a cloudy and foggy phenomena, experienced in the southern coast of California occurs in late spring and early summer (May and June). 

This also occurs in St. Louis, MO during the fall and spring season. Sometimes during the winter as well. Its the Midwest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">'''Full state feedback''' (FSF), or '''pole placement''', is a method employed in [[feedback]] control system theory to place the [[closed-loop pole]]s of a [[Plant (control theory)|plant]] in pre-determined locations in the [[s-plane]].&lt;ref name="Sontag1998"&gt;*{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Placing poles is desirable because the location of the poles corresponds directly to the [[eigenvalue]]s of the system, which control the characteristics of the response of the system.  The system must be considered [[controllable]] in order to implement this method.

==Principle==
[[File:State-system.jpg|thumb|System in open-loop]]

If the closed-loop dynamics can be represented by the state space equation (see [[State space (controls)]])

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\underline{x}}=\mathbf{A}\underline{x}+\mathbf{B}\underline{u}, &lt;/math&gt;

with output equation

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{y} = \mathbf{C}\underline{x}+\mathbf{D}\underline{u},&lt;/math&gt;

then the poles of the system transfer function are the roots of the characteristic equation given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left|s\textbf{I}-\textbf{A}\right|=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Full state feedback is utilized by commanding the input vector &lt;math&gt;\underline{u}&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider an input proportional (in the matrix sense) to the state vector,
[[File:Feedback-system.jpg|thumb|System with state feedback (closed-loop)]]

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{u}=-\mathbf{K}\underline{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting into the state space equations above,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\underline{x}}=(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B}\mathbf{K})\underline{x}; &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{y} = (\mathbf{C}-\mathbf{D}\mathbf{K})\underline{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The poles of the FSF system are given by the characteristic equation of the matrix &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A - B K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\det\left[s\textbf{I}-\left(\textbf{A}-\textbf{B}\textbf{K}\right)\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Comparing the terms of this equation with those of the desired characteristic equation yields the values of the feedback matrix &lt;math&gt;\textbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; which force the closed-loop eigenvalues to the pole locations specified by the desired characteristic equation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlStateSpace#24 Control Design Using Pole Placement]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of FSF ==

Consider a control system given by the following state space equations

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\underline{x}}=\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -2 &amp; -3\end{bmatrix}\underline{x}+\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\underline{u}&lt;/math&gt;

The uncontrolled system has closed-loop poles at &lt;math&gt;s=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=-2&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose, for considerations of the response, we wish the controlled system eigenvalues to be located at &lt;math&gt;s=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=-5&lt;/math&gt;.  The desired characteristic equation is then &lt;math&gt;s^2+6s+5=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Following the procedure given above, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix} k_1 &amp; k_2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and the FSF controlled system characteristic equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\left|s\mathbf{I}-\left(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B}\mathbf{K}\right)\right|=\det\begin{bmatrix}s &amp; -1 \\ 2+k_1 &amp; s+3+k_2 \end{bmatrix}=s^2+(3+k_2)s+(2+k_1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Upon setting this characteristic equation equal to the desired characteristic equation, we find

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 3\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, setting &lt;math&gt;\underline{u}=-\mathbf{K}\underline{x}&lt;/math&gt; forces the closed-loop poles to the desired locations, affecting the response as desired.

This only works for Single-Input systems.  Multiple input systems will have a '''K''' matrix that is not unique.  Choosing, therefore, the best '''K''' values is not trivial.  A [[linear-quadratic regulator]] might be used for such applications.

In the theory of Lorentzian manifolds, spherically symmetric spacetimes admit a family of nested round spheres.   In each of these spheres, every point can be carried to any other by an appropriate rotation about the center of symmetry.

There are several different types of coordinate chart which are ''adapted'' to this family of nested spheres, each introducing a different kind of distortion.  The best known alternative is the [[Schwarzschild coordinates|Schwarzschild chart]], which correctly represents distances within each sphere, but (in general) distorts radial distances and angles.  Another popular choice is the [[isotropic coordinates|isotropic chart]], which correctly represents angles (but in general distorts both radial and transverse distances).  A third choice is the '''Gaussian polar chart''', which correctly represents radial distances, but distorts transverse distances and angles.  In all three possibilities, the nested geometric spheres are represented by coordinate spheres, so we can say that their ''roundness'' is correctly represented.

==Definition==
In a Gaussian polar chart (on a static spherically symmetric spacetime), the [[line element]] takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -f(r)^2 \, dt^2 + dr^2 + g(r)^2 \, \left( d\theta^2 + \sin(\theta)^2 \, d\phi^2 \right), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\infty &lt; t &lt; \infty, \, r_0 &lt; r &lt; r_1, \, 0 &lt; \theta &lt; \pi, \, -\pi &lt; \phi &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Depending on context, it may be appropriate to regard f, g as undetermined functions of the radial coordinate.  Alternatively, we can plug in specific functions (possibly depending on some parameters) to obtain an isotropic coordinate chart on a specific Lorentzian spacetime.

==Applications==
Gaussian charts are often less convenient than Schwarzschild or isotropic charts.  However, they have found occasional application in the theory of static spherically symmetric perfect fluids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3705">In mathematics and [[theoretical physics]], a '''Gerstenhaber algebra''' (sometimes called an '''antibracket algebra''' or '''braid algebra''') is an [[algebraic structure]] discovered by [[Murray Gerstenhaber]] (1963) that combines the structures of a [[supercommutative ring]] and a [[graded Lie superalgebra]]. It is used in the [[Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism]]. It appears also in the generalization of Hamiltonian 
formalism known as the [[De Donder–Weyl theory]] as the algebra of generalized [[Poisson bracket]]s defined on differential forms.

==Definition==
A '''Gerstenhaber algebra''' is a graded-commutative algebra with a [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]] of degree -1 satisfying the [[Poisson algebra|Poisson identity]]. Everything is understood to satisfy the usual [[superalgebra]] sign conventions. More precisely, the algebra has two products, one written as ordinary multiplication and one written as [,], and a '''Z'''-grading called '''degree''' (in theoretical physics sometimes called '''ghost number'''). The '''degree''' of an element ''a'' is denoted by |''a''|. These satisfy the identities
*|''ab''| = |''a''| + |''b''|      (The product has degree 0)
*|[''a'',''b'']| = |''a''| + |''b''| - 1  (The Lie bracket has degree -1)
*(''ab'')''c'' = ''a''(''bc'')   (The product is associative)
*''ab'' = (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;|''a''||''b''|&lt;/sup&gt;''ba''   (The product is (super) commutative)
*[''a'',''bc''] = [''a'',''b'']''c'' + (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;(|''a''|-1)|''b''|&lt;/sup&gt;''b''[''a'',''c''] (Poisson identity)
*[''a'',''b''] = &amp;minus;(&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;(|''a''|-1)(|''b''|-1)&lt;/sup&gt; [''b'',''a''] (Antisymmetry of Lie bracket)
*[''a'',[''b'',''c'']] = [[''a'',''b''],''c''] + (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;(|''a''|-1)(|''b''|-1)&lt;/sup&gt;[''b'',[''a'',''c'']]  (The Jacobi identity for the Lie bracket)

Gerstenhaber algebras differ from [[Poisson superalgebra]]s in that the Lie bracket has degree -1 rather than degree 0. The Jacobi identity may also be expressed in a symmetrical form
:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{(|a|-1)(|c|-1)}[a,[b,c]]+(-1)^{(|b|-1)(|a|-1)}[b,[c,a]]+(-1)^{(|c|-1)(|b|-1)}[c,[a,b]] = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
*Gerstenhaber showed that the [[Hochschild cohomology]] H&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'',''A'') of an algebra ''A'' is a Gerstenhaber algebra.
*A [[Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra]] has an underlying Gerstenhaber algebra if one forgets its second order Δ operator.
*The [[exterior algebra]] of a [[Lie algebra]] is a Gerstenhaber algebra.
*The differential forms on a [[Poisson manifold]] form a Gerstenhaber algebra.
*The multivector fields on a [[manifold]] form a Gerstenhaber algebra using the [[Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket]]

[[File:Haidinger's brush.jpg|frame|Simulated appearance of Haidinger's brush for vertically polarized light. Size and intensity exaggerated for clarity. Actual rotational presentation will vary with polarization of light source.]]

'''Haidinger's brush''' is an [[entoptic phenomenon]] first described by Austrian
physicist [[Wilhelm Karl von Haidinger]] in 1844.

Many people are able to perceive [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light.
It may be seen as a yellowish horizontal bar or bow-tie shape (with "fuzzy" ends, hence the name "brush") visible in the center of the visual field against the blue sky viewed while facing away from the sun, or on any bright background.  It typically occupies roughly 3–5 degrees of vision, about twice or three times the width of one's thumb held at arm's length.  The direction of light polarization is perpendicular to the yellow bar (i.e., vertical if the bar is horizontal).  Fainter bluish or purplish areas may be visible between the yellow brushes (see illustration).  Haidinger's brush may also be seen by looking at a white area on many [[liquid crystal display|LCD flat panel computer screens]] (due to the polarization effect of the display), in which case it is often diagonal.

==Physiological causes==
Haidinger's brush is usually attributed to the [[dichroism]] of the [[xanthophyll]] [[pigment]] of the [[macula]]. In this effect due to the [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel laws]], the unguided oblique rays in the cylindrical geometry of the foveal blue cones, along with their distribution, produce an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|extrinsic]] dichroism. The brush's size is consistent with the size of the macula. The macula's dichroism is thought to arise from some of its pigment molecules being arranged circularly. The small proportion of circularly arranged molecules accounts for the faintness of the phenomenon. Xanthophyll pigments tend to be parallel to [[visive]] nerves that, because the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] is not flat, are almost [[orthogonal]] to the fovea in its central part while being nearly parallel in its outer region. As a result, two different areas of the fovea can be sensitive to two different degrees of polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Floch|first=A|author2=Ropars G |author3=Enoch J |author4=Lakshminarayanan V |year=2010|title=The polarization sense in human vision.|journal=Vision Res.|volume=50|issue=20|pages=2048–2054|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.07.007|pmid=20638403|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698910003433?via%3Dihub}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seeing Haidinger's brush==
[[File:Haidinger's Brush (as demonstrated on Wikipedia's main page).jpg|thumb|260px|Simulated appearance of a computer screen viewed through a polarizer, showing typical size and intensity of Haidinger's brush]]

Many people find it difficult to see Haidinger's brush initially. It is very faint, much more so than generally indicated in illustrations, and, like other [[stabilized images]], tends to appear and disappear. 

It is most easily seen when it can be made to move. Since it is always positioned on the [[macula]], there is no way to make it move laterally, but it can be made to rotate, by viewing a white surface through a rotating polarizer, or by slowly tilting one's head to one side.

To see Haidinger's brush, start by using a polarizer, such as a lens from a pair of polarizing sunglasses. Gaze at an evenly lit, textureless surface through the lens and rotate the polarizer.

An option is to use the polarizer built into a computer's [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen. Look at a white area on the screen, and slowly tilt the head (a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor has no polarizer, and will not work for this purpose unless a separate polarizer is used).

It appears with more distinctness against a blue background. With practice, it is possible to see it in the naturally polarized light of a blue sky. [[Marcel Minnaert|Minnaert]] recommended practicing first with a polarizer, then trying it without.&lt;ref&gt;Minnaert, M. G. J. (1940). Light and colour in the open air  (H. M. Kremer-Priest, Trans.). London: G. Bell and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The areas of the sky with the strongest polarization are those 90 degrees away from the sun. Minnaert said that after a minute of gazing at the sky, "a kind of marble effect will appear. This is followed shortly by Haidinger's brush." He commented that not all observers see it in the same way. Some see the yellow pattern as solid and the blue pattern as interrupted, as in the illustrations on this page. Some see the blue as solid and the yellow as interrupted, and some see it alternating between the two states.

==Use==
The fact that the sensation of Haidinger's brush corresponds with the visual field of the [[macula]] means that it can be utilised in training people to look at objects with their macula. People with certain types of [[strabismus]] may undergo an adaptation whereupon they look at the object of attention not with their fovea (at the centre of the macula) but with an eccentric region of the [[retina]]. This adaptation is known as '''eccentric fixation'''. To aid in training a person to look at an object with their fovea rather than their eccentric retinal zone, a training device can be used. One such apparatus utilises a rotating polarised plate backlit with a bright white light. Wearing blue spectacles (to enhance the Haidinger's brush image) and an [[wikt:occluder|occluder]] over the other eye, the user will hopefully notice the Haidinger's brush where their macula correlates with their visual field. The goal of the training is for the user to learn to look at the test object in such a way that the Haidinger's brush overlaps the test object (and the viewer is thus now looking at it with their fovea). The reason for such training is that the healthy fovea is far greater in its resolving power than any other part of the retina. Another diagnostic method that utilises [[Birefringence|birefringent]] properties of the retinal tissue is [[retinal birefringence scanning]], that can be used in case of severe [[amblyopia]] or when the specialist lacks a cooperation from the patient.

{{Other uses|Homonym}}
In biology, a '''homonym''' is a name for a [[taxon]] that is identical in spelling to another such name, that belongs to a different taxon. 

The rule in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] is that the first such name to be published is the '''senior homonym''' and is to be used (it is "[[valid name (zoology)|valid]]"); any others are '''junior homonyms''' and must be replaced with new names. It is, however, possible that if a senior homonym is archaic, and not in "prevailing usage," it may be declared a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'' and rendered unavailable, while the junior homonym is preserved as a ''[[nomen protectum]]''.

:For example:
:*[[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]] proposed the genus ''Echidna'' in 1797 for the [[echidna|spiny anteater]]. 
:*However, [[Johann Reinhold Forster|Forster]] had already published the name ''Echidna'' in 1777 for a genus of [[moray eel]]s. 
:*Forster's use thus has priority, with Cuvier's being a junior homonym.
:*[[Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger|Illiger]] published the replacement name ''Tachyglossus'' in 1811.

Similarly, the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) specifies that the first published of two or more homonyms is to be used: a '''later homonym''' is "[[Illegitimate name|illegitimate]]" and is not to be used unless [[conservation (botany)|conserved]] (or sanctioned, in the case of fungi).&lt;ref name=ICBN-53&gt;{{cite web|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, Articles 53, 15, and 13|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Example: the later homonym ''[[Myroxylon]]'' L.f. (1782), in the family [[Leguminosae]], is conserved against the earlier homonym ''Myroxylon'' J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst. (1775) (now called ''[[Xylosma]]'', in the family [[Salicaceae]]).

==Parahomonyms==
Under the botanical code, names that are similar enough that they are likely to be confused, are also considered to be homonymous (article 53.3). For example, ''Astrostemma'' Benth. (1880) is an illegitimate homonym of ''[[Asterostemma]]'' Decne. (1838). The zoological code has a set of spelling variations (article 58) that are considered to be identical.

==Hemihomonyms==
Both Codes only consider taxa that are in their respective scope (animals for the ICZN; primarily plants for the ICN). Therefore, if an animal taxon has the same name as a plant taxon, both names are valid. Such names are called ''hemihomonyms''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexey Shipunov. "The problem of hemihomonyms and the on-line hemihomonyms database (HHDB)". Bionomina, 4: 65–72 (2011). [http://www.biotaxa.org/Bionomina/article/download/4/242 Download PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the name ''Erica'' has been given to both a genus of spiders, ''[[Erica (spider)|Erica]]'' Peckham &amp; Peckham, 1892, and to a genus of heaths, ''[[Erica]]'' L. 

Hemihomonyms are possible at the species level as well, with organisms in different kingdoms sharing the same binomial. For instance, ''Orestias elegans''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Orestias_elegans|title=Orestias elegans - Wikispecies|website=species.wikimedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; denotes both a species of fish (kingdom [[Animal|Animalia]]) and a species of orchid (kingdom [[Plant|Plantae]]). Such duplication of binomials occurs in at least six instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Species-level_hemihomonyms|title=Category:Species-level hemihomonyms - Wikispecies|website=species.wikimedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isla Vista virus (ILV)''' is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA [[orthohantavirus]] species of the [[Bunyavirales]] order. It is a [[Novel virus|novel]] New World microtine rodent hantavirus discovered in the [[California vole]] (M. californicus) in [[Santa Barbara County]], California, near [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]].  It is similar to [[Prospect Hill virus]] which has been isolated from a meadow vole ([[Microtus pennsylvanicus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Song W, Torrez-Martinez N, Irwin W, Harrison FJ, Davis R, Ascher M, Jay M, Hjelle B |title=Isla Vista virus: a genetically novel hantavirus of the California vole Microtus californicus |journal=J.

This is a '''list of [[Pelecaniformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Pelecaniformes have had their numbers quantified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23565">Below is a '''list of [[U.S. state]] birds''' as designated by each state's legislature. The list also contains [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territory]] birds as designated by each territory's legislature, as well as the [[District of Columbia]]'s bird. The selection of state birds began in 1927, when the legislatures for [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Maine]], [[Missouri]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Wyoming]] selected their state birds. The last state to choose its bird was [[Arizona]] in 1973. [[Alaska]], [[California]], and [[South Dakota]] permit hunting of their state birds. [[Pennsylvania]] has adopted a "state game bird" but not a state bird, while [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Missouri]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]] have designated an additional "state game bird" for the purpose of hunting. The [[northern cardinal]] is the state bird of seven states, followed by the [[western meadowlark]] as the state bird of six states. Several states have extinct official animals, such as [[List of U.S. state dinosaurs|state dinosaurs]] in addition to [[List of U.S. state insects|state insects]], [[List of U.S. state butterflies|state butterflies]], [[List of U.S. state mammals|state mammals]] and [[U.S. state reptiles|state reptiles]]. 

Each of the five inhabited [[Territories of the United States|territories of the United States]] has a designated territorial bird (except for [[American Samoa]]). The [[District of Columbia]] designated a district bird in 1938.&lt;ref name="DC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7806">The prolific [[mathematician]] [[Paul Erdős]] and his various collaborators made many famous mathematical [[conjecture]]s, over a wide field of subjects, and in many cases Erdős offered monetary rewards for solving them.

==Unsolved==
* The [[Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture]] on coloring unions of cliques.
* The [[Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture]] on cycles with lengths equal to a power of two in graphs with minimum degree 3.
* The [[Erdős–Hajnal conjecture]] that in a family of graphs defined by an excluded induced subgraph, every graph has either a large clique or a large independent set.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''''Making Connections'' Survey''' is a neighborhood-based, longitudinal and cross-sectional survey funded by the [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]]. It serves as an evaluation of a larger initiative supported by the foundation and was designed to collect data measuring how neighborhood change affects the well-being of children. The ''Making Connections'' Survey was conducted by [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]] between 2002 and 2011 with residents in ten low-income communities across the United States. The final survey dataset includes responses from roughly 28,000 interviews at three points in time.&lt;ref&gt;http://mcstudy.norc.org/study-design/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Making Connections'' Initiative==
In 1999, the Annie E. Casey Foundation launched the 10-year ''Making Connections'' Initiative is a collaboration of local organizations and residents that seeks to improve outcomes for disadvantaged children by strengthening their families, improving their neighborhoods, and raising the quality of local services. The initiative was founded on three propositions:  	

* Neighborhood features related to social, political, and economic networks impact family well-being.
* Coordinated action can, over time, change the character of neighborhoods in ways that are beneficial to children
* Data are essential to planning, promoting, and conducting community interventions.

In the selected sites, the Annie E. Casey Foundation activities were centered on achieving three key benchmarks for children and families: 
# More families have increased earnings and income,
# More families have increased levels of assets, and
# More young children are healthy and prepared to succeed in school.

In order to reach these goals, Annie E. Casey Foundation endorsed a “two-generation approach” to combating poverty and creating opportunities for families.  This approach aims to promote family economic success and ensure that children get a “good start” in life by succeeding in early grades of school and reading proficiently by the end of third grade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aecf.org/MajorInitiatives/MakingConnections.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NORC Making Connections Methodology Report pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Sheryl Edelen, a reporter for the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier Journal]]'', said the program aims "to help low-income parents and their children improve their lives by plugging them into a network of 3,600 peers, churches, schools, organizations and agencies that can help them find better jobs, better manage and save money, and use reliable services close to home, such as child care."&lt;ref&gt;https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/2267736991.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Feb+16%2C+2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Making Connections'' Survey==
In 2001, the Annie E. Casey Foundation commissioned the National Opinion Research Center to plan and execute a large-scale, longitudinal neighborhood-based survey. Participants were sampled from the following cities: [[Denver|Denver, CO]]; [[Des Moines|Des Moines, IA]]; [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, IN]]; [[Hartford|Hartford, CT]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]]; [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, WI]]; [[Oakland|Oakland, CA]]; [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence, RI]]; [[San Antonio|San Antonio, TX]]; and [[White Center|White Center (near Seattle), WA]]. 

To evaluate the ''Making Connections'' Initiative, the survey measured the effects of various neighborhood interventions over time in relation to a baseline study conducted early in 2002-2004.  By determining if measurable progress in factors like safety, health care, and childcare is being made in the study communities, the Annie E. Casey Foundation hopes that communities will be able to use the data to achieve grassroots improvement in the future. Data was collected on the following topics: residential mobility, neighborhood change, child welfare, social networks, civic engagement, income, assets, savings, employment, and local interests, as well as household demographics.

The project was unique in that not only were the residents of the ''Making Connections'' neighborhoods respondents, but they were also research partners.  Residents were involved in data review, and they were able to take part in the decision-making process regarding what issues the community should focus on.&lt;ref&gt;http://mcstudy.norc.org/study-design&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NORC Making Connections Methodology Report pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings from the ''Making Connections'' Survey==

Results from the ''Making Connections'' Survey allow social scientists, community activists, and other researchers to examine household characteristics like race, employment, income, and residential stability in the context of greater neighborhood-level trends.  The survey results are available to approved researchers through the National Opinion Research Center's data enclave.  The application process is outlined [http://mcstudy.norc.org/data-access/ here].

Examples of empirical findings from research using the ''Making Connections'' Survey data:

(2011) find that “even among residents living in close proximity to one another, there were a number of divergent opinions about neighborhood names, sizes, and boundaries.” &lt;ref&gt;Coulton, Claudia , Chan, Tsui and Mikelbank, Kristen(2011) 'Finding Place in Community Change Initiatives: Using GIS to Uncover Resident Perceptions of their Neighborhoods', Journal of Community Practice, 19: 23. http://mcstudy.norc.org/publications/files/Coulton_et_al_2011_Finding_Place.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hendy and Kingsley (2009) analyzed the trends and conditions which took place over time in the metropolitan and county areas surrounding the surveyed neighborhoods. Their findings include: an increase in minorities, different employment trends between the metropolitan areas, decrease in social distress indicators, and housing markets which reflect national trends.&lt;ref&gt;Hendy and Kingsley, July 2009. "Metropolitan Conditions and Trends: Changing Contexts for a Community Initiative." pg. 2. http://mcstudy.norc.org/publications/files/MCContextFinal09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kingsley and Hayes (2010) found two significant differences between 2002/3 and 2008/9 in the ethnic composition of the neighborhoods in five sites, "a decline for whites (from 44% to 39%) and an increase for Hispanics (from 31% to 36%).&lt;ref&gt;Kingsley, Thomas G. &amp; Hayes, Christopher. May 2010. "Making Connections Cross-Site Survey: Basic Demographics." The Urban Institute. pg. 7. http://mcstudy.norc.org/publications/files/Neighborhood%20Demographics%2005-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kingsley and Hayes (2010) also found that "[s]ubstantial numbers of Making Connections families with children both receive and give help from or to family or friends. Whether the help is financial or not, they are more likely to give it than receive it." &lt;ref&gt;Kingsley, Thomas G. &amp; Hayes, Christopher. June 2010. "Making Connections Cross-Site Survey: Social and Neighborhood Conditions." The Urban Institute. pg. 4. http://mcstudy.norc.org/publications/files/Social%20and%20neighborhood%20conditions%2004-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18040">'''Mating disruption''' (MD) is a [[Pest control|pest management]] technique designed to control certain [[insect]] [[Pest (organism)|pests]] by introducing artificial stimuli that confuse the individuals and disrupt mate localization and/or courtship, thus preventing [[mating]] and blocking the [[reproductive cycle]]. It usually involves the use of synthetic [[sex pheromone]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Foster, S.P. |author2=Harris, M.O. |year=1997 |title=Behavioral manipulation methods for insect pest-management |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=42 |pages=123–146 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other approaches, such as interfering with [[vibrational communication]], are also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Polajnar, J. |author2=Eriksson, A. |author3=Lucchi, A. |author4=Anfora, G. |author5=Virant-Doberlet, M. |author6=Mazzoni, V. |title=Manipulating behaviour with substrate-borne vibrations – potential for insect pest control |journal=[[Pest Management Science]] |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=15–23 |doi=10.1002/ps.3848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''[[:fr:Confusion sexuelle|La confusion sexuelle]]'' or mating disruption, was first discussed by the [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique]] in 1974 in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thiéry |first=Denis |title=1974-1995 / Mise au point de la confusion sexuelle pour protéger les vignobles |url=http://www.bordeaux-aquitaine.inra.fr/Toutes-les-actualites/70-ans-mise-au-point-confusion-sexuelle |work=www.bordeaux-aquitaine.inra.fr |date=2016-07-06 |accessdate=2017-12-26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Winemakers in France, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, and Italy were the first to use the method to treat vines against the larvae of the moth genus [[Cochylis]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;.

== Mechanism==
In many insect [[species]] of interest to agriculture, such as those in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Lepidoptera]], females emit an airborne trail of a  specific chemical blend constituting that species' sex pheromone. This aerial trail is referred to as a pheromone plume.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Welter, Carolyn Pickel, Jocelyn Millar, Frances Cave, Robert A. Van Steenwyk, John Dunley; Pheromone mating disruption offers selective management options for key pests.CALIFORNIA  AGRICULTURE, VOLUME 59, NUMBER 1 {{cite web |url=http://fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu/crops/pheromone_welter_03_05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630180742/http://fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu/crops/pheromone_welter_03_05.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Carter,H. Fraser; Mating Disruption for Management of Insect Pests. OMAFRA.2003 [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/03-079.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Males]] of that species use the information contained in the pheromone plume&lt;ref&gt;Mafra-Neto, Agenor and Carde, Ring T. 1994. Fine-scale structure of pheromone plumes modulates upwind orientation of flying moths. Nature (London) 369 (6476): 142-144.&lt;/ref&gt; to locate the emitting [[female]] (known as a “calling” female). Mating disruption exploits the male insects' natural response to follow the plume by introducing a synthetic pheromone into the insects’ [[habitat]]. The synthetic pheromone is a volatile organic chemical designed to mimic the species-specific sex pheromone produced by the female insect. The general effect of mating disruption is to confuse the male insects by masking the natural pheromone plumes, causing the males to follow “false pheromone trails” at the expense of finding mates, and affecting the males’ ability to respond to “calling" females. Consequently, the male population experiences a reduced probability of successfully locating and mating with females, which leads to the eventual cessation of breeding and collapse of the insect infestation. The [[California Department of Pesticide Regulation]], the [[California Department of Food and Agriculture]], and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] consider mating disruption to be among the most environmentally friendly treatments used to eradicate pest infestations.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Food &amp; Agriculture 2007 Light Brown Apple Moth Questions and Answers [http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/PDEP/lbam/lbam_main.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Mating disruption works best if large areas are treated with pheromones. Ten acres is a good minimum size for a successful MD program, but larger areas are preferable&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Advantages of mating disruption ==
Pheromone programs are most effective when controlling low to moderate pest population densities. MD has also been identified as a pest control method in which the insect does not become resistant&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;. The scientific community, together with governmental agencies throughout the world, understands the benefits of mating disruption using species-specific sex pheromones, and consider sex-pheromone-based insect control programs among the most environmentally friendly treatments to be used to manage and control insect pest populations. Insect pheromone has been successfully used as an effective tool to slow the spread and to eradicate pests from very large areas in the US; for example to control the  Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), a devastating forestry pest, and to eradicate the boll weevil and pink bollworm, two of the most damaging pest of cotton. Conventional [[pesticide]] based control methods, kill insects directly, whereas mating disruption confuses male insects from accurately locating a mating partner, leading to the eventual collapse of the mating cycle&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;. Mating disruption, due to the specificity of the sex pheromone of the insect species, has the benefit of only affecting the males of that species, while leaving other non target species unaffected&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;. This allows for very targeted pest management, promoting the suppression of a single pest species, leaving the populations of beneficial insects (pollinators and natural enemies) intact. Mating disruption, like most pest management strategies, is a useful technique, but should not be considered a stand-alone treatment program&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; for it targets only a single species in plant production systems that usually have several pests of concern. Mating disruption is a valuable tool that should be used in Integrated Pest Management(IPM) programs. 

Pheromone programs have been used for several decades around the globe and to date (2009) there is no documented public health evidence to suggest that agricultural use of synthetic pheromones is harmful to humans or to any other non-target species. However, continuing research is being conducted.

== Disadvantages of mating disruption ==
Over the decades that pheromone pest programs have been used several disadvantages have been argued when compared to the use of conventional pesticides. Most pheromones target a single species, so a specific mating disruption formulation controls only the species that uses that pheromone blend; whereas pesticides usually kill indiscriminately a plethora of species, including multiple species with a single application. Some synthetic pheromones have high developmental and production costs, causing the mating disruption technique to be too costly to be adopted by conventional commercial growers. Furthermore most commercial pheromone mating disruption formulations must be applied by hand, which can be an expensive and time consuming. Novel pheromone formulations recently developed to be mechanically applied provide long lasting mating disruption effects (e.g., depending on the target pest a single application of SPLAT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iscatech.com/exec/SPLAT.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713061535/http://www.iscatech.com/exec/SPLAT.htm |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  controls the target pest for a complete reproductive cycle,&lt;ref&gt;Lapointe, Stephen L.; Stelinski, Lukasz L.; Evens, Terence J.; Niedz, Randall P.; Hall, David G.; Mafra-Neto, Agenor. 2009.

== Methods of dispersal ==

=== Microencapsulated pheromones ===

Microencapsulated pheromones (MECs) are small droplets of pheromone enclosed within [[polymer]] capsules. The capsules control the release rate of the pheromone into the surrounding environment. The capsules are small enough to be applied in the same method as used to spray [[insecticides]]. The effective field longevity of the microencapsulated pheromone formulations ranges from a few days to slightly more than a week, depending on climatic conditions, capsule size and chemical properties&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;. Microcapsules in the pheromone formulations are usually kept above a prescribed diameter to avoid the risk of inhalation by humans.

=== Hand applied dispensers ===

*'''Hollow tube dispensers''' are plastic twist-tie type dispensers, plastic hollow fibers or plastic hollow microfibers fibers, filled with synthetic sex pheromone and placed throughout the area to be protected.
*'''Pheromone Baits and Stations''' are a stationary, attract and kill type of dispensers. Some are relatively large platform, containing a pheromone lure inside a glue board that ensnares the attracted insect. Other pheromone bait stations contain a pheromone lure in conjunction with a surface containing a dose of insecticide that reduces the attracted insect's fitness, thus reducing its ability to mate and reproduce.
*'''High-emission dispensers''' There are several very high dose pheromone dispensers, some do it passively, like pheromone sachets and large dollops of SPLAT pheromone formulations, others do it be actively releasing bursts of sex pheromone at timed intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Mafra-Neto, A. and T.C. Baker. 1996. Timed, metered sprays of pheromone disrupt mating of Cadra cautella (Lepidoptera: Phycitinae).  J. Agric. Entomol. 13: 149-168&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monolithic Flowable dispensers ===

A new, effective and economical concept in pheromone delivery using a flowable formulation to create long lasting monolithic pheromone dispensers has been brought to the market in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iscatech.com/exec/SPLAT.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713061535/http://www.iscatech.com/exec/SPLAT.htm |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These novel SPLAT pheromone mating disruption formulations can provide effective season long suppression effect (e.g., depending on the target pest a single application of SPLAT controls the target pest for a complete reproductive cycle,&lt;ref&gt;Lapointe, Stephen L.; Stelinski, Lukasz L.; Evens, Terence J.; Niedz, Randall P.; Hall, David G.; [[Agenor Mafra-Neto|Mafra-Neto, Agenor]]. 2009. Sensory Imbalance as Mechanism of Orientation Disruption in the Leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella: Elucidation by Multivariate Geometric Designs and Response Surface Models. J Chem Ecol. 35: 896-903.&lt;/ref&gt; or for the entire season&lt;ref&gt;Tcheslavskaia, Ksenia; Thorpe, Kevin; Zeni, Diego; Bernardi, Carmen; [[Agenor Mafra-Neto|Mafra-Neto, Agenor]]; Coler, Reginald. 2008. The new pheromone delivery system for gypsy moth mating disruption. In: Gottschalk, Kurt W., ed. Proceedings, 18th U.S. Department of Agriculture interagency research forum on gypsy moth and other invasive species. January 9–12, 2007. Annapolis, MD. Gen. Tech. Rep. NRS-P-28. Newtown Square, PA: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Northern Research Station: 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stelinski, LL, Miller, JR, Ledebuhr, R., Siegert, P. and Gut, LJ 2007a. Season-long mating disruption of Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) by one machine application of pheromone in wax drops (SPLAT-OFM). J. Pest Science 80:109-117&lt;/ref&gt;) and can be manually or mechanically applied. Although mechanical dispersal techniques require specialized off-the-shelf application technology and/or equipment, once the application system is made to work it allows protection of extensive areas using pheromones, one of the most benign and effective pest management techniques available today. A benefit of SPLAT is that the dollop anchors where it lands, avoiding unwanted drift of the formulation once applied in the field, and, depending on the mode of application, the cured dollops are retrievable.

=== Aerial dispersal ===

In November 2007, a controversial aerial approach was used to spray microencapsulated LBAM pheromone in urban and rural areas of the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey California to combat the invasive [[light brown apple moth]]. Usually the effect of disruption of orientation of the male moths to females (or monitoring pheromone traps) can be detected by the reduction in moth capture in monitoring pheromone traps.  The government campaign using areawide aerial microencapsulated pheromone applications failed to show any sign of mating disruption on the light brown apple moth populations in the treated area. It was found that the first aerial campaign was performed using an incomplete (the wrong) pheromone blend of the light brown apple moth (the wrong blend decreased tremendously the likelihood of success of the mating disruption program), and the LBAM microencapsulated formulation was untested, and finally, microencapsule formulations are notoriously known for their short field life, weak and erratic performance. Furthermore it is possible that the LBAM microencapsulated formulation used in the government campaign was unfit for aerial delivery in urban areas; although pheromone is safe, the formulation used had microcapsules of very small diameter which made it into a possible inhalation hazard that seems to be linked to an increase in allergenic reactions of the population in the target area. This set of LBAM mating disruption aerial applications done by the government has created tremendous dissent of the public in general as well as of several sectors of the scientific community. Now, several years later, the affected communities as well as the nascent US pheromone industry (which provides safer, yet very effective, alternatives to the use of conventional pesticides) are still suffering the ripple effects of these disastrous Bay Area LBAM eradication campaigns.

But there are numerous, successful pest suppression programs that rely on aerial dispersal of pheromone mating disruptants. One of the largest pheromone mating disruption programs in the globe is the Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmsts.org/operations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308063601/http://www.gmsts.org/operations/ |archivedate=2011-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread has been implemented across the {{convert|1200|mi|km|adj=on}} [[gypsy moth]] frontier from Wisconsin to North Carolina. The program area is located ahead of the advancing front of the gypsy moth population. The STS program focuses on early detection and suppression of the low–level populations along this advancing front, disrupting the natural progress of population buildup and spread. Every year hundreds of thousands of acres are aerially sprayed with two pheromone Gypsy moth pheromone mating disruption formulations, Flakes and SPLAT. A single mating disruption formulation application promotes season-long suppression of gypsy moth in the treated areas. With a crew of 8 people it was possible to aerially treat with SPLAT GM over {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of forest in a single day. The consortium of Federal and State participants have been able to do the following: 

• decrease the new territory invaded by the gypsy moth each year from {{convert|15600|sqmi|km2}} to {{convert|6000|sqmi|km2}}; 

• protect forests, forest–based industries, urban and rural parks, and private property; and 

• avoid at least $22 million per year in damage and management costs.

It seems that the tremendous success of the Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread program is related to extremely well planned campaigns, which involves communication, transparency and clarity of objectives: in advance to an application STS holds meetings  that include the area population in general, concerned citizens, public officials, scientists and technical personnel to discuss strategies of management of Gypsy moth in the areas of concern. There is a movement requesting that new government invasive species eradication campaigns model their pest suppression actions on the existing successful suppression programs like GM STS, and embrace a more effective policy of communication, transparency and clarity of objectives. With the involvement and education of the public, areawide eradication campaigns will be better planned and more able to deliver decisive end effective pest eradication actions.

The '''Modular Ocean Model''' ('''MOM''') is a three-dimensional [[ocean circulation]] model designed primarily for studying the [[ocean]] [[climate]] system.  The model is developed and supported primarily by researchers at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] (NOAA/GFDL) in Princeton, NJ, USA.

== Overview ==

MOM has traditionally been a level-coordinate ocean model, in which the ocean is divided into boxes whose bottoms are located at fixed depths.  Such a representation makes it easy to solve the momentum equations and the well-mixed, weakly stratified layer known as the ocean [[mixed layer]] near the ocean surface.  However, level coordinate models have problems when it comes to the representation of thin bottom boundary layers (Winton et al., 1998) and thick sea ice.  Additionally, because mixing in the ocean interior is largely along lines of constant potential density rather than along lines of constant depth, mixing must be rotated relative to the coordinate grid- a process that can be computationally expensive.  By contrast, in codes which represent the ocean in terms of constant-density layers (which represent the flow in the ocean interior much more faithfully)- representation of the ocean mixed layer becomes a challenge.

MOM3, MOM4, and MOM5 are used as a code base for the ocean component of the GFDL coupled models used in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] assessment reports, including the [[GFDL CM2.X]] physical climate model series and the ESM2M Earth System Model. Versions of MOM have been used in hundreds of scientific papers by authors around the world. MOM4 is used as the basis for the El Nino prediction system employed by the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]].

== History ==

MOM owes its genesis to work at GFDL in the late 1960s by [[Kirk Bryan (oceanographer)|Kirk Bryan]] and Mike Cox. This code, along with a version generated at GFDL and UCLA/NCAR by Bert Semtner, is the ancestor of many of the level-coordinate ocean model codes run around the world today. In the late 1980s, Ron Pacanowski, Keith Dixon, and Tony Rosati at GFDL rewrote the Bryan-Cox-Semtner code in a modular form, enabling different options and configurations to be more easily generated and new physical parameterizations to be more easily included. This version, released in December 1990, became known as Modular Ocean Model v1.0 (MOM1). Further development by Pacanowski, aided by Charles Goldberg and encouraged by community feedback, led to the release of v2.0 (MOM2) in 1995. Pacanowski and Stephen Griffies released v3.0 (MOM3) in 1999. Griffies, Matthew Harrison, Rosati and Pacanowski, with considerable input from a scientific community of hundreds of users, resulted in significant evolution of the code released as v4.0 (MOM4) in 2003. An update, v4.1 (MOM4p1) was released by Griffies in 2009, as was the latest version v5.0 (MOM5), which was released in 2012.

[[File:Oxalis Triangularis Photonasty Timelapse.ogv|thumb|right|300px|Photonastic movement of ''[[Oxalis triangularis]]'' in response to light. At lowered light levels the leaves fold down; timelapse recorded at ~750x actual speed and covering a 1.5 hr period of time.]]

'''Nastic movements''' are non-directional [[Stimulus (psychology)|responses]] to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (e.g. [[temperature]], [[humidity]], light [[irradiance]]), and are usually associated with [[plant]]s. The movement can be due to changes in [[turgor]] or changes in growth . Nastic movements differ from [[Tropism|tropic movements]] in that the direction of tropic responses depends on the direction of the stimulus, whereas the direction of nastic movements is independent of the stimulus's position. The tropic movement is growth movement but nastic movement may or may not be growth movement. The rate or [[frequency]] of these responses increases as intensity of the stimulus increases. An example of such a response is the opening and closing of flowers (photonastic response), movement of euglena, chlamydomonas towards the source of light. They are named with the suffix "-nasty" and have prefixes that depend on the stimuli:
* Epinasty: downward-bending from growth at the top, for example, the bending down of a heavy flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://botanydictionary.org/epinasty.html epinasty - Dictionary of botany&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hyponastic response|Hyponasty]]
* Photonasty: response to light
* [[Nyctinasty]]: movements at night or in the dark
* Chemonasty: response to chemicals or nutrients
* Hydronasty: response to water
* Thermonasty: response to temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermonasty in Tulip and Crocus Flowers|url = http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/65|journal = Journal of Experimental Botany|date = 1953-01-01|issn = 0022-0957|pages = 65–77|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/jxb/4.1.65|language = en|first = W.

* Geonasty/gravinasty: response to gravity

The suffix may come from Greek νάσσω = "I press", ναστός = "pressed", ἐπιναστια = "the condition of being pressed upon".

The '''Nibiru cataclysm''' is a supposed disastrous encounter between the [[Earth]] and a large planetary object (either a collision or a [[Near-Earth object|near-miss]]) which certain groups believe will take place in the early 21st century. Believers in this [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|doomsday event]] usually refer to this object as  ''Nibiru'' or '''[[Planet X]]'''. The idea was first put forward in 1995 by Nancy Lieder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guarantee: The World Will Not End On Friday|author=Marcelo Gleiser|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2012/12/19/167530202/a-guarantee-the-world-will-not-end-on-friday|date=2012|accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists reject impending Nibiru-Earth collision|publisher=NASA|url=http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/articles/scientists-reject-impending-nibiru-earth-collision|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- NOTE: Before mentioning Sumerian myth or Zecharia Sitchin, please read the rest of the article --&gt; founder of the website ZetaTalk. Lieder describes herself as a [[contactee]] with the ability to receive messages from [[extraterrestrials]] from the [[Zeta Reticuli]] star system through an implant in her brain. She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner [[Solar System]] in May 2003 (though that date was later postponed) causing Earth to undergo a physical [[Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis|pole shift]] that would destroy most of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nancy Lieder's biography|author=Nancy Lieder|publisher=zetatalk.com|url=http://zetatalk.com/nancybio.htm|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prediction has subsequently spread beyond Lieder's website and has been embraced by numerous Internet doomsday groups. In the late 2000s, it became closely associated with the [[2012 phenomenon]]. Since 2012, the Nibiru cataclysm has frequently reappeared in the popular media, usually linked to newsmaking astronomical objects such as [[Comet ISON]] or [[Planet Nine]]. Although the name "Nibiru" is derived from the works of the [[ancient astronaut]] writer [[Zecharia Sitchin]] and his interpretations of [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] mythology, he denied any connection between his work and various claims of a coming apocalypse. A prediction by self-described "Christian numerologist" [[David Meade (author)|David Meade]] that the Nibiru cataclysm would occur on 23 September 2017 received extensive media coverage.

The idea that a planet-sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has been rejected by astronomers and planetary scientists as [[pseudoscience]] and an Internet [[hoax]].&lt;ref name=govert&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hunt For Planet X: New Worlds and the Fate of Pluto|author=Govert Schilling |author-link=Govert Schilling|publisher=Copernicus Books|page=111|isbn=0-387-77804-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA2012dec22"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond 2012: Why the World Didn't End |date=2012-12-22 |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an object would have destabilised the orbits of the planets to the extent that their effects would be easily observable today.&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Nibiru|publisher=Youtube=|work=Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TIy-t48uU0|accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers have hypothesized many [[planets beyond Neptune]], and though many have been disproved, there are some that remain viable candidates such as [[Planet Nine]]. All the current candidates are in orbits that keep them well beyond [[Neptune]] throughout their orbit, even when they are closest to the Sun.

[[File:Nancy Lieder 2.jpg|thumb|Nancy Lieder in June 2013.]]
The idea of the Nibiru encounter originated with Nancy Lieder,&lt;!--- NOTE: Before mentioning Sumerian myth or Zecharia Sitchin, please read the rest of the article --&gt; a [[Wisconsin]] woman who claims that as a girl she was [[contactee|contacted]] by [[Grey alien|gray extraterrestrials]] called [[Zeta Reticuli|Zetas]], who implanted a communications device in her brain. In 1995, she founded the website ZetaTalk to disseminate her ideas.&lt;ref name=Molloy/&gt; Lieder first came to public attention on Internet [[newsgroups]] during the build-up to [[Comet Hale–Bopp]]'s 1997 [[perihelion]]. She stated, claiming to speak as the Zetas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZetaTalk Hale–Bopp|author=Nancy Lieder|date=1995|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/poleshft/p46.htm|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "The Hale–Bopp comet does not exist. It is a fraud, perpetrated by those who would have the teeming masses quiescent until it is too late. Hale–Bopp is nothing more than a distant [[star]], and will draw no closer."&lt;ref name=phil&gt;{{cite web|title=The Planet X Saga: Nancy Lieder|author=Phil Plait|publisher=badastronomy.com|url=http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/planetx/lieder.html|accessdate=2009-04-28|authorlink=Phil Plait}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that the Hale–Bopp story was manufactured to distract people from the imminent arrival of a large planetary object, "Planet X", which would soon pass by Earth and destroy civilization.&lt;ref name=phil/&gt; After Hale–Bopp's perihelion revealed it as one of the brightest and longest-observed comets of the last century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kidger| first = M.R. | author2 = Hurst, G | author3 = James, N. | date=2004 | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 78 | issue=1–3 | pages = 169–177 | title = The Visual Light Curve Of C/1995 O1 (Hale–Bopp) From Discovery To Late 1997 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/h72381014307x661/ | doi=10.1023/A:1006228113533 | bibcode=1997EM&amp;P...78..169K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieder removed the first two sentences of her initial statement from her site, though they can still be found in [[Google]]'s archives.&lt;ref name=phil/&gt; Her claims eventually made the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Comets Breed Fear, Fascination and websites|author=George Johnson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/28/us/comets-breed-fear-fascination-and-web-sites.html?sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2009-09-27 | work=The New York Times | date=1997-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieder described Planet X as roughly four times the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing for exactly 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a [[Pole shift hypothesis|pole shift]] (a ''physical'' pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a [[geomagnetic reversal]]) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's core and the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's magnetic core and lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pole Shift Date of May 27, 2003|author=Nancy Lieder|publisher=zetatalk.com|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/index/psdate1.htm|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly a week before the supposed arrival of Planet&amp;nbsp;X in May 2003, Lieder appeared on [[KROQ-FM]] radio in [[Los Angeles]], and advised listeners to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] their pets in anticipation of the event as she had done.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B6QDSzq1A0 Nancy Leider: Kill your Pets Before the '03 Pole Shift], an excerpt from the KROQ-FM interview&lt;/ref&gt; This led the [[Fortean Times]] to conclude that she had put down her dog(s) to save them from further suffering during the Pole Shift.&lt;ref name=Fortean&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet Waves |publisher=Fortean Times |author=Mark Pilkington |date=2003 |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/198/planet_waves.html |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005172531/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/198/planet_waves.html |archivedate=October 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in a 2004 interview she said that she had euthanized her dog because it was acting aggressively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wake Up USA interview|date=2004|publisher=Zetatalk|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/index/wakeupt1.htm|accessdate=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2003 date passed without incident, Lieder said that it was merely a "[[white lie]]&amp;nbsp;... to fool [[the establishment]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pole Shift in 2003 Date|date=2003|publisher=zetatalk|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/index/psdate.htm|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She refused to disclose the true date, saying that to do so would give those in power enough time to declare [[martial law]] and trap people in cities during the shift, leading to their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZetaTalk: White Lie|date=2003|publisher=zetatalk.com|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/index/psdate2.htm|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Zecharia Sitchin and Sumer===
[[File:ZECHARIA SITCHIN.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The word ''Nibiru'' comes from the writings of the Azerbaijani American author and [[ancient astronauts|ancient astronaut]] theorist [[Zecharia Sitchin]].&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;]]

Although Lieder originally referred to the object as "Planet X", it has become deeply associated with ''Nibiru'', a planet from the works of [[ancient astronaut]] proponent [[Zecharia Sitchin]], particularly his book ''The 12th Planet''. According to Sitchin's interpretation of ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n religious texts, which contradicts conclusions reached by any and all credited scholars of Mesopotamian history,&lt;ref name=heiser&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of a Sumerian 12th Planet|url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/nibiru.pdf|author=Michael S. Heiser|accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zecharia Sitchin|publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary|url=http://skepdic.com/sitchin.html|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fritze"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|date=2009|title=Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2BrqdFg5AkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pseudohistory#v=onepage&amp;q=Pseudohistory&amp;f=falselocation=|location=London|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-430-4|pages=210–214|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; a giant planet (called Nibiru or [[Marduk]]) passes by Earth every 3,600 years, allowing its [[Sentience|sentient]] inhabitants to interact with humanity.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt; Sitchin identified these beings with the [[Anunnaki]] in [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]] and claimed that they were humanity's first gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 12th Planet|author=Zecharia Sitchin|publisher=Harper|date=1976|page=120|isbn=0-939680-88-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt; Lieder first made the connection between Nibiru and her Planet X on her site in 1996 ("Planet X does exist, and it is the 12th Planet, one and the same.").&lt;ref name=sitch/&gt;

However, Sitchin, who died in 2010, denied any connection between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, ''The End of Days'', which set the time for the last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zacharia Sitchin|title=The End of Days: Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return|publisher=William Morrow|date=2007|page= 316|isbn=978-0-06-123921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological [[Age of Pisces]] to the [[Age of Aquarius]], sometime between 2090 and 2370.&lt;ref&gt;''The End of Days'' p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 Hazlewood claims===
After Lieder, the first person to propagate her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood, a former member of the ZetaTalk community, who in 2001 published a book titled ''Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003''. Lieder would later accuse him of being a confidence trickster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Zetatalk|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/index/hazelwod.htm|title= Mark Hazlewood Scam|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Japanese new religions|Japanese cult]] called the [[Pana Wave Laboratory]], which blocked off roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks, also warned that the world would end in May 2003 after the approach of a tenth planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pana Wave Cult Raises Concern Among Japanese Authorities|author= Steve Herman|publisher=Voice of America|date=2003|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/pana_wave/pana_wave34.html|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 and the Mayan calendar===
{{main|2012 phenomenon}}
Though Lieder herself has not specified a new date for the object's return, many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates. One frequently cited date was December 21, 2012. This date had many apocalyptic associations, as it was the end of a cycle ([[baktun]]) in the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|long count]] in the [[Mayan calendar]]. Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012.&lt;ref name=morrison2/&gt; Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.&lt;ref name=ison/&gt;

In 2012, Lieder claimed that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] futilely attempted to announce the presence of Nibiru near the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZetaTalk Newsletter|issue=316|author=Nancy Lieder|date=2012|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue316.htm|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2012, she claimed that several [[Head of state|world leaders]] had intended to announce the presence of Nibiru near the Sun on October 20, 2014. Two weeks after the supposed date of announcement, she claimed that it did not occur because of consternation amongst [[the establishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZetaTalk Newsletter|issue=423|author=Nancy Lieder|date=2014|url=http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue423.htm|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his predictions failed to come true, Meade revised them and declared that Nibiru would arrive on 5 October 2017, not on 23 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man who said world was ending Saturday changed his mind|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/09/22/man-who-said-world-ending-saturday-said-isnt-actually-ending/692907001/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meadeebook"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meade|first1=David|title=Will Planet X Signal the Rapture?|url=https://www.ebookit.com/tools/pd/Bo/eBookIt/booktitle-Will-Planet-X-Signal-the-Rapture|website=ebookit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meade announced that, on 5 October, Nibiru would eclipse the Sun, and [[North Korea]], [[China]], and [[Russia]] would launch a combined [[nuclear war|nuclear attack]] on the United States.&lt;ref name="Meadeebook"/&gt; Then, the earth would be devastated by a series of magnitude 9.8 earthquakes, the earth's magnetic pole would shift by 30 degrees, the United States would be split in half, and [[Barack Obama]] would be elected president for an [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Meade|title=October 2017 and the ‘End of Days’|url=http://planetxnews.com/2017/08/30/october-2017-end-days/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- referring to the author's own material because he questioned summaries in other articles as inaccurate --&gt; He predicted that the seven-year [[Great Tribulation]] would begin on 15 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trim|first1=Liam|title=Sunday, October 15 will mark the start of Apocalypse if author David Meade is correct|url=http://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/planet-x-theory-sunday-october-629034|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When October came, another apocalyptic writer, Terral Croft, predicted the arrival of Nibiru for November 19; a prediction again reported in the British tabloid press. Croft describes Nibiru as a "black star" at the edge of our Solar System, which, rather than colliding with Earth, would form an apocalyptic conjunction with Earth, leading to massive earthquakes. Croft claimed that earthquakes have been increasing worldwide in the leadup to the conjunction, though ''[[The Washington Post]]'', quoting the [[United States Geological Survey]], was quick to point out that earthquakes had decreased in both power and frequency over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armageddon via imaginary planet has been pushed back – yet again – to November|author=Avi Selk|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/10/28/armageddon-via-imaginary-planet-has-been-pushed-back-yet-again-to-november/|year=2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]]|accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Begley, a [[YouTube]] conspiracy theorist and [[pastor]] at the Community Gospel Baptist Church in [[Knox, Indiana]], also predicted in one of his YouTube videos that Nibiru would appear in 2017 and declared that the solar eclipse was a sign of the apocalypse and the rogue planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conspiracy theorists use the Bible to claim the eclipse is a sign of the apocalypse|author=Max Londberg|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article166475397.html|quote=Paul Begley says there is 'overwhelming evidence that Planet X will destroy the Earth in 2017'.|year=2017|newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 12 April 2018, Meade cited an alleged 23 April astrological conjunction in Virgo and predicted that Nibiru would appear during the conjunction and presage the Rapture; [[Space.com]] needled that nothing resembling such a conjunction is actually forecast for 23 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No, the Rapture Isn't Coming on April 23 Because of Nibiru (Which Doesn't Exist)|url=https://www.space.com/40288-no-rapture-april-23-nibiru-doesnt-exist.html|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=Space.com|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific rejection==
Astronomers reject the idea of Nibiru, and have made efforts to inform the public that there is no threat to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Richard A.

An orbit like that of Nibiru within our Solar System is inconsistent with celestial mechanics. David Morrison, NASA space scientist explains that after just one previous flyby of Earth, such as they claim happened in Sumerian times, Earth itself would no longer be in its current near circular orbit and would be likely to have lost its Moon. If Nibiru were a [[brown dwarf]] it would have even worse effects, as brown dwarfs are far more massive.&lt;ref name=BigPictureShow&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guests: David Morrison – Robert E. Bartholomew – Michael Brown|title=Big Picture Science Radio Show – Skeptic Check: Nibiru! (Again!)|url=https://www.seti.org/BiPiSci/SkepticCheckNibiruAgain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Pluto is now frequently observed by backyard telescopes, any giant planet beyond Pluto would be easily observed by an amateur astronomer.&lt;ref name=Plait2003/&gt; And if such an object existed in our Solar System, it would have passed through the inner Solar System a million times by now. &lt;ref name=BigPictureShow/&gt;

Astronomer [[Mike Brown (astronomer)|Mike Brown]] notes that if this object's orbit were as described, it would only have remained in the Solar System for about a million years before Jupiter expelled it, and, even if such a planet existed, its magnetic field would have no effect on Earth's.&lt;ref name=mike&gt;{{cite web|title=I do not ♥ pseudo-science|author=Mike Brown|publisher=Mike Brown's planets|date=2008|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieder's assertions that the approach of Nibiru would cause the Earth's rotation to stop or its axis to shift violate the laws of physics. In his rebuttal of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'', which made the same claim that the Earth's rotation could be stopped and then restarted, [[Carl Sagan]] noted that, "the energy required to brake the Earth is not enough to melt it, although it would result in a noticeable increase in temperature: The oceans would [be] raised to the boiling point of water&amp;nbsp;... [Also,] how does the Earth get started up again, rotating at approximately the same rate of spin? The Earth cannot do it by itself, because of the law of the [[conservation of angular momentum]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientists Confront Velikovsky|date=1977|author=Carl Sagan|chapter=An Analysis of ''Worlds in Collision'': Introduction |editor=Donald-W. Goldsmith |publisher= Cornell University Press |isbn=0-8014-0961-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 interview with the [[Discovery Channel]], Mike Brown noted that, while it is not impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000&amp;nbsp;AU. To travel 1000&amp;nbsp;AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400&amp;nbsp;km/s&amp;nbsp;– faster than the galactic [[escape velocity]]. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy into intergalactic space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where are you hiding Planet X, Dr. Brown?|author=Ian O'Neil|publisher=Discovery News|date=2009|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/mike-brown-planetx-pluto.html|accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Many believers in the imminent approach of Planet X/Nibiru accuse [[NASA]] of deliberately covering up visual evidence of its existence.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt; Polls have suggested that many perceive NASA as a vast government agency that receives as much funding as the [[Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=skepcheck&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guests: David Morrison –  Robert E. Bartholomew – Michael Brown|title=Big Picture Science Radio Show - Skeptic Check: Nibiru! (Again!)|url=https://www.seti.org/BiPiSci/SkepticCheckNibiruAgain|website=SETI (podcast)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact NASA's budget amounts to roughly 0.5% of that of the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/5055/federal-spending-on-academic-research-continued-downward-trend-in-2007|title=Federal Spending on Academic Research Continued Downward Trend in 2007|date=August 25, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One such accusation involves the [[IRAS]] infrared space observatory, launched in 1983. The satellite briefly made headlines due to an "unknown object" that was at first described as "possibly as large as the giant planet [[Jupiter]] and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/127658362.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+30%2C+1983&amp;author=By+Thomas+O%27Toole+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A1&amp;desc=Mystery+Heavenly+Body+Discovered|title=Mystery Heavenly Body Discovered|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-01-28|author=Thomas O'Toole|page=A1|date=1983-12-30}} Subscription required.

[[Image:V838 Monocerotis expansion.jpg|thumb|NASA images showing the expansion of a light echo around [[V838 Monocerotis|V838 Mon]], between 2002 and 2004]]
Another accusation frequently made by websites predicting the collision is that the U.S. government built the [[South Pole Telescope]] (SPT) to track Nibiru's trajectory, and that the object has been imaged optically.&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of Nibiru and the End of the World in 2012|author=David Morrison|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2008-05/morrison.html|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the SPT (which is not funded by NASA) is a [[radio telescope]], and cannot take optical images. Its South Pole location was chosen due to the low-humidity environment, and there is no way an approaching object could be seen ''only'' from the South Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If Nibiru Is a Hoax...|author=David Morrison|date=2008|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/answered/2008/10/27/1283/|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2014-12-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001352/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/answered/2008/10/27/1283/|archivedate=2014-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "picture" of Nibiru posted on YouTube was revealed, in fact, to be a [[Hubble telescope|Hubble]] image of the expanding [[light echo]] around the star [[V838 Monocerotis|V838 Mon]].&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;

Another conspiracy claim regards a patch of missing data in [[Google Sky]] near the constellation of Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been [[Redaction|redacted]]. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers. A scientist at Google said that the missing data is due to a glitch in the stitching software used to piece the images together.&lt;ref name=dave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/intro/nibiru-and-doomsday-2012-questions-and-answers |title=Ask an Astrobiologist: Introduction |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2014-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905055011/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/intro/nibiru-and-doomsday-2012-questions-and-answers |archivedate=September 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another piece of claimed evidence drawn from Google Sky is the [[carbon star]] [[CW Leonis]], which is the brightest object in the 10 μm infrared sky and is frequently claimed to be Nibiru.&lt;ref name="CWLEO"&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-08-26 |title=Nibiru it is Not. |publisher=Astroblog |author=[http://www.global-rent-a-scope.com/gras-monthly-heads-up/author/musgrave Ian Musgrave of GRAS telescopes] |url=http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2009/08/nibiru-it-is-not.html |accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misappellations==
Believers in Planet X/Nibiru have given it many names since it was first proposed. All are, in fact, names for other real, hypothetical or imaginary Solar System objects that bear little resemblance either to the planet described by Lieder or to Nibiru as described by Sitchin.

===Planet X===

The discrepancies remained through to the 1990s when the astronomer Robert Harrington put forward his hypothesis for an extra planet beyond Neptune with, as one example, a semi-major axis 101.2 AU and eccentricity 0.411 which makes its perihelion 59.60, so the closest to the Sun it would get is one and a half times the distance to Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | title = The location of Planet X | author = R.

[[File:Barnardstar2006.jpg|thumb|Photograph taken in 2006 showing [[Barnard's star]], which V. M. Rabolu claimed to actually be the planet Hercolubus]]

In 1999, [[New Age]] author V. M. Rabolu wrote in ''Hercolubus or Red Planet'' that [[Barnard's star]] is actually a planet known to the ancients as Hercolubus, which purportedly came dangerously close to Earth in the past, destroying [[Atlantis]], and will come close to Earth again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hercolubus.tv|author=VM Rabolu|publisher=A Prats|url= http://www.hercolubus.tv |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieder subsequently used Rabolu's ideas to bolster her claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZetaTalk: Hercolubus|author=Nancy Lieder|date=2006-11-02|url= http://www.zetatalk.com/index/zeta335.htm |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nemesis===
{{see also|Nemesis (hypothetical star)}}
Believers in Planet X/Nibiru have often confused it with [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]],&lt;ref name=nem/&gt; a hypothetical star first proposed by physicist [[Richard A. Muller]]. In 1984, Muller postulated that [[mass extinctions]] were not random, but appeared to occur in the [[fossil record]] with a loose periodicity that ranged from 26 to 34 million years. He attributed this supposed pattern to a heretofore undetected companion to the Sun, either a dim [[red dwarf]] or a [[brown dwarf]], lying in an elliptical, 26-million-year orbit. This object, which he named Nemesis, would, once every 26 million years, pass through the [[Oort cloud]], the shell of over a trillion icy objects believed to be the source of [[long-period comet]]s that orbit at thousands of times Pluto's distance from the Sun. Nemesis's gravity would then disturb the comets' orbits and send them into the inner Solar System, causing the Earth to be bombarded. However, to date no direct evidence of Nemesis has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. G. Hills |title=Dynamical constraints on the mass and perihelion distance of Nemesis and the stability of its orbit |journal=Nature |volume=311 |issue= 5987 |pages=636–638 |date=1984-10-18 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v311/n5987/abs/311636a0.html |accessdate=2008-03-25 |doi=10.1038/311636a0 |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |bibcode=1984Natur.311..636H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the idea of Nemesis appears similar to the Nibiru cataclysm, they are, in fact, very different, as Nemesis, if it existed, would have an orbital period thousands of times longer, and would never come near Earth itself.&lt;ref name=nem&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask an Astrobiologist: What is Nemesis?|author=David Morrison|work=NASA|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/answered/2010/04/09/1662/|accessdate=2014-12-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213151916/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/answered/2010/04/09/1662/|archivedate=2014-12-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, astronomers [[Chad Trujillo]] and [[Scott Sheppard]] published a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' arguing that the apparent clustering of the [[arguments of perihelion]] of distant [[trans-Neptunian objects]] suggested the existence of a large trans-Neptunian planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Sedna-like body with a perihelion of 80 astronomical units|author=Chadwick Trujillo|author-link=Chadwick Trujillo|author2=Scott Sheppard|author2-link=Scott Sheppard|last-author-amp=yes |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=507|pages=471–474|date=27 March 2014|doi=10.1038/nature13156|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v507/n7493/full/nature13156.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2016, Mike Brown and [[Konstantin Batygin]] announced that they had corroborated Trujillo and Sheppard's findings, and that they believed the planet, which they dubbed "[[Planet Nine]]", would have a mass roughly ten times that of the Earth, and a [[semimajor axis]] of approximately 400–1500 AU (60–225 billion km).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22|title=Evidence for a distant giant planet in the Solar system|first1=Konstantin|last1=Batygin|first2=Michael E.|last2=Brown|date=20 January 2016|journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]]|volume=151|number=2|doi=10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22|pages=22|bibcode=2016AJ....151...22B|arxiv = 1601.05438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in Nibiru and the Nibiru cataclysm immediately argued that this constituted evidence for their claims. However, astronomers pointed out that this planet, if it exists, would have a [[perihelion]] (closest approach to the Sun) of roughly 200 AU, or 30 billion km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Planet Nine isn't a Death Star or the killer planet 'Nibiru.’ It may not even exist.|author= Joel Achenbach|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/01/21/planet-nine-isnt-the-mythical-nibiru-it-may-not-even-exist/|date=2016|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, believers in the Nibiru cataclysm began to suggest that the month marked the true date for Nibiru's arrival and the destruction of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shock claim Planet 9 wiped out life on Earth before...and will again|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/505737/planet-9-nine-comet-wipe-out-life-earth-extinction-Daniel-Whitmire-nibiru-x-tyche-nemesis|publisher=The Daily Star|date=2016|accessdate=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' published a paper by Daniel Whitmire (who had proposed the existence of [[#Tyche|Tyche]]) in which he reconsidered a modified version of the [[#Nemesis|Nemesis]] model he had first proposed in 1985&lt;ref name=utoday/&gt; in light of recent speculations concerning the possibility of a trans-Neptunian planet.&lt;ref name=mnras&gt;{{cite journal|title=Periodic mass extinctions and the Planet X model reconsidered|url=http://mnrasl.oxfordjournals.org/content/455/1/L114.abstract|author=Daniel P.

==Public reaction==
[[File:David Morrison SkeptiCal.jpg|thumb|right|Astronomer [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] has repeatedly debunked the claims of Nibiru cataclysm supporters.&lt;ref name=foratv/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrison2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=David|title=The Truth About Nibiru|url=https://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/truth-about-nibiru/|website=Solar System Exploration Research: Virtual Institute|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|date=2017|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The impact of the public fear of the Nibiru cataclysm has been especially felt by professional astronomers. In 2008, Mike Brown said that Nibiru was the most common [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] topic he was asked about.&lt;ref name=mike/&gt;

Before his retirement after 2012, [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], director of the [[SETI Institute]], [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSI Fellow]] and Senior Scientist at [[NASA]]'s Astrobiology Institute at [[Ames Research Center]], said he received 20 to 25 emails a week about the impending arrival of Nibiru: some frightened, others angry and naming him as part of the conspiracy to keep the truth of the impending apocalypse from the public, and still others asking whether or not they should kill themselves, their children or their pets.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=foratv/&gt; Half of these emails were from outside the U.S.&lt;ref name=morrison2/&gt; "Planetary scientists are being driven to distraction by Nibiru," notes science writer [[Govert Schilling]], "And it is not surprising; you devote so much time, energy and creativity to fascinating scientific research, and find yourself on the tracks of the most amazing and interesting things, and all the public at large is concerned about is some crackpot theory about clay tablets, god-astronauts and a planet that doesn't exist."&lt;ref name=govert/&gt; In a similar vein, Professor [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] Tweeted in 2012 that, "If anyone else asks me about 'Nibiru' the imaginary bullshit planet I will slap them around their irrational heads with [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=ProfBrianCox|author=Brian Cox|number=267912728969089024|date=12 November 2012|title=If anyone else asks me about "Nibiru" the imaginary bullshit planet I will slap them around their irrational heads with Newton's Principia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

NASA frequently has to evaluate whether or not to respond to such claims, and the value of reassuring the public is outweighed by the risk of granting further exposure to a completely non-scientific idea.&lt;ref name=skepcheck/&gt; Prior to the 2012 date, Morrison stated that he hoped that the non-arrival of Nibiru could serve as a teaching moment for the public, instructing them on "rational thought and baloney detection", but doubted that would happen.&lt;ref name=morrison&gt;{{cite web|title=Armageddon from Planet Nibiru in 2012? Not so fast|author=David Morrison|publisher=discovery.com|date=2008|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/space/my-take/nibiru-armageddon-david-morrison.html|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2017 revival, Morrison stated that the Nibiru phenomenon "keeps popping up over and over" despite his original assumption that it would be short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selk|first1=Avi|title=Please stop annoying this NASA scientist with your ridiculous Planet X doomsday theories|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/18/please-stop-annoying-this-nasa-scientist-with-your-ridiculous-planet-x-doomsday-theories/|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison noted in a lecture recorded on [[FORA.tv]] that there was a huge disconnect between the large number of people on the Internet who believed in Nibiru's arrival and the majority of scientists who have never heard of it. To date he is the only major NASA scientist to speak out regularly against the Nibiru phenomenon.&lt;ref name=foratv&gt;{{cite web|title=David Morrison: Surviving 2012 and Other Cosmic Disasters |publisher=FORA.tv|url=http://fora.tv/2010/04/24/David_Morrison_Surviving_2012_and_Other_Cosmic_Disasters|accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[viral marketing]] campaign for [[Sony Pictures]]' 2009 film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'', directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], which depicts the end of the world in the year 2012, featured a supposed warning from the "Institute for Human Continuity" that listed the arrival of Planet X as one of its doomsday scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IHC:'' Education/Awareness|date=2009|publisher=Sony Pictures|url=http://www.instituteforhumancontinuity.org/?hs308=email#/initiatives/earth/education/planetX|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Brown attributed a spike in concerned emails and phone calls he received from the public to this site.&lt;ref name=sony&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Pictures and the End of the World|author=Mike Brown|publisher=Mike Brown's Planets|date=2009|url= http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2009/06/sony-pictures-and-end-of-world.html|accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish filmmaker [[Lars von Trier]] drew inspiration from Nibiru for his 2011 apocalyptic film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen A.

==Biography and career==
Kardashev graduated from [[Moscow State University]] in 1955, following up at [[Sternberg Astronomical Institute]].  He studied under [[Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky|Shklovskii]] and finished his PhD in 1962.

In 1963 Kardashev examined [[quasar]] [[CTA-102]], the first Soviet effort in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]).  In this work he came up with the idea that some galactic civilizations would be perhaps millions or billions of years ahead of us, and created the [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev classification scheme]] to rank such civilizations. Kardashev defined three levels of civilizations, based on energy consumption: [[Planetary civilization|Type&amp;nbsp;I]] with "technological level close to the level presently attained on earth, with energy consumption at ≈4{{e|19}} [[erg]]/sec (4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; watts)". Type&amp;nbsp;II, "a civilization capable of harnessing the energy radiated by its own star", and Type&amp;nbsp;III, "a civilization in possession of energy on the scale of its own [[galaxy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kardashev| first =Nikolai| title=Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations| date = 1964 | journal=Soviet Astronomy | bibcode = 1964SvA.....8..217K | volume = 8 | page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Serious Russian efforts in [[SETI]] predate similar programs in the [[United States|US]] by some years.  Other notable experts in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] were [[Vsevolod Troitskii]] and [[Iosif Samuilovich Shklovskii]] (Kardashev's former professor).

Kardashev became a corresponding (associate) member of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], Division of General Physics and Astronomy on December 12, 1976. He became a full member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] on March 21, 1994 and was awarded the [[Demidov Prize]] in 2014.&lt;ref name= DP1&gt; {{cite web|url= http://zioc.ru/events/news-announcements/2015/full-member-of-ras-oleg-nefedov-was-awarded-the-demidov-prize&amp;lang=en|title=Full Member of RAS Oleg Nefedov was awarded the Demidov Prize|publisher= Royal Academy of Sciences|accessdate = 11 September 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Nature''''' was a [[philosophy|philosophical]] poem which details [[Anaximander]]'s theories about the [[evolution]] of the [[Earth]], [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[humankind]]. Anaximander described his theory that humans and other animals descended from fish once the world's oceans began to dry up. Also he described a theory of [[abiogenesis]] in his book in the way that he believed that the first life forms formed from mist. We know little about his book because it has been lost or destroyed, however it still remains important today because it describes one of the world's earliest theories of evolution.

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
[[File:Aristoteles De Caelo page 1.png|right|thumb|Page one of Aristotle's ''On the Heavens'', from an edition published in 1837]]

'''''On the Heavens''''' (Greek: Περὶ οὐρανοῦ; Latin: ''De Caelo'' or ''De Caelo et Mundo'') is [[Aristotle]]'s chief [[cosmological]] treatise: written in 350 BC it contains his astronomical theory and his ideas on the concrete workings of the terrestrial world. It should not be confused with the spurious work ''[[On the Universe]]'' (''De mundo'', also known as ''On the Cosmos'').

According to Aristotle in On the Heavens, the heavenly bodies are the most perfect realities, (or "substances"), whose motions are ruled by principles other than those of bodies in the [[sublunary sphere]]. The latter are composed of one or all of the four [[classical element]]s ([[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]]) and are perishable; but the matter of which the heavens are made is imperishable [[aether (classical element)|aether]], so they are not subject to [[On Generation and Corruption|generation and corruption]]. Hence their motions are eternal and perfect, and the perfect motion is the circular one, which, unlike the earthly up-and down-ward locomotions, can last eternally selfsame. As substances, celestial bodies have matter (aether) and form (a given period of uniform rotation). Sometimes Aristotle seems to regard them as living beings with a rational soul as their form&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Bowen, Christian Wildberg, ''New perspectives on Aristotle's De caelo'' (Brill, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; (see also ''[[Aristotelian view of God|Metaphysics]]'', bk. XII). This work is significant as one of the defining pillars of the Aristotelian worldview, a school of philosophy that dominated intellectual thinking for almost two millennia. Similarly, this work and others by [[Aristotle]] were important seminal works by which much of [[scholasticism]] was derived.

== Historical connections ==

Aristotelian philosophy and cosmology was influential in the Islamic world, where his ideas were taken up by the [[Falsafa]] school of philosophy throughout the later half of the first millennia AD. Of these, philosophers [[Averroes]] and [[Avicenna]] are especially notable. Averroes in particular wrote extensively about On The Heavens, trying for some time to reconcile the various themes of Aristotelian philosophy, such as natural movement of the elements and the concept of planetary spheres centered on the [[Earth]], with the mathematics of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Endress (1995). Averroes' De Caelo Ibn Rushd's Cosmology in his Commentaries on Aristotle's On the Heavens. Arabic Sciences and Philosophy, 5, pp 9-49. doi:10.1017/S0957423900001934.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas would remain central to philosophical thought in the Islamic world well into the pre-modern period, and its influences can be found in both the theological and mystical tradition, including in the writings of [[al-Ghazali]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]]. 

[[File:St. Thomas Aquinas Confounding Averroes.jpg|thumbnail|right|Thomas Aquinas and Averroes]]

European philosophers had a similarly complex relationship with De Caelo, attempting to reconcile church doctrine with the mathematics of [[Ptolemy]] and the structure of Aristotle. A particularly cogent example of this is in the work of [[Thomas Aquinas]], theologian, philosopher and writer of the 13th century. Known today as St. Thomas of the [[Catholic Church]], Aquinas worked to synthesize Aristotle's cosmology as presented in De Caelo with Christian doctrine, an endeavor that led him to reclassify Aristotle's [[unmoved mover]]s as angels and attributing the 'first cause' of motion in the celestial spheres to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McInerny, Ralph|author2=O'Callaghan, John|last-author-amp=yes|title=Saint Thomas Aquinas|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)|url=//plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2010/entries/aquinas/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, Aquinas accepted Aristotle's explanation of the physical world, including his cosmology and physics.

The 14th century French philosopher [[Nicole Oresme]] translated and commentated on ''De Caelo'' in his role as adviser to [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]] of France, on two separate occasions, once early on in life, and again near the end of it. These versions were a traditional Latin transcription and a more comprehensive French version that synthesized his views on cosmological philosophy in its entirety, ''Questiones Super de Celo'' and ''Livre du ciel et du monde'' respectively. "Livre du ciel et du monde" was written at the command of King Charles V, though for what purpose remains of some debate. Some speculate that, having already had Oresme translate Aristotelian works on ethics and politics in the hope of educating his courtiers, doing the same with ''De Caelo'' may be of some value to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, E. (n.d). Nicole Oresme, Aristotle's 'On the heavens', and the court of Charles V. Texts And Contexts In Ancient And Medieval Science : Studies On The Occasion Of John E, 187-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sex and the Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the "Buffy" Fan''''' is an academic publication relating to the fictional [[Buffyverse]] established by TV series, [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer|''Buffy'']] and [[Angel (1999 TV series)|''Angel'']].

==Book description==

Written for undergraduates, ''Sex and the Slayer'' provides an introduction to feminism within mass media, specifically within the series ''Buffy''.

The book looks at how the show approaches gender. Jowett takes a feminist cultural studies approach,  exploring the ways in which the series represents femininity, masculinity, and gendered relations, (this includes sexuality and sexual orientation).  Jowett argues that ''Buffy'' presents a mixture of "subversive" and "conservative" portrayal of gender roles.

The '''Smith predictor''' (invented by [[Otto_J._M._Smith|O. J. M. Smith]] in 1957) is a type of predictive [[Controller_(control_theory)|controller]] for systems with pure time delay. The idea can be illustrated as follows. 

Suppose the plant consists of &lt;math&gt;G(z)&lt;/math&gt; followed by a pure time delay &lt;math&gt;z^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;.

As a first step, suppose we only consider &lt;math&gt;G(z)&lt;/math&gt; (the plant without a delay) and design a controller &lt;math&gt;C(z)&lt;/math&gt; with a [[closed-loop transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;H(z)=\frac{C(z) G(z)}{1+C(z)G(z)}&lt;/math&gt; that we consider satisfactory.

Next, our objective is to design a controller &lt;math&gt;\bar{C}(z)&lt;/math&gt; for the plant &lt;math&gt;G(z) z^{-k}&lt;/math&gt; so that the closed loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;\bar{H}(z)&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;H(z) z^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving &lt;math&gt;\frac{\bar{C} G z^{-k}}{1+\bar{C}G z^{-k}} = z^{-k} \frac{C G }{1 + C G}&lt;/math&gt;,
we obtain
&lt;math&gt; \bar{C} = \frac{C}{1+CG(1-z^{-k})}&lt;/math&gt;. The controller is implemented as shown in the following figure, where &lt;math&gt;G(z)&lt;/math&gt; has been changed to &lt;math&gt;\hat{G}(z)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that it is a model used by the controller.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Smith_predictor_1.svg|640 px]]&lt;/center&gt;

Note that there are two feedback loops.  The outer control loop feeds the output back to the input, as usual. However, this loop alone would not provide satisfactory control, because of the delay; this loop is feeding back outdated information.  Intuitively, for the k sample intervals during which no fresh information is available, the system is controlled by the inner loop which contains a predictor of what the (unobservable) output of the plant G currently is. 

To check that this works, a re-arrangement can be made as follows:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Smith_predictor_2.svg|640 px]]&lt;/center&gt;

Here we can see that if the model used in the controller, &lt;math&gt;\hat{G}(z)z^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;,  matches the plant &lt;math&gt;G(z) z^{-k}&lt;/math&gt; perfectly, then the outer and middle feedback loops cancel each other, and the controller generates the "correct" control action.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''social effects of evolutionary thought''' have been considerable.  As the scientific explanation of life's diversity has developed, it has often displaced alternative, sometimes very widely held, explanations. Because the theory of [[evolution]] includes an explanation of humanity's origins, it has had a profound impact on human [[society|societies]]. Some have vigorously denied acceptance of the scientific explanation due to its perceived religious implications (e.g. its implied rejection of the [[special creation]] of humans presumably described in the [[Bible]]). This has led to a vigorous conflict between [[creation and evolution in public education]], primarily in the United States.

==Evolution and ethics==
The theory of evolution by natural selection has also been adopted as a foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as [[social Darwinism]], an idea that preceded the publication of &lt;cite&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/cite&gt;, popular in the 19th century, which holds that "the [[survival of the fittest]]" (a phrase coined in 1851 by Herbert Spencer, 6 years before Darwin published his theory of evolution) explains and justifies differences in wealth and success among societies and people. A similar interpretation was one created by Darwin's cousin, [[Francis Galton]], known as [[eugenics]], which claimed that human civilization was subverting natural selection by allowing the less bright and less healthy to survive and out-breed the more smart and more healthy.

Later advocates of this theory suggested radical and often coercive social measures in an attempt to "correct" this imbalance. [[Thomas Huxley]] spent much time demonstrating through a series of thought experiments that it would not only be immoral, but impossible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2940 Evolution and Ethics by Thomas Henry Huxley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that social Darwinism is based on misconceptions of evolutionary theory, and many ethicists regard it as a case of the [[is-ought problem]]. After the atrocities of [[the Holocaust]] became linked with eugenics, it greatly fell out of favor with public and scientific opinion, though it was never universally accepted by either, and at no point in Nazi literature is Charles Darwin or the scientific theory of evolution mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/darwin_nazism.htm The fallacious nature of [[reductio ad Hitlerum]] arguments by anti-evolutionists.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2015}}

In his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] argues that Nazism was largely a continuation of [[Christian anti-Semitism]]. Jim Walker compiled a list of 129 quotes from [[Mein Kampf]] in which Hitler described himself as a Christian, or mentioned God, Jesus or a biblical passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler.htm Webpage containing 129 Mein Kampf quotes relating to his Christianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2015}} argue that six million of the people killed during the Holocaust were killed because of their religion (Judaism) not their race, "strength," or any reason with an obvious link to the mechanism of Darwinian evolution. Hitler often used Christian beliefs like, "Jews killed Jesus," to justify his anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitlerchristian.htm Religion and Hitler - a history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that humans share ancestors with other animals has also affected how some people view the relationship between humans and other species. Many proponents of [[animal rights]] hold that if animals and humans are of the same nature, then rights cannot be distinct to humans.

Charles Darwin, in fact, &lt;!-- himself was an abolitionist who --&gt; considered "[[sympathy]]" to be one of the most important [[Ethics|moral virtues]] — and that it was, indeed, a product of natural selection and a trait beneficial to social animals (including [[homo sapiens|humans]]). Darwin further argued that the most "sympathetic" societies would consequently be the most "successful." He also stated that our sympathy should be extended to "all sentient beings":

{{quote|As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. If, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shows us how long it is, before we look at them as our fellow-creatures. ... This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honored and practiced by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion.|source=Charles Darwin; ''The Descent of Man'', 1871}}

===Thomas Huxley: Evolution and Ethics===
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}
{{Essay-like|date=September 2013}}
[[Thomas Huxley]], ''Darwin's Bulldog'', spent much of his book [[Evolution and Ethics]] debunking Social Darwinism, piece by piece. The following is a summary of his arguments in the ''Prolegomena'', the most detailed and comprehensive of the two sections devoted to it. It should be noted that Huxley is here attempting to disprove the science behind Social Darwinism; as such, the moral arguments only come in later in the essay.

Consider a garden. Without constant upkeep, it would return to the ''state of nature'', even the very walls surrounding it crumbling in sufficient time, but by constant diligence of the gardener, may be maintained in a ''state of art''. This "state of art" is not permanent: It is instead the replacement of natural selection by artificial selection through the human energy expended in maintaining it.

This artificial selection is, however, part of natural selection: It is the action upon a set of species by the human species by way of the human species expending energy through evolved intelligence on its choice of selection. It is thus no less natural than, for example, a predator expending energy through evolved instinct on preferentially hunting a certain prey species. The presence of humans may change the dynamic, but in a perfectly natural way. Hence, it is part of the ''cosmic process'', that is natural laws, even though the "histological process" may remove many aspects of the "struggle for existence" that is a key part of the natural laws that apply to biology, from its preferred plant species by substituting human work for work done by the species itself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not only is the state of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the principle of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions to the needs of the forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nature uses unrestricted breeding to let hundreds compete for the natural resources that would only support one, and uses frost and drought to kill off the weak and unlucky, requiring not just strength, but "flexibility and good fortune." However, a gardener restricts multiplication, gives each plant sufficient space and nourishment,  protects from frost and drought&amp;mdash;and, in every other way, attempts to modify the conditions to benefit the forms that most nearly approach the result he desires. However, though the gardener's actions may have circumvented natural selection, he can still improve the species, should he find them wanting, through selective breeding. The struggle for existence is not actually required for improvement: only heritability, variation, and some form of selective pressure.

Can we then apply this to humans? Let's see how far we can take the analogy with respect to colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose a shipload of English colonists sent to form a settlement, in such a country as Tasmania was in the middle of the last century. On landing, they find themselves in the midst of a state of nature, widely different from that left behind them in everything but the most general physical conditions. The common plants, the common birds and quadrupeds, are as totally distinct as the men from anything to be seen on the side of the globe from which they come. The colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they desire to occupy.  They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend themselves from the re-immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old state of nature. Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up, in watchful antagonism to the old regime. Considered as a whole, the colony is a composite unit introduced into the old state of nature; and, thenceforward, a competitor in the struggle for existence, to conquer or be vanquished.

Under the conditions supposed, there is no doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as yet we lack an organized gardener. Let us imagine an idealized one: an administrative authority of intelligence and foresight as much greater than men as men are to their livestock. The unwanted native species - men, animals, or plants - are all weeded out and destroyed. Those to replace them are chosen with a view to his ideal of the colony, just as a gardener tries to create through his selection his ideal garden. And, finally, to ensure that no struggle for existence between the colonists interferes with the struggle against nature, he provides them with sufficient food, housing, and so on. "With every step of this progress in civilization, the colonists would become more and more independent of the state of nature; more and more, their lives would be conditioned by a state of art. In order to attain his ends, the administrator would have to avail himself of the courage, industry, and co-operative intelligence of the settlers; and it is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the proportion of persons who possess such qualities, and diminishing that of persons devoid of them. In other words, by selection directed towards an ideal."

However, though this might create a paradise where every aspect of nature works to support its colonists, problems arise: "as soon as the colonists began to multiply, the administrator would have to face the tendency to the reintroduction of the cosmic struggle into his artificial fabric, in consequence of the competition, not merely for the commodities, but for the means of existence. When the colony reached the limit of possible expansion, the surplus population must be disposed of somehow; or the fierce struggle for existence must recommence and destroy that peace, which is the fundamental condition of the maintenance of the state of art against the state of nature.

If the administrator is guided purely by scientific considerations, he would work to restrict the population by removing "the hopelessly diseased, the infirm aged, the weak or deformed in body or in mind, and the excess of infants born," just as a "gardener pulls up defective and superfluous plants, or the breeder
destroys undesirable cattle. Only the strong and the healthy, carefully matched, with a view to the progeny best adapted to the purposes of the administrator, would be permitted to perpetuate their kind."

And so we have reached Social Darwinism. However, we do not have an idealized administrator:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the more thoroughgoing of the multitudinous attempts to apply the principles of cosmic evolution, or what are supposed to be such, to social and political problems, which have appeared of late years, a considerable proportion appear to me to be based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish, from its own resources, an administrator of the kind I have imagined. The pigeons, in short, are to be their own [[Sir John Sebright]]. A despotic government, whether individual or collective, is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence, and with what, I am afraid, many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness, required for the purpose of carrying out the principle of improvement by selection, with the somewhat drastic thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends.  Experience certainly does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual "saviors of society"; and, on the well-known grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to corporations, it seems probable (indeed the belief is not without support in history) that a collective despotism, a mob got to believe in its own divine right by demagogic missionaries, would be capable of more thorough work in this direction than any single tyrant, puffed up with the same illusion, has ever achieved.  But intelligence is another affair. The fact that "saviors of society" take to that trade is evidence enough that they have none to spare. And such as they possess is generally sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend. However, I doubt whether even the keenest judge of character, if he had before him a hundred boys and girls under fourteen, could pick out, with the least chance of success, those who should be kept, as certain to be serviceable members of the polity, and those who should be chloroformed, as equally sure to be stupid, idle, or vicious. The "points" of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a puppy or a short-horn calf; many do not show themselves before the practical difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion. And by that time the mischief is done. The evil stock, if it be one, has had time to multiply, and selection is nullified.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, humans are not cattle, nor flowers: the organization of human society is kept together by
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them. They do not even correspond to social insects such as bees: With bees, "The members of the society are each organically predestined to the performance of one particular class of functions only. If they were endowed with desires, each could desire to perform none but those offices for which its organization specially fits it; and which, in view of the good of the whole, it is proper it should do. Among mankind, on the contrary, there is no such predestination to a sharply defined place in the social organism. However much men may differ in the quality of their intellects, the intensity of their passions, and the delicacy of their sensations, it cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an agricultural laborer and nothing else, and another to be a landowner and nothing else. Moreover, with all their enormous differences in natural endowment, men agree in one thing, and that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life; and, in short, to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do, without the least reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born, checked only by sympathy, familial and social bonds, and fear of the judgment of ones fellow man. "Every forward step of social progress brings men into closer relations with their fellows, and increases the importance of the pleasures and pains derived from sympathy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In short, he describes a creation of morality.

Since morality is what keeps the desire for selfishness in check, it is necessary to the propagation of society, with one requirement: the punishment of wrongdoers being necessary for the continuation of society, self-restraint must not be taken so far that wrongdoers may act unrestrained: Without the protection of society against them, "The followers of the "golden rule" may indulge in hopes of heaven, but they must reckon with the certainty that other people will be masters of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley credits Hartley (Observations on Man (1749), vol. ii p. 281.) for not only having "...laid the foundations but built up much of the superstructure of a true theory of the Evolution of the intellectual and moral faculties and for having realized that the creation of civilization will in itself create ethics, if not in an evolutionary context." as well as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley sums up this section of his argument against Social Darwinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have further shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the horticulturist and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part in the evolution of society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley finishes with a series of short, further evidences against Social Darwinism, including:

* Historical evidences against: Consider the vast changes of society between the Tudor and the Victorian eras; however, human nature, as evidenced by their writing, remains the same. "In my belief, the innate qualities, physical, intellectual, and moral, of our nation have remained substantially the same for the last four or five centuries. If the struggle for existence has affected us to any serious extent (and I doubt it) it has been, indirectly, through our military and industrial wars with other nations."
* Whether some qualities are virtues or vices depends on circumstance: "The benevolence and open-handed generosity which adorn a rich man, may make a pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune, may very easily, under unfavorable conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a "failure" will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which makes all the difference. I sometimes wonder whether people, who talk so freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own history. Surely, one must be very "fit," indeed, not to know of an occasion, or perhaps two, in one's life, when it would have been only too easy to qualify for a place among the "unfit.""

&lt;!--Have skipped the struggle for means of enjoyment argument, as it is almost impossible to summarize--&gt;

==Evolution and religion==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

Before Darwin's argument and presentation of the evidence for evolution, Western [[religion]]s generally discounted or condemned any claims that diversity of life is the result of an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and the liberal [[Anglican]] theologians who went on to publish ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''. as well as by many scientists in [[France]] and [[Scotland]] and some in [[England]], notably [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. Literal or authoritative interpretations of [[sacred text|Scripture]] hold that a [[God|supreme being]] directly created humans and other animals as separate ''[[Created kind]]s'', which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as [[creationism]]. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to the teaching of evolution theory, particularly by conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. They have expressed concerns about the effects of the teaching of evolution on society and their faith (see [[Creation-evolution controversy]]).

In response to the wide scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution, many religions have formally or informally synthesized the scientific and religious viewpoints. Several important 20th century scientists ([[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]]) whose work confirmed Darwin's theory, were also [[Christianity|Christians]] who saw no incompatibility between their experimental and theoretical confirmations of evolution and their faith. Some religions have adopted a [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolution]] viewpoint, where God provides a [[divine spark]] that ignited the process of evolution and (or), where God has guided evolution in one way or another.

===Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church===

{{main|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]], beginning in 1950 with [[Pope Pius XII]]'s encyclical [[Humani generis|Humani Generis]], took up a neutral position with regard to evolution. "The Church does not forbid that...research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 22, 1996, address to the [[Pontifical Academy of Science]], [[Pope John Paul II]] updated the Church's position, recognizing that Evolution is "more than a hypothesis" - "In his encyclical Humani Generis, my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP961022.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic views on Evolution===

Classical figures have not discussed the subject as it has only come up in the 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).

===Jewish views on evolution===

==Evolutionary theory and the political left==
{{Undue weight section|date=September 2011}}

Many important political figures on the left have never publicized their views on [[biology]], and so their opinions of evolutionary theory are unknown. To some extent, [[Marxist]]s are the exception. [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] supported Darwin's evolutionary theory. Marx even sent Darwin a copy of his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'', though Darwin never wrote back to him. Karl Marx's work was based on a material view of the world that showed natural causes and effects for all aspects of human society and economy. He recognized that Darwin's work provided a similar material explanation for all of nature, thus supporting Marx's worldview.

In 1861 Karl Marx wrote to his friend Ferdinand Lassalle, "Darwin’s work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle. ... Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, for the first time, 'teleology' in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works|volume=41|pages=246-247|chapter=Letter to F. Lassalle in Berlin. London, 16 January 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most later Marxists agreed with this view, but some – particularly those in the early [[Soviet Union]] – believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals. As a result, they came to support [[Lamarckism]] instead – the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This led to the practice of [[Lysenkoism]], which caused agricultural problems.

In his book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] argued that co-operation and mutual aid are as important in the evolution of the species as competition and mutual strife, if not more so.

On the contemporary moderate left, some authors such as [[Peter Singer]] (in his book, ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'') support Darwinism but reach different political and economic lessons than more conservative observers. Richard Dawkins' book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', has a chapter, "Nice guys finish first," that attempts to explain the role of altruism and cooperation in evolution and how social animals not only cannot survive without such traits, but how evolution will create them. Dawkins explains that when an animal sacrifices itself or uses its resources for the survival of other members of the same species, its genes, present on the other animals, survive. For example, if a mother dies to save three of its pups, one and a half copies (on average) of its genes will survive, because there is a 50% chance of a particular gene being present in its offspring. Dawkins also made a documentary of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzeCn02l_Rw Nice guys finish first]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary, Dawkins added that chapter as a way of overcoming modern day misinterpretations of the concept of ''survival of the fittest''.

==Evolution in relation to Social Darwinism and Imperialism==

"[[Social Darwinism]]" is a derogatory term associated with the 19th century [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] theory developed by [[British Whig Party|Whig]] philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. It is associated with evolutionary theory but now widely regarded as unwarranted. Social Darwinism was later expanded by others into ideas about "[[survival of the fittest]]" in commerce and human societies as a whole, and led to claims that [[social inequality]], [[sexism]], [[racism]] and [[imperialism]] were justified.&lt;ref&gt;On the history of [[eugenics]] and evolution, see {{cite book|authorlink=Daniel Kevles |first=D |last=Kevles |year=1998 |title=In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44557-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ideas contradict [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s own views, and contemporary scientists and philosophers consider these ideas to be neither mandated by evolutionary theory nor supported by data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] strongly disagreed with attempts by Herbert Spencer and others to extrapolate evolutionary ideas to all possible subjects; see {{cite book|authorlink=Mary Midgley|first=M|last=Midgley|year=2004|title=The Myths we Live By|publisher=Routledge|page=62|isbn=978-0-415-34077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allhoff F |title=Evolutionary ethics from Darwin to Moore |journal=History and philosophy of the life sciences |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–79 |year=2003 |pmid=15293515 |doi=10.1080/03919710312331272945 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gowaty, Patricia Adair |title=Feminism and evolutionary biology: boundaries, intersections, and frontiers |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |year=1997 |isbn=0-412-07361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Darwinists vigorously advocated empires, saying that strong nations—by definition, those that were successful at expanding industry and empire—would survive and others would not.

==Details==

[[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]], [[aviator|pilot]]ed by [[Peter Siebold]], carried SpaceShipOne to launch altitude. At 08:15 [[Pacific Daylight Time Zone|PDT]] at an altitude of 47,900 feet (14.6 km) and a speed of 112 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s (58 [[Metre per second|m/s]]), SpaceShipOne was released from White Knight. After gliding to 44,400 feet (13.5 km) and accelerating to [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.55, the [[rocket]] was lit for a 15 [[second]] burn.

9 seconds into the burn, SpaceShipOne exceeded the speed of sound. The craft climbed at a 70 degree angle, accelerating at 3 [[g-force|''g'']] (30 m/s²). At burn-out the Mach number was 1.2. The craft coasted to an [[apogee]] altitude of 67,800 feet (20.7 km).

The craft was reconfigured into high-drag ("feathered") mode to begin descent. After about a minute of descent, it switched to glider configuration at 35,000 feet (10.7 km). It then glided for 12 minutes back to [[Mojave Airport]].

During landing a [[flight dynamics|roll]] oscillation caused the left main gear to collapse. The craft made a [[runway excursion]] rolling to a stop in soft sand. The craft sustained minor damage, later repaired, and the pilot was uninjured.&lt;ref name="SMHSpacecraftBuiltOnTheQuietGoesSupersonicOnItsFirstSoloFlight"/&gt;{{cn|date=August 2016|reason=Needs reference to later repair}}

'''Starfire Optical Range''' ('''SOR''' - Pronounced as an [[initialism]]) is a [[United States Air Force]] research laboratory on the [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. Its primary duty, according to the official website, is to "develop and demonstrate optical wavefront control technologies." The range is a secure lab facility and is a division of the [[United States Air Force Research Laboratory#Directed Energy Directorate|Directed Energy Directorate]] of the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]].

SOR's optical equipment includes a 3.5 meter [[telescope]] which is "one of the largest telescopes in the world equipped with adaptive optics designed for satellite tracking" according to the Air Force, a 1.5 meter telescope, and a 1-meter beam director.

==Purpose==
The purpose of Starfire is to conduct research to use [[adaptive optics]] to remove the effects of [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] ([[atmospheric turbulence]]).&lt;ref name=BroadNYT&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Broad |title=Administration Researches Laser Weapon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/washington/03laser.html?ex=1304308800&amp;en=d3975f5fa334c2ec&amp;ei=5088 |publisher=New York Times |date=2006-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turbulence interferes with laser beam integrity over distances.  Lasers are being used for long-distance high-bandwidth communications and accuracy in air-to-air laser connectivity is important for data integrity.

Scintillation is also a problem in development of weaponized lasers, such as the [[airborne laser]] being developed to intercept [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]].

According to an article published on May 3, 2006 in the ''[[New York Times]]'', research is being conducted at the laboratory into how to use ground-based [[laser]]s to disable [[satellite]]s; that is, as an [[anti-satellite weapon]].&lt;ref name=BroadNYT/&gt;

'''Systematic political science''', as developed by [[Dallas F. Bell Jr.]], basically is the use of [[game theory]] methods to mathematically unify the anthropocentric academic disciplines of [[theology]], [[epistemology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[eschatology]] for computerized [[analysis]] and predictions after [[verification and validation]] methods are employed, such as [[red team]] procedures.  The discipline of systematic political science has two natural divisions of emphasis--pure and applied.  Pure (systematic) political science focuses on the parameters of individual, institutional, and societal behavior(s).  The behavioral parameters create probable decision-tree algorithms from a norm within the min max vector space sum, ∑.  Applied (systematic) political science applies the corresponding behavioral algorithms from pure political science to the subject(s) of analysis.

'''''The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat''''' is a book by journalist [[Charles Clover (journalist)|Charles Clover]] about [[overfishing]]. Clover, a former environment editor of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' (London) and now a columnist on the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' (London), describes how modern fishing is destroying ocean ecosystems. He concludes that current worldwide fish consumption is unsustainable.&lt;ref name="Fromartz"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/food/eat_drink/2007/06/20/clover_qa/ Fromartz, Samuel. "The End of the Line." ''Salon.com'' June 20, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; The book provides details about overfishing in many of the world's critical ocean habitats, such as the [[New England]] fishing grounds, west African coastlines, the European North Atlantic fishing grounds, and the ocean around Japan.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"&gt;"''The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat.''" ''Science News.'' 23 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The book concludes with suggestions on how the nations of the world could engage in sustainable ocean fishing.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews" /&gt;

==Synopsis==

Fishing is occurring at an unsustainable rate. Technological advances, political indecisiveness, and commercial interests in the fishing industry have produced a culture where fish stocks are being exploited beyond their capacity to regenerate. Commercial fish may become extinct within our lifetimes.

Official figures of global fish stocks have been wrong for several years. The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] reported that the amount of wild fish caught had increased from 44 million tons in 1950, to 88 million tons in 1990, to 104 million tons in 2000. These figures were official even though the FAO knew they were false, that the catch was actually decreasing. In 1997, the [[Grand Banks]] [[cod]] fisheries of Newfoundland, Canada, had collapsed. 75% of all fisheries were either fully exploited or overfished.

Critically endangered species of fish are still allowed to be fished. For example, the [[bluefin tuna]]’s stock is equivalent to the black rhino. However, it is still being illegally caught and sold. Furthermore, there is even an oversupply problem in the current market as technological innovations have allowed entire schools of [[bluefin tuna]] to be caught at the same time. In Spain, the catch of bluefish tuna has exponentially decreased: 5000 million tons in 1999, 2000 million tons in 2000, 900 million tons in 2005.

Developed countries are exploiting the fishing stocks of developing countries. In [[West Africa]], fishing agreements are made with European, American, and Asian fleets because money is needed to build basic infrastructure like schools and hospitals. This comes at the expense of their own local fishing industry which operates at a much less industrialised level, even though much of their local economy is sustained by fisheries. Widespread corruption within developing countries allows many agreements to be flouted.

The most common technique for modern fishing, [[trawling]], is severely damaging. A fishing vessel goes to sea, placing a net 8 inches into the seabed. The vessel travels over a certain distance where everything in the net is taken, without discrimination, and hopefully some commercially viable fish is in the net. Much of the commercially unviable fish is thrown away, with incalculable damage done to the ecosystem. Han Lindeboom compared fisheries to other industries for bottom-dwelling animals. Fishing is a thousand times more damaging than sand or gravel extraction, a million times higher than oil or gas exploration.

Technological advances used for the fishing industry are comparable to that of modern warfare. Systems of satellite technology such as [[Global Positioning System]] are used near the surface of the water and sonars with advanced echolocation are used under the water. Boats have improved engines, nets, and lines. Computers can plot fish underwater, specify its quantity, and map it with a three-dimensional image.

Deep sea fishing is becoming more accessible with technological advances and more attractive as global fish stocks decline. Most commercial fish come from the shallow seas of the continental shelves or the surface water of the open oceans. Deep sea fishing involves the fish below 1 000 feet. However, regulation of the deep sea within each country’s 200 mile limit is in its infancy, and it is non-existent elsewhere. One deep-sea fish, [[blue whiting]], has a sustainable catch of 1 000 000 tons a year. Norway alone catches 880 000 tons a year.

There is a history of fishery mismanagement ever since the industrial revolution. Industrial fishing began during the late 1800s where steam-powered trawlers operated in Western Europe. Local fisherman noticed that fish populations were being systematically wiped out. Half the fishing fleet in the world was sunk in WW2 and the opportunity to manage fisheries then was lost.  Afterwards, scientific and mathematical models were developed to better understand fish. However, these were not taken seriously. For example, [[maximum sustainable yield]], the optimal point between sustainable population size and the fishing intensity, is currently discredited because of the inability to accurately measure fish quantities. However, it is still the objective of several international fishing conventions.

Newfoundland, Canada, is a prime example of what happens when a community dependent on fisheries has overfished their fish stocks. Europeans have settled and fished in Newfoundland for 500 years, since [[John Cabot]] arrived in 1497. Estimates of the spawning stock of cod are 4.4 million tons at the time of Cabbot. In 1992, the fishing industry closed because the cod was at the point of extinction. Now, shrimp and snowcrabs have settled in the waters. This is also a cultural problem as the fisherman that live in that area work in the fisheries for 12 weeks a year then collect unemployment insurance for the rest of the year.

The common oceans, parts of the water that are beyond each country’s 200-mile limit, are not being managed properly. Stinting is the favoured method of management around those areas, where each vessel catches a limited amount of fish. However, it does not seem to work, as two species of large toothfish around Antarctica have gone extinct. The vessel construction industry is pushing more vessels to fish in those unregulated areas as fish stocks decrease. For example, the Irish domestic pelagic fleet is already 40% larger than the EU fleet limits. Yet, new fishing vessels, such as the Atlantic Dawn with over 15 000 tons, are being produced because of the entrenched interests business and political interests.

Crimes of omission are a cause in overfishing. People turn a blind eye to this situation. Logbooks do not report true catches. And even if vessels are caught, the fines for vessels that overfish are often not enforced. ‘Black fish’ is the name given to illegal catches. According to the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]], 50% of hake is illegal, 60% of cod is illegal. The observation of independent observers on fishing vessels that operate illegally are not made public without great censorship, for fear of causing offence.

High end restaurants are serving endangered fish as a delicacy for the wealthy. Celebrity chefs maintain those several restaurants and publish numerous cookbooks on serving endangered fish. The example of [[Nobu]] is used,  one of the most famous restaurants in the world.

Canned tuna is readily available to the general public. However, most canned tuna is fished unsustainably. The first problem is the [[bycatch]]. [[Purse seining]] up to 80 miles long sweep the oceans for tuna, but catching everything else in the way, including sharks, dolphins, and a variety of other fish. Second, little is being done to restrict the tuna fleet. Third, the stock is not managed because it is being operated in the middle of the ocean.

Even a scientific discussion about extinctions is marred by political interests. The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] currently warns that 75% of the world’s fisheries are fully exploited, overexploited, or significantly depleted. One practical solution to overfishing is maintaining ecological and economic operations in offshore water, and ecological and cultural operations in the inshore waters.

Rights-based systems of are a viable solution to managing fish. [[Individual fishing quota|Quota]]s can be bought or sold such that fisherman have incentive to save up for the future. Furthermore, fisheries have incentive to watch their neighbours, in case their fish stock declines and the value of their quotas falls. Iceland currently uses this system and their waters are among the few places in the world where fish is both plentiful and on the increase.

[[Marine Reserves]] are another viable method of protecting fish. In order for intensive fishing to occur, 50% of the ocean must be protected so that marine life can be sustained. However, marine reserves are not just an environmental solution, it a cultural entity that can also be used to generate economic revenue. In the Great Island Marine Reserve of New Zealand, 1370 acres of water are protected. The largest snappers are 8 times larger than those outside and 14 times more numerous.

Recreational fishing must be better managed along with industrial fishing. The contemporary angler is equipped with technology such as sonars, fish finders, and global positioning systems. As a consequence, they are taking more fish. Although angers are more cautious than industrial fisherman, the amount of fish they take is growing.

The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] is an agency that gives an independent certification of sustainability to fisheries. It has three stringent criteria: the fishery must not be overfishing, the fishery must maintain the ecosystem of the fish, the fishery must be operating in accordance with local, national, and international law. Remarkably, all filets that [[McDonald's]] use are  MSC certified, with more large stores to follow.

Fish farming is the process of growing fish in an artificial environment. The traditional method involves feeding fish waste vegetables, and this is being done in developing countries. Modern fish farming involves feeding processed small wild fish to large carnivorous fish such as [[salmon]], [[trout]], and [[prawns]]. However, modern fish farming often relies on fish taken from the water in the developing world to feed the fish being sold in the developing world. Furthermore, fish farms introduce alien species are to local environments.

The situation with the fish in the oceans is dire. The problem of overfishing are as follows: the catches of wild fish have peaked and are now in decline, rational fishery management is the exception rather than the rule, the most valuable fish is trawled to the point of extinction, the developed world is stealing from both the developing world and the future generations, and fish farming, the most viable alternative to aquaculture, has serious issues.

Solutions that people can do: fish less today so we can harvest more fish in the future, eat less fish that is wastefully caught, become educated about fish so that we can reject fish caught unsustainably, and favour the most selective, least wasteful fishing methods. Laws that should be implemented in the future: give fisherman tradable rights to fish, create marine reserves, give regional fisheries bodies real power as they are preserving the populations in their local area, and let citizens take ownership of the sea.

==Reviews==
[[University of British Columbia]] Professor of Fisheries [[Daniel Pauly]], reviewing the book for the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'', praised the book: "It is entertaining, outrageous and a must-read for anyone who cares about the sea and its denizens, or even about our supply of seafood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisheries.ubc.ca/files/InBrusselsCan%27tSeeShoalForTheFish.pdf Pauly, Daniel. "Review of 'The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat'."] ''The Times Higher Education Supplement.'' 22 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' called it "persuasive and desperately disturbing," "the maritime equivalent of ''[[Silent Spring]]''...".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/paperbacks-the-end-of-the-linebrthe-island-at-the-centre-of-the-worldbrthe-bugatti-queenbrpower-politics-and-culturebra-brief-history-of-the-human-racebrice-roadbrold-school-746321.html Hirst, Christopher; Patterson, Christina; and Tonkin, Boyd. "Paperbacks."] ''[[The Independent]].'' 25 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although widely reviewed in the United Kingdom, the book received little attention in the United States.&lt;ref name="Fromartz" /&gt; However, it was featured on the cover of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, Bart. "Fishing for Answer to Hard Questions." ''Maine Sunday Telegram.'' 25 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
The book was made into a documentary film of the same name in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-cause12-2009jun12,0,4210545.story Daunt, Tina. "'The End of the Line' Examines the Perils of Overfishing." ''Los Angeles Times.'' June 12, 2009]; [http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12970826 "Underwater Treasures." ''The Economist.'' January 22, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; The film examines the threatening extinction of the [[bluefin tuna]], caused by increasing demand for [[sushi]]; the impact on populations, marine life and climate resulting from an imbalance in marine populations; and the starvation and hunger in coastal populations, caused by the possible extinction of fish in some waters, the possible loss of livelihoods as experienced in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] following the collapse of the [[cod]] population, along with the potential remedies.

It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in the World Cinema Documentary Competition in Park City, [[Utah]], 15–25 January 2009. on 7 December 2009 at 10 pm ET/PT on CBC News Network's The Passionate Eye. The powerful documentary was filmed over 2 years at locations in England, Alaska Hong, [[Senegal]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, [[Nova Scotia]], [[Malta]] and the [[Bahamas]], following author, Charles Clover while he investigates those responsible for the dwindling marine population.

The film features Clover, along with tuna farmer turned whistle blower [[Roberto Mielgo]], top scientists from around the world, indigenous fishermen and fisheries enforcement officials, who predict that seafood could potentially extinct in 2048. Labelled the Biggest Problem you've Never Heard of, The End of the Line illustrates the disastrous effects of overfishing, and rebukes myths of farmed fish as a solution. The film advocates consumer responsibility to purchase sustainable seafood, pleas with politicians and fishermen to acknowledge the chilling devastation of overfishing, and for no-take zones in the sea to protect marine life.

On 3 March 2010, REACT to FILM screened End of the Line at the [[Soho House (club)|SoHo House]] in Manhattan, NY and moderated a Q&amp;A with producer [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2009936/ Alexis Zoullas].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Peter|title=React to film|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/from-new-york/2010/03/react-to-film|work=Vogue Italia|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]] and Japanese restaurant chain [[Nobu]] have come under criticism for not taking tuna off the menu. The Economist has called The End of the Line "the inconvenient truth about the impact of overfishing on the world's oceans". The film was directed by [[Rupert Murray]], Executive Produced by Christopher Hird and [[Chris Gorell Barnes]] produced by [[George Duffield (film-maker)|George Duffield]] and Claire Lewis, and narrated by [[Ted Danson]].

A French version was narrated by actress [[Mélanie Laurent]] and was released in June 2012 by LUG Cinéma.

The '''Voskhod''' ({{Lang-ru|'''Восход'''}}, ''"Sunrise"'') was a [[spacecraft]] built by the [[Soviet Union]]'s space program for [[human spaceflight]] as part of the [[Voskhod programme]]. It was a development of and a follow-on to the [[Vostok spacecraft]]. Voskhod 1 was used for a three-man flight whereas Voskhod 2 had a crew of two. They consisted of a spherical descent module (diameter 2.3 meters), which housed the [[cosmonaut]]s, and instruments, and a conical equipment module (mass 2.27 tonnes, 2.25 m long, 2.43 m wide), which contained propellant and the engine system. Voskhod was superseded by the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] in 1967.

==Design==
The Voskhod spacecraft was, essentially, a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup solid fuel retro rocket added to the top of the descent module. The ejection seat was removed for more space and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok crew position. There was no provision for crew escape in the event of a launch or landing emergency.

Lack of space meant that the three crew members of Voskhod 1 did not wear [[space suit]]s.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2000|p=423}} Both crew members wore spacesuits on the Voskhod 2 mission, as it involved an EVA and used an inflatable airlock. This allowed cosmonaut [[Aleksei Leonov]] to exit and re-enter the craft. It was needed because the vehicle's electrical and environmental systems were air-cooled, and complete capsule depressurization would lead to overheating. The airlock weighed 250&amp;nbsp;kg, was 700&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, 770&amp;nbsp;mm high when collapsed for launch. When extended in orbit, it was 2.5 m long, had an internal diameter of 1.0 m and an external diameter of 1.2 m. The second crew member wore a spacesuit as a precaution against accidental descent module depressurization. The airlock was jettisoned after use.

The lack of ejection seats meant that the Voskhod crew would return to Earth inside their spacecraft unlike the Vostok cosmonauts who ejected and parachuted down separately. Because of this, a new landing system was developed, which added a small solid-fuel rocket to the parachute lines. It fired as the descent module neared touchdown, providing a softer landing.

A backup solid-fueled retrorocket was added to the top of the descent module in the event that the main retrorocket failed. This had not been necessary on Vostok as the orbit was low enough that the spacecraft would decay in ten days if the retrorocket failed, there being enough onboard consumables to sustain the cosmonaut that long. In any case, the Blok E equipped R-7 booster lacked sufficient lift capacity for a backup retrorocket. Since Voskhod was well below the maximum lift capacity of the larger Blok I equipped R-7, it would be put into a quite high orbit and not decay in ten days.

Voskhod utilized the 11A57 booster, essentially the Molniya 8K78L with the Blok L stage removed to create a medium lift LEO launcher, and later the launch vehicle for the Soyuz program.

The spacecraft notably lacked any launch escape system, meaning that the crew would not survive a booster failure that occurred in the first 2-1/2 minutes of launch (after payload shroud jettison, the descent module could simply be detached). Although work had begun on a LES in 1962, it was not ready yet and so the engineers and cosmonauts simply had to gamble that the booster functioned properly during ascent, as by 1964, the R-7's success rate was improving but still not perfect.
