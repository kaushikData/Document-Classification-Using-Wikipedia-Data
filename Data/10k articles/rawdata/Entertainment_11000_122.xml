'''Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation''' ([[colloquial]]: '''Twentieth Century Fox'''; '''Fox'''; '''20th Century Fox''') is an American [[film studio]] currently owned by [[Fox Entertainment Group]], itself owned by [[21st Century Fox]]. One of the [[Major film studio|"Big Six"]] major American film studios, it was formed from the merger of the [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corporation]] and [[Twentieth Century Pictures]] in 1935, and is located in the [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]] area of [[Los Angeles]]. The studio was owned by [[News Corporation]] from 1984 to 2013. On December 14, 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced its intention to acquire the studio along with the majority of 21st Century Fox's other entertainment assets, which was approved by both companies on July 27, 2018.&lt;ref name="Approval"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/fox-disney-shareholders-vote-approve-merger/|title=Fox and Disney Shareholders Vote to Approve $71.3 Billion Merger|last=Williams|first=Trey|work=The Wrap|date=July 27, 2018|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20th Century Fox is a member of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpaa.org/our-story |title=Our Story|publisher=MPAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding===
{{see also|Fox Film|Twentieth Century Pictures}}
[[File:Foxstudiosentrance.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to 20th Century Fox's studio lot.]]
[[File:Gangs all here trailer.jpg|upright|thumb|230px|[[Carmen Miranda]] in ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]''. In 1946, she was the highest-paid actress in the United States.{{sfn|Livingston|2005|page=101}}]] [[File:Photo Don Ameche, Alice Faye, and Carmen Miranda in THAT NIGHT IN RIO (1941).jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[Alice Faye]], [[Don Ameche]], and [[Carmen Miranda]] in ''[[That Night in Rio]]'', produced by Fox in 1941.]] [[File:Viva Zapata movie trailer screenshot (3).jpg|thumb|right|220px|From the 1952 film ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'']][[Twentieth Century Pictures]]' [[Joseph Schenck]] and [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] left [[United Artists]] over a stock dispute, and began merger talks with the management of financially struggling [[Fox Film]], under President Sidney Kent.&lt;ref name="Cobbles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/zanuck-schenck.htm|title=The Formation of Twentieth Century-Fox|work=Cobbles|location=United States|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spyros Skouras]], then manager of the [[Fox West Coast Theaters]], helped make it happen (and later became president of the new company).&lt;ref name="Cobbles"/&gt;  Aside from the theater chain and a first-rate studio lot, Zanuck and Schenck felt there was not much else to Fox, which had been reeling since the founder [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] lost control of the company in 1930. The studio's biggest star, [[Will Rogers]], died in a plane crash weeks after the merger. Its leading female star, [[Janet Gaynor]], was fading in popularity and promising leading men [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] and [[Spencer Tracy]] had been dropped because of heavy drinking.

At first, it was expected that the new company was originally to be called "Fox-20th Century", even though 20th Century was the senior partner in the merger. However, 20th Century brought more to the bargaining table besides Schenck and Zanuck; it was more profitable than Fox and had considerably more talent.  The new company, 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, began trading on May 31, 1935;&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{Cite web|title=20th Century Fox: Chronology|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/fox/chronology.shtml|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hyphen was dropped in 1985. Kent remained as President, while Schenck became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Zanuck became Vice President in Charge of Production, replacing Fox's longtime production chief [[Winfield Sheehan]].

The company established a special training school. [[Lynn Bari]], [[Patricia Farr]] and [[Anne Nagel]] were among 14 young women "launched on the trail of film stardom" on August 6, 1935, when they each received a six-month contract with 20th Century Fox after spending 18 months in the school. The contracts included a studio option for renewal for as long as seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hollywood Roundup|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5323575/the_times/|work=The Times|agency=United Press|date=August 6, 1935|location=Indiana, Hammond|page=35|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 20, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, 20th Century Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915, the year Fox Film was founded.  For instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary.  However, in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding, even though most film historians agree it was founded in 1915.&lt;ref name="NY Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/02/10/is-fox-really-75-this-year-somewhere-the-fantastic-mr-william-fox-begs-to-differ|title=Is Fox really 75 this year? Somewhere, the fantastic Mr. (William) Fox begs to differ|author=New York Post Staff|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|date=February 10, 2010|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's films retained the 20th Century Pictures searchlight logo on their opening credits as well as its opening fanfare, but with the name changed to 20th Century-Fox.

After the merger was completed, Zanuck quickly signed young actors who would carry 20th Century-Fox for years:{{sfn|Lev|2014|page=23}} [[Tyrone Power]], [[Linda Darnell]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Don Ameche]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Gene Tierney]], [[Sonja Henie]], and [[Betty Grable]]. Also on the Fox payroll he found two players who he built up into the studio's leading assets, [[Alice Faye]] and seven-year-old [[Shirley Temple]]. Favoring popular biographies and musicals, Zanuck built Fox back to profitability. Thanks to record attendance during World War II, Fox overtook [[RKO]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (Hollywood's biggest studio) to become the third most profitable film studio. While Zanuck went off for 18 months' war service, junior partner [[William Goetz]] kept profits high by going for light entertainment. The studio's—indeed the industry's—biggest star was creamy blonde [[Betty Grable]].

In 1942, Spyros Skouras succeeded Kent as president of the studio. Together with Zanuck, who returned in 1943, they intended to make Fox's output more serious-minded.{{sfn|Barkan|2001|page=349}} During the next few years, with pictures like ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', ''[[Wilson (1944 film)|Wilson]]'', ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'', ''[[The Snake Pit]]'', ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang]]'', and ''[[Pinky (film)|Pinky]]'', Zanuck established a reputation for provocative, adult films. Fox also specialized in adaptations of best-selling books such as [[Ben Ames Williams]]' ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945), starring Gene Tierney, which was the highest-grossing Fox film of the 1940s. Fox also produced film versions of Broadway musicals, including the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] films, beginning with the musical version of ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'' (1945), the only work that the partnership wrote especially for films.

After the war, and with the advent of television, audiences slowly drifted away. 20th Century-Fox held on to its theaters until a court-mandated "divorce"; they were spun off as Fox National Theaters in 1953.{{sfn|Lev|2013|page=162}} That year, with attendance at half the 1946 level, 20th Century-Fox gambled on an unproven gimmick. Noting that the two film sensations of 1952 had been [[Cinerama]], which required three projectors to fill a giant curved screen, and "Natural Vision" [[3-D film|3D]], which got its effects of depth by requiring the use of polarized glasses, Fox mortgaged its studio to buy rights to a French anamorphic projection system which gave a slight illusion of depth without glasses. President [[Spyros Skouras]] struck a deal with the inventor [[Henri Chrétien]], leaving the other film studios empty-handed, and in 1953 introduced [[CinemaScope]] in the studio's groundbreaking feature film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wahooschools.org/vnews/display.v/SEC/Community%7CWahoo's%20Famous%20Sons%3E%3EDarryl%20Zanuck|title=Zanuck Remembered as a Hollywood Powerhouse|work=[[Wahoo, Nebraska|Wahoo School District]]|date=March 1, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zanuck announced in February 1953 that henceforth all Fox pictures would be made in CinemaScope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwestchicagofilmsociety.org/2012/07/16/moving-pictures-that-move-house-of-bamboo-in-cinemascope/|title=Moving Pictures That Move: House of Bamboo in CinemaScope|date=June 16, 2012|work=Northwest Chicago Film Society|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convince theater owners to install this new process, Fox agreed to help pay conversion costs (about $25,000 per screen); and to ensure enough product, Fox gave access to CinemaScope to any rival studio choosing to use it. Seeing the box-office for the first two CinemaScope features, ''The Robe'' and ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'' (also 1953), Warner Bros., MGM, [[Universal Pictures]] (then known as [[Universal-International]]), [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] quickly adopted the process. In 1956 Fox engaged [[Robert Lippert]] to establish a subsidiary company, [[Regal Pictures]], later [[Associated Producers Incorporated]] to film [[B picture]]s in CinemaScope (but "branded" RegalScope). Fox produced new musicals using the CinemaScope process including ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' and ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (both 1956).

CinemaScope brought a brief upturn in attendance, but by 1956 the numbers again began to slide.{{sfn|Watson|2015|page=290}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/poetics_10cinemascope.pdf|page=290|title='The Modern Miracle You See Without Glasses' - CinemaScope: 1953–1954: 'Twentieth Century-Fox presents A CinemaScope Production': 1953–1954 (Films made in CinemaScope from 1953 to 1956)|work=David Bordwell|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Darryl Zanuck announced his resignation as head of production. Zanuck moved to [[Paris]], setting up as an independent producer, seldom being in the United States for many years.

===Production and financial problems===
Zanuck's successor, producer [[Buddy Adler]], died a year later.{{sfn|Harris|2011|page=1900}} President Spyros Skouras brought in a series of production executives, but none had Zanuck's success. By the early 1960s, Fox was in trouble. A new version of ''Cleopatra'' had begun in 1959 with [[Joan Collins]] in the lead.&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt; As a publicity gimmick, producer [[Walter Wanger]] offered $1 million to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] if she would star;&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt; she accepted, and costs for ''Cleopatra'' began to escalate, aggravated by [[Richard Burton]]'s on-set romance with Taylor, the surrounding media frenzy, and Skouras' selfish preferences and inexperienced micromanagement on the film's production. Not even his showmanship made up for his considerable lack of filmmaking expertise in speeding up production on ''Cleopatra''.

Meanwhile, another remake — of the 1940 [[Cary Grant]] hit ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' — was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep Fox afloat. The [[romantic comedy]] entitled ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' paired [[Marilyn Monroe]], Fox's most bankable star of the 1950s, with [[Dean Martin]] and director [[George Cukor]]. The troubled Monroe caused delays on a daily basis, and it quickly descended into a costly debacle. As ''Cleopatra''{{'}}s budget passed $10 million, eventually costing around $40 million, Fox sold its back lot (now the site of [[Century City]]) to Alcoa in 1961 to raise cash. After several weeks of script rewrites on the Monroe picture and very little progress, mostly due to director George Cukor's filming methods, in addition to Monroe's chronic sinusitis, Monroe was fired from ''Something's Got to Give''&lt;ref name="Kamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1998/03/elizabeth-taylor-199803|title=When Liz Met Dick|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=April 29, 2016|first=David|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|last=Kamp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two months later she was found dead. According to Fox files she was rehired within weeks for a two-picture deal totaling $1 million, $500,000 to finish ''Something's Got to Give'' (plus a bonus at completion), and another $500,000 for ''What a Way to Go''. Elizabeth Taylor's disruptive {{POV statement|date=March 2013}} reign on the ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' set continued unchallenged from 1960 into 1962, though three Fox executives went to [[Rome]] in June 1962 to fire her.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} They learned that director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors, so Fox was then forced to allow Taylor several more weeks of filming. In the meantime during that summer of 1962 Fox released nearly all of its contract stars, including [[Jayne Mansfield]].{{sfn|Ferruccio|2010||page=117}}{{sfn|Strait|1992|page=86}}

With few pictures on the schedule, Skouras wanted to rush Zanuck's big-budget war epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962),&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt; a highly accurate account of the [[Normandy Landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944, with a huge international cast, into release as another source of quick cash. This offended Zanuck, still Fox's largest shareholder, for whom ''The Longest Day'' was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for many years. After it became clear that ''Something's Got to Give'' would not be able to progress without Monroe in the lead (Martin had refused to work with anyone else), Skouras finally decided that re-signing her was unavoidable. But days before filming was due to resume, [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|she was found dead]] at her Los Angeles home and the picture resumed filming as ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'', with [[Doris Day]] and [[James Garner]] in the leads. Released in 1963, the film was a hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisday.net/move-over-darling/|title=Move Over, Darling|work=Doris Day|location=United States|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfinished scenes from ''Something's Got to Give'' were shelved for nearly 40 years. Rather than being rushed into release as if it were a B-picture, ''The Longest Day'' was lovingly and carefully produced under Zanuck's supervision. It was finally released at a length of three hours, and was well received.

At the next board meeting Zanuck spoke for eight hours, convincing directors that Skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor. Zanuck was installed as chairman, and then named his son [[Richard Zanuck]] as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3670633/The-Napoleon-of-Sunset-Boulevard.html|title=The Napoleon of Sunset Boulevard|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=January 20, 2008|last=Preston|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|first=John|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new management group seized ''Cleopatra'' and rushed it to completion, shut down the studio, laid off the entire staff to save money, axed the long-running [[Movietone News]]reel, and made a series of cheap, popular pictures that restored Fox as a major studio. The saving grace for the studio's fortunes came from the tremendous success of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/richard-d-zanuck-a-hollywood-legend-too-busy-to-look-back/|title=Richard D. Zanuck, a Hollywood legend too busy for nostalgia
|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Los Angeles Times Staff|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=April 13, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an expensive and handsomely produced film adaptation of the [[The Sound of Music|highly acclaimed Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical]], which became a significant success at the box office and won five [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] ([[Robert Wise]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture of the Year]].

Fox also had two big science-fiction hits in the 1960s: ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (1966), and the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968), starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[Kim Hunter]], and [[Roddy McDowall]]. ''Fantastic Voyage'' was the last film made in [[CinemaScope]], which was ultimately replaced by Panavision lenses.

Zanuck stayed on as chairman until 1971, but there were several expensive flops in his last years, resulting in Fox posting losses from 1969 to 1971. Following his removal, and after an uncertain period, new management brought Fox back to health. Under president [[Gordon T. Stulberg]] and production head [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], Fox films connected with modern audiences. Stulberg used the profits to acquire resort properties, soft-drink bottlers, [[Hoyts|Australian theaters]] and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom-or-bust cycle of picture-making.

Foreshadowing a pattern of film production still yet to come, in late 1973 20th Century Fox joined forces with Warner Bros. to co-produce ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardswatch.com/predictions/best-supporting-studio-warner-bros-pictures-track-record-in-the-best-supporting-actor-category/|location=United States|title=Best Supporting Studio: Warner Bros. Pictures' Track Record in the Best Supporting Actor Category|last=Anderson|work=Awards Watch|date=September 28, 2013|first=Erik|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an all-star action blockbuster from producer [[Irwin Allen]].  Both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios, and announced that as Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be career suicide to have competing movies. Thus the first joint-venture studio deal was struck.  In hindsight (while it may be commonplace now) back in the 1970s it was a risky, but revolutionary, idea that paid off handsomely at both domestic and international box offices around the world.

In 1977 Fox's success reached new heights and produced the most profitable film made up to that time, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Substantial financial gains were realized as a result of the film's unprecedented success: from a low of $6 in June 1976, stock prices more than quadrupled to almost $27 after ''Star Wars''' release; 1976 revenues of $195 million rose to $301 million in 1977.{{sfn|Solomon|2002|pages=19–20}}

===Marvin Davis and Rupert Murdoch===

[[Image:Foxplazafromolympicblvd.jpg|thumb|

With financial stability came new owners, when Fox was sold for more than $700 million in 1981 to investors [[Marc Rich]] and [[Marvin Davis]]. Fox's assets included [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]], the [[Aspen Skiing Company]] and a [[Century City, Los Angeles, California|Century City]] property upon which Davis built and twice sold [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]].

By 1984 Rich had become a fugitive from justice, having fled to Switzerland after being charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with tax evasion, racketeering and illegal trading with Iran during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. Rich's assets were frozen by U.S. authorities.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas C. Hayes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/20/business/rich-to-sell-fox-stake-to-davis.html|title=Rich to Sell Fox Stake to Davis|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 20, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 [[Marvin Davis]] bought out [[Marc Rich]]'s 50% interest in 20th Century Fox Film Corporation for an undisclosed amount,&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt; reported to be $116 million.{{sfn|Wolff|2010|page=167}} Davis sold this interest to [[Rupert Murdoch]] for $250 million in March 1985. Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase [[John Kluge]]'s Metromedia television stations.{{sfn|Wolff|2010|page=167}} Murdoch went ahead alone and bought the stations, and later bought out Davis' remaining stake in Fox for $325 million.{{sfn|Wolff|2010|page=167}}

To gain FCC approval of Fox's purchase of [[Metromedia]]'s television holdings, once the stations of the long-dissolved [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network, Murdoch had to become a U.S. citizen. He did so in 1985, and in 1986 the new [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] took to the air. Over the next 20-odd years the network and owned-stations group expanded to become extremely profitable for News Corp.

[[Image:Foxstudios.jpg|thumb|left|Fox's Los Angeles studios in 2005.]]
Since January 2000 this company has been the international distributor for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] releases. In the 1980s Fox — through a joint venture with [[CBS]] called [[CBS/Fox Video]] — had distributed certain UA films on video; thus UA has come full circle by switching to Fox for video distribution. Fox also makes money distributing films for small independent film companies.

In 2008 Fox announced an Asian subsidiary, Fox STAR Studios, a joint venture with [[STAR TV]], also owned by News Corporation. It was reported that Fox STAR would start by producing films for the [[Bollywood]] market, then expand to several Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2008/09/fox-sets-asian.html|title=Fox sets Asian movie venture|accessdate=April 29, 2016|author=Los Angeles Times Staff|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, 20th Century Fox signed a five-year deal with [[DreamWorks Animation]] to distribute in domestic and international markets. However the deal did not include the distribution rights for previously released films which DreamWorks Animation acquired from [[Paramount Pictures]] later in 2014.&lt;ref name=VarietyQ22014Earnings&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chney|first1=Alexandra|title=DreamWorks Animation Q2 Earnings Fall Short of Estimates, SEC Investigation Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/dreamworks-animation-q2-earnings-fall-short-of-estimates-1201271262/|accessdate=July 30, 2014|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox's deal with DreamWorks Animation ended on June 2, 2017 with ''[[Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie]]'', with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] taking over the distribution deal with DreamWorks Animation due to [[NBCUniversal]]'s acquisition of DreamWorks Animation on August 22, 2016, starting on March 1, 2019 with the release of ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 3]]''.

In 2012 Rupert Murdoch announced that News Corp. would be split into two publishing and media-oriented companies: a [[News Corp|new News Corporation]], and [[21st Century Fox]], which operates the Fox Entertainment Group and 20th Century Fox. Murdoch considered the name of the new company a way to maintain the 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future.&lt;ref name="verge-21stlogo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch|first=Chris|title=21st Century Fox logo unveiled ahead of News Corp split|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/9/4316444/21st-century-fox-logo-revealed-by-rupert-murdoch|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianLogo&gt;{{cite web|last=Rushe|first=Dominic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/18/rupert-murdoch-split-empire-news-corp?CMP=twt_fd|title=Rupert Murdoch splits empire but keeps faith in tomorrow's newspapers|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

[[20th Television]] is Fox's television [[Television syndication|syndication]] division. [[20th Century Fox Television]] is the studio's television production division.

During the mid-1950s features were released to television in the hope that they would broaden sponsorship and help distribution of network programs. Blocks of one-hour programming of feature films to national sponsors on 128 stations was organized by Twentieth Century Fox and National Telefilm Associates. Twentieth Century Fox received 50 percent interest in NTA Film network after it sold its library to National Telefilm Associates. This gave 90 minutes of cleared time a week and syndicated feature films to 110 non-interconnected stations for sale to national sponsors.&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fifties_Television.html?id=sWjhCESKy4AC|last=Boddy|first=William|year=1990|title=Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics|location=[[Urbana, Illinois]]|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|20th Century Fox Records|Fox Music}}

Between 1933 and 1937, a custom record label called ''Fox Movietone'' was produced starting at F-100 and running through F-136.  It featured songs from Fox movies, first using material recorded and issued on [[Victor Records|Victor]]'s [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label and halfway through switched to material recorded and issued on [[American Record Corporation|ARC]]'s dime store labels (Melotone, Perfect, etc.).  These scarce records were sold only at Fox Theaters.

[[Fox Music]] has been Fox's music arm since 2000. It encompasses music publishing and licensing businesses, dealing primarily with Fox Entertainment Group television and film soundtracks.

Prior to Fox Music, 20th Century Records was its music arm from 1958 to 1982.

==Radio==
The ''Twentieth Century Fox Presents'' radio series&lt;ref name=RUSC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusc.com/old-time-radio/20th-Century-Fox-Presents.aspx?s=809|title=20th Century Fox Presents|work=RUSC|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were broadcast between 1936 and 1942. More often than not, the shows were a radio preview featuring a medley of the songs and soundtracks from the latest movie being released into the theaters, much like the modern day movie trailers we now see on TV, to encourage folks to head down to their nearest Picture House.

The radio shows featured the original stars, with the announcer narrating a lead up that encapsulated the performance.

==Motion picture film processing==
From its earliest ventures into movie production, Fox Film Corporation operated its own processing laboratories.  The original lab was located in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] along with the studios.  A lab was included with the new studio built in Los Angeles in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Fox Folks Vol. I, No. 4, August 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by [[Alan E. Freedman]], the Fort Lee lab was moved into the new Fox Studios building in Manhattan in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Fox Folks Vol. I, No. 4, August 1922.  Also, Vol. III, No. 7, July 1924, p. 12 and back outside cover, and Vol. III, No. 8, August 1924, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932, Freedman bought the labs from Fox for $2,000,000 to bolster what at that time was a failing Fox liquidity.&lt;ref&gt;Image, DeLuxe Laboratories, Inc. check 101 to Fox Film Corporation for $2,000,000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FilmDaily&gt;{{cite news|title=Freedman Group Buys Fox Film Laboratories|work=[[Film Daily]]|location=United States|date=April 3, 1932|accessdate=April 29, 2016|page=1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdailyvolume55859newy#page/799/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renamed the operation "DeLuxe Laboratories" which much later became [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|DeLuxe Entertainment Services Group]].  In the 1940s Freedman sold the labs back to what was then 20th Century Fox and remained as president into the 1960s.  Under Freedman's leadership, DeLuxe added two more labs in Chicago and Toronto and processed film from studios other than Fox.

[[File:Screenshot 20th Century Fox Logo in 1975.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|20th Century Fox's second logo, used from 1953 to 1987. This version was designed by [[Pacific Title &amp; Art Studio|Pacific Title]] artist [[Rocky Longo]], and was originally created for the new [[CinemaScope]] process.]]
20th Century Fox is known for its searchlight structure logo. Its [[fanfare]] was originally composed in 1933 by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], who became the head of Twentieth Century-Fox's music department from 1940 until the 1960s. It was re-recorded in 1935 when 20th Century-Fox was officially established.

The original [[Art Deco]] iteration of the 20th Century-Fox logo, designed by special effects animator and matte painting artist [[Emil Kosa Jr.]], was originally made as the design for the [[20th Century Pictures]] logo, with "Fox" replacing "Pictures, Inc." in 1935. The logo was originally created as a [[matte painting]] on several layers of glass and was animated frame-by-frame. Kosa's final major work for Fox was a matte painting of the [[Statue of Liberty]] in the ending scene of ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968), shortly before his death.

[[File:Logo 20th century fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|20th Century Fox's iconic [[Computer animation|CGI]] logo used from 1994 to 2010. It can still be seen on various Fox websites.]]

In 1953, Rocky Longo, an artist at [[Pacific Title &amp; Art Studio|Pacific Title]] (now [[Pacific Title and Art]]), was hired to recreate the original logo design for the new [[CinemaScope]] picture process. Alfred Newman also re-composed the logo's fanfare with an extension to be heard during the CinemaScope logo that would follow after the Fox logo for films made using the new lenses. In order to give the design the required width to fit into the CinemaScope frame, Longo tilted the number "0" in "20th". The new fanfare was first used on the film ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'' (1953). ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'', the first film released in the CinemaScope format, featured a choir singing over the logo instead of the regular fanfare.

{{Listen|filename=20th Century FOX fanfare.ogg|title=20th Century Fox Fanfare|description=The fanfare from the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', plus the soundtracks of the [[1980 in film|1980 film]] ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', conducted by [[John Williams]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}

By the 1970s, the Fox fanfare was being used in films sporadically. [[George Lucas]] enjoyed the Alfred Newman fanfare so much that he insisted for it to be used in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). As a result, the original release of ''Star Wars'' featured the CinemaScope version of the logo, but with the version of fanfare as conducted by [[Lionel Newman]], as the original version by Alfred Newman had been misfiled. [[John Williams]] composed the film's opening theme in the same key as the fanfare ([[B-flat major|B{{flat}} major]]), serving as an extension to it of sorts. In 1980, Williams conducted a new version of the extended fanfare for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Williams' recording of the fanfare was then used in every subsequent ''[[Star Wars]]'' film until ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). After the introduction of the CGI Fox logo in 1994, the series used the final view of the new logo, replicating look of the first three released films' opening logos and allowing the [[Lucasfilm]] logo to appear during the second part of the fanfare.

In 1981, Longo repainted and updated the logo design by recoloring it yellow, redesigning it, placing the monument on a background of blue clouds and straightened the "0" in "20th". The Fox fanfare was re-orchestrated in 1981, as Longo's revised logo was being introduced.

In 1994, after a few failed attempts (which even included trying to film the familiar monument as an actual three-dimensional model,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}) Fox in-house television producer [[Kevin Burns]] was hired to produce a new logo for the company, this time using the then-new process of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). With the help of graphics producer [[Steve Soffer]] and his company Studio Productions (which had recently given face-lifts to the [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Universal Studios]] logos in 1986 and 1990, respectively), Burns insisted that the new logo would contain more detail and animation, so that the longer 21-second Fox fanfare would be used as the underscore. The new logo incorporated a virtual Los Angeles cityscape that was designed around the monument. In the background, the [[Hollywood sign]], which would give the monument an actual location (approximating Fox's actual address in [[Century City]]) can be seen. One final touch was the addition of store-front signs, with each one bearing the name of Fox executives who worked with the studio at the time. These include "Murdoch's Department Store" (referring to Rupert Murdoch, president of News Corporation, Fox's parent at the time), "Chernin's" (referring to [[Peter Chernin]]), "Burns Tri-City Alarm" (a homage to Burns' late father, who owned a burglar and fire alarm company in Upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]), "Steve's Place" (referring to Soffer) and "Ilinidi's". It was also the first time Fox was recognized as a subsidiary of News Corporation, as a byline reading "A News Corporation Company" was incorporated into the logo.

As the CGI logo was being prepared to premiere at the beginning of ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), Burns asked [[Bruce Broughton]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} to compose a new version of the familiar fanfare by Alfred Newman. In 1997, Alfred's son [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]] recorded the new version of the fanfare to reopen the Newman Scoring Stage (originally known as Fox Scoring Stage), and debuted with the release of ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997). This rendition is still in use {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.

In 2009, a newly updated CGI logo produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] debuted with the film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009). A "75th anniversary" version of the logo was introduced to coincide with 20th Century Fox's 75th anniversary the following year (much akin to practices made by most of the other American major film studios at the time), making its debut with ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'' and its final one with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="NY Post"/&gt;

===Legacy===
Numerous parodies of the fanfare have appeared in film and television. Variations have also been used by other Fox divisions and affiliated television stations, including [[WTVT]] in Tampa, Florida, and the now-defunct [[Fox Kids Network]]. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], [[Foxstar Productions]], and [[Fox Studios Australia]] are just a few of the other corporate entities that have used variations based on the original logo's design. [[21st Century Fox]], the corporate successor to the old News Corporation, uses a logo incorporating a minimalist representation of the searchlights featured in the logo.&lt;ref name="verge-21stlogo"/&gt;

'''A Bigger Bang''' was a worldwide [[concert tour]] by [[The Rolling Stones]] which took place between August 2005 and August 2007, in support of their album ''[[A Bigger Bang]]''. At the time, it was the [[List of highest grossing concert tours|highest grossing tour]] of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56586/update-stones-roll-by-u2-for-top-grossing-tour-ever |title=Update: Stones Roll By U2 For Top Grossing Tour Ever |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning $558,255,524. It has since been surpassed by [[U2]]'s 2009 to 2011 [[U2 360 Tour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huliq.com/37065/rolling-stones-tour-breaks-attendance-records|title=Rolling Stones' Tour Breaks Attendance Records|work=HULIQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; now placing second.

==History==
In  2005, the Stones announced plans for another world tour starting 21 August at a [[press conference]] and a mini concert at the [[Juilliard School]] in New York City. The A Bigger Bang Tour was expected to include dates throughout the United States and Canada before going to South America, Asia and Europe. During the Q&amp;A, [[Mick Jagger]] told reporters that it would not necessarily be their last tour.

All rehearsals for the tour took place in [[Toronto]], Ontario, in a private school; for the full stage rehearsals, a hangar at [[Pearson International Airport]] was rented.

In keeping with tradition, the Rolling Stones performed a surprise club show on 10 August 2005 at the [[Phoenix Concert Theatre]] before an audience of 1,000, each only paying $10 (the Phoenix's regular cover charge).

The tour had its official start on 21 August 2005 with two shows at historic [[Fenway Park]] in Boston. The Stones' huge stage caused extensive damage to the outfield, so that approximately 40,000 square feet (4,000 m²) of [[sod]] had to be brought in to repair it, and a subsequent baseball game held at the park three days later had to be pushed back an hour to give the grounds crew more time to complete the repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/tigers/2005-09-04-comerica-stones_x.htm "Comerica Park needs new moss after Stones concert"]. ''USA Today''. 4 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2005, it was announced by tour producer [[Michael Cohl]] that the A Bigger Bang Tour had grossed a record-shattering $162 million since opening at Fenway Park. This broke the previous North American record, held by the Stones themselves for their own 1994/1995 [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]], which grossed approximately $120 million.
In terms of revenue, the A Bigger Bang Tour was the largest tour in North America. The second largest was the Stones' 1997/1998 [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]].

On 1 February 2006, The Stones played their first concert at the [[Baltimore Arena]] since 1969, the second smallest venue they have played for the entire tour. Their most intimate performance, save the surprise Phoenix show in Toronto, was in [[Radio City Music Hall]] on 14 March 2006, in a private concert for supporters of the [[Robin Hood Foundation]]. This benefit concert was their only performance at the venue to date. Other intimate venues The Stones played during the tour was the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]] in New York City. On 28 August 2005, the Rolling Stones performed at [[Frank Clair Stadium]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada, their first performance in Ottawa since a performance at the [[Ottawa Auditorium]] 40 years earlier on 24 April 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X8cyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e-wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3578%2C3112010 |title=Four stitches, one punch, and a bite follow Stones |date=26 April 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the American leg of the tour, on 5 February 2006 the Stones played "[[Start Me Up]]", "[[Rough Justice (The Rolling Stones song)|Rough Justice]]" and "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" at the halftime show of [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit]]. Before performing "Satisfaction", Jagger made an uncharacteristic comment on their longevity: "This one we could've done for [[Super Bowl I]]." Jagger was asked to leave out two sexually suggestive lyrics. The audio on his microphone was lowered twice for the two requested omissions, but Jagger still sang those lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4688278.stm |title=Stones angry at 'ridiculous' cuts |date=8 February 2006|accessdate=15 July 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Rolling-stones-copacabana-18-02-11.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The Rolling Stones bring 1.5 million people to the sands of Copacabana.]] --&gt;

The outstanding scale of the tour was realised on 18 February 2006 when the Stones played a one-night concert on [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana Beach]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The free concert was broadcast on television and broke several records as the largest rock concert of all time. There were a reported two million people present on the beach and crowding subsequent streets. A special bridge was constructed for the band to cross from the stage to the hotel safely. Three days after the monstrous event, [[U2]] played in [[São Paulo]], and clearly affected by the huge night, ended their concert with the words, "I can't get no, satisfaction!" While the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] states the largest free concert ever was given in the same spot in 1994 by [[Rod Stewart]], to 3.5 million people, that figure includes everyone who was on Copacabana Beach for fireworks and New Year's Eve celebrations, not just for that concert. This show was recorded for exhibition on digital movie screens across the United States via [[Regal Cinemas]] and heard live on [[XM Radio]]. Additionally, the show was shown live on [[AOL Music]] in partnership with Network Live.

The Stones arrived on 8 April in the People's Republic of China for their first-ever performance in the world's most populous country (performances planned in 2003 for the [[Licks Tour]] were canceled due to the [[SARS]] epidemic). The Chinese authorities requested that the group not perform "[[Brown Sugar (song)|Brown Sugar]]", "[[Honky Tonk Women]]", "Beast of Burden", and "[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]", as they were considered to be "too suggestive."

==Richards' fall==
After their 18 April 2006 performance in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, the Rolling Stones took a one-month break before embarking on the European leg of their A Bigger Bang Tour. [[Mick Jagger]] remained in New Zealand to film a cameo in the sitcom ''[[The Knights of Prosperity]]'', while [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]] went to Fiji for two weeks with their wives.

During the vacation, Richards fell from a tree. After suffering a concussion, he was rushed back to Ascot Private Hospital in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, for further observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/richards-concussed-after-fall-from-coconut-tree-6102254.html|title=Richards concussed after fall from coconut tree|date=2006-05-01|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although reports claimed he had been released two days later, it was soon confirmed by the hospital he underwent brain surgery on 5 May to relieve a blood clot that had gathered behind his skull. The [[BBC]] reported that upon discharge, Richards profusely thanked the hospital staff for his care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4983890.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Entertainment {{!}} Stones guitarist has head surgery|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May, Britain's ''The Independent'' newspaper said that the injury meant up to six shows could be pulled from the start of the band's European tour at an estimated cost of £1 million a show. The A Bigger Bang Tour restarted in [[Milan]], Italy on 11 July 2006 at [[Stadio Giuseppe Meazza]], with Jagger singing an entire Italian translation of "As Tears Go By" and Richards having made a full recovery; four of the first fifteen dates were rescheduled for later in the summer, with the rest of the dates taking place in the summer of 2007. As well as the first fifteen dates, two more dates were postponed due to Jagger contracting [[laryngitis]].

The only previous show cancelled was one in [[Dublin]], due to complications with the promoter. Due to delays with construction, the two shows set to be at [[Wembley Stadium]] were moved to [[Twickenham Stadium]], London.  To promote this European leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour, there were plans to release the new track "[[Biggest Mistake]]" from the ''A Bigger Bang'' album.

In mid-August 2007, several media sources reported that the band would quit touring at the end of their tour, and the last concert on the tour, in London on 26 August, would be their last gig ever. Less than a week later, in an interview with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, Wood said the band had no plans to quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/36492/rolling-stones-well-never-stop-touring|title=Rolling Stones: 'We'll Never Stop Touring'|author=Jason Gregory|work=gigwise.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jagger also stated "I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a76846/jagger-insists-the-stones-will-never-quit.html|title=Jagger insists the Stones will never quit|author=Kimberley Dadds|date=2 October 2007|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour concluded with a record total gross of $558,255,524.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1048656/rolling-stones-tour-grosses-more-than-half-a-billion|title=Rolling Stones Tour Grosses More Than Half A Billion|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surpassed the previous record of $377 million earned by [[U2]] for their successful [[Vertigo Tour]]. The Stones also hold the record for third and fourth highest grossing tours with the [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] and [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]].

The official logo for the tour was the "Chippy Tongue"—an exploding re-design of the traditional Tongue logo.

==The show==
There were five different ticket options at each concert in the USA: Gold Seating $100, Diamond Seating $350, Premium Seating $175, General Admission $100 and Side Seating $50. In the United Kingdom, the price levels were £40, £60, £90, £150 and £340. Tickets had been seen on eBay for up to $4000.&lt;ref name=Wapshott&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/wealthy-rockers-do-it-for-a-bigger-bang/2005/09/18/1126981948331.html|title=Wealthy rockers do it for A Bigger Bang|last=Wapshott|first=Nicholas|date=19 September 2005|work=The Age, business section|publisher=The Age Company Ltd.

Jagger quipped about the Schwarzenegger, "Apparently he's been fundraising outside, selling bootleg T-shirts and scalping tickets", to the crowd, with Richards adding, "Hey, Arnold, don't forget our cut on the T-shirts." &lt;ref name="Wapshott"/&gt;&lt;!-- cites two previous sentences --&gt;

The A Bigger Bang Tour stage was designed by [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stufish.com/the-rolling-stones/a-bigger-bang-outdoors/reality.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 November 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20081225110000/http://www.stufish.com/the-rolling-stones/a-bigger-bang-outdoors/reality.html |archive-date=25 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Production design was by Fisher, [[Charlie Watts]], [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Patrick Woodroffe]].  The show included state-of-the-art electronics that presented visual screen shots of the Stones Tongue and live footage. The stage was 25&amp;nbsp;m (84&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. The multi-level construction included balconies behind the stage with accommodation for 400 audience.  As on the [[Bridges to Babylon]] and [[Licks Tour|Licks]] tours, the band played part of the set on a 'B' stage in the center of the field.  A section of the stage detached itself and rolled the entire band along a catwalk, creating an "island" [[B stage]] in the middle of the stadium. Unusual stage designs in and of themselves have been a feature since [[Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas '75]].

The introduction featured [[fireworks]] and computer-generated graphics representing the literal [[Big Bang]]. The four band members' faces hazily appear, and further graphics depicting fast travel through a city's streets before Keith Richards appeared on the screen to the sound of the band's opening song (mainly "[[Start Me Up]]" or "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" although a handful of other numbers opened shows on the tour).

During the concerts, one large central screen played live footage of the various band members, predominantly Jagger. Either side of the main screen, there were two sets of lighting effect panels that combine with the main screen to produce visual effects at various points in the show.

At stadium gigs, during "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]", huge flames were sent into the air above the stage. During the 1970s, this song only made sporadic live appearances, though is captured on 1977's ''[[Love You Live]]''. However, since 1989's [[Steel Wheels Tour]], "Sympathy for the Devil" has become a setlist mainstay and a vehicle for the show's most elaborate effects.

On Saturday 11 November 2006, Mick Jagger's father, Joe Jagger, died of pneumonia at age ninety-three in Kingston upon Thames near London. Jagger flew to Britain the day before to see his father one last time before returning to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] the same day, where he was to perform on Saturday night. The show went ahead as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mick Jagger's father dies at 93|date=12 November 2006|work=NBC today|author=|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/15688719|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominican artist [[Juan Luis Guerra]], opened their [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] show making it the only [[Merengue music|Merengue]] artist that has ever opened for the Stones. This opening act "garnered the best reception ever seen at a Stones show", as reported by [http://www.iorr.org It's Only Rock and Roll], the Rolling Stones Fan Club of Europe.&lt;ref name="SanJuanShowReview"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rolling Stones' San Juan, Puerto Rico 2006 Show Review |url=http://www.iorr.org/tour05/sanjuan.htm|accessdate=10 October 2007 |author=Dean Goodman |publisher=It's Only Rock and Roll| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071010003243/http://www.iorr.org/tour05/sanjuan.htm| archivedate= 10 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], show acts included Halifax natives [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], well known rap artist [[Kanye West]] and [[Alice Cooper]]. [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]] opened the show in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]]. [[Three Days Grace]] opened both concerts in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]].  [[Blue October]] opened for them in [[Nampa, Idaho]].

The two shows in San Francisco were supported by [[Metallica]], who said they were "honoured" to break a seventeen-year span of not performing an opening show, in order to open for the Stones. The Stones acknowledged this gesture by giving them 75 minutes per show, instead of the usual 45 to 60 minutes. They were also Metallica's only dates that year as they had planned to take 2005 off from touring.

[[Guns N' Roses]] were scheduled to open for the Stones for two dates in Germany, whilst on one of their [[Chinese Democracy Tour]] pre-legs. However, due to [[Keith Richards]]' fall from a tree, the shows were cancelled.

[[Van Morrison]] was the supporting act in [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands as well as in Oakland, California.. Due to heavy rain his amps, etc. were getting wet, so he was forced to stop after two songs.

'''Air Force Day''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|یوم فضائیه}}}} or ''Youm-e-Fizaya'') is celebrated in [[Pakistan]] as a [[Public holidays in Pakistan#Partial holidays or national days|national day]] on 7 September, after the annual celebration of the [[Defence Day]]. [[Airshows]] and other programs mark the [[Pakistan Air Force]]'s (PAF) role in defending the nation in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paf.gov.pk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnimarzi.com/pakistan-air-force-paf-dayseptember-7 |title=Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Day,September 7. |publisher=~www.apnimarzi.com~ |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indo-Pakisani war of 1965==
{{main|Indo-Pakistani Air War of 1965}}
On 6 September, both countries openly went to war following a series of minor skirmishes that preceded the 6th, when Pakistan was attacked by India from the Lahore-Burki sector during the dead of night (at 5 am). The war began following Pakistan's [[Operation Gibraltar]], which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the [[Tashkent Declaration]].

===Notable decorations===
A notable event of the war was that  [[Pakistan Air Force]] [[flying ace]] [[Muhammad Mahmood Alam]] shot down five [[Indian Air Force]] [[Hawker Hunter]] Mk.56 fighters in less than a minute, four being in first 30 seconds and became one of the few [[aviators who became ace in a day]] and the only jet age ace-in-a-day. He was awarded the [[Sitara-e-Jurat]] ("The star of courage") and [[Medal bar|bar]] for his actions.&lt;ref name="defencejournal2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/september/alam.htm |title=Alam’s Speed-shooting Classic |publisher=Defencejournal.com |last=Air Cdre M Kaiser Tufail |accessdate=2011-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040737/http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/september/alam.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fricker|first=John|title=Battle for Pakistan: the air war of 1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPttAAAAMAAJ |pages=15–17 |quote="before we had completed more than of about 270 degree of the turn, at around 12 degree per second, all four hunters had been shot down." -- "My fifth victim of this sortie started spewing smoke and then rolled on to his back at about 1000 feet."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Polmar&gt;{{cite book|last=Polmar|first=Norman|title=One hundred years of world military aircraft|year=2003|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-59114-686-5|pages=354|author2=Dana Bell|quote=Mohammed Mahmood Alam claimed five victories against Indian Air Force Hawker Hunters, four of them in less than one minute! Alam, who ended the conflict with 1 1 kills, became history's only jet "ace-in-a-day."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcome of war for PAF===
[[Pakistan Air Force]] gained a lot of credibility and reliability among Pakistan military and international war writers for successful defence of lahore and other important areas of Pakistan and heavy retaliation to India on the next day. The alertness of the airforce was also related to the fact that some pilots were scrambled six times in less than an hour on indication of Indian air raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Fricker|title=Battle for Pakistan: The Air War of 1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPttAAAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=I.

The '''Australian New Wave''' (also known as the '''Australian Film Revival''', '''Australian Film Renaissance''', or '''New Australian Cinema''') was an era of resurgence in worldwide popularity of [[Australian cinema]], particularly in the United States. It began in the early [[Australian films of the 1970s|1970s]] and lasted until the mid-late [[Australian films of the 1980s|1980s]]. The era also marked the emergence of [[Ozploitation]], a film genre characterised by the exploitation of colloquial [[Australian culture]].

==Background==
The Australian film industry declined after [[World War II]], coming to a virtual stop by the early 1960s. The [[Gorton Government|Gorton]] (1968–71) and [[Whitlam Government]]s (1972–75) intervened and rescued the industry from its expected oblivion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/film/ |title=Film in Australia　 |accessdate=28 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217010927/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/film/ |archive-date=17 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal and several state governments established bodies to assist with the funding of film production and the training of film makers through the [[Australian Film Television and Radio School]], which fostered a new generation of Australian filmmakers who were able to bring their visions to the screen. The 1970s saw a huge renaissance of the Australian film industry. Australia produced nearly 400 films between 1970 and 1985, more than had been made in the history of the Australian film industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | pages=229–233 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to pre-New Wave films, New Wave films are often viewed as fresh and creative, possessing "a vitality, a love of open spaces and a propensity for sudden violence and languorous sexuality". The "straight-ahead narrative style" of many Australian New Wave films reminded American audiences of "the [[Hollywood]]-maverick period of the late 1960s and early '70s that had just about run its course".&lt;ref name="hale"&gt;Hale, Mike (23 January 2013). [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/movies/the-last-new-wave-70s-australian-film-at-lincoln-center.html "When Australia Soared on Film"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beme Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|m}}), stylized as '''beme''', was a multimedia company founded by Matt Hackett and [[Casey Neistat]], a vlogger and short film maker on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Casey Neistat's Video App Avoids the Artificial Self-Image - artnet News|url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/casey-neistats-new-video-app-asks-renounce-artificial-self-image-327383|website = artnet News|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Casey Neistat - Youtube|url = https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat|website = YouTube|access-date= 2018-10-20|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beme Inc. was the creator of the [[mobile app]], [[Beme (app)|Beme]].

Despite this, the Beme News YouTube channel is still active.

==History==
In 2014, Beme Inc. was founded by Matt Hackett and [[Casey Neistat]]. On July 17, 2015, Beme Inc. released a mobile app called [[Beme (app)|Beme]] on the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]]. The app enables users to produce unedited 2-to-8-second videos, which are immediately uploaded and shared with the user's subscribers, without the ability to preview the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This New App Filters Out Phoniness and Sends 4-Second Videos You Can't Review First|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/new-app-filters-out-phoniness-and-sends-4-second-videos-you-cant-review-first-165999|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, 2015, Casey Neistat confirmed a [[United States dollar|US$]]2.6M seed round led by [[Lightspeed Venture Partners]]&lt;ref name="investors"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beme-2/investors | title= Beme - Funding RoundSeed - CrunchBase | work=CrunchBase | accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gary Vaynerchuk#VaynerRSE|VaynerRSE]].&lt;ref name="investors" /&gt; On May 2, 2016, Beme was released for Android on the [[Google Play]] Store. At TechCrunch, in May 2016, Neistat informed that they had raised a total of US$6M and had 11 full-time employees (10 technical, 1 responsible for social media). He also reported that burn rate was under around US $180k per month and that his salary was US$0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TechCrunch|title=Casey Neistat's YouTube Life|date=2016-05-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nJDgvgkaEU&amp;t=17m30s|accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2016, [[CNN]] announced the acquisition of Beme Inc. for a reported US$25 million and became a subsidiary of [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.]]&lt;ref name="WSJ-CNN_acquisition_of_Beme"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cnn-buys-casey-neistats-video-app-beme-1480353128|title=CNN Buys Casey Neistat’s Video App Beme|last=Perlberg|first=Steven|date=November 28, 2016|work=|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=December 4, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017, cofounders Matt Hackett and Casey Neistat announced that they were leaving Beme and that it would be folded into CNN Digital Studios.

In [[microeconomics]], the '''Bertrand–Edgeworth model''' of price-setting oligopoly looks at what happens when there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where there is a limit to the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.

==History==
[[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] (1822–1900) developed the model of [[Bertrand competition]] in oligopoly.  This approach was based on the assumption that there are at least two firms producing a homogenous product with constant [[marginal cost]] (this could be constant at some positive value, or with zero marginal cost as in Cournot). Consumers buy from the cheapest seller. The Bertrand–[[Nash equilibrium]] of this model is to have all (or at least two) firms setting the price equal to marginal cost.  The argument is simple: if one firm sets a price above marginal cost then another firm can undercut it by a small amount (often called ''epsilon undercutting'', where epsilon represents an arbitrarily small amount) so that the equilibrium is zero (this is sometimes called the [[Bertrand paradox (economics)|Bertrand paradox]]).

The Bertrand approach assumes that firms are willing and able to supply all demand: there is no limit to the amount that they can produce or sell.  [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] considered the case where there is a limit to what firms can sell (a capacity constraint):  he showed that if there is a fixed limit to what firms can sell, then there may exist no [[Pure strategy|pure-strategy]]  [[Nash equilibrium]] (this is sometimes called the [[Edgeworth paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edgeworth|first=Francis|year=1889|title=The pure theory of monopoly}}, reprinted in {{cite book|title=Collected Papers relating to Political Economy|year=1925|volume=1|publisher=[[Macmillan (publisher)|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Shubik]] developed the Bertrand–Edgeworth model  to allow for the firm to be willing to supply only up to its profit maximizing output at the price which it set (under [[profit maximization]] this occurs when marginal cost equals price).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shubik |first=M. |year=1959 |title=Strategy and Market Structure: Competition, Oligopoly, and the Theory of Games |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co8rAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered the case of strictly convex costs, where marginal cost is increasing in output. [[Martin Shubik|Shubik]] showed that if a Nash equilibrium exists, it must be the [[perfectly competitive]] price (where demand equals supply, and all firms set price equal to marginal cost). However, this can only happen if market demand is infinitely elastic (horizontal) at the competitive price. In general, as in the Edgeworth paradox, no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist. [[Huw Dixon]] showed that in general a [[mixed strategy]] Nash equilibrium will exist when there are [[Convex function|convex]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |last=Dixon |first=H. D. |year=1984 |title=The existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in a price-setting oligopoly with convex costs |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=16 |issue=3–4 |pages=205–12 |doi=10.1016/0165-1765(84)90164-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dixon’s proof used the Existence Theorem of [[Partha Dasgupta]] and [[Eric Maskin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dasgupta |first1=P. |last2=Maskin |first2=E. |year=1986 |title=The Existence of Equilibrium in Discontinuous Economic Games, I: Theory |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=1–26 |jstor=2297588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Dixon's assumption of (weakly) convex costs, marginal cost will be non-decreasing.  This is consistent with a cost function where marginal cost is flat for a range of outputs, marginal cost is smoothly increasing, or indeed where there is a kink in total cost so that marginal cost makes a discontinuous jump upwards.

==Later developments and related models==
There have been several responses to the non-existence of pure-strategy equilibrium identified by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] and [[Martin Shubik]].  Whilst the existence of mixed-strategy equilibrium was demonstrated by [[Huw Dixon]], it has not proven easy to characterize what the equilibrium actually looks like.  However, Allen and Hellwig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=B.|last2=Hellwig|first2=M.|year=1986|title=Bertrand–Edgeworth oligopoly in large markets|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|issue=53|pages=175–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; were able to show that in a large market with many firms, the average price set would tend to the competitive price.

It has been argued that non-pure strategies are not plausible in the context of the Bertrand–Edgworth model.  Alternative approaches have included:
*Firms choose the quantity they are willing to sell up to at each price.  This is a game in which price and quantity are chosen: as shown by Allen and Hellwig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1818802|title=Price-Setting Firms and the Oligopolistic Foundations of Perfect Competition|first1=Beth|last1=Allen|first2=Martin|last2=Hellwig|publisher=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=76|issue=2|journal=Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association |date=May 1986|pages=387–392.}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a more general case by [[Huw Dixon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://huwdixon.org/publication_archive/articles/ej1992.pdf|first=Huw|last=Dixon|title=The Perfectly competitive outcome as the equilibrium in an Edgeworthian price–quantity game|journal=[[Economic Journal]]|year=1992|issue=102|pages=301–309|accessdate=30 December 2013}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the perfectly competitive price is the unique pure-strategy equilibrium.
*Firms have to meet all demand at the price they set as proposed by Krishnendu Ghosh Dastidar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dastidar|first=Krishnendu Ghosh|date=January 1995|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/joecth/v5y1995i1p19-32.html||accessdate=30 December 2013|title=On the Existence of Pure Strategy Bertrand Equilibrium,|journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]]|publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–32|doi=10.1007/bf01213642}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pay some cost for turning away customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Huw|date=December 1990|title=Bertrand–Edgeworth Equilibria when Firms Avoid Turning Customers Away|journal=Journal of Industrial Economics|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|volume=39|issue=2|pages=131–46|doi=10.2307/2098489}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 December 2013--&gt;{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this can ensure the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, it comes at the cost of generating multiple equilibria.  However, as shown by [[Huw Dixon]], if the cost of turning customers away is sufficiently small, then any pure-strategy equilibria that exist will be close to the competitive equilibrium.
*Introducing [[product differentiation]], as proposed by Jean-Pascal Benassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benassy|first=Jean-Pascal|date=April 1989|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/restud/v56y1989i2p217-34.html|title=Market Size and Substitutability in Imperfect Competition: A Bertrand–Edgeworth–Chamberlin Model|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|publisher=[[Wiley–Blackwell]]|volume=56|issue=2|pages=217–34|accessdate=30 December 2013|doi=10.2307/2297458}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is more of a synthesis of [[monopolistic competition]] with the Bertrand–Edgeworth model, but Benassy showed that if the [[elasticity of demand]] for the firms output is sufficiently high, then any [[pure strategy]] equilibrium that existed would be close to the competitive outcome.
*"Integer pricing" as explored by [[Huw Dixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Huw David|date=July 1993|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/buecrs/v45y1993i3p257-68.html|title=Integer Pricing and Bertrand–Edgeworth Oligopoly with Strictly Convex Costs: Is It Worth More Than a Penny?|journal=[[Bulletin of Economic Research]]|publisher=[[Wiley–Blackwell]]|volume=45|issue=3|pages=257–68|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8586.1993.tb00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than treat price as a [[continuous variable]], it is treated as a [[discrete variable]].  This means that firms cannot undercut each other by an arbitrarily small amount, one of the necessary ingredients giving rise to the non-existence of a pure strategy equilibrium. This can give rise to multiple pure-strategy equilibria, some of which may be distant from the competitive equilibrium price. More recently, Prabal Roy Chowdhury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=P. R.|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/indorg/v26y2008i3p746-761.html Bertrand–Edgeworth|title=Equilibrium with a large number of firms|journal=[[International Journal of Industrial Organization]]|volume=26|issue=3|date=May 2008|pages=746–761|accessdate=30 December 2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2007.05.009}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; has combined the notion of discrete pricing with the idea that firms choose prices and the quantities they want to sell at that price as in Allen–Hellwig.
*[[Epsilon equilibrium]] in the pure-strategy game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=H.|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/restud/v54y1987i1p47-62.html|title=Approximate Bertrand Equilibria in a replicated Industry|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|volume=54|year=1987|pages=47–62|accessdate=30 December 2013}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an epsilon equilibrium, each firm is within epsilon of its optimal price.  If the epsilon is small, this might be seen as a plausible equilibrium, due perhaps to [[menu cost]]s or [[bounded rationality]]. For a given epsilon&gt;0, if there are enough firms, then an epsilon-equilibrium exists (this result depends on how one models the residual demand – the demand faced by higher-priced firms given the sales of the lower-priced firms).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1873">'''Bottom dealing''' or "base dealing" is a [[sleight of hand]] technique in which the bottom card from a deck of playing cards is dealt instead of the top card. It is used in card illusions, and as a method of [[card sharp]].

The deck is typically held in a modified [[mechanic's grip]] in the dealer's non-dominant hand. The dealer slides the top card partially off the deck as if to deal it, while the dominant hand instead takes hold of the bottom card. The card is snapped away from the deck while the top card is reset.

Unless the dealer is particularly skilled at bottom dealing, the technique produces a slightly different sound from standard dealing, and the second-to-bottom card may be drawn slightly out of place. This is called a "hanger."

Bottom dealing and [[second dealing]] both have application in [[Magic (illusion)|performance magic]].&lt;ref name=erdnase&gt;

'''Braess's paradox''' (often cited as '''Braess' paradox''') is a proposed explanation for the situation where an alteration to a road network to improve traffic flow actually has the reverse effect and impedes [[road traffic|traffic]] through it. The paradox was postulated in 1968 by German mathematician [[Dietrich Braess]], who noticed that adding a road to a [[traffic congestion|congested]] road traffic network could increase overall journey time, and it has been used to explain instances of improved [[traffic flow]] when existing major roads are closed.

The paradox may have analogies in [[electrical power grid]]s and biological systems. It has been suggested that in theory, the improvement of a malfunctioning network could be accomplished by removing certain parts of it.

== Discovery and definition ==
Dietrich Braess, a mathematician at [[Ruhr University]], [[Germany]], noticed the flow in a road network could be impeded by adding a new road, when he was working on [[traffic modelling]]. His idea was that if each driver is making the [[optimization|optimal]] self-interested decision as to which route is quickest, a shortcut could be chosen too often for drivers to have the shortest travel times possible. More formally, the idea behind Braess's discovery is that the [[Nash equilibrium]] may not equate with the best overall flow through a network.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;New Scientist, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129520-600-42nd-st-paradox-cull-the-best-to-make-things-better/  42nd St Paradox: Cull the best to make things better], 16 January 2014 by Justin Mullins&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox is stated as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"For each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions, one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the [[flow density|density of the flow]]. If every driver takes the path that looks most favourable to them, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adding extra capacity to a [[network (mathematics)|network]] when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. That is because the [[Nash equilibrium]] of such a system is not necessarily optimal. The network change induces a new game structure which leads to a (multiplayer) [[prisoner's dilemma]]. In a Nash equilibrium, drivers have no incentive to change their routes. While the system is not in a Nash equilibrium, individual drivers are able to improve their respective travel times by changing the routes they take. In the case of Braess's paradox, drivers will continue to switch until they reach Nash equilibrium despite the reduction in overall performance.

If the latency functions are linear, adding an edge can never make total travel time at equilibrium worse by a factor of more than 4/3.&lt;ref name="RoughgardenTardos"&gt;

== Possible instances of the paradox in action ==

=== Prevalence ===
In 1983, Steinberg and Zangwill provided, under reasonable assumptions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for Braess' paradox to occur in a general transportation network when a new route is added. (Note that their result applies to the addition of ''any'' new route, not just to the case of adding a single link.) As a corollary, they obtain that Braess's paradox is about as likely to occur as not occur; their result applies to random rather than planned networks and additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1287/trsc.17.3.301| title = The Prevalence of Braess' Paradox| journal = Transportation Science| volume = 17| issue = 3| pages = 301| year = 1983| last1 = Steinberg | first1 = R. | last2 = Zangwill | first2 = W. I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traffic ===

Braess's paradox has a counterpart in case of a reduction of the road network (which may cause a reduction of individual commuting time).&lt;ref name=Razemon/&gt;

In [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], a speeding up in traffic around the city was seen when a motorway was removed as part of the [[Cheonggyecheon]] restoration project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Easley | first1 = D. | last2 = Kleinberg | first2 = J. | title = Networks | page = 71 | publisher = Cornell Store Press | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], after investments into the road network in 1969, the traffic situation did not improve until a section of newly built road was closed for traffic again.&lt;ref name="Knödel1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knödel|first=W.|title=Graphentheoretische Methoden Und Ihre Anwendungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJ22pwAACAAJ|date=31 January 1969|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|isbn=978-3-540-04668-4|pages=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the temporary closing of 42nd Street in [[New York City]] for [[Earth Day]] reduced the amount of congestion in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina |authorlink=Gina Kolata | date=1990-12-25 | publisher=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/health/what-if-they-closed-42d-street-and-nobody-noticed.html |title=What if They Closed 42d Street and Nobody Noticed? |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Youn, Gastner and Jeong demonstrated specific routes in Boston, New York City and London where that might actually occur and pointed out roads that could be closed to reduce predicted travel times.&lt;ref name="YounGastner2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Youn | first1 = Hyejin | last2 = Gastner | first2 = Michael | last3 = Jeong | first3 = Hawoong | title = Price of Anarchy in Transportation Networks: Efficiency and Optimality Control| journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 101 | issue = 12 | year = 2008 | issn = 0031-9007 | pmid = 18851419 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.128701 | arxiv = 0712.1598 | bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101l8701Y | pages=128701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, New York experimented with closures of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] at [[Times Square]] and [[Herald Square]], which resulted in improved traffic flow and permanent pedestrian plazas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2814.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Paul Lecroart, of the institute of planning and development of the [[Île-de-France]], wrote that "Despite initial fears, the removal of main roads does not cause deterioration of traffic conditions beyond the starting adjustments. The traffic transfer are limited and below expectations".&lt;ref name=Razemon/&gt; He also notes that some motorized travels are not transferred on public transport and simply disappear ("evaporate").&lt;ref name=Razemon/&gt;

The same phenomenon was also observed when road closing was not part of an urban project but the consequence of an accident. In 2012 in [[Rouen]], a bridge was burned by an accident; during the two following years, other bridges were more used, but the total number of cars crossing bridges was reduced.&lt;ref name=Razemon&gt;{{fr}} Olivier Razemon, "Le paradoxde de l'« évaporation » du trafic automobile", ''[[Le monde]]'', Thursday 25 August 2016, page 5.

=== Electricity ===
In 2012, scientists at the [[Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization]] demonstrated, through [[computational modeling]], the potential for the phenomenon to occur in [[Electrical grid|power transmission networks]] where [[Electricity generation|power generation]] is decentralized.&lt;ref name=rdmag_mpi&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, an international team of researchers from Institut Néel (CNRS, France), INP (France), IEMN (CNRS, France) and UCL (Belgium) published in Physical Review Letters&lt;ref name="PalaBaltazar2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pala | first1 = M.

In particular, they showed that adding a path for electrons in a nanoscopic network paradoxically reduced its conductance. That was shown both by simulations as well as experiments at low temperature using as [[scanning gate microscopy]].

=== Biology ===
[[Adilson E. Motter]] and collaborators demonstrated that Braess's paradox outcomes may often occur in biological and ecological systems.&lt;ref&gt;Motter A. E. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200900128/abstract Improved network performance via antagonism: From synthetic rescues to multi-drug combinations], BioEssays 32, 236 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Motter suggests removing part of a perturbed network could rescue it. For resource management of endangered species [[food webs]], in which extinction of many species might follow sequentially, selective removal of a doomed species from the network could in principle bring about the positive outcome of preventing a series of further extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Sahasrabudhe S., Motter A. E., [http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1163 Rescuing ecosystems from extinction cascades through compensatory perturbations], Nature Communications 2, 170 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team sports strategy ===
It has been suggested that in basketball, a team can be seen as a network of possibilities for a route to scoring a basket, with a different efficiency for each pathway, and a star player could reduce the overall efficiency of the team, analogous to a shortcut that is overused increasing the overall times for a journey through a road network. A proposed solution for maximum efficiency in scoring is for a star player to shoot about the same number of shots as teammates. However, this approach is not supported by hard statistical evidence, as noted in the original paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 2009arXiv0908.1801S |title = The price of anarchy in basketball |journal = Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports|volume = 6 |issue = 1 |last1 = Skinner|first1 = Brian|last2 = Gastner|first2 = Michael T|last3 = Jeong|first3 = Hawoong|year = 2009|arxiv = 0908.1801|doi = 10.2202/1559-0410.1217|citeseerx = 10.1.1.215.1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In soccer [[Helenio Herrera]] is well known for his famous quote "with 10 [players] our team plays better than with 11".

== Mathematical approach ==

=== Example ===
[[Image:Braess paradox road example.svg|right|500px]]

Consider a road network as shown in the adjacent diagram on which 4000 drivers wish to travel from point Start to End. The travel time in minutes on the Start-A road is the number of travelers (T) divided by 100, and on Start-B is a constant 45 minutes (likewise with the roads across from them). If the dashed road does not exist (so the traffic network has 4 roads in total), the time needed to drive Start-A-End route with A drivers would be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{A}{100} + 45&lt;/math&gt;. The time needed to drive the Start-B-End route with B drivers would be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{B}{100} + 45&lt;/math&gt;. If either route took less time, it would not be a Nash equilibrium: a rational driver would switch from the longer route to the shorter route. As there are 4000 drivers, the fact that &lt;math&gt;A + B = 4000&lt;/math&gt; can be used to derive the fact that &lt;math&gt;A = B = 2000&lt;/math&gt; when the system is at equilibrium. Therefore, each route takes &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2000}{100} + 45 = 65&lt;/math&gt; minutes.

Now suppose the dashed line A-B is a road with an extremely short travel time of approximately 0 minutes. Suppose that the road is opened and one driver tries Start-A-B-End. To his surprise he finds that his time is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2000}{100} + \tfrac{2001}{100} = 40.01&lt;/math&gt; minutes, a saving of 25 minutes. Soon, more of the 4000 drivers are trying this new route. The time taken rises from 40.01 and keeps climbing. When the number of drivers trying the new route reaches 2500, with 1500 still in the Start-B-End route, their time will be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2500}{100} + \tfrac{4000}{100} = 65&lt;/math&gt; minutes, which is no improvement over the original route. Meanwhile, those 1500 drivers have been slowed to &lt;math&gt; 45 + \tfrac{4000}{100} = 85&lt;/math&gt; minutes, a 20-minute increase. They are obliged to switch to the new route via A too, so it now takes &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4000}{100} + \tfrac{4000}{100} = 80&lt;/math&gt; minutes. Nobody has any incentive to travel A-End or Start-B because any driver trying them will take 85 minutes. Thus, the opening of the cross route triggers an irreversible change to it by everyone, costing everyone 80 minutes instead of the original 65. If every driver were to agree not to use the A-B path, or if that route were closed, every driver would benefit by a 15-minute reduction in travel time.

=== Existence of an equilibrium ===
If one assumes the travel time for each person driving on an edge to be equal, an equilibrium will always exist.

Let &lt;math&gt;L_e(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the formula for the travel time of each person traveling along edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; people take that edge. Suppose there is a traffic graph with &lt;math&gt;x_e&lt;/math&gt; people driving along edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. Let the energy of e, &lt;math&gt;E(e)&lt;/math&gt;, be

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{x_e} L_e(i) = L_e(1) + L_e(2) + \cdots + L_e(x_e)&lt;/math&gt;

(If &lt;math&gt;x_e = 0&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;E(e) = 0&lt;/math&gt;). Let the total energy of the traffic graph be the sum of the energies of every edge in the graph.

Take a choice of routes that minimizes the total energy. Such a choice must exist because there are finitely many choices of routes. That will be an equilibrium.

Assume, for contradiction, this is not the case. Then, there is at least one driver who can switch the route and improve the travel time. Suppose the original route is &lt;math&gt;e_0, e_1, \ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt; while the new route is &lt;math&gt;e'_0, e'_1, \ldots, e'_m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be total energy of the traffic graph, and consider what happens when the route &lt;math&gt;e_0, e_1, ... e_n&lt;/math&gt; is removed. The energy of each edge &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; will be reduced by &lt;math&gt;L_{e_i}(x_{e_i})&lt;/math&gt; and so the &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; will be reduced by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n L_{e_i}(x_{e_i})&lt;/math&gt;. That is simply the total travel time needed to take the original route. If the new route is then added, &lt;math&gt;e'_0, e'_1, \ldots, e'_m&lt;/math&gt;, the total energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; will be increased by the total travel time needed to take the new route. Because the new route is shorter than the original route, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; must decrease relative to the original configuration, contradicting the assumption that the original set of routes minimized the total energy.

Therefore, the choice of routes minimizing total energy is an equilibrium.

=== Finding an equilibrium ===
The above proof outlines a procedure known as [[best response]] dynamics, which finds an equilibrium for a linear traffic graph and terminates in a finite number of steps. The algorithm is termed "best response" because at each step of the algorithm, if the graph is not at equilibrium then some driver has a best response to the strategies of all other drivers and switches to that response.

Pseudocode for Best Response Dynamics:
  Let ''P'' be some traffic pattern.
  '''while''' ''P'' is not at equilibrium:
    compute the potential energy ''e'' of ''P''
    '''for each''' driver ''d'' in ''P'':
      '''for each''' alternate path ''p'' available to ''d'':
         compute the potential energy ''n'' of the pattern when ''d'' takes path ''p''
         '''if''' ''n'' &lt; ''e'':
           modify ''P'' so that ''d'' takes path ''p''
  '''continue''' the topmost '''while'''

At each step, if some particular driver could do better by taking an alternate path (a "best response"), doing so strictly decreases the energy of the graph. If no driver has a best response, the graph is at equilibrium. Since the energy of the graph strictly decreases with each step, the best response dynamics algorithm must eventually halt.

=== How far from optimal is traffic at equilibrium? ===
If the travel time functions are linear, that is &lt;math&gt;L_e(x) = a_e x + b_e&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a_e, b_e \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then at worst, traffic in the energy-minimizing equilibrium is twice as bad as socially optimal.&lt;ref name="EasleyKleinberg"&gt;&lt;!-- please do not point the URL to http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch08.pdf, as it does not contain the reference cited by Easley and Kleinberg --&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book.pdf|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World (8.3 Advanced Material: The Social Cost of Traffic at Equilibrium)|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Jon|publisher=Jon Kleinberg|last1=Easley|first1=David|website=Jon Kleinberg's Homepage|accessdate=2015-05-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316015111/http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-16|deadurl=no}} – This is the preprint of {{ISBN|9780521195331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proof:
Let ''Z'' be some traffic configuration, with associated energy ''E''(''Z'') and total travel time ''T''(''Z''). For each edge, the energy is the sum of an [[arithmetic progression]], and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, one can show that ''E''(''Z'') ≤ ''T''(''Z'') ≤ 2''E''(''Z''). If &lt;math&gt;Z_o&lt;/math&gt; is the socially-optimal traffic flow and &lt;math&gt;Z_e&lt;/math&gt; is the energy-minimizing traffic flow, the inequality implies that &lt;math&gt;T(Z_e) \leq 2E(Z_e) \leq 2E(Z_o) \leq 2T(Z_o)&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the total travel time for the energy-minimizing equilibrium is at most twice as bad as for the optimal flow.

=== Dynamics analysis of Braess' paradox ===
In 2013, Dal Forno and Merlone&lt;ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Border-collision bifurcations in a model of Braess paradox | journal = [[Mathematics and Computers in Simulation]] | volume = 87 | year = 2013 | pages = 1–18 | issn = 0378-4754 | doi = 10.1016/j.matcom.2012.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; interpret Braess' paradox as a dynamical ternary choice problem. The analysis shows how the new path changes the problem. Before the new path is available, the dynamics is the same as in binary choices with externalities, but the new path transforms it into a ternary choice problem. The addition of an extra resource enriches the complexity of the dynamics. In fact, there can even be coexistence of cycles, and the implication of the paradox on the dynamics can be seen from both a geometrical and an analytical perspective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1223">'''Brazilian gaucho music''' (in Portuguese ''música gaúcha brasileira'' or ''música nativista''), denotes the traditional music of Southern Brazil, especially the one of [[Río Grande do Sul]] state, whose population has a strong ancestry of European countries like Portugal, Spain, Italy and Germany. The word ''[[gaucho]]'' refers to the countryside and farm people.

Among the main musical styles of ''gaucho music'' there are: [[milonga (music)|milonga]], [[chamamé]], chamarra, polca, vanera (with the variants vanerão y vanerinha), bugio, rasguido doble and rancheira.

The songs of ''gaucho music'' present themes of the folk traditions of the ''gaucho'': field, farm, horse, moral values, regional cuisine, women. The music is built in a slow, intimate manner, with lyrics abundant in metaphors. Some representative artists have been [[Teixeirinha]], José Mendes, Gildo de Freitas, Dimas Costa, Gaúcho da Fronteira, Porca Véia.

Some of the musical instruments used in the genre are [[accordion]], guitar, violin and [[bombo legüero]].

A '''Cornelian dilemma''' (''dilemme cornélien'') (spelled in translation with two "l"'s i.e. "Corneillian") is a [[dilemma]] for someone to oblige and choose from each options, revealing a detrimental effect on anyone. It involves the character experiencing an inner conflict, forcing them to choose between [[love]] with [[honour]] or [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] with [[duty]]. It is introduced in ''[[Le Cid]]''.

'''''Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey''''' is&lt;!-- as long as we can view the series somehow, the series exist, so leave as "is". --&gt; a 2014 American science [[documentary television]] series.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140304"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots ‘Cosmos’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html |date=March 4, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is a follow-up to the 1980 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', which was presented by [[Carl Sagan]] on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] and is considered a milestone for scientific documentaries. This series was developed to bring back the foundation of science to network television at the height of other scientific-based television series and films. The show is presented by astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], who, as a young high school student, was inspired by Sagan. Among the executive producers are [[Seth MacFarlane]], whose financial investment was instrumental in bringing the show to broadcast television, and [[Ann Druyan]], a co-author and co-creator of the original television series and Sagan's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sellers |first=John |title=Seth MacFarlane to Produce Sequel to Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/05/idUS178470467020110805 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is produced by [[Brannon Braga]], and [[Alan Silvestri]] composed the backing score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/01/14/alan-silvestri-to-score-cosmos-a-spacetime-odyssey/ |title=Alan Silvestri to Score ‘Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey’ |publisher=Film Music Reporter |date=January 14, 2014 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series loosely follows the same thirteen-episode format and storytelling approach that the original ''Cosmos'' used, including elements such as the "Ship of the Imagination" and the "[[Cosmic Calendar]]", but features information updated since the 1980 series, along with extensive computer-generated graphics and animation footage augmenting the narration.

The series premiered on March 9, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Library of Congress Officially Opens The Seth MacFarlane Collection of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-200.html |work=News from the Library of Congress |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously in the United States across ten [[21st Century Fox]] networks.

The series concluded on June 8, 2014, with home media release of the entire series on June 10, 2014. ''Cosmos'' has been critically praised, winning several television broadcasting awards and a [[Peabody Award]] for educational content.

On January 13, 2018, Fox announced another season titled ''Cosmos: Possible Worlds'', which will debut on March 3, 2019, on Fox, and the following day on National Geographic channels. &lt;!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!--&gt;

==Production==
===Background===
The original 13-part ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' first aired in 1980 on the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]], and was hosted by [[Carl Sagan]]. The show has been considered highly significant since its broadcast; [[David Itzkoff]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as "a watershed moment for science-themed television programming".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; The show has been watched by at least 400 million people across 60 different countries,&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; and until the 1990 documentary ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'', remained the network's highest rated program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/13/entertainment/la-et-st-fox-seth-macfarlane-cosmos-neil-degrasse-tyson-20130513 |title=2013 Upfronts: Fox, Seth MacFarlane to reboot Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos' |first=Meredith |last=Blake |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=July 22, 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sagan's death in 1996, his widow [[Ann Druyan]], the co-creator of the original ''Cosmos'' series along with [[Steven Soter]], and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] sought to create a new version of the series, aimed to appeal to as wide an audience as possible and not just to those interested in the sciences. They had struggled for years with reluctant television networks that failed to see the broad appeal of the show.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/arts/television/fox-plans-new-cosmos-with-seth-macfarlane-as-a-producer.html |title=‘Family Guy’ Creator Part of ‘Cosmos’ Update |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2012 |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Seth MacFarlane]] was instrumental in obtaining network funding for ''Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey'', and also serves as an executive producer.]]
[[Seth MacFarlane]] had met Druyan through Tyson at the 2008 kickoff event for the [[Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange]], a new Los Angeles office of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], designed to connect Hollywood writers and directors with scientists.&lt;ref name="wapost papers"/&gt; A year later, at a 2009 lunch in New York City with Tyson, MacFarlane learned of their interest to re-create ''Cosmos''. He was influenced by ''Cosmos'' as a child, believing that ''Cosmos'' served to "[bridge] the gap between the academic community and the general public".&lt;ref name="wapost papers"/&gt; At the time MacFarlane told Tyson, "I'm at a point in my career where I have some disposable income ... and I’d like to spend it on something worthwhile."&lt;ref name="parade"/&gt; MacFarlane had considered the reduction of effort for space travel in recent decades to be part of "our culture of lethargy".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; MacFarlane, who has several series on the Fox network, was able to bring Druyan to meet the heads of Fox programming, Peter Rice and [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], and helped secure the greenlighting of the show.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; MacFarlane admits that he is "the least essential person in this equation" and the effort is a departure from work he's done before, but considers this to be "very comfortable territory for me personally".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; He and Druyan have become close friends, and Druyan stated that she believed that Sagan and MacFarlane would have been "kindred spirits" with their respective "protean talents".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; In June 2012, MacFarlane provided funding to allow about 800 boxes of Sagan's personal notes and correspondences to be donated to the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="wapost papers"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/11/12/science-geek-seth-macfarlane-donates-to-carl-sagans-notes-collection/ |title=Science geek Seth MacFarlane donates to Carl Sagan’s notes collection |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Point of Inquiry]]'' interview, Tyson discussed their goal of capturing the "spirit of the original ''Cosmos''", which he describes as "uplifting themes that called people to action".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson&amp;nbsp;— Space Chronicles |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_space_chronicles/ |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Druyan describes the themes of wonder and skepticism they are infusing into the scripts, in an interview with ''[[Skepticality]]'', "In order for it to qualify on our show it has to touch you. It still has to be rigorously good science&amp;mdash;no cutting corners on that. But then, it also has to be that equal part skepticism and wonder both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ankylosaur of the Cosmos |url=http://www.skepticality.com/ankylosaur-cosmos/ |work=[[Skepticality]] |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Big Picture Science]]'' interview, Tyson credits the success of the original series for the proliferation of science programming, “The task for the next generation of ''Cosmos'' is a little bit different because I don’t need to teach you textbook science. There’s a lot of textbook science in the original ''Cosmos'', but that’s not what you remember most. What most people who remember the original series remember most is the effort to present science in a way that has meaning to you that can influence your conduct as a citizen of the nation and of the world&amp;mdash;especially of the world.” Tyson states that the new series will contain both new material and updated versions of topics in the original series, but primarily, will service the “needs of today’s population". “We want to make a program that is not simply a sequel to the first, but issues forth from the times in which we are making it, so that it matters to those who is this emergent 21st century audience.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Big Picture Science&amp;nbsp;– Seth’s Cabinet of Wonders |url=http://radio.seti.org/blog/2012/03/big-picture-science-seths-cabinet-of-wonders/ |publisher=[[SETI]] |first=Gary |last=Niederhoff |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson considered that recent successes of science-oriented shows like ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', along with films like ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'', showed that "science has become mainstream" and expects ''Cosmos'' "will land on hugely fertile ground".&lt;ref name="parade"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://parade.condenast.com/249139/lynnsherr/neil-degrasse-tyson-cosmos-master-of-the-universe/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: Cosmos’s Master of the Universe |first=Lynn |last=Shear |date=January 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson spoke about the "love-hate relationship" viewers had with the original series' Spaceship of the Imagination, but confirmed during production that they were developing "vehicles of storytelling".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry" /&gt; Tyson affirmed that defining elements of the original series, such as the Spaceship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar with improved special effects, as well as new elements, would be present. Animation for these sequences was ultimately created by a team hand-picked by MacFarlane for the series.&lt;ref name="parade"/&gt; [[Kara Vallow]] developed and produced the animation, and the animation studio used was [[Six Point Harness]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McNally |first=Victoria |title=Learn More About the Awesome Animation Sequences in Cosmos From Producer Kara Vallow |url=http://www.themarysue.com/kara-vallow-interview/ |publisher=The Mary Sue |date=March 6, 2014 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of the Spaceship of the Imagination, and sound design in general, was created by Rick Steele, who said of the show: "Cosmos has been, by far, the most challenging show of my career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asoundeffect.com/creating-the-sound-of-cosmos-a-spacetime-odyssey/ |title=Creating The Breathtaking Sound Of ‘COSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey’ |author=Andersen, Asbjoern |publisher=A Sound Effect |date=June 16, 2014 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated Spaceship was designed to "remain timeless and very simple", according to MacFarlane, using the ceiling to project future events and the floor for those in the past, to allow Tyson, as the host, to "take [the viewer] to the places that he’s talking about".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/03/07/cosmos-spacetime-odyssey-seth-macfarlane-ship/ |title=Seth MacFarlane explains the new ship on 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey' |first=Mandi |last=Bierly |date=March 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary=[[File:6 Virgo Supercluster (ELitU).png|thumb|right|The Earth's location within the [[Virgo Supercluster]].]]
The show begins with a brief introduction recorded by then President of the United States [[Barack Obama]] describing the "spirit of discovery" that the series aspires to give to its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/03/08/obama-cosmos/ |title=Obama to introduce Fox's 'Cosmos' |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=March 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2014 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=qcdYYISYh0I|title=President Obama's Intro to Cosmos, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson opens the episode to reflect on the importance of Sagan's original ''Cosmos'', and the goals of this series. He introduces the viewer to the "Ship of the Imagination", the show's narrative device to explore the universe's past, present, and future. Tyson takes the viewer to show where Earth sits in the scope of the [[Observable universe|known universe]], defining the Earth's "address" within the [[Virgo Supercluster]]. Tyson explains how humanity has not always seen the universe in this manner, and describes the hardships and persecution of [[Renaissance Italy|Renaissance Italian]] [[Giordano Bruno]] in challenging the prevailing [[geocentric model]] held by the [[Catholic Church]]. To show Bruno's ''vision'' of the cosmic order he uses an animated adaptation of the [[Flammarion engraving]], a 19th century illustration that has now become a common meme for the revealing of the mysteries of the Universe.

The episode continues onto the scope of time, using the concept of the [[Cosmic Calendar]] as used in the original series to provide a metaphor for this scale. The narration describes how if the [[Big Bang]] occurred on January 1, all of humankind's recorded history would be compressed into the last few seconds of the last minute on December 31. Tyson concludes the episode by recounting how Sagan inspired him as a student as well as his other contributions to the scientific community.

 |ShortSummary=[[File:Tree of life SVG.svg|thumb|right|The diversity of species as shown via the [[Tree of life (biology)|Tree of Life]].]]
The episode covers several facets of the origin of life and [[evolution]]. Tyson describes both [[artificial selection]] via [[selective breeding]], using the example of humankind's domestication of wolves into dogs, and [[natural selection]] that created species like polar bears. Tyson uses the Ship of the Imagination to show how [[DNA]], [[genes]], and [[mutation]] work, and how these led to the diversity of species as represented by the [[Tree of life (biology)|Tree of life]], including how complex organs such as the [[eye]] came about as a common element.

Tyson describes [[extinction]] of species and the five great [[extinction event]]s that wiped out numerous species on Earth, while some species, such as the [[tardigrade]], were able to survive and continue life. Tyson speculates on the possibility of life on other planets, such as Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], as well as how [[abiogenesis]] may have originated [[life|life on Earth]]. The episode concludes with an animation from the original ''Cosmos'' showing the evolution of life from a single cell to humankind today.

 |ShortSummary=[[File:Newton - Principia (1687), title, p. 5, color.jpg|thumb|right|The first page of Isaac Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'']] The episode begins with Tyson describing how [[pattern recognition]] manifested in early civilization as using [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]] to predict the passing of the seasons, including how the passage of a [[comet]] was often taken as an omen. Tyson continues to explain that the origin of comets only became known in the 20th century due to the work of [[Jan Oort]] and his hypothesis of the [[Oort cloud]].

Tyson then continues to relate the collaboration between [[Edmond Halley]] and [[Isaac Newton]] in the last part of the 17th century in [[Cambridge]]. The collaboration would result in the publication of ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', the first major work to describe the laws of physics in mathematical terms, despite objections and claims of plagiarism from [[Robert Hooke]] and financial difficulties of the [[Royal Society of London]]. Tyson explains how this work challenged the prevailing notion that God had planned out the heavens, but would end up influencing many factors of modern life, including [[space flight]].

Tyson further describes Halley's contributions based on Newton's work, including determining [[Astronomical unit|Earth's distance to the sun]], the [[Stellar kinematics|motion of stars]] and predicting the orbit of then-unnamed [[Halley's Comet]] using Newton's laws. Tyson contrasts these scientific approaches to understanding the galaxy compared to what earlier civilizations had done, and considers this advancement as humankind's first steps into exploring the universe. The episode ends with an animation of the Milky Way and [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] galaxies' [[Andromeda–Milky Way collision|merging]] based on the principles of Newton's laws.

 |ShortSummary=[[File:Accretion disk.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's concept of a [[black hole]]'s [[accretion disk]].]]
Tyson begins the episode by explaining the nature of the [[speed of light]] and how much of what is seen of the observable universe is from light emanated from billions of years in the past. Tyson further explains how modern astronomy has used such analyses via [[deep time]] to identify the [[Big Bang]] event and the age of the universe.

Tyson proceeds to describe how the work of [[Isaac Newton]], [[William Herschel]], [[Michael Faraday]], and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] contributed to understanding the nature of [[electromagnetic waves]] and [[gravitational force]], and how this work led towards [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]], that the speed of light is a fundamental constant of the universe and gravity can be seen as distortion of the fabric of space-time. Tyson describes the concept of [[Dark star (Newtonian mechanics)|dark star]]s as postulated by [[John Michell]] which are not visible but detectable by tracking other stars trapped within their [[gravity well]]s, an idea Herschel used to discover [[binary star]]s.

Tyson then describes the nature of [[black hole]]s, their enormous gravitational forces that can even capture light, and their discovery via [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray sources]] such as [[Cygnus X-1]]. Tyson uses the Ship of Imagination to provide a postulate of the warping of [[spacetime]] and [[time dilation]] as one enters the [[event horizon]] of the black hole, and the possibility that these may lead to other points within our universe or others, or even time travel. Tyson ends on noting that Herschel's son, [[John Herschel|John]] would be inspired by his father to continue to [[Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars|document the known stars]] as well as contributions towards [[photography]] that play on the same nature of deep time used by astronomers.

Animated sequences in this episode feature caricatures of William and John Herschel; [[Patrick Stewart]] provided the voice for William in these segments.

 |ShortSummary=[[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|thumb|right|Representative [[Fraunhofer lines]] used in [[astronomical spectroscopy]] to determine the composition of distant stellar objects]]
This episode explores the [[Light#Wave theory|wave theory of light]] as studied by humankind, noting that light has played an important role in scientific progress, with such early experiments from over 2000 years ago involving the [[camera obscura]] by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]]. Tyson describes the work of the 11th century Arabic scientist [[Ibn al-Haytham]], considered to be one of the first to postulate on the nature of light and optics leading to the concept of the [[telescope]], as well as one of the first researchers to use the [[scientific method]].

Tyson proceeds to discuss the nature of light as discovered by humankind. Work by [[Isaac Newton]] using [[diffraction]] through [[prism]]s demonstrated that light was composed of the [[visible spectrum]], while findings of [[William Herschel]] in the 19th century showed that light also consisted of [[infrared]] rays. [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] would later come to discover that by magnifying the spectrum of visible light, gaps in the spectrum would be observed. These [[Fraunhofer lines]] would later be determined to be caused by the absorption of light by [[electron]]s in moving between [[atomic orbital]]s (in the show illustrated by the [[Bohr model]]) when it passed through atoms, with each atom having a characteristic signature due to the [[quantum mechanics|quantum nature]] of these orbitals. This since has led to the core of [[astronomical spectroscopy]], allowing astronomers to make observations about the composition of stars, planets, and other stellar features through the spectral lines, as well as observing the motion and expansion of the universe, and the hypothesized existence of [[dark matter]].

 |ShortSummary=
[[File:Supernova1987A.jpg|thumb|Supernova [[SN 1987A]] demonstrated the existence of [[neutrinos]].]]
This episode looks to the nature of the cosmos on the micro and atomic scales, using the Ship of the Imagination to explore these realms. Tyson describes some of the micro-organisms that live within a dew drop, demonstrating [[paramecium]]s and [[tardigrade]]s. He proceeds to discuss how plants use [[photosynthesis]] via their [[chloroplasts]] to convert sunlight into chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and energy-rich sugars. Tyson then discusses the nature of molecules and atoms and how they relate to the evolution of species. He uses the example set forth by [[Charles Darwin]] postulating the existence of the long-tongued [[Xanthopan morganii|Morgan's sphinx moth]] based on the nature of the [[comet orchid]] with pollen far within the flower. He further demonstrates that scents from flowers are used to trigger [[Olfaction|olfactory centers in the brain]], stimulating the mind to threats as to aid in the survival of the species.

Tyson narrates how two Greek philosophers contributed to our understanding of science. [[Thales]] was among the first thinkers to examine a "universe governed by the order of natural laws that we could actually figure out," and [[Democritus]] postulated that all matter was made up of combinations of atoms in a large number of configurations. He then describes how [[carbon]] forms the basic building block for life on Earth due to its unique chemical nature. Tyson explains the basic atomic structure of [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electrons]], and the process of [[nuclear fusion]] that occurs in most stars that can overcome the [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]] that normally keeps atoms from touching each other. He then discusses the existence of [[neutrino]]s that are created by these nuclear processes, and that typically pass through all matter, making them virtually undetectable. He explains how subterranean water pool facilities lined with special detectors like the [[Super-Kamiokande]] are used to detect neutrinos when they collide with water molecules, and how neutrinos from supernova [[SN 1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] were detected three hours before the [[photon]]s of light from the explosion were observed due to the neutrinos' ability to pass through matter of the dying sun. Tyson concludes by noting that there are neutrinos from the [[Big Bang]] still existing in the universe but due to the nature of light, there is a "wall of infinity" that cannot be observed beyond.

 |ShortSummary=[[File:Meteorcrater.jpg|thumb|right|Meteor fragments from [[Meteor Crater]] in Arizona were used to estimate the age of the Earth and other materials in the Solar System.]]
This episode is centered around how science, in particular the work of [[Clair Cameron Patterson|Clair Patterson]] (voiced in animated sequences by [[Richard Gere]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.space.com/25560-cosmos-tv-show-smartphone-app.html |title='Cosmos' App Puts the Universe in Your Smartphone |first=Megan |last=Gannon |date=April 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 20, 2014 |publisher=[[Space.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the middle of the 20th century, was able to determine the [[age of the Earth]]. Tyson first describes how the Earth was formed from the coalescence of matter some millions of years after the formation of the Sun, and while scientists can examine the formations in [[stratum|rock stratum]] to date some geological events, these can only trace back millions of years. Instead, scientists have used the debris from meteor impacts, such as the [[Meteor Crater]] in Arizona, knowing that the material from such meteors coming from the [[asteroid belt]] would have been made at the same time as the Earth.

Tyson then outlines the work Patterson did as a graduate under his adviser [[Harrison Brown]] to provide an accurate count of lead in [[zircon]] particles from Meteor Crater, and to work with similar results being collected by [[George Tilton]] on uranium counts; with the established [[half-life]] of uranium's [[radioactive decay]] to lead, this would be used to estimate the age of the Earth. Patterson found that his results were contaminated by lead from the ambient environment, compared to Tilton's results, and required the construction of the first ultra-high [[cleanroom]] to remove all traces of environmental lead. With these clean results, Patterson was able to estimate the age of the Earth to 4.5 billion years.

Tyson goes on to explain that Patterson's work in performing lead-free experiments directed him to investigate the sources for lead. Tyson notes how lead does not naturally occur at Earth's surface but has been readily mined by humans (including the [[Roman Empire]]), and that [[lead poisoning|lead is poisonous to humans]]. Patterson examined the levels of lead in the common environment and in deeper parts of  the oceans and [[Antarctic]] ice, showing that lead had only been brought to the surface in recent times. He would discover that the higher levels of lead were from the use of [[tetraethyllead]] in leaded gasoline, despite long-established claims by [[Robert A. Kehoe]] and others that this chemical was safe. Patterson would continue to campaign against the use of lead, ultimately resulting in government-mandated restrictions on the use of lead. Tyson ends by noting that similar work by scientists continues to be used to help alert humankind to other fateful issues that can be identified by the study of nature.

 |ShortSummary=[[File:Edward Charles Pickering's Harem 13 May 1913.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Harvard Computers]] that helped to classify the types of stars]]
This episode provides an overview of the composition of stars, and their fate in billions of years. Tyson describes how early humans would identify stars via the use of [[constellation]]s that tied in with various myths and beliefs, such as the [[Pleiades]]. Tyson describes the work of [[Edward Charles Pickering]] to capture the spectra of multiple stars simultaneously, and the work of the [[Harvard Computers|Harvard Computers or "Pickering's Harem"]], a team of women researchers under Pickering's mentorship, to catalog the spectra. This team included [[Annie Jump Cannon]], who developed the [[stellar classification]] system, and [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]], who discovered the means to measure the distance from a star to the earth by its spectra, later used to identify other galaxies in the universe. Later, this team included [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin|Cecilia Payne]], who would develop a good friendship with Cannon; Payne's thesis based on her work with Cannon was able to determine the composition and temperature of the stars, collaborating with Cannon's classification system.

Tyson then explains the lifecycle of stars, being borne out from [[interstellar cloud]]s. He explains how stars like the [[Sun]] keep their size due to the conflicting forces of gravity that pulls the gases in, and the expansion from escaping gases from the fusion reactions at its core. As the Sun ages, it will grow hotter and brighter to the point where the balance between these reactions will fail, causing the Sun to first expand into a [[red giant]], and then collapse into a [[white dwarf]], the collapse limited by [[electron degeneracy pressure|the atomic forces]]. Tyson explains how larger stars may form even more collapsed forms of matter, creating [[nova]]s and [[supernova]]s depending on their size and leading to [[pulsar]]s. Massive stars can collapse into [[black hole]]s. Tyson then describes that stars can only be so large, using the example of [[Eta Carinae]] which is considered an unstable solar mass that could become a [[hypernova]] in the relatively near future. Tyson ends describing how all matter on Earth is the same stuff that stars are made of, and that light and energy from the stars is what drives life on Earth.

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|A map of Earth's [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]]]
This episode explores the [[palaeogeography]] of Earth over millions of years, and its impact on the development of life on the planet. Tyson starts by explaining that the [[lignin]]-rich trees evolved in the [[Carboniferous]] era about 300 million years ago, were not edible by species at the time and would instead fall over and become carbon-rich [[coal]]. Some 50 million years later, near the end of the [[Permian]] period, volcanic activity would burn the carbonaceous matter, releasing carbon dioxide and acidic components, creating a sudden [[greenhouse gas]] effect that warmed the oceans and [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|released methane from the ocean beds]], all leading towards the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], killing 90% of the species on Earth.

Tyson then explains the nature of [[plate tectonics]] that would shape the landmasses of the world. Tyson explains how scientists like [[Abraham Ortelius]] hypothesized the idea that land masses may have been connected in the past, [[Alfred Wegener]] who hypothesized the idea of a super-continent [[Pangaea]] and [[continental drift]] despite the prevailing idea of flooded land-bridges at the time, and [[Bruce C. Heezen]] and [[Marie Tharp]] who discovered the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] that supported the theory of plate tectonics. Tyson describes how the landmasses of the earth lay atop the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], which moves due to the motion and heat of the earth's [[outer core|outer]] and [[inner core]].

Tyson moves on to explain the asteroid impact that initiated the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], leaving small mammals as the dominant species on earth. Tyson proceeds to describe more recent geologic events such as the formation of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] due to the breaking of the natural dam at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and how the geologic formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] broke the free flow of the Atlantic Ocean into the Pacific, causing large-scale climate change such as turning the bulk of Africa from lush grasslands into arid plains and further influencing evolution towards tree-climbing mammals. Tyson further explains how the influence of other planets in the Solar System have small effects on the Earth's spin and [[Axial tilt|tilt]], creating the various [[ice age]]s, and how these changes influenced early human's nomadic behavior. Tyson concludes the episode by noting how Earth's landmasses are expected to change in the future and postulates what may be the next great extinction event.

[[File:Faraday Michael Christmas lecture detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Faraday]] presenting his experiments with electromagnetism at a [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lecture]], 1856]]
This episode provides an overview of the nature of [[electromagnetism]], as discovered through the work of [[Michael Faraday]]. Tyson explains how the idea of another force of nature, similar to gravitational forces, had been postulated by Isaac Newton before. Tyson continues on Faraday, coming from poor beginnings, would end up becoming interested in studying [[electricity]] after reading books and seeing lectures by [[Humphry Davy]] at the [[Royal Institution]]. Davy would hire Faraday after seeing extensive notes he had taken to act as his secretary and lab assistant.

After Davy and chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] unsuccessfully tried to build on [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]'s discovery of the electromagnetic phenomena to harness the ability to create motion from electricity, Faraday was able to create his own device to create the first [[electric motor]] by applying electricity aligned along a magnet. Davy, bitter over Faraday's breakthrough, put Faraday on the task of improving the quality of high-quality optical glass, preventing Faraday from continuing his research. Faraday, undeterred, continued to work in the Royal Institution, and created the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lectures]] designed to teach science to children. Following Davy's death, Faraday returned to full time efforts studying electromagnetism, creating the first [[electrical generator]] by inserting a magnet in a coil of wires.

Tyson continues to note that despite losing some of his mental capacity, Faraday concluded that electricity and magnetism were connected by unseen fields, and postulated that light may also be tied to these forces. Using a sample of the optical glass that Davy had him make, Faraday discovered that an applied magnetic field could affect the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light passing through the glass sample (a [[dielectric material]]), leading to what is called the [[Faraday effect]] and connecting these three forces. Faraday postulated that these fields existed across the planet, which would later be called [[Earth's magnetic field]] generated by the rotating molten iron [[inner core]], as well as the phenomena that caused the planets to rotate around the sun. Faraday's work was initially rejected by the scientific community due to his lack of mathematical support, but [[James Clerk Maxwell]] would later come to rework Faraday's theories into the [[Maxwell's equations]] that validated Faraday's theories. Their combined efforts created the basis of science that drives the principles of modern communications today.

 |ShortSummary=
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Sagan]] with a replica of the Mars [[Viking program]] lander]]
This episode covers how life may have developed on Earth and the possibility of life on other planets. Tyson begins by explaining how the human development of writing systems enabled the transfer of information through generations, describing how [[Enheduanna|Princess Enheduanna]] ca. 2280 BC would be one of the first to sign her name to her works, and how [[Gilgamesh]] collected stories, including that of [[Utnapishtim]] documenting a [[Gilgamesh flood myth|great flood]] comparable to the story of [[Noah's Ark]]. Tyson explains how [[DNA]] similarly records information to propagate life, and postulates theories of how DNA originated on Earth, including [[Models of DNA evolution|evolution]] from a shallow tide pool, or from the [[ejecta]] of meteor collisions from other planets. In the latter case, Tyson explains how comparing the composition of the [[Nakhla meteorite]] in 1911 to results collected by the [[Viking program]] demonstrated that material from Mars could transit to Earth, and the ability of some [[microbe]]s to survive the harsh conditions of space. With the motions of solar systems through the galaxy over billions of years, life could conceivably propagate from planet to planet in the same manner.

Tyson then moves on to consider if life on other planets could exist. He explains how [[Project Diana]] performed in the 1940s showed that radio waves are able to travel in space, and that all of humanity's broadcast signals continue to radiate into space from our planet. Tyson notes that projects have since looked for similar signals potentially emanating from other solar systems. Tyson then explains that the development and lifespan of extraterrestrial civilizations must be considered for such detection to be realized. He notes that civilizations can be wiped out by cosmic events like supernovae, natural disasters such as the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba disaster]], or even self-destruct through war or other means, making probability estimates difficult. Tyson describes how [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], in which some of the oldest [[red dwarf]] stars exist, would offer the best chance of finding established civilizations. Tyson concludes that human intelligence properly applied should allow our species to avoid such disasters and enable us to migrate beyond the Earth before the Sun's eventual transformation into a [[red giant]].  Princess Enheduanna's animation is modeled on CNN's [[Christiane Amanpour]], who also did Enheduanna's voice.

 |ShortSummary=[[File:Global Temperature Anomaly.svg|thumb|right|The increase in surface temperatures on Earth due to global warming]]
This episode explores the nature of the [[greenhouse effect]] (discovered by [[Joseph Fourier]] and [[Svante Arrhenius]]), and the evidence demonstrating the existence of [[global warming]] from humanity's influence. Tyson begins by describing the long-term history of the planet Venus; based on readings from the [[Venera]] series of probes to the planet, the planet once had an ocean and an atmosphere, but due to the release of [[carbon dioxide]] from [[volcanic eruptions]], the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus caused the surface temperatures to increase and boiled away the oceans.

Tyson then notes the delicate nature of the amount of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide in the atmosphere]] can influence Earth's [[climate]] due to the greenhouse effect, and that levels of carbon dioxide have been increasing since the start of the 20th century. Evidence has shown this to be from humankind's [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[Petroleum|oil]], coal, and [[Natural gas|gas]] instead of from volcanic eruptions due to the [[isotopic signature]] of the carbon dioxide. The increase in carbon dioxide has led to an increase in temperatures, in turn leading to [[positive feedback loop]]s of the melting polar ice caps and dethawing of the [[permafrost]] to increase carbon dioxide levels.

Tyson then notes that humans have discovered means of harvesting [[solar power]], such as [[Augustin Mouchot]]'s solar-driven motor in the 19th century, and [[Frank Shuman]]'s solar-based steam generator in the 1910s. Tyson points out that in both cases, the economics and ease of using cheap coal and oil caused these inventions to be overlooked at the time. Today, solar and wind-power systems would be able to collect enough solar energy from the sun easily. Tyson then compares the motivation for switching to these cleaner forms of energy to the efforts of the [[Space race]] and emphasizes that it is not too late for humanity to correct its course.

[[File:Pale Blue Dot (uitsnede).png|thumb|right|Earth as a [[pale blue dot]] in the middle of the band of light, taken by ''Voyager I'' from outside the orbit of Neptune]]
Tyson begins the episode by noting how the [[destruction of the Library of Alexandria]] lost much of humanity's knowledge to that point.  He then contrasts on the strive for humanity to continue to discover new facts about the universe and the need to not close off further discovery.

Tyson then proceeds to describe the discovery of [[cosmic rays]] by [[Victor Hess]] through high-altitude balloon trips, where radiation increased the farther one was from the surface. [[Swiss]] [[Astronomer]] [[Fritz Zwicky]], in studying [[supernovae]], postulated that these cosmic rays originated from these events instead of electromagnetic radiation. Zwicky would continue to study supernovae, and by looking at [[Cosmic distance ladder#standard candles|standard candles]] that they emitted, estimated the movement of the galaxies in the universe. His calculations suggested that there must be more mass in the universe than those apparent in the observable galaxies, and called this [[dark matter]]. Initially forgotten, Zwicky's theory was confirmed by the work of [[Vera Rubin]], who observed that the rotation of stars at the edges of observable galaxies did not follow expected rotational behavior without considering dark matter. This further led to the proposal of [[dark energy]] as a viable theory to account for the universe's increasing rate of expansion.

Tyson then describes the interstellar travel, using the two ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' probes. Besides the abilities to identify several features on the planets of the solar system, ''Voyager I'' was able to recently demonstrate the existence of the Sun's variable [[heliosphere]] which helps buffer the Solar System from [[Interstellar medium|interstellar winds]]. Tyson describes Carl Sagan's role in the ''Voyager'' program, including creating the [[Voyager Golden Record]] to encapsulate humanity and Earth's position in the universe, and convincing the program directors to have ''Voyager I'' to take a picture of Earth from beyond the orbit of Neptune, creating the image of the [[Pale Blue Dot]]. Tyson concludes the series by emphasizing [[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Sagan's message]] on the human condition in the vastness of the cosmos, and to encourage viewers to continue to explore and discover what else the universe has to offer.

The series concludes with the empty-seated Ship of the Imagination leaving Earth and traveling through space as Tyson looks on from planet Earth.

In August 2011, the show was officially announced for primetime broadcast in the spring of 2014. The show is a co-production of Druyan's Cosmos Studios, MacFarlane's [[Fuzzy Door Productions]], and [[National Geographic Channel]]; Druyan, MacFarlane, Cosmos Studios' Mitchell Cannold, and director Brannon Braga are the executive producers.&lt;ref name="hwr announce"/&gt;

Fox's CEO Kevin Reilly considered that the show would be a risk and outside the network's typical programming, but that "we believe this can have the same massive cultural impact that the original series delivered," and committed the network's resources to the show.&lt;ref name="hwr announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-orders-seth-macfarlanes-cosmos-219567 |title=Fox Orders Seth MacFarlane's 'Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey' |first=Lacey |last=Rose |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show would first be broadcast on Fox, re-airing the same night on the [[National Geographic Channel]].&lt;ref name="hwr announce"/&gt;

In Canada, it was broadcast simultaneously on [[Global Television Network|Global]], [[National Geographic Channel (Canada)|National Geographic Channel]] and [[Nat Geo Wild (Canada)|Nat Geo Wild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.globaltv.com/cosmos/ |publisher=Shaw Media |accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preview of the show's first episode was aired for student filmmakers at the [[White House Student Film Festival]] on February 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Obama to Introduce 'Cosmos' Premiere |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/president-obama-to-introduce-cosmos-premiere-20140308 |first=Miriam |last=Coleman |date=March 8, 2014 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cosmos'' premiered simultaneously in the US across ten [[21st Century Fox|Fox]] networks: [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[FXX]], [[FX Movie Channel|FXM]], [[Fox Sports 1]], [[Fox Sports 2]], [[National Geographic Channel]], [[Nat Geo WILD]], [[National Geographic Channel#Nat Geo Mundo|Nat Geo Mundo]], and [[Fox Life]].

The Fox network broadcast averaged about 5.8 million viewers in Nielsen’s affiliate-based estimates for the 9 o’clock hour Sunday, as well as a 2.1 rating/5 share in adults 18-49. The under-50 audience was roughly 60% men.

===Criticism===
The new miniseries has been criticized by some [[Christians]] and the [[Christian right|religious right]] for some of the things stated during the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/13_ways_neil_degrasse_tysons_cosmos_sent_the_religious_right_off_the_deep_end_partner/ |title=13 ways Neil deGrasse Tyson's "Cosmos" sent the religious right off the deep end |publisher=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] |date=June 14, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |first=Dan |last=Arel}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian fundamentalists]] were upset that the scientific theories covered in the show opposed the [[Genesis creation narrative]] in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sean-mcelwee/neil-degrasse-tyson-vs-the-right_b_5469180.html |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson v. the Right: Cosmos, Christians and the Battle for American Science |first=Sean |last=McElwee |date=June 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] was upset that the science show "smears" [[Catholicism]]. A spokesman for the League noted how the show focused on [[Giordano Bruno]], whom the Catholic Church turned over to secular authorities to be burnt at the stake for blasphemy, immoral conduct, and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology, in addition to some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology, and stated that the show "skipped [[Copernicus]] and [[Galileo]]&amp;mdash;two far more consequential men in proving and disseminating the [[heliocentric theory]]&amp;mdash;because in their cases, the Church's role was much more complicated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/cosmos-accused-of-taking-a-jab-at-catholics-115976/ |title='Cosmos' Accused of Taking a Jab at Catholics |first=Michael |last=Gryboski |date=March 11, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |publisher=[[Christian Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''entertainment industry during World War II''' underwent changes to help aid the cause of the war. The [[entertainment industry]] during this time was often controlled by a country's government. Since the governments believed that a supportive home front was crucial to their countries' victory, they generally sought to keep the civilian spirits high and to depict the war in a positive light. With this motive in mind, governments engaged in the regulation and censorship of the forms of media, as well as the introduction of new methods of informing citizens through these media outlets.

Government censorship of mass media was enforced in much of the world during this time period in fear of threatening the domestic harmony of a nation. Some of the most popular forms of entertainment during [[World War II]] were radio, film, and music. In conjunction with one another, these forms of media kept citizens entertained with a pastime, informed about their country's war efforts, and motivated to contribute to the cause of the war. The radio was a great way to reach out to citizens and communicate with the community.

====
In comparison to television, [[radio]] was a much more affordable form of entertainment. Because of this, the radio was the most popular form of entertainment during World War II. Radio stations fueled propaganda and reached a countless number of citizens. Many shows popularized and quickly gained influence in certain countries. Radio broadcasts, like other forms of entertainment at the time, were regulated by the government and were pushed to keep citizens informed about war efforts and to encourage citizens to help the cause. Radio stations, along with other media outlets, were major fuels of [[propaganda]] during World War II.

An example of a popular radio program is Tommy Handley's ''[[It's That Man Again]],'' which continued airing throughout the war in Britain until 1949. Comedian [[Tommy Handley]] utilized his radio broadcasts to keep citizens informed about the war efforts and to keep the spirits of Britain high during this time of hardship. ''It's That Man Again'' garnered substantial influence - up to 40% of the British population listened to this show during World War II. The show’s last broadcast occurred on January 6, 1949, with Handley passing away only three days later. To further demonstrate the show’s influence, two memorial services were held in his honor, with thousands of listeners present at the funeral grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/entertainment_in_britain.htm |title=Entertainment in Britain |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''It's That Man Again'' was hosted on [[BBC]], a broadcasting service program still widely known in Britain today. Like BBC, other broadcasting companies also attempted to keep civilian spirits high and expressed certain opinions on the war. Hosts of radio programs took sides regarding the war; for example, the [[Voice of Russia]], the government's international radio broadcasting station, expressed the country’s opinions and eventually targeted the United States. Radio programs were broadcast in up to twenty-three different languages, which widened the appeal of these stations.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rhodes, "Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II", 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Though Philo Farnsworth had invented the first working television system in 1927, only few people owned television sets because of its price and scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of the City of San Francisco |url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html |title=Inventor Philo Farnsworth (1906-1971) Revolutionizes Television - 1928 |publisher=Sfmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622033654/http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most citizens did not own televisions, they relied on [[cinemas]] to keep informed and educated. Cinemas of Europe and the United States were mostly regulated by the government. Films made during this time period were more realistic than escapist, in contrast to [[entertainment during the Great Depression]].

Cinemas provided for a good place to watch information films. New films that showed in cinemas were often informative of a country’s war efforts or the progress of the war itself. Furthermore, the government released additional films that were designed to model the desired human behaviors and actions during the war. These government films often suggested methods of coping with the loss of families and homes and to inform the audience to caution the presence of enemy spies.

===Britain===
The [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] was formed on the day that followed the start of war. It was the department of government that managed propaganda and publicity for Britain during World War II. The Ministry of Information recognized the significant influence that the entertainment industry had over the citizens, so they kept their work close to film maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/inf3.htm |title=Research and learning &amp;#124; Exhibitions &amp;#124; The Art of War &amp;#124; Learn about the art |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British war films typically incorporated a suspenseful story of war while infusing the messages that the Ministry wished to deliver into the storyline.

Another popular example of one of these films is the British propaganda film ''[[Miss Grant Goes to the Door]]'', which taught audiences how to recognize German spies, how to hide [[Ordnance Survey]] maps from enemies, and how to be of aid to soldiers and sailors – women were encouraged to knit socks and mittens for sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/100021800 |title=MISS GRANT GOES TO THE DOOR [Main&amp;#93; &amp;#124; Imperial War Museums |publisher=Iwm.org.uk |date= |access-date=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612031637/http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/100021800 |archivedate=June 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This film further reminded citizens that ‘’Cromwell’’ was the codeword to signify the invasion of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/80/a5819880.shtml |title=WW2 People's War - Codeword Cromwell |publisher=BBC |date=September 20, 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood (United States)===
Theater attendance was at an all-time high in 1946, proving to be Hollywood’s most profitable year of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moderntimes.com/1946/ |title=1946: Hollywood and the Great Directors |publisher=Moderntimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the United States, the propaganda agency that coordinated actions with the film industry was the [[Office of War Information]]. The agency worked with film makers to record and photograph wartime activities while regulating its content. The agency worked to display the war in a positive light and censored negative content like pictures of soldier insanity and casualty; pictures of American casualties were banned from being published until 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~class/am485_98/lane/media/censor.htm |title=Print and War |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growth of the film industry came the growth of the influence of Hollywood celebrities. Hollywood stars appeared in advertisements and toured the country to encourage citizens to purchase war bonds to support their country in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1682.html |title=U.S. War Bonds |publisher=U-s-history.com |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, documents published by the National Archives leaked to the public regarding the involvement of numerous Hollywood celebrities with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during World War II. Some 750,000 documents reveal that famous American public figures were actually spies for the Office of Strategic Services. These celebrities include celebrity chef [[Julia Child]] and baseball player [[Moe Berg]], who were hired to gather information required by the US military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7562242.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; US celebrities spied during WWII |publisher=BBC News |date=August 14, 2008 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The theme of war took a popular role in the development of pop music. Artists expressed their feelings of hardships during the war. Others sang songs that aimed to lift the spirits of the citizens.

British singer [[Vera Lynn]], or the Forces Sweetheart, sang popular songs such as "[[We'll Meet Again]]" and "[[The White Cliffs of Dover]]", which restored an optimistic outlook for soldiers and families while uplifting Allied spirits during a time of hardship when Nazi Germany was bombing Britain. American singer and stage actress [[Adelaide Hall]] also entertained extensively throughout WWII entertaining both the public and the troops in the UK and with [[ENSA]] across Europe.
[[File:Adelaide Hall starring in Piccadixie at the Finsbury Park Empire, London, 28 July 1941.jpg|thumb|left| [[Adelaide Hall]] starring in ''Piccadixie'' at the Finsbury Park Empire, London, 28 July 1941]]
"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)]]" was a 1941 [[Academy Award]]-winning song by [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], which illustrated memories of the magnificent city of Paris that had been taken over by Germany prior to the song’s release.

[[The Andrews Sisters]]' "[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]" expressed the feelings of a man's draft experience. Many listeners could relate because of the number of people drafted into the war.

=== Government involvement in the music industry ===
Government agencies pushed music producers to record more patriotic and uplifting songs. The Office of War Information especially pushed for this following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in the United States. In her book ''God Bless America'', Kathleen E.R. Smith states that only twenty-seven war-themed songs had reached the top ten charts during the span of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Kathleen E. R. God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

This suggests that these patriotic war-themed songs, pushed by the government, did not sell well. Billboard archives suggest that the public preferred escapist and rather lighthearted songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/archive#/archive |title=Search the Billboard Magazine Archives |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female singers became more prominent by singing songs expressing the war from the woman’s point of view, illustrating feelings of separation and loneliness. Furthermore, as musicians joined the military, larger bands shrunk and often disbanded, creating a trend towards soloists and smaller music groups.

===Musician contributions to the war===
Many musicians contributed to the war effort. Musician [[Glenn Miller]] enlisted in the army to perform in the United States Organization, in which he established the Army Air Force Band. Musician Irving Berlin assisted in the war effort by creating the "This is the Army" musical, which raised millions by playing on Broadway and for the US troops.

===Impact of the war===
Because of the war, approximately 15 million people "crossed county lines" and brought about the spread of different music styles like country music and African-American styles.&lt;ref&gt;Ennis, Philip H. The Seventh Stream: The Emergence of Rock 'n' Roll in American Popular Music. Hanover: Wesleyan University Press, published by University of New England Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the war itself influenced the music industry through its technology. The capture of Germany’s magnetic tape technology became a staple in music production for independent producers. [[Magnetic tape sound recording]] allowed for independent producers to produce high quality sounds without the assistance of major labels.

===Dance===
Changes in music correlated to the evolution of dances. Ballroom dancing gained popularity when people were looking to have a good time. [[The Grafton Ballroom]] in Britain was famed for its architecture and interior at the time.

The evolution of music brought about new sounds such as [[jazz]] and [[swing music]]. These sounds translated to new dances. [[Jitterbug]] dancing grew in popularity. The [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], which was taken to England by American troops, eventually became a dance of the International style of [[Ballroom dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1344 |title=Port Cities: - Entertainment during World War Two - Cinema |publisher=Mersey-gateway.org |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526011434/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1344 |archivedate=May 26, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benavente's role in the development of the entremes was comparable to that of Lope de 'Vega in drama. Besides writing more entremeses than any of his contemporaries (150 are attributed to him), Quinones de Benavente was the major .&lt;/ref&gt;

When the genre begun it was written both in [[prose]] and [[verse (poetry)]], but after [[Luis Quiñones de Benavente]] (1600-1650) defined the genre, all works were written in verse. The usual characters of the entremés were the common people; the plot usually [[satire|satirized]] the customs and the occupations of the characters, subjects that couldn't be treated in the dramatic works during which the entremés works were played.

Sometimes the playings included songs that were the origin of another genre, the [[Zarzuela#Italian influence|tonadilla]].

Some of the most important authors of this genre are: [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Luis Quiñones de Benavente]], [[Luis Vélez de Guevara]], [[Alonso Jerónimo de Salas Barbadillo]], [[Alonso de Castillo Solórzano]], [[Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Francisco Bernardo de Quirós]], [[Jerónimo de Cáncer|Jerónimo de Cáncer y Velasco]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Vicente Suárez de Deza y Ávila]], [[Sebastián Rodríguez de Villaviciosa]], [[Agustín Moreto]] and [[Francisco Bances Candamo]].

'''''Fire-Brigade: The Battle for Kiev - 1943''''' (commonly abbreviated '''''Fire-Brigade''''') is a [[Wargame (video games)|Computer Wargame]] developed and published by [[Panther Games]] in [[Australia]] in 1988. The game is set around the historical [[Eastern Front (WWII)|WWII Eastern Front]] [[Battle of Kiev (1943)|battle for Kiev]] in 1943.

''Fire-Brigade'' was a pioneering [[Wargame (video games)|computer wargame]] as it was one of the first wargames to take advantage of the new graphical mouse driven interfaces that 16bit computers were making available on both [[Macintosh II|MAC II]] &amp; [[IBM PC]]. It was also one of the first wargames to enable network game-play for head to head multiplayer battles.

''Fire-Brigade'' required a huge amount of [[hard drive]] space and [[RAM]] for the time of its release to take full advantage of the development of [[8-bit color|256 colours]]. For colour ''Fire-Brigade'' required 2MB of RAM and 640KB of hard drive space, while for mono the game only required 1MB of RAM.

== Historical Synopsis ==

Early November, 1943 and the war in Russia is at its height. With the capture of the strategic city of Kiev imminent, Soviet General Vatutin unleashes Rybalko's elite 3rd Guards Tank Army. "Drive like hell" his orders read, "and we'll split the entire German Front!"

With the fate of the Army Group South in the balance, Marshall von Manstein must commit Balck's 48th Panzer Korps, the fire-brigade, to save the German Army. Receiving the Soviet attack will be fierce, delivering the counter-attack could be decisive... for one side or the other!

== Gameplay ==

''Fire-Brigade'' is a turn-based strategic &amp; tactical computer wargame that allows players flexibility and advanced functions. You can play either by yourself against the [[AI]] or against another person in any of four scenarios networked via modem or cable. You can play either as the [[Germans]] or the [[Soviet Union]] in any of the scenarios and you have at your command a comprehensive reporting system and realistic staff support.

Players can set combat, logistics and air commitment support values to direct the allocation of supplies; reinforcements and combat support assets. Gather intelligence on enemy forces and assess information on friendly forces before issuing movement and attack orders to units in either a micro (individual units) or macro level (subordinate headquarters). You can then set the frontage of your unit's formation to either narrow, medium or broad, all while you 'confer' with the games' AI which will use [[artificial intelligence]] routines to execute the orders within set variable parameters such as morale, troop quality, fatigue etc.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, David (1988), pp.4-77, ''Fire Brigade Player Manual'', [[Panther Games| Panther Games Pty Ltd]], Retrieved 2013-04-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Players are given a 15 step recommended sequence of play list in the game manual for ''Fire-Brigade''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, David (1988), p.22, ''Fire Brigade Player Manual'', [[Panther Games| Panther Games Pty Ltd]], Retrieved 2013-04-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flüchtlinge''''' (''Refugees'') is a 1933 [[Nazi Germany|German]] film depicting [[Volga German]] refugees persecuted by the [[Bolsheviks]] on the [[China|Sino]]-[[Russia]]n border in [[Manchuria]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="leiser29"&gt;[[Erwin Leiser]], ''Nazi Cinema'' p. 29 {{ISBN|0-02-570230-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was directed by [[Gustav Ucicky]] and starred [[Hans Albers]], [[Käthe von Nagy]] and [[Eugen Klöpfer]]. The screenplay was written by [[Gerhard Menzel]] and was based on his own novel of the same title.&lt;ref name="tainted150"&gt;Cinzia Romani, ''Tainted Goddesses: Female Film Stars of the Third Reich'' p. 150 {{ISBN|0-9627613-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first movie to win the state prize, and Goebbels praised it as among those films that, while they did not explicitly cite National Socialist principles, nevertheless embodied its spirit,&lt;ref name="leiser29"/&gt; a new film reflecting the ideal of their national revolution.&lt;ref name="tainted150"/&gt;

The refugees are rescued by [[Führerprinzip|a heroic German leader]] much like the [[Führer]]; the symbolism is obviously intended to emulate [[Adolf Hitler]] although its hero, being blond and athletic, represented the physical ideal much more clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Leiser, ''Nazi Cinema'' p. 29-30 {{ISBN|0-02-570230-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is disgusted by "[[Weimar Republic|November Germany]]", and devotes himself to the ideal of "true Germany".&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Leiser, ''Nazi Cinema'' p. 29 {{ISBN|0-02-570230-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He off-handedly disposes of some refugees as worthless, and demands complete obedience from all others.&lt;ref name="leiser30"&gt;Erwin Leiser, ''Nazi Cinema'' p. 30 {{ISBN|0-02-570230-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of a boy deeply devoted to him moves him, as dying for a cause is something he would wish for himself, in keeping with Nazi glorification of heroic death.&lt;ref name="leiser30"/&gt;

Their Communist persecutors are portrayed simply as brutal murderers, typical of works prior to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] (and again after its breach).&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Leiser]], ''Nazi Cinema'' p. 40 {{ISBN|0-02-570230-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shown for some time after the pact, owing to bureaucratic oversight, complicating the efforts of Nazi propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Jay W. Baird, ''The Mythical World of Nazi War Propaganda'', p. 147 {{ISBN|0-8166-0741-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Fields was born in northern [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kenson| first = Stephen| authorlink = Steve Kenson| title = ProFiles: Fred Fields| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #261| page = 112| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the small town of [[Burlington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;http://fmfsdg.fineartstudioonline.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; Fields wanted to be an artist since childhood: "I don't know that becoming an artist is a decision you can make... I've been drawing since before I can remember, and I started painting at age nine. I used to do all these monsters and stuff, and my mom was frankly a little concerned about it. Now that I'm making a living at it, I think mom's OK with it. My parents always encouraged me to draw and do what I wanted with it. They've always been 100% behind me." Fields attended the Central Academy of Commercial Art in Cincinnati, and moved to Chicago after graduation.&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"/&gt; He worked there for about a year in advertising, producing illustrations and concept sketches for both television commercials and print ads.&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"/&gt; He worked at [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Advertising]] in Chicago as a storyboard comp artist.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Fields continued painting on his own time, and began sending out samples of his work; ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine was among the clients those who were interested in his work. Fields painted his first cover for ''Dragon'' in 1988, for issue #142.&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"/&gt; He applied to [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s art department soon after and was hired.&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"/&gt; "I went from freelancing, completely on my own, to sitting in a room with the likes of [[Clyde Caldwell]], [[Gerald Brom|Brom]], [[Tony Szczudlo]], [[Robh Ruppel]], [[Dana Knutson]], [[Randy Post]], and [[Todd Lockwood]]. I just sort of stopped and thought, 'Wow, I've arrived.'"&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"/&gt; Fields worked on scenes from worlds such as [[Forgotten Realms]], and even [[Ravenloft]], saying "It was fun doing the Gothic horror stuff. In some cases, I think I took it further than other artists. I put a lot more blood in there."&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"/&gt;

His work was represented in the 1996 collection ''The Art of TSR: Colossal Cards''. Critic Joseph Szadkowski of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' singled out Fields's work "Dragon Claw" as "stunning",&lt;ref&gt;Szadkowski, Joseph (March 30, 1996). "Colossal items in miniature", ''[[The Washington Times]]'', p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; and later named the collection as the year's "Best Trading Card Release Based on Fantasy Art".&lt;ref&gt;Szadkowski, Joseph (January 11, 1997). "Jim Shooter misfires again: SERI: Second of two parts", ''[[The Washington Times]]'', p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; Archangel Entertainment released a book of his artwork in 1999, entitled ''The Art of Fred Fields''.&lt;ref name="Dragon #261"/&gt;

In May 2010, artwork by Fields appeared as part of the "Lucid Daydreams" Exhibition at Gallery Provocateur in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/visual-arts/node/26562&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Fred Fields has had his art appear in various ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game books and their associated novels throughout the 1990s, as well as in other games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]''. His artwork has appeared on numerous ''D&amp;D'' covers, such as ''[[Greyhawk Ruins]]'' and ''[[Book of Artifacts]]''.

Fields has illustrated cards for the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' collectible card game.

'''Goodbye Deponia''' is a [[point-and-click adventure]] created by [[Daedalic Entertainment]]. It is available since October 15, 2013 and is the third installment of the Deponia trilogy.

==Synopsis==
Anti-hero Rufus still lives on the planet Deponia which is nothing more than a dump. He still wishes to become an inhabitant of Elysium, the flying city. Furthermore, he wants to stop the Organon. This military organization deceived the Elysian government by telling them Deponia is not inhabited any more and it would be better to blow up the planet. Rufus gets help from pirate Bozo, the Elysium girl Goal and the resistance.

==Plot==
En route to the upper ascension station via Bozo's cruiser, Rufus and Goal get stuck on an Organon cruiser behind them. While trying to save Goal, Rufus meets Barry, his biggest fan who wants to watch Rufus in action. Rufus frees Goal, destroying Bozo's cruiser in the process.

Rufus, Goal, Doc and Bozo are forced to continue their trip to the upper ascension station in Porta Fisco by foot. They overnight in a hotel. There, Doc and Bozo set up a lab so the three Goal personalities can be finally merged. Doc and Bozo deceive Rufus by telling him he must look for an important object (of which they think does not exist).

Meanwhile, Argus sends Cletus and Opperbot on a mission to find Goal after they noticed they captured Donna instead of Goal. Rufus finds out Cletus has the important object in his room. Once in possession he returns to the lab but it seems the operation is already finished with success. A furious Rufus leaves the lab and runs into Argus who just arrived with Donna. After some [[hide-and-seek]], Rufus (currently wearing Cletus' clothes) can convince Argus he is Cletus ''(Rufus and Cletus are look-alikes)''. A disguised Goal claims to be Donna. The plan works and Argus takes them to the last Organon-cruiser in Porta Fisco.

Aboard the cruiser, Rufus removes his disguise before being warned about the cameras in the room. He attempts to erase the footage and Goal is taken to be interrogated by Argus in the process. Rufus sneaks in inside a torture bot as Argus reveals his plan to conquer Elysium and wants Goal by his side. Much to Goal and Rufus' surprise, Argus removes his helmet to reveal he also looks just like Rufus. Rufus tries to free Goal by pushing random buttons but ends up injecting her with a lethal shot. As she dies, she admits her love for Rufus. Angered, Argus has the bot (not knowing Rufus is inside) thrown overboard.

Rufus ends up in a room similar to the tutorial of each game. He believes the room is Hell due to the repeated process of being killed by the crusher and returning to the room. Further investigation reveals the room is actually a cloning facility. Rufus manages to get past the machinery to find a man resembling Death. Rufus follows the man and finds out his name is Hermes. Hermes admits that he is responsible for the situation Rufus finds himself in. He discovered Utopia and got the idea to make Elysium to fly there. He thought up the idea to destroy Deponia to power Elysium, having forgotten that people still live there. He also created a line of clone workers to do the work. Hermes explains that Rufus, Cletus, and Argus are the last living prototypes of the clones. Rufus becomes infuriated and vandalizes the facility. Hermes becomes depressed and kills himself.

Suddenly, a dead woman falls out of the sky. Rufus recognizes Goal and wants to ask Hermes if there is a way to clone her. However, Hermes just committed suicide so Rufus first has to clone him. Once succeeded Goal is also cloned. However, she returns as a baby and falls in the drain. Rufus has three problems which must be solved at same time: to rescue baby Goal, to prevent the invasion of the Organon in Elysium and to prevent Deponia to be blown up. That's why he clones himself twice which means there are now three "Ruffi".

One Rufus ends up aboard the last Organon-cruiser while the other two end up in the resistance headquarters. They find the Captain Seagull is still alive and is the new leader. He's planning to fire a cannon at Elysium to prevent Deponia from being destroyed. One Rufus convinces him to hold off the attack until he can age Goal back to an adult. Seagull is really only allowing it hoping Rufus will fail and finally acknowledge how much of a failure Seagull thinks he is. Rufus ages baby Goal but she is in fact revealed to be a clone of Donna rather than Goal. Seagull demands Rufus gives up and resorts to threatening one clone with a gun while the other points out Rufus' faults. Rufus' deceased adoptive mother is mentioned pushing Seagull to fire the gun. The other resistance members intervene and the shot instead hits the other clone. Rufus carries his wounded clone to an escape vehicle but accidentally backs it into the cannon preventing it from being fired.

Meanwhile, the Rufus on the cruiser has been working with Cletus, (whom he mistakes for one of the other Rufus clones). He makes the discovery that Goal was saved after the lethal injection incident. She's thrown from the cruiser and Rufus follows her on Opperbot. At the headquarters, Rufus is mourning the death of the other Rufus. Seagull prepares to kill Rufus when the Rufus riding Opperbot crashes into him killing them both. The last remaining Rufus reunites with Goal and apologizes to her and everyone for having doomed them all. However, Goal convinces everyone to give Rufus another chance pointing out it's thanks to him Deponia has not yet been destroyed. The resistance looks to Rufus for one last crazy idea. Rufus decides they will all cram into the vehicle inside the cannon and fire it at the cruiser.

The plan succeeds although Rufus is seen as Argus and taken to Ulysses, the leader of the Organon. Rufus is surprised when it turns out Ulysses is the father of Goal. Ulysses still has the intention to blow up Deponia which will also destroy the Organon cruiser. Ulysses thinks his daughter is in Elysium. Rufus can prove the opposite is true. However, the irreversible process for the detonation already started.

Rufus convinces Argus and Cletus to cooperate in order to destroy the bomb. This succeeds, but the three get stuck in the rotor which balances the cruiser. They are found by Goal who can only rescue one of them. She decides only to rescue Rufus but as the three wear the same outfit she does not know who Rufus actually is.

Ultimately, Rufus tells Goal that Cletus is actually Rufus and lets go to fall back to Deponia. Goal saves Cletus while Barry follows Rufus down, congratulating him for his selfless action and for saving everyone.

Goal takes “Rufus” to the council of Elysium. The council is concerned: due to the new situation Elysium is overpopulated and there are not enough resources. That's why they have the intention to destroy Elysium and move back to Deponia. Goal tells the council to listen to the advice of "Rufus". Cletus decides to give up his old identity and to live as Rufus as from now. Goal then leaves the scene and goes to a perch overlooking Deponia. She sighs hinting that she knew she picked Cletus over Rufus. It is not revealed whether the real Rufus survived the fall or not.

'''James Stuart Blackton''' (January 5, 1875 – August 13, 1941) was a British-American film producer and director of the [[silent film|silent era]]. One of the pioneers of motion pictures, he founded [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1897. He was one of the first filmmakers to use the techniques of stop-motion and drawn animation, is considered a father of American animation, and was the first to bring many classic plays and books to the screen. Blackton was also the commodore of the Motorboat Club of America&lt;ref name=VarietyObit/&gt; and the [[Atlantic Yacht Club]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
James Stuart Blackton was born on January 5, 1875, in [[Sheffield|Sheffield, Yorkshire, England]], to Henry Blacktin and Jessie Stuart. He emigrated with his family to the United States in 1885 and changed the family name to Blackton.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He worked as a reporter and illustrator for the ''[[New York Evening World]]'', and performed regularly on stage with conjuror [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert Smith]].&lt;ref name="Victorian Cinema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/blackton|title=James Stuart Blackton|last=Gifford|first=Denis|website=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1896, [[Thomas Edison]] publicly demonstrated the [[Vitascope]], one of the first film projectors, and Blackton was sent to interview Edison and provide drawings of how his films were made. Eager for good publicity, Edison took Blackton to his [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]], the special cabin he used to do his filming, and created a film on the spot of Blackton doing a lightning portrait of Edison. The inventor did such a good job selling the art of moviemaking that he talked Blackton and partner Smith into buying a print of the new film, as well as prints of nine other films, plus a Vitascope to show them to paying audiences.

The new act was a great success, despite the various things Blackton and Smith were doing between the Edison films. The next step was to start making films of their own. In this way the [[Vitagraph Studios|American Vitagraph Company]] was born.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

During this period, J. Stuart Blackton ran the Vitagraph studio, and produced, directed, and wrote its films. He even starred in some of his films, playing the [[comic strip]] character "[[Happy Hooligan]]" in a series of shorts. Since profits were constantly increasing, Blackton felt that he could try any idea that sprang to his head, and in a series of films Blackton developed the concepts of animation.

===Animated films===
The first of his animation films is ''[[The Enchanted Drawing]]'', with a copyright date of 1900 but probably made at least a year earlier.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In this film, Blackton sketches a face, a bottle of wine and a glass, a top hat, and a cigar. During the film he appears to remove the wine, glass, hat, and cigar as real objects, and the face appears to react. The "animation" here is of the stop-action variety, where the camera is stopped, a single change is made, and the camera is then started again. The process was first used by [[Georges Méliès]] and others.

The transition to stop-motion was apparently accidental, and occurred around 1905. According to Albert Smith, one day the crew was filming a complex series of stop-action effects on the roof while steam from the building's generator was billowing in the background. On playing the film back, Smith noticed the odd effect created by the steam puffs scooting across the screen and decided to reproduce it deliberately. A few films (some of which are lost) use this effect to represent invisible ghosts, or to have toys come to life. In 1906, Blackton directed ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'', which uses stop-motion as well as stick puppetry to produce a series of effects. After Blackton's hand draws two faces on a chalkboard, they appear to come to life and engage in antics. Most of the film uses live action effects instead of animation, but nevertheless this film had a huge effect in stimulating the creation of animated films in America. In Europe, the same effect was had from ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907), another Vitagraph short directed by Blackton. ''The Haunted Hotel'' was mostly live-action, about a tourist spending the night in an inn run by invisible spirits. Most of the effects are also live-action (wires and such), but one scene of a dinner making itself was done using stop-motion, and was presented in a tight close-up that allowed budding animators to study it for technique.

Blackton made another animated film that has survived, 1907's ''Lightning Sketches'', but it has nothing to add to the art of animation. In 1908 he made the first American film version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1908 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', filmed in New York City's [[Central Park]] and ''[[The Thieving Hand]]'', filmed in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]]. By 1909, Blackton was too absorbed in the business of running Vitagraph to have time for filmmaking. He came to regard his animation experiments in particular as being rather juvenile (they receive no mention in his unpublished autobiography).

===Dramatic films and later life===

Stuart Blackton believed that the US should join the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] involved in [[World War I]] overseas and in 1915 produced ''[[The Battle Cry of Peace]]''. Former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was one of the film's staunchest supporters and convinced Gen. [[Leonard Wood]] to loan Blackton an entire regiment of marines to use as extras. Upon its release, the film generated a controversy rivaling that of ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' because it was considered as militaristic propaganda.

Blackton left Vitagraph to go independent in 1917, but returned in 1923 as junior partner to Albert Smith.  In 1925, Smith sold the company to [[Warner Brothers]] for more than $1 million.&lt;ref name=VarietyObit/&gt;

Blackton did quite well with his share until the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]], which destroyed his savings and made him bankrupt in 1931.&lt;ref name=VarietyObit&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Commodore Blackton, Who Went from Riches to Relief, Dies at 66|date=August 20, 1941|page=4|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety143-1941-08#page/n123/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent his last years on the road, showing his old films and lecturing about the days of silent movies. His daughter Violet Virginia Blackton (1910–1965) married writer [[Cornell Woolrich]] in 1930 but their marriage was annulled in 1933.

He married actress Evangeline Russell de Rippeteau in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Stuart Blackton To Wed.

'''''Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals''''', known as {{nihongo|''Estpolis Denki II''|エストポリス伝記II||officially translated ''Biography of Estpolis II''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Estpolis Denki |developer=Neverland Co., Ltd. |publisher=Taito Corporation |date=25 June 1993 |platform=Super Famicom |quote=&lt; Staff &gt; [...] Biography of Estpolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in Japan, and as '''''Lufia''''' in Europe and Australia, is a [[role-playing video game]] with [[puzzle video game|puzzle]] elements developed by [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]] and published in Japan in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]], and in North America and Europe in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] by [[Natsume (company)|Natsume]] and [[Nintendo]] respectively, for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].

The game is a prequel to ''[[Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom]]''. It follows the story of the first main character's ancestor, Maxim, and explains the origins of the war between mankind and a group of gods called the Sinistrals. ''Lufia II'' made a number of changes from the first game. Dungeons no longer have random encounters and there are hundreds of puzzles throughout the game, ranging from simple to extremely challenging. It also introduced new skills, such as a variety of weapons that could be used to stun monsters or solve puzzles, and IP attacks. In 2010, [[Square Enix]] released a re-imagining of the original game titled ''[[Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals]]''.

==Gameplay==
In ''Lufia II'', characters walk around an over world map, enter dungeons, fight monsters, buy or find new equipment and spells, and set out on a quest to save the world. The player's party supports up to four characters at once, along with a Capsule Monster. There are various forms of transportation which the player may utilize in order to travel faster than walking, these include; warping, a spell learned early in the game; a boat, modified by Lexis into a submarine and later a blimp. Various casino games are accessible later in the game; these include Pachinco Slot, Black Jack, Slot Machine, Stud Poker, and Action Bingo.

In dungeons, monsters appear on the map, and can be avoided if the player wishes. Motion in dungeons is also turn-based, and monsters do not move unless the player does. Maxim gains a number of tools and weapons for use in dungeons (similar to ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' titles), such as a bow and arrow, bombs and a [[hookshot (device)|hookshot]]; these, along with his sword, will stun monsters temporarily and interact with obstacles. Finally, dungeons place great emphasis on puzzles.  On the world map, monsters are encountered randomly.

Aside from the RPG standards of "Fight," "Use Item" and "Use Magic," characters also have access to IP Skills, which are attached to weapons, armor and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=IP Techniques |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=83|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1996 |pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each character's IP bar fills when he or she takes damage, and is depleted when an available IP skill is invoked. IP Skills take varying amounts of charge to activate. Players can freely wear and customize their characters with different varying sets of these weapons and armor for different IP skill effects and apply them while utilizing tactics during battles. Also, IP Skills themselves cannot be customized, sometimes forcing the player to choose between a newer and stronger piece of gear, or an older, weaker one that has a useful IP Skill.

Capsule monsters are special creatures which the player may only find on specific locations of the world. Once a Capsule monster is found, the party acquires a fifth, [[Artificial Intelligence|computer controlled]] member. These monsters can be fed items and equipment, and once they are satiated they evolve to a different form, up to a fifth and definitive form, labeled M. Seven of them exist, and each Capsule monster belongs to a different element (Neutral, [[Light]], [[Wind]], [[Water]], [[Shadow|Dark]], [[Fire]] and [[Soil]]), and has a different set of skills.

The Ancient Cave, a randomly generated dungeon composed of 99 floors, is presented to the player as a [[side-quest]] in the town of Gruberik. Every time the player enters the cave, a new layout is generated, similar to the [[roguelike]] genre. Within the cave, the characters are downgraded to zero [[experience point]]s and stripped of nearly all equipment and items. The player must proceed through the cave's floors, collecting equipment, finding magic spells and increasing levels, with the objective of reaching the Ancient Cave's final floor. There are three ways of exiting the cave: by dying, by reaching its bottom or by finding and using an item exclusive to the cave, named "providence". Within the cave lie two kinds of chests, blue and red. Red chests contain items which can only be used inside the cave for the duration of the playing session. As soon as the player leaves the cave, all items from red chests disappear, except for "Iris Treasures," which cannot be equipped and serve only as collectibles. The rare blue chests contains items which can be used outside the cave and brought back to the cave on subsequent journeys. Some items that can be found in blue chests can also be found by other means, such as monster drops. These can also be taken in and out of the Ancient Cave just as if they were found in blue chests. The bottom floor of the inn in Gruberik serves as a storage for these items.

==Plot==
The game is a prequel, set ninety-nine years before ''[[Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom]]'', which tells the story of how the Sinistrals first appeared in the world and the battles fought against them. The story is centered around the hero Maxim, a swordsman from the town of Elcid who is born with a natural ability to fight and is destined to destroy the Sinistrals. Throughout his journey, he meets other warriors who are able to confront the Sinistrals as well.

===Characters===
The game's protagonist is Maxim, a talented swordsman from the town of Elcid. Little about his past is mentioned in the game, but the game begins to follow him when a mysterious woman named Iris tells him that he is to go on a journey.

Throughout the game, Maxim is joined by other talented warriors or 'Heroes of Legend' such as Tia, his childhood friend, who has a romantic interest in Maxim; Guy, a wandering warrior who joins Maxim after he rescued his sister; Dekar, the powerful bodyguard of Prince Alex of Bound Kingdom; Lexis, a brilliant inventor; Artea, an elven bowman; and Selan, commander of the Parcelyte army who becomes Maxim's wife in mid-story.

The game's antagonists are the Sinistrals, a group of four godlike beings bent on world domination. They are led by Daos, the Sinistral of Terror, who seeks an ultimate weapon to use against the people of the world. His three subordinates are Gades, the Sinistral of Destruction, who is credited with the destruction of two entire cities; Amon, the Sinistral of Chaos, who is known to be a brilliant tactician; and Erim, the Sinistral of Death.

==Release==
The North American release of the game has a few graphical and textual glitches which were corrected in the European version. The European versions were released in English, German, Spanish and Dutch for distribution in [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]] respectively. The Australian version was released in 1997, one year after the North American version. Both the European and Australian releases of the game were titled "Lufia", not "Lufia 2", and included no [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]s because ''[[Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom]]'' was never released in Europe and Australia.

The game has an aggregate review score of 80% on [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name="GameRankings" /&gt; On release, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave the game a score of 30 out of 40,{{r|Fam|Fam1|Fam2}} while it received a perfect score of 10 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review.&lt;ref name="Fam3"&gt;読者 クロスレビュー: エストポリス伝記 II.

He concluded that the game is unexceptional, and in particular pales against the recently released ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', but makes a decent holdover for gamers waiting for the next great RPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=93 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1996|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nintendo DS remake==
{{Main|Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals}}

An [[action-RPG]] remake of ''Lufia II'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] was developed by [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]], with much of the staff of ''Lufia II'' involved in the project, and released in 2010. As in the original game, it features dungeons that focus heavily on puzzle-solving, but unlike the original, the gameplay is now oriented towards action, with the player controlling Maxim directly in battle and switching between characters by tapping his or her portrait on the bottom screen. The story also differs heavily in many points and received several additions.

'''Mallet dampening''' is a [[vibraphone]] technique that facilitates [[legato]] phrasing on the instrument. It is accomplished by striking a note on one of the bars of the instrument while the pedal is depressed and then using the head of the same or another mallet to stop the vibrations of the bar without raising the pedal.

There are many benefits of being proficient in this technique as a [[vibraphonist]].  As it allows a player to hold out one chord and add or subtract any individual pitch desired, a vibist can transition between chords much more smoothly than a pianist who cannot stop a string from vibrating without reaching inside the instrument when the pedal is down.  Most modern vibraphonists are highly skilled in this technique.

[[Image:HittingTimes1.png|thumb|340px|[[Stopped process#Brownian motion|Stopped Brownian motion]] is an example of a martingale. It can model an even coin-toss betting game with the possibility of bankruptcy.]]
In [[probability theory]], a '''martingale''' is a [[sequence]] of [[random variable]]s (i.e., a [[stochastic process]]) for which, at a particular time, the [[conditional expectation]] of the next value in the sequence, given all prior values, is equal to the present value.

Originally, ''[[martingale (betting system)|martingale]]'' referred to a class of [[betting strategy|betting strategies]] that was popular in 18th-century [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=N. J. |last=Balsara|title=Money Management Strategies for Futures Traders|publisher= Wiley Finance|year= 1992| isbn =0-471-52215-5 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jehps.net/juin2009/Mansuy.pdf|title=The origins of the Word "Martingale"|last1=Mansuy|first1=Roger|date=June 2009|volume=5|number=1|journal=Electronic Journal for History of Probability and Statistics|accessdate=2011-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131103618/http://www.jehps.net/juin2009/Mansuy.pdf|archive-date=2012-01-31|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the [[gambler]] wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails.  The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake.  As the gambler's wealth and available time jointly approach infinity, his probability of eventually flipping heads approaches 1, which makes the martingale betting strategy seem like a [[almost surely|sure thing]].  However, the [[exponential growth]] of the bets eventually bankrupts its users due to finite bankrolls. [[Stopped process#Brownian motion|Stopped Brownian motion]], which is a martingale process, can be used to model the trajectory of such games.

The concept of martingale in probability theory was introduced by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]] in 1934, though he did not name it. The term "martingale" was introduced later by {{harvtxt|Ville|1939}}, who also extended the definition to continuous martingales. Much of the original development of the theory was done by [[Joseph Leo Doob]] among others.  Part of the motivation for that work was to show the impossibility of successful betting strategies.

==Definitions==
A basic definition of a [[Discrete-time stochastic process|discrete-time]] '''martingale''' is a discrete-time [[stochastic process]] (i.e., a [[sequence]] of [[random variable]]s) ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... that satisfies for any time ''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} ( \vert X_n \vert )&lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} (X_{n+1}\mid X_1,\ldots,X_n)=X_n.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the [[conditional expected value]] of the next observation, given all the past observations, is equal to the most recent observation.

===Martingale sequences with respect to another sequence===

More generally, a sequence ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;... is said to be a '''martingale with respect to''' another sequence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;... if for all ''n''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} ( \vert Y_n \vert )&lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} (Y_{n+1}\mid X_1,\ldots,X_n)=Y_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a '''[[continuous time|continuous-time]] martingale with respect to''' the [[stochastic process]] ''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[stochastic process]] ''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that for all ''t''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} ( \vert Y_t \vert )&lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} ( Y_{t} \mid \{ X_{\tau}, \tau \leq s \} ) = Y_s\quad \forall s \le t.&lt;/math&gt;

This expresses the property that the conditional expectation of an observation at time ''t'', given all the observations up to time &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt;, is equal to the observation at time ''s'' (of course, provided that ''s''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''). Note that the second property implies that &lt;math&gt;Y_n&lt;/math&gt; is measurable with respect to &lt;math&gt;X_1 \dots X_n&lt;/math&gt;.

===General definition===

In full generality, a [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;Y:T\times\Omega\to S&lt;/math&gt; is a '''martingale with respect to a filtration''' &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_*&lt;/math&gt; '''and [[probability measure]] P''' if
* Σ&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Filtration (probability theory)|filtration]] of the underlying [[probability space]] (Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;'''P''');
* ''Y'' is [[adapted process|adapted]] to the filtration Σ&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e., for each ''t'' in the [[index set]] ''T'', the random variable ''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a Σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[measurable function]];
* for each ''t'', ''Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' lies in the [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;''S''), i.e.
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}} ( | Y_{t} | ) &lt; + \infty;&lt;/math&gt;
* for all ''s'' and ''t'' with ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''t'' and all ''F''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}} \left([Y_t-Y_s]\chi_F\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''χ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the [[indicator function]] of the event ''F''. In Grimmett and Stirzaker's ''Probability and Random Processes'', this last condition is denoted as
::&lt;math&gt;Y_s = \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}} ( Y_t | \Sigma_s ),&lt;/math&gt;
:which is a general form of [[conditional expectation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. |last1=Grimmett |first2= D.|last2= Stirzaker|title=Probability and Random Processes|edition= 3rd|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2001| isbn =0-19-857223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that the property of being a martingale involves both the filtration ''and'' the probability measure (with respect to which the expectations are taken).  It is possible that ''Y'' could be a martingale with respect to one measure but not another one; the [[Girsanov theorem]] offers a way to find a measure with respect to which an [[Itō process]] is a martingale.

==Examples of martingales==
* An unbiased [[random walk]] (in any number of dimensions) is an example of a martingale.
* A gambler's fortune (capital) is a martingale if all the betting games which the gambler plays are fair. To be more specific: suppose ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a gambler's fortune after ''n'' tosses of a [[fair coin]], where the gambler wins $1 if the coin comes up heads and loses $1 if it's tails.  The gambler's conditional expected fortune after the next trial, given the history, is equal to his present fortune. This sequence is thus a martingale.
* Let ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''n'' where ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the gambler's fortune from the preceding example.  Then the sequence { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ... } is a martingale.  This can be used to show that the gambler's total gain or loss varies roughly between plus or minus the [[square root]] of the number of steps.
* ([[Abraham de Moivre|de Moivre]]'s martingale) Now suppose the coin is unfair, i.e., biased, with probability ''p'' of  coming up heads and probability ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' of tails.  Let

::&lt;math&gt;X_{n+1}=X_n\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;
:with "+" in case of "heads" and "−" in case of "tails".  Let

::&lt;math&gt;Y_n=(q/p)^{X_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

:Then { ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ... } is a martingale with respect to { ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ... }. To show this
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E[Y_{n+1} \mid X_1,\dots,X_n] &amp; = p (q/p)^{X_n+1} + q (q/p)^{X_n-1} \\[6pt]
&amp; = p (q/p) (q/p)^{X_n} + q (p/q) (q/p)^{X_n} \\[6pt]
&amp; = q (q/p)^{X_n} + p (q/p)^{X_n} = (q/p)^{X_n}=Y_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Polya's urn]] contains a number of different coloured marbles; at each [[iterative method|iteration]] a marble is randomly selected from the urn and replaced with several more of that same colour. For any given colour, the fraction of marbles in the urn with that colour is a martingale. For example, if currently 95% of the marbles are red then, though the next iteration is more likely to add red marbles than another color, this bias is exactly balanced out by the fact that adding more red marbles alters the fraction much less significantly than adding the same number of non-red marbles would.
* ([[Likelihood-ratio test]]ing in [[statistics]]) A random variable X is thought to be distributed according either to probability density ''f'' or to a different probability density ''g''.  A [[random sample]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is taken.  Let ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the "likelihood ratio"

::&lt;math&gt;Y_n=\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{g(X_i)}{f(X_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

:If X is actually distributed according to the density ''f'' rather than according to ''g'', then {&amp;nbsp;''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' :&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;} is a martingale with respect to {&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' :&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;}.
* Suppose each [[amoeba]] either splits into two amoebas, with probability ''p'', or eventually dies, with probability 1 − ''p''.  Let ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the number of amoebas surviving in the ''n''th generation (in particular ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 if the population has become extinct by that time).  Let ''r'' be the [[Galton–Watson process|probability of ''eventual'' extinction]].  (Finding ''r'' as  a function of ''p'' is an instructive exercise.  Hint: The probability that the descendants of an amoeba eventually die out is equal to the probability that either of its immediate offspring dies out, given that the original amoeba has split.)  Then

::&lt;math&gt;\{\,r^{X_n}:n=1,2,3,\dots\,\}&lt;/math&gt;

:is a martingale with respect to { ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'': ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ... }.

* In an ecological community (a group of species that are in a particular trophic level, competing for similar resources in a local area), the number of individuals of any particular species of fixed size is a function of (discrete) time, and may be viewed as a sequence of random variables. This sequence is a martingale under the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography]].
* If { ''N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 } is a [[Poisson process]] with intensity λ, then the compensated Poisson process {&amp;nbsp;''N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;λ''t'' : ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;} is a continuous-time martingale with [[Classification of discontinuities|right-continuous/left-limit]] sample paths.
* [[Wald's martingale]]

==Submartingales, supermartingales, and relationship to harmonic functions{{anchor|Submartingales and supermartingales}}==

There are two popular generalizations of a martingale that also include cases when the current observation ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not necessarily equal to the future conditional expectation ''E''[''X&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''] but instead an upper or lower bound on the conditional expectation. These definitions reflect a relationship between martingale theory and [[potential theory]], which is the study of [[harmonic function]]s. Just as a continuous-time martingale satisfies ''E''[''X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''|{''X''&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;τ≤s}]&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;∀''s''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t'', a harmonic function ''f'' satisfies the [[partial differential equation]] Δ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 where Δ is the [[Laplace operator|Laplacian operator]]. Given a [[Brownian motion]] process ''W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a harmonic function ''f'', the resulting process ''f''(''W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') is also a martingale.
* A discrete-time '''submartingale''' is a sequence &lt;math&gt;X_1,X_2,X_3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of [[Integrable function|integrable]] random variables satisfying
::&lt;math&gt;{}E[X_{n+1}|X_1,\ldots,X_n] \ge X_n.&lt;/math&gt;
: Likewise, a continuous-time submartingale satisfies
::&lt;math&gt;{}E[X_t|\{X_{\tau} : \tau \le s\}] \ge X_s \quad \forall s \le t.&lt;/math&gt;
:In potential theory, a [[subharmonic function]] ''f'' satisfies  Δ''f''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0. Any subharmonic function that is bounded above by a harmonic function for all points on the boundary of a ball are bounded above by the harmonic function for all points inside the ball. Similarly, if a submartingale and a martingale have equivalent expectations for a given time, the history of the submartingale tends to be bounded above by the history of the martingale. Roughly speaking, the [[prefix]] "sub-" is consistent because the current observation ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''less than'' (or equal to) the conditional expectation ''E''[''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']. Consequently, the current observation provides support ''from below'' the future conditional expectation, and the process tends to increase in future time.
* Analogously, a discrete-time '''supermartingale''' satisfies
::&lt;math&gt;{}E[X_{n+1}|X_1,\ldots,X_n] \le X_n.&lt;/math&gt;
: Likewise, a continuous-time supermartingale satisfies
::&lt;math&gt;{}E[X_t|\{X_{\tau} : \tau \le s\}] \le X_s \quad \forall s \le t.&lt;/math&gt;
:In potential theory, a [[superharmonic function]] ''f'' satisfies Δ''f''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0. Any superharmonic function that is bounded below by a harmonic function for all points on the boundary of a ball are  bounded below by the harmonic function for all points inside the ball. Similarly, if a supermartingale and a martingale have equivalent expectations for a given time, the history of the supermartingale tends to be bounded below by the history of the martingale. Roughly speaking, the prefix "super-" is consistent because the current observation ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''greater than'' (or equal to) the conditional expectation ''E''[''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']. Consequently, the current observation provides support ''from above'' the future conditional expectation, and the process tends to decrease in future time.

===Examples of submartingales and supermartingales===
* Every martingale is also a submartingale and a supermartingale.  Conversely, any  stochastic process that is ''both'' a submartingale and a supermartingale is a martingale.
* Consider again the gambler who wins $1 when a coin comes up heads and loses $1 when the coin comes up tails.  Suppose now that the coin may be biased, so that it comes up heads with probability ''p''.
** If ''p'' is equal to 1/2, the gambler on average neither wins nor loses money, and the gambler's fortune over time is a martingale.
** If ''p'' is less than 1/2, the gambler loses money on average, and the gambler's fortune over time is a supermartingale.
** If ''p'' is greater than 1/2, the gambler wins money on average, and the gambler's fortune over time is a submartingale.
* A [[convex function]] of a martingale is a submartingale, by [[Jensen's inequality]].  For example, the square of the gambler's fortune in the fair coin game is a submartingale (which also follows from the fact that ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n'' is a martingale).  Similarly, a [[concave function]] of a martingale is a supermartingale.

==Martingales and stopping times==
{{Main|Stopping time}}

A [[stopping time]] with respect to a sequence of random variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... is a random variable τ with the property that for each ''t'', the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = ''t'' depends only on the values of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time ''t'', you can look at the sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop.  An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the gambling table, which might be a function of his previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can't choose to go or stay based on the outcome of games that haven't been played yet.

In some contexts the concept of ''stopping time'' is defined by requiring only that the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t'' is [[statistical independence|probabilistically independent]] of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;t&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;t&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... but not that it is completely determined by the history of the process up to time ''t''.  That is a weaker condition than the one appearing in the paragraph above, but is strong enough to serve in some of the proofs in which stopping times are used.

One of the basic properties of martingales is that, if &lt;math&gt;(X_t)_{t&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; is a (sub-/super-) martingale and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a stopping time, then the corresponding stopped process &lt;math&gt;(X_t^\tau)_{t&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;X_t^\tau:=X_{\min\{\tau,t\}}&lt;/math&gt; is also a (sub-/super-) martingale.

The concept of a stopped martingale leads to a series of important theorems, including, for example, the [[optional stopping theorem]] which states that, under certain conditions, the expected value of a martingale at a stopping time is equal to its initial value.

The community was originally created in 2004 by teenagers Erin Lang, Bri Draffen and Breniecia Reuben.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell Sunderland and Emalie Marthe|title=OH NO HE DIDN’T DID A WHITE GUY STEAL A POPULAR GOSSIP SITE FROM THREE BLACK TEENAGERS?|url=https://www.vice.com/read/oh-no-he-didnt-0000473-v21n10|accessdate=6 October 2014|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang maintains that after her mother died in 2009 she was denied access to the site and lost control to the current moderators Brenden Delzer and Elizabeth Carter.

==Editorial style==
The community publishes an average of 100 member posts per day,&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/2009/ "ONTD! Calendar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612112119/http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/2009/ |date=2009-06-12 }}, retrieved 2009-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; with most posts getting between 100 and 500 comments on average. The community moderators post a weekly post called "Free for All Friday" (or "FFAF") which allows members to post off-topic comments. These free-for-all posts have often been expanded to include community discussion posts for important pop culture events such as the [[Academy Awards]], the [[Olympics]] (known as "Free for All Olympics" or "FFAO" posts) and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' viewing posts.

In addition to members submitting the posts themselves, ONTD relies heavily on user participation in the comments section, where members can express their opinions on posts. Members often illustrate their reaction to a particular news item by posting an animated [[GIF]] image which represents their feelings. After the death of [[Michael Jackson]] on June 25, 2009, according to [[MSNBC]], "users expressed their collective grief by posting a [[Fantasia Barrino]] GIF, in which the ''[[American Idol]]'' star wails and flails her arms wildly,"&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;Popkin, Helen A.S.: [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31571885/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/ "'Net Big Enough For Michael Jackson and Iran"], ''[[MSNBC]]'' 2009-06-26. Retrieved on 2009-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; while other users expressed concern over the continued use of a popular GIF taken from the music video "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]" featuring a scene of Jackson eating popcorn, an image that is frequently posted on the community in anticipation of a controversial or "flame-worthy topic."&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;

Oh No They Didn't's popularity has resulted in a series of spin-off communities which follow the same format, but with a different or specialized topic, such as ontd_political for politics. A comprehensive list of other communities is available [http://community.livejournal.com/ontd_masterlist here].

==Awards and recognition==

ONTD won the Best Gossip Blog award in the 2008 Weblog Awards, beating out other popular celebrity blogs such as [[Dlisted|D-Listed]], [[Perez Hilton]] and [[TMZ.com|TMZ]], with a whopping 44% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2008.weblogawards.org/polls/best-gossip-blog/|title=Best Gossip Blog - The 2008 Weblog Awards|website=2008.weblogawards.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish newspaper ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' described the community as "Gossip on steroids."&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;Nanok Bie: [http://www.metro.se/se/article/2009/02/16/19/5440-45/index.xml "Ett himmelrike för skvallertanten"], ''Swedish [[Metro International|Metro]]'', 16-02-2009. Retrieved on 11-06-2009. ''"Oh No They Didn’t är en skvallersajt på steroider. I stället för att några utvalda ”journalister” skriver inläggen är det här medlemmarna själva som skvallrar.

Men om man älskar skvaller och orkar vada igenom mer än 100 inlägg om dagen så hittar man många guldkorn, ofta innan de större tidningarna fått upp ögonen för det."''&lt;/ref&gt;   The paper also noted that with a high volume of posts, the reader would "find a lot of highlights, and often before newspapers get their hands on it".&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;  The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that the "scandal-mongering community overflows with interactive snark" and encouraged the reader to "imagine a gossip clearinghouse run by teenagers with bad attitudes and sharp tongues".&lt;ref&gt;Chonin, Neva.

Retrieved 2009-12-27&lt;/ref&gt; to as "[[jackals]]" because the stories posted on the blog are taken from other sources. In response, the users embraced the term and repeatedly used the term in later posts, as well as manipulating their icons to include photographs of the animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/42310449.html "perez continues to be a moron- ontd gets a mention"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226011237/http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/42310449.html |date=2009-12-26 }} 2009-12-22. Retrieved 2009-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Village Voice]] called the community a "psychopathic celebrity news/gossip wire-of-sorts" and its users "a community of pathologically obsessive celebrity gossip sadomasochists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/04/andrew_breitbar_2.php Andrew Breitbart vs. Oh No They Didn't: A Media Spat with Epic Potential] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425042525/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/04/andrew_breitbar_2.php |date=2010-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community culture==
Members of the community often use [[Internet slang|acronyms]] such as TY ("thank you"), BB ("baby") and IAWTC ("I agree with this comment"). The devoted followers of celebrities – such as [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Lady Gaga]] – are nicknamed "stans" after the [[Eminem]] song "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]". In FFAF (free for all Friday) posts, members are encouraged by moderators to ask any questions or to voice any comments or concerns about the site, as well as posting off-topic comments freely.

== Exclusives ==
ONTD was the first community to break the news of [[Jamie Lynn Spears]]' pregnancy, after leaking ''[[OK! Magazine]]'''s unpublished front page cover,&lt;ref name="popmatters" /&gt; and was the first to report that [[Kirk Acevedo]] had announced via his [[Facebook]] status update that he had been fired from the Fox drama, ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karger, Dave. [http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/05/fringe-star-ann.html 'Fringe' star Kirk Acevedo announces firing on Facebook?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526235359/http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/05/fringe-star-ann.html |date=2009-05-26 }}. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. May 20, 2009. Retrieved June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the rumors of Jon from [[Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8|Jon and Kate Gosselin]]'s infidelity started appearing in February 2009, a photo of Jon out on town was posted on ONTD, which showed him posing with two young women in a local bar. National gossip magazines picked up the news, and a screen grab of ONTD could be seen in ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Star (magazine)]], issue 03-04-2009, page 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[US Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[US Weekly]], issue 03-11-2009, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most scandalous and notable events are often given nicknames to distinguish them in future posts, such as the January 2008 hospitalization of [[Britney Spears]], which was dubbed ''Hostage Brituation '08'' by the community's members.  This nickname was later picked up and used by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kreps, Daniel: [https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/01/04/britney-spears-hospitalized-after-hostage-brituation-involving-her-two-kids/ "Britney Spears Hospitalized After “Hostage Brituation” Involving Her Two Kids; Released Next Day"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 2008-01-04. Retrieved 2009-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse case between singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] was dubbed ''Domestic Disturbia '09'' by the community's members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klue.com.my/articles/1261-Wednesdays-Word-Up-Domestic-Disturbia Wednesdays Word Up: Domestic Disturbia] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110719183629/http://www.klue.com.my/articles/1261-Wednesdays-Word-Up-Domestic-Disturbia |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the community was also credited with starting a [[meme]] ("Gokey is a douche") connected to some friends of ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Danny Gokey]]'s negative comments and pictures regarding fellow contestant [[Adam Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, James. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1614260/20090618/story.jhtml Danny Gokey Detractors Take Their Fight To Twitter, Google]. ''[[MTV News]]''. June 18, 2009.

The community was also responsible for a hoax that claimed actress [[Betty White]] had died. After a post titled "Renner, Just Happy to Be Here" was approved to the community, the original poster edited the post to show a screen grab of a [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] article claiming White had died.&lt;ref name=betty&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/03/betty-white-death-hoax-fake.html Betty White is just fine -- though one hoaxer better lie low for a while]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. March 2, 2010. Retrieved March 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Users displayed shock and confusion, before slowly realizing the article was a fake when not only did the source link just go to TMZ's main website, but the article mentioned "possibilities of foul play and drug abuse, and grandchildren that Betty White does not have."&lt;ref&gt;[http://maisontv.livejournal.com/69671.html The Cutting Room Floor - ALERT : Betty White is Alive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820124051/http://maisontv.livejournal.com/69671.html |date=2011-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Community moderators deleted the post within 40 minutes, but not before "Betty White" became a Twitter trending topic. Once the hoax was discovered, fans urged each other to tweet #BettyWhiteFacts and other positive messages about White instead of spreading further death rumours.&lt;ref name=betty /&gt;

Another notable hoax involved a fake Twitter screenshot of [[Michael Lohan]] saying his daughter [[Lindsay Lohan]] had an affair with [[Tommy Mottola]] when she was 17, and that she had HIV. Though the post was quickly deleted, Perez Hilton reported on the screenshot as if it were true and other gossip sites followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perezhilton.com/2010-04-27-lindsay-lohan-has-aids|title=Lindsay Lohan Has AIDS?????|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/06/AR2010050605861.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Michael and Lindsay Lohan lies go viral, and the truth is hard to corral | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | date=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5528363/the-lindsay-lohan-has-hiv-twitter-scam-that-fooled-everyone |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604094709/http://gawker.com/5528363/the-lindsay-lohan-has-hiv-twitter-scam-that-fooled-everyone |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael believed that the screenshot was real and that someone had hacked his Twitter account, while Lindsay refused to believe her father was innocent, stating "He's a grown man and has done the exact same things on TV/interviews, why wouldn't he lie on Twitter, and everywhere else!" The moderators of ONTD later apologized for the scandal, while stating that they were "pretty appalled to learn that NONE of the other gossip or news sites that posted the story bothered to check for accuracy and have yet to post a retraction or apology for spreading such a vicious rumor." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/46756241.html|title=Update On The Michael Lohan Tweet Scandal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== LiveJournal downtime ==
In January 2009, ONTD became the first LiveJournal community to surpass 16,777,216 (2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;) comments. This exceeded LiveJournal's previously unknown limit on comments.&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;Lewis, Nick.

Retrieved 2009-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in almost a week of downtime for the community, while LiveJournal worked to fix the issue. A second community, [http://community.livejournal.com/ontd/ ontd], was created and members posted and commented there until the issue was fixed.

Oh No They Didn't was briefly suspended due to an explosion in usage following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death]] of [[Michael Jackson]] on June 25, 2009. The amount of traffic the community received brought all of LiveJournal's servers down, resulting in downtime for the entire domain.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt; During this time, members migrated temporarily to [http://community.livejournal.com/ontd/ ontd] once again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/ontd/193207.html "Oops" - ONTD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701030214/http://community.livejournal.com/ontd/193207.html |date=2009-07-01 }},&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oxford Friend''' is an [[Oxford]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;shire-based [[LGBT]]Q+ charity providing emotional support and counselling to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.

'''Psychological thriller''' is a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] narrative which emphasizes the unstable or delusional psychological states of its characters. In terms of context and convention, it is a [[Genre#Subgenre|subgenre]] of the broader ranging thriller narrative structure,&lt;ref name = DictionaryDotCom&gt;Dictionary.com, definition, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/psychological+thriller psychological thriller (definition)], Accessed November 3, 2013, "...a suspenseful movie or book emphasizing the psychology of its characters rather than the plot; this subgenre of thriller movie or book – Example: In a psychological thriller, the characters are exposed to danger on a mental level rather than a physical one....",&lt;/ref&gt; with similarities to [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] and [[detective fiction]] in the sense of sometimes having a "dissolving sense of reality". It is often told through the viewpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted mental perceptions and focusing on the complex and often tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters.&lt;ref name = Blackwell&gt;Christopher Pittard, Blackwell Reference, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405182904_chunk_g978140518290418_ss1-14 Psychological Thrillers], Accessed November 3, 2013, "...characteristics of the genre as “a dissolving sense of reality; reticence in moral pronouncements; obsessive, pathological characters; the narrative privileging of complex, tortured relationships” ( Munt 1994)..."&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Drama (film and television)|drama]], [[action film|action]], and [[paranoia]]. Not to be confused with [[psychological horror]], which involves more terror than [[wikt:psychosomatic|psychosomatic]] themes.

==Definition==
Peter Hutchings states varied films have been labeled psychological thrillers, but it usually refers to "narratives with domesticated settings in which action is suppressed and where thrills are provided instead via investigations of the psychologies of the principal characters."&lt;ref name=hutchings&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of Horror|last=Hutchings|first=Peter|page=253|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780810870505|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinguishing characteristic of a psychological thriller is it emphasizes the mental states of its characters: their perceptions, thoughts, distortions, and general struggle to grasp reality.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies and the Modern Psyche | last=Packer | first=Sharon | publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2007|isbn=9780275993597|pages=87–90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX4goUP_yh0C&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to director [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]], psychological thrillers focus on story, character development, choice, and moral conflict; fear and anxiety drive the psychological tension in unpredictable ways. Madden stated their lack of spectacle and strong emphasis on character led to their decline in Hollywood popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/9032326/John-Madden-on-psychological-thrillers.html|title=John Madden on Psychological Thrillers|last=Bowie-Sell|first=Daisy|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=2012-01-23|accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers are suspenseful by exploiting uncertainty over characters' motives, honesty, and how they see the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Erin|last=Whitney|date=2012-11-15|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]|url=http://www.backstage.com/interview/gretchen-mol-returns-stage-modern-thriller-good-mother/|title=Gretchen Mol Returns to the Stage in 'The Good Mother'|accessdate=2013-08-21|quote="element of a psychological thriller because ... suspenseful feeling of who did what, who's being honest ... about perception..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films can also cause discomfort in audiences by privileging them with information they wish to share with the characters; guilty characters may suffer similar distress by virtue of their knowledge.&lt;ref name="packer" /&gt;

However, [[James N. Frey]] defines psychological thrillers as a style, rather than a subgenre; Frey states good thrillers focus on the psychology of their antagonists and build suspense slowly through ambiguity.&lt;ref name="frey"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Write a Damn Good Thriller|last=Frey|first=James N.|authorlink=James N. Frey|pages=15–19|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] | year=2010 | isbn=9781429913638|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POPvQNgZYIQC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators and/or film distributors or publishers who seek to distance themselves from the negative connotations of horror often categorize their work as a psychological thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/story/six-things-that-still-drive-me-psycho|title=Six Things that Still Drive Me Psycho|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[DreadCentral]]|date=2008-05-27|accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same situation can occur when critics label a work to be a psychological thriller in order to elevate its perceived literary value.&lt;ref name="frey" /&gt;

==Literary devices and techniques==
* [[Plot twist]] – Films such as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[The Skeleton Key]]'' have advertised the fact that they contain plot twists and asked audiences to refrain from revealing spoilers. Psychological thrillers with poorly received plot twists, such as ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'', have suffered in the box office.&lt;ref name=twist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-08-11-skeleton-key-main_x.htm|title=This Shocking Twist Is ... Secret|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2005-08-11|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unreliable narrator]] – [[Andrew Taylor (author)|Andrew Taylor]] identifies the unreliable narrator as a common literary device used in psychological thrillers and traces it back to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s influence on the genre. Criminal insanity may be explored as a theme.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7833135.stm|title=The DNA of detection|last=Taylor|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Taylor (author)|work=[[BBC]]|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MacGuffin]] – Alfred Hitchcock pioneered the concept of the MacGuffin, a goal or item that helps to move the plot. The MacGuffin is frequently only vaguely defined, and it can be used to increase [[suspense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/971272-196/the-week-in-preview-i-am-a.html|title=The Week in Preview: "I am a typed director. If I made Cinderella, the audience would immediately be looking for a body in the coach." – Alfred Hitchcock|first=Teresa|last=Santoski|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Nashua Telegraph]]|date=2012-08-13|accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Many psychological thrillers have emerged over the past years, all in various media (film, literature, radio, etc.). Despite these very different forms of representation, general trends have appeared throughout the narratives. Some of these consistent themes include:&lt;ref name=packer/&gt;

* [[Death]]
* [[Existence]]/[[Intention|Purpose]]
* [[Identity (philosophy)|Identity]]
* [[Mind]]
* [[Perception]]
* [[Reality]]

In psychological thrillers, characters often have to battle an inner struggle. Amnesia is a common [[plot device]] used to explore these questions. Character may be threatened with death, be forced to deal with the deaths of others, or fake their own deaths.&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; Psychological thrillers can be complex, and reviewers may recommend a second or third viewing to "decipher its secrets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Holden | date=2011-04-14 | work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/movies/the-double-hour-italian-thriller-review.html|title=Romance or Film Noir? Both, and a Thriller|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common elements may include [[stock character]]s, such as a [[Hardboiled|hardboiled detective]] and [[serial killer]], involved in a [[cat and mouse]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/07/31/your_psychological_thriller/ | title=Your Psychological Thriller | last=Wright | first=Chris|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2011-07-31|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensation novel]]s, examples of early psychological thrillers, were considered to be socially irresponsible due to their themes of sex and violence. These novels, among others, were inspired by the exploits of real-life detective [[Jack Whicher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview29|title=The Prince of Sleuths|last=Summerscale|first=Kate|authorlink=Kate Summerscale|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water, especially floods, is frequently used to represent the unconscious mind, such as in ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' and ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Movies and the Mind|last=Indick|first=William|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] | year=2004 | isbn=9780786480920 | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU8B-6Bvb94C&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers may not always be concerned with plausibility. Peter Hutchings defines the [[giallo]], an Italian subgenre of psychological thrillers, as violent murder mysteries that focus on style and spectacle over rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of Horror Cinema|last=Hutchings|first=Peter|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780810870505|pages=141–143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter B. Flint of ''[[The New York Times]]'', detractors of Alfred Hitchcock accused him of "relying on slick tricks, illogical story lines and wild coincidences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0813.html | title=Alfred Hitchcock Dies; A Master of Suspense|last=Flint|first=Peter B.|work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1980-04-30 | accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rhyme''' is a repetition of similar sounds (usually, the exact same sound) in the final stressed syllables (and any following syllables) of two or more words. Most often, this kind of "perfect" rhyming is consciously used for effect in the final positions of [[Line (poetry)|lines]] of [[poem]]s and [[song]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhyme|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rhyme}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less strictly speaking, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word ''rhyme'' has come to be sometimes used as a [[pars pro toto|shorthand term]] for any brief poem, such as a [[rhyming couplet]] or [[nursery rhyme]].

==Etymology==

The word derives from [[Old French]] ''rime'' or ''ryme'', which may be derived from [[Old Frankish language|Old Frankish]] ''*rīm'', a Germanic term meaning "series, sequence" attested in Old English (Old English ''rīm'' meaning "enumeration, series, numeral") and Old High German ''rīm'', ultimately cognate to Old Irish ''rím'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἀριθμός}}'' ''arithmos'' "number". Alternatively, the Old French words may derive from [[Latin]] ''rhythmus'', from Greek ''{{lang|grc|ῥυθμός}}'' (''rhythmos'', [[rhythm]]).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book | title = rhyme, n. | work = OED Online | date = March 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/165361?rskey=SsEOXt&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Harper | first = Douglas | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | year = 2000–2012 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rhyme&amp;searchmode=none | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling ''rhyme'' (from original ''rime'') was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period from a learned (but perhaps etymologically incorrect) association with Latin ''rhythmus''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The older spelling ''rime'' survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling; cf. ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of [[linguistics]] and [[phonology]] for which ''rime/rhyme'' is used to refer to the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Syllable coda|coda]] of a [[syllable]]. Some prefer to spell it ''rime'' to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see [[syllable rime]]).

==Function of rhyming words==
Rhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. It also serves as a powerful [[mnemonic]] device, facilitating memorization. The regular use of [[Rhyme#Classification by position|tail rhyme]] helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example [[William Shakespeare]] often used a rhyming [[couplet]] to mark off the end of a scene in a play.

==Types of rhyme==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

The word ''rhyme'' can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a [[perfect rhyme]]. Examples are ''sight'' and ''flight'', ''deign'' and ''gain'', ''madness'' and ''sadness''.

===Perfect rhymes===
{{main article|Perfect rhyme}}

Perfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme, which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable.

* '''single''', also known as [[masculine rhyme|masculine]]: a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words (''rhyme'', ''sublime'')
* '''double''', also known as [[Feminine rhyme|feminine]]: a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words (''picky'', ''tricky'')
* '''[[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]]:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (''cacophonies'', ''Aristophanes'')

===General rhymes===
In the general sense, ''general rhyme'' can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:

* '''[[syllable rhyme|syllabic]]:''' a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain stressed vowels. (''cleaver'', ''silver'', or ''pitter'', ''patter''; the final syllable of the words ''bottle'' and ''fiddle'' are {{IPA|/l/}}, a [[liquid consonant]].)
* '''imperfect (or near):''' a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (''wing'', ''caring'')
* '''weak (or unaccented):''' a rhyme between two sets of one or more unstressed syllables. (''hammer'', ''carpenter'')
* '''semirhyme:''' a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word. (''bend'', ''ending'')
* '''forced (or oblique):''' a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (''green'', ''fiend''; ''one'', ''thumb'')
* '''[[assonance]]:''' matching vowels. (''sh'''a'''ke'', ''h'''a'''te'') Assonance is sometimes referred to as slant rhymes, along with consonance.
* '''[[literary consonance|consonance]]:''' matching consonants. ('''''r'''a'''b'''ie'''s''', '''r'''o'''bb'''er'''s''''')
*'''[[half rhyme]]''' (or '''slant rhyme'''): matching final consonants. (''Roxie'''', ''Lexie''''')
* '''[[pararhyme]]:''' all consonants match. (''tell'', ''tall'')
* '''[[alliteration]]''' (or '''head rhyme'''): matching initial consonants. ('''''sh'''ip'', '''''sh'''ort'')

===Identical rhymes===
Identical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry; but are valued more highly in other literatures such as, for example, ''[[rime riche]]'' in French poetry.

Though [[homophone]]s and [[homonym]]s satisfy the first condition for rhyming—that is, that the stressed vowel sound is the same—they do not satisfy the second: that the preceding consonant be different. As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.

If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.&lt;ref name="myclasses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myclasses.net/smiser/cwp/rhyme.html|title=Rhyme, which cites ''Whitfield's University Rhyming Dictionary'', 1951 |publisher=myclasses.net|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="michael-thomas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-thomas.com/music/songwriting/rhyming.htm|title=Rhyming and Songwriting|publisher=michael-thomas.com|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a ''super-rhyme'' or "more than perfect rhyme" is the ''identical rhyme'', in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in ''gun'' and ''begun''. Punning rhymes, such as ''bare'' and ''bear'' are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, it is called a ''[[holorhyme]]'' ("For I scream/For ice cream").

In poetics these would be considered ''identity'', rather than rhyme.

===Eye rhyme===
{{main article|Eye rhyme}}
Eye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently.&lt;ref name=Stillman /&gt;  Examples in English are ''cough'', ''bough'', and ''love'', ''move''.

Some early written poetry appears to contain these, but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost.

===Mind rhyme===
{{main article|Mind rhyme}}
Mind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to [[rhyming slang]], but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, “this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour,”  a mind rhyme has occurred.

===Classification by position===
Rhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse:
*'''Tail rhyme''' (also called '''end rhyme''' or '''rime couée''') is a rhyme in the final syllable(s) of a verse (the most common kind).
*'''[[Internal rhyme]]''' occurs when a word or phrase in the interior of a line rhymes with a word or phrase at the end of a line, or within a different line.
*'''[[Off-centered rhyme]]''' is a type of internal rhyme occurring in unexpected places in a given line. This is sometimes called a misplaced-rhyme scheme or a [[spoken word]] rhyme style.
*'''[[Holorime]]''', mentioned above, occurs when two entire lines have the same sound.
*'''[[Broken rhyme]]''' is a type of [[enjambement]] producing a rhyme by dividing a word at the line break of a poem to make a rhyme with the end word of another line.
*'''Cross rhyme''' matches a sound or sounds at the end of a line with the same sound or sounds in the middle of the following (or preceding) line.&lt;ref name=Stillman /&gt;

A [[rhyme scheme]] is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem.

==History==
In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplet]]s. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s.

The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese [[Shi Jing]] (ca. 10th century BC). Rhyme is also occasionally used in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=6wSWpZmmlAoC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=ugaritic+poetry+rhyme&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8i7tZjxiF6&amp;sig=F918VtPZEKIZ7r4ffu7lDRbrH6k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=37ReTdeKLJKs8QOespxa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rhyme&amp;f=false Old Testament survey: the message, form, and background of the Old Testament pg. 236]"&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not usually rhyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesling|first=Donald|title=The chances of rhyme|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03861-5|pages=x–xi, 38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rhyme was used very occasionally. For instance, Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem ''[[Catullus 1|Cui dono lepidum novum libellum]]''.&lt;ref name="prosentient"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosentient.com.au/balnaves/johnbalnaves/dissch6c.asp|title=Bernard of Morlaix - METRE AND RHYME|publisher=prosentient.com.au|accessdate=2015-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031628/http://www.prosentient.com.au/balnaves/johnbalnaves/dissch6c.asp|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks knew rhyme, and rhymes in ''[[The Wasps]]'' by [[Aristophanes]] are noted by a translator.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristophanes, 2: Wasps, Lysistrata, Frogs, The Sexual Congress|author1=Aristophanes|author2=Slavitt, D.R.|author3=Bovie, S.P.|date=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press, Incorporated|isbn=9780812216844|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHmfT2s4mLgC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some archaic sources, [[Early Irish literature|Irish literature]] introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, but that is a disputed claim.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08116a.htm Article about early Irish literature by Prof. Douglas Hyde in The Catholic Encyclopedia]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7th century, the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. Also in the 7th century, rhyme was used in the [[Qur'an]]. The [[leonine verse]] is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century.

Rhyme entered European poetry in the [[High Middle Ages]], in part under the influence of the [[Arabic language]] in [[Al Andalus]] (modern Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=88|author=Menocal, Maria Rosa|title=The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=0-8122-1324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the [[6th century in poetry|sixth century]], as in their long, rhyming [[qasida]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10387-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since languages change over time, lines that rhymed in the past may no longer rhyme in today's language, and it may not be clear how one would pronounce the words so that they rhyme:

==Rhyme in various languages==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

===Celtic languages===
:''For Welsh, see [[cynghanedd]]''

Rhyming in the [[Celtic Languages]] takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Brian Ó Cuív sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period: the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme. Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme: they need not be identical, but must belong to the same class. Thus 'b' and 'd' can rhyme (both being 'voiced plosives'), as can 'bh' and 'l' (which are both 'voiced continuants') but 'l', a 'voiced continuant', cannot rhyme with 'ph', a 'voiceless continuant'. Furthermore, "for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one."&lt;ref&gt;Ó Cuív, Brian (1967). 'The Phonetic Basis of Classical Modern Irish Rhyme'. ''Ériu 20, pp. 96-97''&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-Classical period, these rules fell into desuetude, and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices, as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song ''Bríd Óg Ní Mháille'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ga|Is a Bhríd Óg Ní Mháille}}
{{IPA-ga|is ə vrʲiːdʲ oːɡ nʲiː wɒːlʲə|}}
{{lang|ga|'S tú d'fhág mo chroí cráite}}
{{IPA-ga|stuː dɒːɡ mə xriː krɒːtʲə|}}
|
Oh young Bridget O'Malley

You have left my heart breaking}}

Here the vowels are the same, but the consonants, although both palatalized, do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme.

===Chinese===
{{Further|Rime dictionary}}
Besides the vowel/consonant aspect of rhyming, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] rhymes often include [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] quality (that is, [[Contour (linguistics)|tonal contour]]) as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme.

Use of rhyme in [[Classical Chinese poetry]] typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets, with end-rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet.

Another important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past [[varieties of Chinese]], such as [[Middle Chinese]].

===English===
{{see also|English poetry}}
[[Old English poetry]] is mostly [[alliterative verse]]. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is [[The Rhyming Poem]].

As [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is important in English, lexical stress is one of the factors that affects the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme. Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical.&lt;ref name=Stillman&gt;{{cite book|last=Stillman|first=Frances|title=The Poet's Manual and Rhyming Dictionary|year=1966|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0500270309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words in English, such as "[[Orange (word)|orange]]" and "silver", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever writer can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming "orange" with combinations of words like "door hinge" or with &lt;!--POV: far-fetched--&gt; lesser-known words like "[[Blorenge]]" – a hill in Wales – or the surname [[Gorringe (disambiguation)|Gorringe]]), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a [[synonym]] ("orange" could become "amber", while "silver" could become a combination of "bright and argent").

One view of rhyme in English is from [[John Milton]]'s preface to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'':
{{quote|The Measure is ''English'' Heroic  Verse without Rime, as that of ''Homer'' in ''Greek'', and of ''Virgil'' in ''Latin''; Rime being no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer Works especially, but the Invention of a barbarous Age, to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous modern Poets, carried away by Custom...&lt;!--carefully proofread --&gt;}}

A more tempered view is taken by [[W. H. Auden]] in [[The Dyer's Hand]]:
{{quote|Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect, the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical, they give notice; if he lacks authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest.}}

Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of [[doggerel]].

===French===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Meter (poetry)]] --&gt;

In [[French poetry]], unlike in English, it is common to have ''identical rhymes'', in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants ("consonnes d'appui") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, ''flour'' and ''flower'', would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones ''doigt'' and ''doit'' or ''point'' ("point") and ''point'' ("not") is not only acceptable but quite common.

Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories "rime pauvre" ("poor rhyme"), "rime suffisante" ("sufficient rhyme"), "[[rime riche]]" ("rich rhyme") and "rime richissime" ("very rich rhyme"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme "tu" with "vu" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme "pas" with "bras" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and "tante" with "attente" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute "e" in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.

''[[Holorime]]''  is an extreme example of ''rime richissime'' spanning an entire verse. [[Alphonse Allais]] was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from [[Marc Monnier]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Gall, amant de la Reine, alla (tour magnanime)
Galamment de l'Arène à la Tour Magne, à Nîmes.}}
|
Gallus, the Queen's lover, went (a magnanimous gesture)
Gallantly from the Arena to the Great Tower, at Nîmes.}}

Classical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way.

French spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced, and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification. They are encountered in almost all of the pre-20th-century French verse texts, but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century.

The most important "silent" letter is the "[[Silent letter#Vowels|mute e]]". In spoken French today, final "e" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted&lt;!--leads a kind of half-life: this is an abuse of the term "half-life"--&gt; after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. "Joue" could rhyme with "boue", but not with "trou". Rhyming words ending with this silent "e" were said to make up a "double rhyme", while words not ending with this silent "e" made up a "single rhyme". It was a principle of stanza-formation that single and double rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. Virtually all 17th-century French plays in verse alternate single and double [[alexandrine]] couplets.

The now-silent final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were traditionally an integral part of the rhyme, such that "pont" rhymed with "vont" but not with "long"; but spelling and pronunciation did not coincide exactly—"pont" also rhymed with "rond". There are a few rules that govern most word-final consonants in archaic French pronunciation:
* The distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants is lost in the final position. So "d" and "t" (both pronounced /t/) rhyme. So too with "g" and "c" (both /k/), "p" and "b" (both /p/), and "s", "x" and "z" (all /z/). Rhymes ending in /z/ are called "plural rhymes".
* Nasal vowels rhyme whether they are spelled with "m" or "n". ("Essaim" rhymes with "sain" but not with "saint" because of the final "t".)
* If a word ends in a stop followed by "s", the stop is silent (therefore "temps" rhymes with "dents"). In the archaic orthography some of these silent stops are omitted from the spelling as well (e.g. "dens" for "dents").

===Greek===
:''See [[Homoioteleuton]]'' rhyme

Ancient Greek poetry seldom if ever uses rhyme. Modern Greek poetry uses it extensively.

===Hebrew===
Ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] rarely employed rhyme, e.g. in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 29 35: ועשית לאהרן ולבניו כָּכה, ככל אשר צויתי אֹתָכה (the identical part in both rhyming words being / 'axa/ ). Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the [[piyyut|Jewish liturgical poetry]] written in the [[Byzantine empire]] era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of [[piyyut|piyyuts]] that have been discovered in the [[Cairo Geniza]]. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the [[Syriac Christianity]] (written in [[Aramaic]]), and through this mediation introduced into [[Latin poetry]] and then into all other languages of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt; See: Benjamin Harshav (Hrushovski)'s article on Hebrew Prosody in the [[Encyclopedia Judaica]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Latin===
In [[Latin]] rhetoric and poetry [[homeoteleuton]] and [[Alliteration (Latin)|alliteration]] were frequently used devices.

[[Rhyme#Classification by position|Tail rhyme]] was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by [[Cicero]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|O Fortu'''natam''' '''natam''' me consule '''Romam'''.}}
|
O fortunate Rome, to be born with me consul}}

But [[Rhyme#Classification by position|tail rhyme]] was not used as a prominent structural feature of [[Latin poetry]] until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early [[Middle Ages]]. This is the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] ''[[Dies Irae]]'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum Sybilla}}
|
The day of wrath, that day
which will reduce the world to ashes,
as foretold by David and the Sybil.}}

[[Medieval poetry]] may mix Latin and [[vernacular]] languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed [[macaronic]].

===Portuguese===
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] classifies rhymes in the following manner:

*'''rima pobre''' (poor rhyme): rhyme between words of the same [[grammatical category]] (e.g. noun with noun) or between very common endings (''-ão'', ''-ar'');
*'''rima rica''' (rich rhyme): rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings;
*'''rima preciosa''' (precious rhyme): rhyme between words with a different [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], for example ''estrela'' (star) with ''vê-la'' (to see her);
*'''rima esdrúxula''' (odd rhyme): rhyme between [[Proparoxytone|proparoxytonic]] words (example: ''ânimo'', "animus", and ''unânimo'', "unanimous").

===Russian===
Rhyme was introduced into [[Russian language|Russian]] poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Rhyme depends on a vowel and adjacent consonant (which may include the [[semivowel]] ''[[Short I]]''). Vowel pairs rhyme - even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced. Early 18th century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wachtel|first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Russian Poetry|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780511206986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish=== 
In Polish literature rhyme was used from the beginning. Unrhymed verse was never popular, although sometimes it was sometimes imitated form Latin. [[Homer]]'s, [[Virgil]]'s and even [[John Milton|Milton]]'s epic poems were furnished with rhymes by Polish translators.&lt;ref&gt;Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Kraków 2003, p. 19 (in Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of paroxytonic accentuation in Polish, feminine rhymes always prevailed. Rules of Polish rhyme were established in 16th century. Then only feminine rhymes were allowed in syllabic verse system. Together with introducing syllabo-accentual metres, masculine rhymes began to occur in Polish poetry. They were most popular at the end of 19th century. The most frequent rhyme scheme in Old Polish (16th - 18th centuries) was couplet AABBCCDD..., but Polish poets, having perfect knowledge of Italian language and literature, experimented with other schemes, among others [[ottava rima]] (ABABABCC) and [[sonnet]] (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD or ABBA ABBA CDCD EE).
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|pl|Wpłynąłem na suchego przestwór oceanu,
Wóz nurza się w zieloność i jak łódka brodzi,
Śród fali łąk szumiących, śród kwiatów powodzi,
Omijam koralowe ostrowy burzanu.}}
|attr1=Adam Mickiewicz,&lt;br&gt;"{{lang|pl|Stepy akermańskie}}", ''{{lang|pl|Sonety krymskie}}'', lines 1-4
|
Across sea-meadows measureless I go,
My wagon sinking under grass so tall
The flowery petals in foam on me fall,
And blossom-isles float by I do not know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonnets.org/mickiewicz.htm#001 Adam Mickiewicz's Sonnets from the Crimea at Sonnet Central]&lt;/ref&gt;|attr2="The Ackerman Steppe", ''Sonnets from the Crimea'',&lt;br&gt;translated by [[Edna Worthley Underwood]]}}

The metre of Mickiewicz's sonnet is the [[Polish alexandrine]] (tridecasyllable, in Polish "trzynastozgłoskowiec"): 13(7+6) and its rhymes are feminine: [anu] and [odzi].

===Arabic===
Rhymes were widely spread in the [[Arabian peninsula]] around the 6th century, in letters, poems and songs, as well as long, rhyming qasidas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10387-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the Koran uses a form of rhymed prose named [[saj']].

===Sanskrit===
Patterns of rich rhyme (''prāsa'') play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the ''pada'' (metrical foot): ''ādiprāsa'' (first syllable), ''dvitīyākṣara prāsa'' (second syllable), ''antyaprāsa'' (final syllable) etc.

===Tamil===
There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called ''etukai'' (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line.

The other rhyme and related patterns are called ''mō&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;ai'' ([[alliteration]]), ''toṭai'' ([[epistrophe|epiphora]]) and ''iraṭṭai kiḷavi'' ([[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]).

Some classical Tamil poetry forms, such as ''veṇpā'', have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]].

===Vietnamese===
Rhymes are used in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] to produce similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:

'''Nghèo''' như con '''mèo'''
&lt;br&gt;/'''ŋɛu''' ɲɯ kɔn '''mɛu'''/ 
&lt;br&gt;"Poor as a cat"
&lt;br&gt;

Compare the above Vietnamese example, which is a ''rhyming'' simile, to the English phrase "(as) poor as a church mouse", which is only a ''semantic'' simile.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 98 in Thuy Nga Nguyen and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] (2012), "Stupid as a Coin: Meaning and Rhyming Similes in Vietnamese", ''International Journal of Language Studies'' 6 (4), pp. 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simon During''' (born 1950) is a New Zealand born academic who completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge. In 1983, he joined the English Department at the University of Melbourne as a tutor, where, ten years later and after visiting positions at the University of Auckland and the Rhetoric Dept, UC Berkeley, he was appointed to the Robert Wallace chair.  After establishing the Cultural Studies, Media and Communications and Publishing programs at Melbourne, he left for [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 2001, and taught in the English department there for nine years. &lt;br /&gt;
Since 2010 he has been a Research Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the University of Queensland as well as holding visiting positions at the Frei Universität Berlin, Universität Tübingen, the American Academy of Rome, the University of Cambridge, Université de Paris and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;
 
His work contributes  to the study of British literary history, literary and cultural theory, postcolonialism, secularism, Australian and New Zealand literatures, and has been translated into many languages.

His books include ''Foucault and Literature'' (Routledge 1991) ''Patrick White'' (Oxford 1994), ''Exit Capitalism, literary culture, theory and post-secular modernity'' (Routledge 2010) and, most recently, ''Against Democracy: literary experience in the era of emancipations'' (Fordham 2012). His anthology ''The Cultural Studies Reader'' is a standard textbook in the field. Perhaps his most well known book is ''Modern Enchantments: The Cultural and Secular Power of Magic'' (2002), which explores the history of [[Magic (illusion)|magic]]. It has had a wide impact.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, James. (2002). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/28/highereducation.news "Modern Enchantments: The Cultural and Secular Power of Magic"]. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Brian. (2004). [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/174248 "Modern Enchantments: The Cultural Power of Secular Magic (review)"]. MLQ: Modern Language Quarterly.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674013711&amp;content=reviews "Modern Enchantments"]. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

His current research mainly addresses relations between Anglicanism  and literature between 1688 and 1945.

'''Smoke and mirrors''' is a classic technique in [[magic (illusion)|magical illusions]] that makes an entity appear to hover in empty space. It was documented as early as 1770 and spread widely after its use by the charlatan [[Johann Georg Schröpfer]], who claimed the apparitions to be conjured spirits. It subsequently became a fixture of 19th-century [[phantasmagoria]] shows. The illusion relies on a hidden projector (known then as a [[magic lantern]]) the beam of which reflects off a mirror into a cloud of smoke, which in turn [[scattering|scatters]] the beam to create an image.

The phrase "smoke and mirrors" has entered common English use to refer to any proposal that, when examined closely, proves to be an illusion.

'''''Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]]. It is the sequel to [[BioWare]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' and was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] on December 6, 2004, for [[Microsoft Windows]] on February 8, 2005, and [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] on July 21, 2015. Like its predecessor, it is set in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe 4,000 years before the events of the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' and is based on the [[d20 System]] developed by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. The game uses the [[Odyssey Engine]], which was originally used in ''Knights of the Old Republic''. The plot first started being written before the original ''Knights of the Old Republic'' was released, and development began in October 2003, after BioWare offered Obsidian their ''Star Wars'' license due to being confident in their previous work.

''Knights of the Old Republic II'' starts five years after the events of the first game and follows the story of The Exile, a [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] who was exiled from the Jedi Order. During this time, the Jedi Order has been almost completely wiped out by the [[Sith]]. The game begins with the protagonist waking up from unconsciousness on an [[asteroid mining]] facility. After he or she escapes with the help of their party members, they find the person who exiled them ten years ago, who sends the protagonist on a mission to seek out the remaining Jedi to fight against the Sith.

The game's critical reception upon its release was generally positive; praise was given to the story, characters, and writing, which were noted to be more grey than the original ''Knights of the Old Republic''. However, the game received criticism for being too similar to its predecessor in terms of graphics and gameplay systems. [[GameSpy]] named one of the game's party members, [[Kreia]], the best video game character of 2005, and the game was included in the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Knights of the Old Republic II combat.png|thumb|left|Screenshot from the first level of the game illustrating the interface and combat system.]]
''Knights of the Old Republic II'' is a [[role-playing video game]] played from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person view]] that features [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|pausable real-time]] combat.&lt;ref name="SpotRevX" /&gt; Combat and interactions with the environment and [[non-player character]]s in ''Knights of the Old Republic II'' are based on the [[d20 System]] as in ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''.&lt;ref name="GameSpyInter" /&gt; The game starts with a character creation screen with several choices to make, and there is also an option of letting the game do it automatically.&lt;ref name="Spothand"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres|first1=Ricardo|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Updated Hands-On|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-updated-hands-on/1100-6112913/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 30 new [[the Force|Force]] powers, which are manifestations of the Force, in ''Knights of the Old Republic II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Mini-preview at 411Mania|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/06/21/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-mini-preview-at-411mania|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=June 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its predecessor, the game has several [[minigames]], including swoop bike racing and a card game called Pazaak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duke|title=Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords|url=http://gr.bolt.com/games/pc/rpg/star_wars_kotor_2.htm|accessdate=June 21, 2015|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|date=February 5, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215011702/http://gr.bolt.com/games/pc/rpg/star_wars_kotor_2.htm|archivedate=February 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interface has been streamlined from the original game and party management has been made easier; for example, the player can switch between two selected weapon sets in the menu.&lt;ref name="Spothand" /&gt; As in the first game, the player can choose to align with either the light side or the dark side. Choosing dialogue options that are respectful and empathetic gives the protagonist light side points, while options that are egotistic and evil result in dark side points.&lt;ref name="SpotRevX" /&gt;

They allow the player character to practice in lightsaber combat or Force powers, depending on player choice.&lt;ref name="SpotRevX" /&gt;

The player can travel with up to two party members at a time, which gain [[experience point]]s at the same rate as the player character.&lt;ref name="SpotRevX" /&gt; Equipment and perks for party characters can be selected for different statistical effects or abilities.&lt;ref name="KTR2G"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodgson|first1=David|last2=Hogwood|first2=James|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords: Prima Official Game Guide|date=December 21, 2004|publisher=DK Games|isbn=9780761547488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can [[Looting (gaming)|loot]] corpses and various environmental objects.&lt;ref name=KTR2G/&gt; The protagonist also has the ability to "influence" their party members; by doing things that impress them, the player increases their influence with them.&lt;ref name="1UPRev" /&gt; Depending on the level of influence, party members may support the player character unconditionally or turn against the protagonist.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===

===Characters===
The Exile's backstory reveals that the character served under [[Revan]] during the Mandalorian Wars and ordered the activation of a devastating weapon in the climactic battle over Malachor V. The deaths that ensued created such a substantial "wound" in [[the Force]] that the character was forced to sever their connection to the Force to survive, and the Jedi Council ordered the character exiled from the Jedi Order.&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; As the game progresses, the Jedi Exile rebuilds a connection to the Force and creates unusually strong Force Bonds with other characters and places, while unknowingly sapping Force powers.&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt;

Among the characters who join the Jedi Exile are [[Kreia]], who acts as the Exile's mentor;&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=KotOR 2: Meet Your Team|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/01/kotor-2-meet-your-team|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; pilot and former Sith [[assassination|assassin]] [[Atton Rand]]; technician and Mandalorian War veteran [[Bao-Dur]] and his droid remote;&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; the criminal droid [[G0-T0]];&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; and the Sith apprentice [[Visas Marr]]. [[T3-M4]] and [[Canderous Ordo]] (now identified as "[[Mandalore]]"), both featured in the first game, also join the Exile's team.&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; Other characters join the Exile's party under certain conditions. [[HK-47]], who appears in the first game, joins the quest if the Exile collects and uses the parts necessary to reactivate him.&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; Depending on the player's alignment, the Exile will either be joined by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Mira (Star Wars)|Mira]] (light side or neutral)&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; or by her rival, a [[Wookiee]] bounty hunter known as [[Hanharr]] (dark side).&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; Depending on the player's gender, the Exile will either be joined by Mical the Disciple (female) or Brianna the [[Handmaiden]] (male).&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt;

The game features three main antagonists: Darth Traya, a mysterious assailant who remains in the dark through most of the game;&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; [[List of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic characters#Darth Sion|Darth Sion]], an undead Sith Lord with a murderous hatred for Jedi;&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt; and [[List of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic characters#Darth Nihilus|Darth Nihilus]], a Sith Lord whose physical being was destroyed due to his immense affinity to the Force.&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt;

===Plot===
While hiding on the ''Harbinger'', a Republic cruiser, the Exile is sedated by HK-50, an assassin droid, to be delivered to a crime syndicate called the Exchange, who have put out a bounty on live Jedi. The Exile is rescued by Kreia, with whom the Exile forms a Force Bond with, and the droid T3-M4 on the ''Ebon Hawk'', and the three flee the ''Harbinger'' as it is hijacked by a squad of Sith assassins. However, their ship is damaged during the escape by the ''Harbinger''{{'}}s gunfire, and they eventually arrive at the Peragus Mining Facility. Teaming up with smuggler Atton Rand, the group escapes to the planet Telos IV. While hiding out on Telos, they encounter Atris, a surviving member of the Jedi Council who sentenced the protagonist to exile ten years prior. After settling a dispute regarding the Exile's past sentence, Atris forms an uneasy alliance with them, instructing them to seek out other surviving Jedi in order to rally against the Sith. The Exile then travels to four worlds to find reclusive Jedi Masters and either beg for their aid or kill them in revenge for being exiled, depending on player choice. As the Exile continues their journey, they are joined by several individuals in their quest.&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt;

After finding all the Masters, the Exile travels back to [[Dantooine]] and learns that the countless deaths at Malachor V resulted in the Exile unconsciously giving up their connection to the Force, which then became the teachings of the new Sith. If the player aided the Jedi Masters, they prepare to strip the Exile of their Force connection permanently, as the Masters fear that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force, but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution. If the player killed the Jedi Masters, Kreia attacks the Exile and leaves. Tracking Kreia to Telos, the Exile fights and defeats a corrupted Atris, from whom it is learned that Kreia plans to strengthen a massive wound in the Force made ten years prior. This wound had been created by the Exile during the Mandalorian Wars, when they activated a superweapon in order to end the battle on the planet Malachor V, causing mass death and destruction. Before following her to Malachor V, where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya, the Exile stops a Sith invasion of Telos, defeating one of Traya's former apprentices, the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. On Malachor V, the Exile is separated from their companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the planet's surface and the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm. On the final floor of the academy, the Exile kills the Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet's core.&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt;

The Exile defeats the Sith Lord, but before Traya dies, she delivers a prophetic vision of the future pertaining to the player's companions and the worlds that were visited over the course of the story. Depending on the Exile's alignment, they either order the destruction of Malachor V, escaping before it is destroyed, and travel into the Unknown Regions in search of Revan (light side), or remain on Malachor V as the new Dark Lord of the Sith (dark side).&lt;ref name="VideoGame" /&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Chris Avellone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chris Avellone]] (''pictured'') was the [[Video game design#Game designer|lead designer]] of ''Knights of the Old Republic II''.]]
''Knights of the Old Republic II'' was developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] and published by [[LucasArts]].&lt;ref name="LeadingSequel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thorsen|first1=Tor|title=KOTOR sequel leading LucasArts' E3 charge|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/kotor-sequel-leading-lucasarts-e3-charge/1100-6095387/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sequel to [[BioWare]]'s ''Knights of the Old Republic'',&lt;ref name="LeadingSequel" /&gt; and it uses the same [[Odyssey Engine]] as the original game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thorsen|first1=Tor|title=BioWare trademarks new game engine|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-trademarks-new-game-engine/1100-6104277/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=August 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; BioWare suggested that Obsidian should be offered the ''Knights of the Old Republic'' license due to their familiarity with Obsidian's past work and the good relationship between the two developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development schedule for the sequel to be too tight.&lt;ref name="FearEuro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QAFU"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thorsen|first1=Tor|title=Q&amp;A: Obsidian Entertainment's Feargus Urquhart|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-obsidian-entertainments-feargus-urquhart/1100-6104565/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=August 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released in [[personal computer|PC]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Chris|title=In the Home Stretch|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/584907p1.html|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=February 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the game began in October 2003.&lt;ref name="Wrapone" /&gt; The overview of the game's story was originally drafted before the first ''Knights of the Old Republic'' was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts.&lt;ref name="DiaryOne"&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Designer Diary #1|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-designer-diary-1/1100-6102189/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=July 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation to write ''Knights of the Old Republic II'', lead designer [[Chris Avellone]] tried to learn as much about the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first ''Knights of the Old Republic'' and the original ''Star Wars'' films for inspiration.&lt;ref name="GameSpyInter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Interview|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/565247p1.html|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=November 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avellone said that Obsidian recognized one of the things that made ''Knights of the Old Republic'' great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.&lt;ref name="Wrapone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Wrap Report, Part 1|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/24/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-wrap-report-part-1?page=1|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=December 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Knights of the Old Republic II'' uses the same [[d20 System]] as the first ''Knights of the Old Republic'' with some changes, and the level cap has also been removed.&lt;ref name="GameSpyInter" /&gt; For the most part, the team didn't want to redo any of the design elements from the first game, as they felt that there was no need to change anything that had already proved successful; instead, they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon them in a way that retained the base style of ''Knights of the Old Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Postmortem: Jedi Mind Tricks – Choice and Consequence In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II|journal=[[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer]]|date=April 2005|volume=12|issue=4|pages=30–36|url=http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/GD_Mag_Archives/GDM_April_2005.pdf|last1=Saunders|first1=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Saunders (video game developer)|accessdate=June 20, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928205154/http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/GD_Mag_Archives/GDM_April_2005.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obsidian put much work into the game's graphics, including the appearances of non-player characters.&lt;ref name="GameSpyInter" /&gt; Other technological improvements include the lighting and weather effects, in addition to increasing the level sizes.&lt;ref name="GameSpyInter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tslpeg2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bramwell|first1=Tom|title=Knights of the Old Republic: The Sith Lords preview|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/p_kotor2|accessdate=June 20, 2017|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=April 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knights of the Old Republic II''{{'}}s lead artist was Aaron Meyers; he decided which people would join the art team after looking through "tons of applications, resumes, and demo reels", and he said that he was pleased with the number of people who wanted to work for Obsidian.&lt;ref name="Diarythree"&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Designer Diary #3|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-designer-diary-3/1100-6113338/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyers also complained about the short deadline the development team had to deal with.&lt;ref name="Diarythree" /&gt; Obsidian's [[Chief operating officer|COO]], Chris Parker, said that the schedule set for the development team was "extremely aggressive", and that the team felt a lot of pressure because they were "making a sequel to the [[List of Game of the Year awards|game of the year]] for 2003".&lt;ref name="Wrapone" /&gt;

For the music, the development team felt that symphony orchestra would work best for ''Knights of the Old Republic II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Designer Diary #5 – Music|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-designer-diary-5-music/1100-6118170/|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical score was composed by [[Mark Griskey]], who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's theme, [[Darth Sion]]'s theme and [[Darth Nihilus]]'s theme (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's theme from ''The Return of the Jedi''). He also created a theme for the main character, which is heard occasionally when he or she experiences internal conflict. The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=68 Interview with Mark Griskey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424071320/http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=68 |date=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening crawl utilizes the version of [[John Williams]]' main ''Star Wars'' theme that was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.

When Obsidian was preparing to present ''Knights of the Old Republic II'' at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2004]], they tried to fit as much information as they could, saying that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation.&lt;ref name="DiaryOne" /&gt; During this time, none of the [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels and put them through a schedule to finish them on time.&lt;ref name="DiaryOne" /&gt; The [[Technology demonstration|demo]] was finished a few days before the event,&lt;ref name="DiaryOne" /&gt; and the game was presented in May 2004.&lt;ref name="E3ign"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tal|first1=Blevins|title=E3 2004: Knights of the Old Republic: The Sith Lords|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/05/12/e3-2004-knights-of-the-old-republic-the-sith-lords|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''Knights of the Old Republic II'' was later unveiled in July 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tuttle|first1=Will|title=The First Trailer for KOTOR II - The Sith Lords|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/534274p1.html|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=July 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official website was launched in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KOTOR II Web site goes live|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kotor-ii-web-site-goes-live/1100-6111893/|accessdate=June 20, 2017|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking back at ''Knights of the Old Republic II'' in a 2013 interview, Avellone said that because of LucasArts forcing Obsidian to finish the game in a short time frame of 14 to 16 months, the game ended up being in an "unfinished" state.&lt;ref name="FearEuro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Purchese|first1=Robert|title=Fear is the path to the dark side|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-31-fear-is-the-path-to-the-dark-side|accessdate=June 16, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Avellone said that Obsidian was at fault for this due to not cutting out enough things; he noted that all minigames should have been removed, and also said that there were too many in-engine [[cutscene]]s.&lt;ref name="FearEuro" /&gt; Obsidian's co-founder, [[Feargus Urquhart]], said that the game was originally going to be released in 2005, but it was later moved up to December 2004 after E3; according to him, Obsidian had to choose between "get[ting] in trouble or get[ting] it done".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schreier|first1=Jason|title=The Knights of New Vegas|url=http://kotaku.com/5968952/the-knights-of-new-vegas-how-obsidian-survived-countless-catastrophes-and-made-some-of-the-coolest-role-playing-games-ever|accessdate=June 16, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, several cuts had to be made; one of the most major was the droid planet M4-78, which was entirely removed from the game after the 2004 E3 event when the team realized that they wouldn't be able to fit it into the schedule.&lt;ref name="Wraptwo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Wrap Report, Part 2|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/27/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-wrap-report-part-2|accessdate=June 20, 2017|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=December 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; M4-78's designer, [[Kevin Saunders (video game developer)|Kevin Saunders]], explained that he moved assets from that planet to Nar Shaddaa's yacht level in order to complete it on time, which was prior also likely to be cut from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars: KotOR II M4-78EP Planet Restoration Mod Released|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/news/110423-star-wars-kotor-ii-m4-78ep-planet-restoration-mod-released.html|accessdate=June 20, 2017|publisher=[[UGO Networks|GameBanshee]]|date=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It entered their chart for the month at number 11, and at number 3 on the Xbox-only chart.&lt;ref&gt;[[The NPD Group|NPD]] sales figures report, December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Videogame Sales – Month Ended 12/31/2004|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/index.asp?layout=marketData&amp;content=topgamesellers&amp;chartdate=12%2F31%2F2004&amp;Submit=Go|accessdate=June 20, 2017|publisher=VideoBusiness.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120102519/http://www.videobusiness.com/index.asp?layout=marketData&amp;content=topgamesellers&amp;chartdate=12%2F31%2F2004&amp;Submit=Go|archivedate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its North American release on Windows, it debuted at number 2 on the PC chart for the month of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thorsen|first1=Tor|title=ChartSpot: February 2005|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chartspot-february-2005/1100-6120823/|accessdate=June 20, 2017|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the game debuted at the top of the weekly chart, beating [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s much-anticipated online game ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', which was released in the same week.

''Knights of the Old Republic II'' was met with positive reception upon its release; on [[Metacritic]], it has an [[Aggregate data|aggregate]] score of 85/100 and 86/100 on the PC and Xbox versions respectively, indicating "generally favorable reviews" according to the site.&lt;ref name="MetaP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MetaX" /&gt; [[IGN]] said that there is a bulk of pressure involved with developing the sequel to a game from a different developer which won several "[[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]]" awards, and that Obsidian delivered.&lt;ref name="IGNXBOX" /&gt; The review also said that it won't disappoint fans of the original game and that it is mostly similar to it in terms of the model.&lt;ref name="IGNPC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNXBOX" /&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' praised both the first and second ''Knights of the Old Republic'' and said that the second game continues the series' tradition of not fixing what is not broken.&lt;ref name="ProRevX" /&gt; [[GameSpot]] echoed this statement, also saying that both the good things and the shortcomings from the first game are present in ''Knights of the Old Republic II''.&lt;ref name="SpotRevX" /&gt;

[[GameSpy]] compared the game to ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' from the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film trilogy in that it is the best of the series in terms of story, and also said that the game has the best story in a video game since ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev" /&gt; [[1UP.com]] wrote that Obsidian surpassed the original ''Knights of the Old Republic'' in terms of the writing, saying that the plot is more consistent, the dialogue is edgier and the moral choices are more significant;&lt;ref name="1UPRev" /&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' agreed, writing, "your decision making, as you pursue a light or dark path, is more ambiguous, with more unexpected consequences".&lt;ref name="cgwrev18" /&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' said that compared to the original game, ''Knights of the Old Republic II''{{'}}s plot is "far more grey".&lt;ref name="EuroRev" /&gt; The review also said that planets are "better developed and paced".&lt;ref name="EuroRev" /&gt; GameZone wrote that the game is a "Must Buy" for people who like well-written characters and story.&lt;ref name="ZoneRevX" /&gt;

The combat was generally well-received, with some reviewers noting that it is mostly unchanged from the original ''Knights of the Old Republic''.&lt;ref name="CVGRev"&gt;{{cite news|title=PC Reviews: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=115817|accessdate=June 14, 2015|work=[[Computer and Video Games]]|date=March 30, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624090605/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=115817|archivedate=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZoneRevP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProRevP" /&gt; GameSpot compared the combat from the first ''Knights of the Old Republic'' to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous.&lt;ref name="SpotRevP" /&gt; GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first ''Knights of the Old Republic'' to the second, but that this is a good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable.&lt;ref name="ZoneRevX" /&gt; IGN praised the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]], saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members.&lt;ref name="IGNPC" /&gt; GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original ''Knights of the Old Republic''.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev" /&gt;

GameSpot criticized ''Knights of the Old Republic II''{{'}}s graphics, calling them "lackluster".&lt;ref name="SpotRevX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SpotRevP" /&gt; GameSpy's reviewer felt that the game's graphics were disappointing, calling them "a little dated" and "half-baked".&lt;ref name="GSpyRev" /&gt; The reviewer further criticized the graphics for looking the same as they were in the first game of the series, saying that they could only be considered "good" during the release of that game.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev" /&gt; GameZone said that the game looks exactly the same as the original ''Knights of the Old Republic''&lt;ref name="ZoneRevX" /&gt; and that it doesn't compare to the majority of mainstream games released at the time.&lt;ref name="ZoneRevP" /&gt; GameSpy called the music in the game "excellent"; however, the reviewer noted that some of it is re-used from the first game of the series.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev" /&gt; The GameSpy reviewer also said that while the majority of the voice-acting is good, there are "a few more examples of bad voice-acting" than in the first ''Knights of the Old Republic''.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev" /&gt; GameZone said that the "top-notch" voice acting complements the game's very well-written dialogue, and also praised the game's sound effects.&lt;ref name="ZoneRevX" /&gt;

The game was criticized for its [[glitch]]es; several players reported having problems with [[pathfinding]] bugs.&lt;ref name="IGNPC" /&gt; 1UP.com's reviewer condemned ''Knights of the Old Republic II'' for having the same bugs and technical issues as in the first game, saying that his party "still had a tendency to warp and skip around the map at times", and he also criticized the pathfinding in the game.&lt;ref name="1UPRev" /&gt; GameSpy said that the game's bugs are "hard to forgive", and that these issues didn't occur in the first ''Knights of the Old Republic''.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev" /&gt; In a different article, GameSpy said that the game is incomplete, and attributed this to its rushed deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buecheler|first1=Christopher|title=The Resident Cynic: A Rush and A Push|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/588/588057p1.html|accessdate=June 15, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=February 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameSpy called Kreia the best video game character of 2005, saying that she was "easily the most intriguing, complicated, enigmatic, well-designed and nuanced character in a video game this year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Character -- Kreia from KotOR II|url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index23.html|accessdate=June 15, 2015|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223151100/http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index23.html|archivedate=December 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die|last=Mott|first=Tony|year=2010|publisher=[[Quintessence Editions]]|location=London|isbn=9781741730760|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">'''Stichomythia''' (Greek: Στιχομυθία) is a technique in [[verse drama]] in which sequences of single alternating lines, or half-lines (hemistichomythia&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;[http://roberthogan.net/books/antilabe-rebuilt.pdf], Antilabe Rebuilt by Robert Hogan.&lt;/ref&gt;) or two-line speeches (distichomythia&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Die stichomythie in der griechischen tragödie und komödie:
ihre anwendung und ihr ursprung by Adolf Gross (German).&lt;/ref&gt;) are given to alternating [[Character (arts)|characters]]. It typically features repetition and [[antithesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Lesley, ed. | title = New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 3056 | isbn = 0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated in the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]], though many dramatists since have used the technique. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] it derives from the Greek ''stikhos'' ("row, line of verse") + ''muthos'' ("speech, talk").&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford"&gt;Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition Revised&lt;/ref&gt;

Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of [[Dialogue (fiction)|dramatic dialogue]] where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.

==In Ancient Greek drama==
Stichomythia originated in Greek drama.&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford" /&gt; Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtly in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zkMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:bwNarlyOkSgC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MgIQT8LiNobqtgfDn9T5AQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=editions%3AbwNarlyOkSgC&amp;f=false], Studies in stichomythia by J. Leonard Hancock&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca==
Senecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally&lt;ref name="usu.edu"&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/131romtheatre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca's tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==In more recent theatre==
Renaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name="selu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/cfrederic/TheatreHistoryThruRenaissance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

Modern theatre rarely uses verse,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/nov/11/plays-verse-missing-stage | work=The Guardian | first=Raymond | last=Blankenhorn | title=Plays in verse were all the rage, but why are they missing from the stage? | date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==General trends==
In terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character's line interrupts the other's.&lt;ref name="Hogan" /&gt;

In terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Sophocles===
A short example from [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|R. C. Jebb]]'s translation of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'': the scene is an argument between [[Ismene]] and her sister [[Antigone]].
For further examples from ''Antigone'', consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Sophocles/antigone.html].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ISMENE:  And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, 'tis with pain that I mock thee. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   At least thy choice was not made without my protest. &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===
''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Act I, scene ii.  [[Richard III of England|Richard Plantagenet]], [[Earl of Gloucester]] (later [[Richard III of England]]) threatens to kill himself unless Lady Anne, widow of Prince Edward (of Lancaster), agrees to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LADY ANNE:  I would I knew thy heart.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  'Tis figured in my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   I fear me both are false.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Then never man was true.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   Well, well, put up your sword.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Say, then, my peace is made.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   That shall you know hereafter.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  But shall I live in hope?&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   All men, I hope, live so.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   To take is not to give. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:     Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act III, Scene iv (the Closet scene), [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] is confronted by his mother, the queen, about the play (III, ii) which Hamlet rigged to expose his murderous step-uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
QUEEN:   Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Mother, you have my father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
QUEEN:   Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "The Merchant of Venice", Shylock and Bassanio enter into an argument using stichomythia at 4.1.65-9, which "catches the dramatic tension of a quasi-forensic interrogation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SHYLOCK:  I am not bound to please thee with my answers.&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further intensification is often achieved by [[antilabe]], in which a single verse line is distributed on alternating speakers.

===Corneille===
An exchange  in ''[[Le Cid]]'' (1.3.215–226), by [[Pierre Corneille]], has been called "an excellent instance of Corneille's skilful handling of 'stichomythia'".&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1918, p. 103)&lt;/ref&gt;  Don Diègue (an old man, the hero's father) has been appointed the prince's tutor, a post that the Count (''le Comte'') wanted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Que l'a gagné sur vous l'avoit mieux merité.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l'exercer en est bien le plus digne.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n'est pas un bon signe.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Vous l'avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: L'éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n'était dû qu'à mon bras.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui n'a pu l'obtenir ne le méritoit pas.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Ne le méritoit pas!  Moi?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE:                      Vous.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE:                                  Ton impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Téméraire viellard, aura son récompense.  [''Il lui donne un soufflet''
&lt;ref&gt;
COUNT: What I deserved, you carried away.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who won it over you had deserved it more.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: He who can exercise it best is the most worthy.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: To be refused it is not a good sign.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: You had it by intrigue, being an old courtier.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The luster of my high deeds was my only supporter.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Let's speak better, the King does honor to your age.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The King, when he does it, measures it according to courage.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: And by that the honor was owed to my arm only.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who could not obtain it did not deserve it.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Did not deserve it!  I?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO:                      You.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT:                                  Your impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Rash old man, will have its reward.  [''He slaps him'']
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Musical drama===
In the scene in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', [[libretto]] by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro's mother, she repeats her disbelief (''Sua madre?'', that is, "his mother?") to each character and is reassured in the same words.  A critic has called that "the merriest and most congenial form imaginable" of stichomythia.&lt;ref&gt;Knepler (1997, p. 192)&lt;/ref&gt;  For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by [[Andrea Maffei]] for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[I masnadieri]]'' has been called "musical stichomythia",&lt;ref&gt;Budden (1992, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
AMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t'ha diviso?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l'inchiesta crudel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Beato se chiuso m'avesse l'avel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Anch'io, derelitta, ti piansi lung'anni.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?&lt;ref&gt;AMALIA: Which sea, which land divided you from me?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Oh, unhappy woman, end the cruel inquiry!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: False news said you were dead.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Happy were I if shut in the tomb!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Did you, O my Carlo, feel the torment?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: May your heart never know it!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: I too, lonely, cried for you many years.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Then for me an angel dared weep?
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples from [[Musical theatre|musical]]s are "I Remember it Well" (lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], first version in the Broadway musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'', second in the film ''[[Gigi]]'') and "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" (by [[Irving Berlin]], from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'').  Another is from "The Last Supper" in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus: Why don't you go do it?&lt;br&gt;
Judas: You want me to do it!&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: Hurry, they're waiting&lt;br&gt;
Judas: If you knew why I do it...&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: I don't care why you do it&lt;br&gt;
Judas: To think I admired you,&lt;br&gt;
for now I despise you&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: You liar—you Judas&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
In the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a "witty exchange of one-liners" and associated with the [[film noir]] characters  Jeff Bailey in ''[[Out of the Past]]'', [[Sam Spade]], and [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2008, p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; Another film-noir example is in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (dialog by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]]). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren't you?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea,
      if you know what I mean.&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: How fast was I going officer?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: I'd say around 90.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose it doesn't take?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: That tears it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Take The Stage''''' is a non-scripted singing competition starring [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]] and [[Rodney Jerkins|Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], and produced by YOBI.tv.

''Take The Stage'' has been likened to shows such as [[American Idol]], [[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]], and [[The X Factor (TV series)|X Factor]] in that the contestants are put through a variety of challenges to see who has what it takes to be the next musical sensation. It has also, however, been noted as different from these shows for its non-reliance on professional or celebrity judges and the absence of progressive eliminations, as well as for its focus on original music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Lucas|title=MySpace Meets 'American Idol' in New Singing Competition 'Take the Stage'|url=http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/myspace-meets-american-idol-new-singing-competition-take-stage-42726|publisher=TheWrap.com|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hampp|first=Andrew|title=Johnny Wright, Rodney Jerkins Talk New MySpace Competition Series 'Take The Stage'|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/johnny-wright-rodney-jerkins-talk-new-myspace-1007233952.story|publisher=Billboard.biz|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieselman|first=Jarett|title=Building the Perfect Reality Competition|url=http://www.theinsider.com/tv/52850_Johnny_Wright_Talks_Take_The_Stage/index.html|publisher=TheInsider.com|accessdate=20 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806055040/http://www.theinsider.com/tv/52850_Johnny_Wright_Talks_Take_The_Stage/index.html|archivedate=6 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Toy Association''' is an American [[trade association]] for the US toy industry.

== Description ==
The Toy Association’s member companies account for roughly 85% of US domestic toy sales. In 2017, US retail sales of toys generated nearly $27 billion. The toy industry’s annual total economic impact in the US is nearly $110.9 billion.&lt;ref name="dallas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toyassociation.org/ta/research/data/impact/toys/research-and-data/data/economic-impact-data.aspx|title=Economic Impact Data|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2018|work=toyassociation.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average price of a toy is around $10, but the estimated 3 billion units sold across the United States each year generates approximately $27 billion in direct toy sales. From toy inventors to store clerks, the toy industry supports an estimated 691,263 jobs (FTE) generating $35.1 billion in wages for US workers. The toy industry generates $14.98 billion in tax revenue each year.&lt;ref name="dallas"/&gt;

The Toy Association produces two major annual trade fairs: the North American International Toy Fair and the Fall Toy Preview. Other events include conferences and PlayFair, a team-building program offered to schools and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organization Profile |url=http://www.toyassociation.org/App_Themes/tia/pdfs/about/TIAOrganizationalProfile.pdf |publisher=Toy Industry Association |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
Bereavement, as defined by Webster, is the state of being bereaved or deprived of something or someone. The DSM-IV TR lists bereavement as a mental health diagnosis when the focus of clinical attention is related to the loss of a loved one and when symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder are present for up to two months. A number of treatments for bereavement have been used and evaluated, but music therapy models have been found to be the most successful in treating grief and bereavement (Rosner, Kruse &amp; Hagl, 2010).

== Music therapy practice ==
{{See also|Music therapy}}
Music therapy practice is working together with clients, through music, to promote healthy change (Bruscia, 1998; Abrams, 2010).  The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has defined the practice of music therapy as "a behavioral science concerned with changing unhealthy behaviors and replacing them with more adaptive ones through the use of musical stimuli" (Davis, Gfeller &amp; Thaut, 2008).

=== Brief history ===
The use of music to soothe grief has been used since the time of David and King Saul. In I Samuel, David plays the [[Lyre]] in order to make King Saul feel relieved and better.  It has since been used all over the world for treatment of various issues, though the first recorded use of official "music therapy" was in 1789 - an article titled "Music Physically Considered" by an unknown author was found in ''Columbian Magazine''.  The creation and expansion of music therapy as a [[treatment modality]] thrived in the early to mid 1900's and while a number of organizations were created, none survived for long.  It wasn't until 1950 that the National Association for Music Therapy was founded in New York that clinical training and certification requirements were created. In 1971, the American Association for Music Therapy was created, though at that time called the Urban Federation of Music Therapists. The [http://www.cbmt.org/ Certification Board for Music Therapists] was created in 1983 which strengthened the practice of music therapy and the trust that it was given.  In 1998, the American Music Therapy Association was formed out of a merger between National and American Associations and is now{{when|as of when?|date=December 2017}} the single largest music therapy organization in the world (American music therapy, 1998–2011).  More about the history along with general information and application of music therapy can be found on the [http://www.musictherapy.org American Music Therapy Association] website.

=== Interventions ===
Though music therapy practice employs a large number of intervention techniques, some of the most commonly used interventions include improvisation, therapeutic singing, therapeutic instrumental music playing, music-facilitated reminiscence and life review, songwriting, music-facilitated relaxation, and lyric analysis.  While there has been no conclusive research done on the comparison of interventions (Jones, 2005; Silverman, 2008; Silverman &amp; Marcionetti, 2004), the use of particular interventions is individualized to each client based upon thorough assessment of needs, and the effectiveness of treatment may not rely on the type of intervention (Silverman, 2009).

[[Improvisation in music therapy]] allows for clients to make up, or alter, music as they see fit.  While improvisation is an intervention in a methodical practice, it does allow for some freedom of expression, which is what it is often used for.  Improvisation has several other clinical goals as well, which can also be found on the [[Improvisation in music therapy]] page, such as: facilitating verbal and nonverbal communication, self-exploration, creating intimacy, teamwork, developing creativity, and improving cognitive skills (Bruscia, 1998).  Building on these goals, R. Keith Botello and Dr. Robert E. Krout (2008) took steps to design a cognitive behavioral application of improvisation to assess and improve communication in couples.  Further research is needed before the use of improvisation is conclusively proven to be effective in this application, but there were positive signs in this study of its use.

Singing or playing an instrument is often used to help clients express their thoughts and feelings in a more structured manner than improvisation and can also allow participation with only limited knowledge of music.  Singing in a group can facilitate a sense of community and can also be used as group ritual to structure a theme of the group or of treatment (Krout, 2005).  In a one-time bereavement support group, songs that were specifically composed by music therapists for this group to meet the goals of the program.  The songs were sung by the group which appeared to result in the facilitation and growth of connectedness within the group.  While not a substitute for long-term counseling, this one-time support group showed that sing-alongs can be powerful in providing support and connectedness in a group, especially when the songs were composed to incorporate desired themes and context.

Though lyric analysis is often and widely used, research that compares music therapy intervention has been inconclusive up to this point.  Dr. Michael Silverman (2009) completed a study on lyric analysis and found it to be the third most used type of intervention.  Music Therapists use lyric analysis in a variety of ways, but typically lyric analysis is used to facilitate dialogue with clients based on the lyrics, which can then lead to discussion that addresses the goals of therapy (Freed, 1987).  Dr. Silverman also noted that the song that therapists found most effective in lyric analysis was "Lean on Me" by Bill Withers.  Other popular choices were the songs "I am a Rock," "Bridge Over Troubled Water," "Concrete Angel," "Everybody Hurts," "Help," and "Let It Be."  The choice of song is often based around the material and issues listed in the song, but therapists have stated they also choose songs based on their clients' preferences, and on their own personal tastes in music (Silverman, 2009).

== Diagnosing bereavement ==
At the moment,{{when|date=December 2017}} bereavement is listed as its own diagnosis in the DSM-IV TR, but proposed changes in the DSM-V may impact the way bereavement is diagnosed.  The DSM-IV TR states the following about bereavement:
:This category can be used when the focus of clinical attention is a reaction to the death of a loved one. As part of their reaction to the loss, some grieving individuals present with symptoms characteristic of a Major Depressive Episode (e.g., feelings of sadness and associated symptoms such as insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss). The bereaved individual typically regards the depressed mood as "normal," although the person may seek professional help for relief of associated symptoms such as insomnia or anorexia. The duration and expression of "normal" bereavement vary considerably among different cultural groups. The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder is generally not given unless the symptoms are still present 2 months after the loss. However, the presence of certain symptoms that are not characteristic of a "normal" grief reaction may be helpful in differentiating bereavement from a Major Depressive Episode. These include 1) guilt about things other than actions taken or not taken by the survivor at the time of the death; 2) thoughts of death other than the survivor feeling that he or she would be better off dead or should have died with the deceased person; 3) morbid preoccupation with worthlessness; 4) marked psychomotor retardation; 5) prolonged and marked functional impairment; and 6) hallucinatory experiences other than thinking that he or she hears the voice of, or transiently sees the image of, the deceased person.

== Music therapy in grief treatment ==
It has become well known in the music therapy field that music can be an effective tool in the treatment of grief and bereavement but Francesca Albergato-Muterspaw (2009) looked at how music actually played a role in the healing from grief.  In her study, three primary themes presented themselves from the interviews and observation of the participants.  She found firstly that, music has a significant connection with emotion.  Music can be used to express oneself, keep a client distracted when there is a need for distraction, and can help clients reflect on themselves and past experiences leading to changes in identity.  Secondly, a sense of community, culture, and spirituality was found when music was used in treatment.  Employing the ides of community, culture, and spirituality have shown to be vital in the process of dealing with grief so using music to elicit these concepts makes it a powerful tool indeed.  Lastly, it was found that music was important to clients as a way to give tribute to the deceased.  On top of these areas of note, it was also discussed that the participants had a better understanding of each other - more so than they had simply by talking with each other (Albergato-Muterspaw, 2009).  It appears that music allows for context and meta messages to be more easily and successfully communicated between a group, an important point for therapists in any field, and also especially important when working with the bereaved.  In 2008, Kathryn Lindenfelser and colleagues looked at the experiences parents of terminally ill children had with music therapy.  They found that music therapy was effective in altering perceptions in the midst of adversity, was a strong component of remembrance, provided a multifaceted treatment, and as the other study also mentioned, increased communication and expression in both the adults and children (Lindenfelser Grocke &amp; McFerran, 2008).  In a separate study that explored the effects of music therapy on pain in children and families, it was found that music therapy can be used to reduce physical pain and anxiety, enhance relaxation, and promote positive moods and compliance.  There was also an inverse relationship found between music therapy and behavioral distress (Whitehead-Pleaux, Baryza &amp; Sheridan, 2007).  Since bereavement is diagnosed when elements of depression are found, and since music therapy has shown to be effective in enhancing mood and lowering distress, one could conclude that elements of music therapy could also be effective in the treatment of depression and other adjustment disorders, though further research would need to be done to make that conclusion.

== Cultural considerations ==
Music therapy, like many forms of therapy, has the potential to be a highly culturally sensitive one. Empathy in general is an important aspect of any mental health and the same is true for music therapy, as is cultural awareness. It's the added complexity to cultural empathy that comes from adding music that provides both the greater risk and potential to provide exceptional culturally sensitive therapy (Valentino, 2006). An extensive knowledge of a culture is really needed to provide this effective treatment as providing culturally sensitive music therapy goes beyond knowing the language of speech, the country, or even some background about the culture. Simply choosing music that is from the same country of origin or that has the same spoken language is not effective for providing music therapy as, similar to the United States, music genres vary as do the messages each piece of music sends. Also, different cultures view and use music in various ways and may not always be the same as how the therapist views and uses music. There do tend to be misconceptions in the field, however, even in the practitioners of music therapy. It was actually found in one study, that 82% of therapists thought that choosing songs in a client's native language would automatically be appropriate and only 13% of therapists thought that their cross-cultural training was adequate (Valentino, 2006) so it does appear that though music therapy has potential, the field could be better served with some further cross-cultural training.  Melody Schwantes and her colleagues wrote an article that describes the effective use of the Mexican "corrido" in a bereavement group of Mexican migrant farm workers (Schwantes, Wigram, Lipscomb &amp; Richards, 2011). This support group was dealing with the loss of two of their coworkers after an accident they were in and so the corrido, a song form traditionally used for telling stories of the deceased. An important element that was also mentioned was that songwriting has shown to be a large cultural artifact in many cultures, and that there are many subtle messages and thoughts provided in songs that would otherwise be hard to identify.  Lastly, the authors of this study stated that "Given the position and importance of songs in all cultures, the example in this therapeutic process demonstrates the powerful nature of lyrics and music to contain and express difficult and often unspoken feelings" (Schwantes ''et al.'', 2011).

== Empirical evidence ==
In this day and age,{{when|date=December 2017}} providing evidence-based practice is becoming more and more important and music therapy has been continuously critiqued and regulated in order to provide that desired evidence-based practice.  A number of research studies and meta-analyses have been conducted on, or included, music therapy and all have found that music therapy has at least some promising effects, especially when used for the treatment of grief and bereavement.  The AMTA has largely supported the advancement of music therapy through research that would promote evidenced-based practice.  With the definition of evidence-based health care as "the conscientious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients or the delivery of health services, current best evidence is up-to-date information from relevant, valid research about the effects of different forms of health care, the potential for harm from exposure to particular agents, the accuracy of diagnostic tests, and the predictive power of prognostic factors" (Cochrane, 1972).

Both qualitative and quantitative studies have been completed and both have provided evidence to support music therapy in the use of bereavement treatment.  One study that evaluated a number of treatment approaches found that only music therapy had significant positive outcomes where the others showed little improvement in participants (Rosner,Kruse &amp; Hagl, 2010).  Furthermore, a pilot study, which consisted of an experimental and control group, examined the effects of music therapy on mood and behaviors in the home and school communities.  It was found that there was a significant change in grief symptoms and behaviors with the experimental group in the home, but conversely found that there was no significant change in the experimental group in the school community, despite the fact that mean scores on the Depression Self-Rating Index and the Behavior Rating Index decreased (Hilliard, 2001).  Yet another study completed by Russel Hilliard (2007), looked at the effects of Orff-based music therapy and social work groups on childhood grief symptoms and behaviors.  Using a control group that consisted of wait-listed clients, and employing the Behavior Rating Index for Children and the bereavement Group Questionnaire for Parents and Guardians as measurement tools, it was found that children who were in the music therapy group showed significant improvement in grief symptoms and also showed some improvement in behaviors compared to the control group, whereas the social work group also showed significant improvement in both grief and behaviors compared to the control group.  The study concludes with support for music therapy as a medium from bereavement groups for children (Hilliard, 2007).

Though there has been research done on music therapy, and though the use of it has been evaluated, there remain a number of limitations in these studies and further research should be completed before absolute conclusions are made, though the results of using music therapy in the treatment have consistently shown to be positive.
