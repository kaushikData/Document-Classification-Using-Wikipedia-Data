'''Albert Grünwedel''' (July 31, 1856 – October 28, 1935) was a German indologist, tibetologist, [[archaeologist]], and [[Exploration|explorer]] of Central Asia. He was one of the first scholars to study the [[Lepcha language]].

==Life==

Grünwedel was born in [[Munich]] in 1856, the son of a painter. He studied art history and [[Asian languages]], including [[Avestan]], and in 1883 earned his doctorate at the [[University of Munich]]. In 1881 he began work as an assistant at the [[Museum für Asiatische Kunst|Museum of Ethnology]] in Berlin and in 1883 he was appointed deputy director of the ethnographic collection. Grünwedel  won accolades for his numerous publications on [[Buddhist art]], archaeology Central Asia, and [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] languages. Two notable works were ''Buddhist art in India'' (1893) and ''Mythology of Buddhism in Tibet and Mongolia'' (1900), which concerned  the [[Ancient Greece|Greek origins]] of the [[Gandhara]]n [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist artistic style]] and its development in Central Asia.

In 1899 Grünwedel was invited to join a Russian archaeological research expedition led by [[Vasily Radlov]] into the north of [[Xinjiang province]], China.  In the same year he was appointed a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1902-1903 Grünwedel led the first German expedition to [[Turpan]], in Xinjiang, becoming the first modern European to study the massive ruins near [[Gaochang]].  He recorded the events of this expedition in his book ''Report on Archaeological work in Idikutschahri and Surrounding areas in Winter 1902-1903'' (1905). The next expedition was led by [[Albert von Le Coq]], who became famous for removing large numbers of [[frescos]] from sites across Xinjiang.&lt;ref name=hopkirk&gt;{{cite book |last=Hopkirk |first=Peter |authorlink= Peter Hopkirk |coauthors= |title= Foreign Devils on the Silk Road: The Search for the Lost Cities and Treasures of Chinese Central Asia |year=1980 |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]] |location=[[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]] |isbn=0-87023-435-8 |pages=110–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grünwedel himself headed the third [[German Turfan expeditions|German Turfan expedition]] in 1905-1907, the results of which were published in ''Ancient Buddhist Religion in Chinese Turkistan'' (1912). Grünwedel's expeditions were largely funded by the [[Krupp family]].&lt;ref name=hopkirk/&gt; Grünwedel was joined by [[Heinrich Lüders]] who made major contributions to the epigraphical analysis of the Turpan-Expedition findings after being called to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Berlin as Professor for oriental languages in 1909.

Grünwedel retired in 1921, and in 1923 moved to [[Bavaria]], where his spent his last years at [[Bad Tölz]] writing a number of scientific papers. He died in [[Lenggries]] in 1935.

'''Allen Edwardes''' is the pen-name of a scholar of Middle Eastern and Oriental erotica.  He is best known as the author of the 1959 book ''The Jewel in the Lotus'', the introduction to which was written by the noted sexologist and prolific writer, [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]. The book, named after a famous [[mantra]], is an amassment of sexual curiosities apparently plucked from a variety of ethnographical and orientalist sources. Throughout the book, one finds a plethora of uncontrolled generalizations concerning the sexual behaviour of non-western populations. Doubt has been cast on the sincerity of its scholarship. A recent study accuses the author of "more than a touch of prurience," and warns that "the guise of orientalist scholarship clearly gives Edwardes leeway to express a surfeit of subconscious homoerotic phantasy."&lt;ref&gt;Boone 2001: 53&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the book is a curious and highly specific example of a more general tendency in Western scholarship—or, in this case, rather pseudo-scholarship—which has been criticized as '[[Orientalism]]' ([[Edward Said]]).

Edwardes, who was born in 1939 and was also known as D. A. Kinsley, wrote a number of other books as well, including racy biographies of [[Robert Clive]] and [[Richard Francis Burton]].  Kirkus Reviews judged the latter book, published in 1963, to be "for sensation seekers and pseudo-intellectuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death Rides a Camel (review)|journal=Kirkus Reviews|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/allen-edwardes/death-rides-a-camel/|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vladimiro Ariel Dorfman''' (born May 6, 1942) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]]-[[Chile]]an-[[America]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arieldorfman.com/ |title=Ariel Dorfman Home Page |date= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[novelist]], [[playwright]], [[essayist]], [[academic]], and [[human rights]] activist.  A citizen of the United States since 2004, he has been  a professor of [[literature]] and [[Latin American Studies]] at [[Duke University]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]],  since 1985.

==Background and education==
Dorfman was born in [[Buenos Aires]] on May 6, 1942, the son of Adolf Dorfman, who was born in [[Odessa]] (then [[Russian Empire]]) to a well-to-do Jewish family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorfman |first=Ariel |date=1998 |title=Heading South, Looking North: A Bilingual Journey |location=New York |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |page=18 |isbn=0374168628}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a prominent Argentine professor of economics and the author of ''Historia de la Industria Argentina'', and Fanny Zelicovich Dorfman, who was born in [[Chișinău|Kishinev]] of [[Bessarabia]]n Jewish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_138/arieldorfmansbedroom.html |title= Ariel Dorfman’s Bedroom War |publisher= by Jerry Tallmer for thevillager.com |date= December 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv_dorfman |title= Ariel Dorfman Interview |publisher= by Danny Postel for [[The Progressive]] |date= December 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his birth, they moved to the United States and then, in 1954, moved to [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.gacemail.com.ar/Detalle.asp?NotaID=10101 El largo exilio de Ariel Dorfman] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706081626/http://www.gacemail.com.ar/Detalle.asp?NotaID=10101 |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended and later worked as a professor at the [[University of Chile]], marrying Angélica Malinarich in 1966 and becoming a Chilean citizen in 1967.  From 1968 to 1969, he attended graduate school at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and then returned to Chile.

Since the restoration of democracy in Chile, in 1990, he and his wife Angélica have divided their time between [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and the United States.

==Career==
From 1970 to 1973, Dorfman served as a cultural adviser to President [[Salvador Allende]]. During this time he wrote, with Armand Mattelart, a critique of [[North America]]n [[cultural imperialism]], ''[[How to Read Donald Duck]]''. Dorfman was supposed to work on the night shift at the [[La Moneda]] presidential palace the night before the Pinochet coup, but he had swapped his shift with his friend Claudio Jimeno, not knowing what was to come. Forced to leave Chile in 1973, after the coup by General [[Augusto Pinochet]] leading to President Allende's suicide, Dorfman went on to live in [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]  Since 1985 he has taught at [[Duke University]], where he is currently Walter Hines Page Research Professor of Literature and Professor of [[Latin American Studies]].

Dorfman was member of the [[Group of 88]], a group of signatories of a controversial advertisement in [[The Chronicle (Duke University)|''The Chronicle'']], Duke's student newspaper&lt;ref name="Ad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/listening.pdf |title=What Does a Social Disaster Sound Like? |publisher=African &amp; African American Studies Department, Duke University |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825054233/http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/listening.pdf |archivedate=August 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Supporters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/supporters.pdf |title=List of Supporters |publisher=African &amp; African American Studies Department, Duke University |accessdate=November 16, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415004657/http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/supporters.pdf |archivedate=April 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Duke lacrosse case]].

Dorfman details his life of exile and bi-cultural living in his memoir, ''Heading South, Looking North'', which has been acclaimed by [[Elie Wiesel]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Literary work==
[[File:Ariel Dorfman (1463213435) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dorfman in 2007]]
Dorfman's work often deals with the horrors of tyranny and, in later works, the trials of exile. In an interview in ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Dorfman said, "I'm constantly trying to figure out how you can be true to an experience which in fact very few people in the world would understand, such as having most of your friends disappear or be tortured, and at the same time finding a way of telling that story so other people in other places can read their own lives into that." His most famous play, ''[[Death and the Maiden (play)|Death and the Maiden]]'', describes the encounter of a former torture victim with the man she believed tortured her; it was made into a [[Death and the Maiden (film)|film in 1994]] by [[Roman Polanski]] starring [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Ben Kingsley]]. Dorfman identified "the stark, painful Chilean transition to democracy" as ''Death and the Maiden'''s central theme.&lt;ref name=Berman&gt;Berman, Jenifer. [http://bombsite.com/issues/50/articles/1833 "Ariel Dorfman"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Winter 1995. Retrieved 25 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The play received a 20th anniversary revival in the 2011–2012 season at the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]] in London's West End, directed by [[Jeremy Herrin]] and starring [[Thandie Newton]], [[Tom Goodman-Hill]], and [[Anthony Calf]].

His thesis on [[Absurdism|the absurd]] in plays of [[Harold Pinter]] was published in Spanish as ''El absurdo entre cuatro paredes: el teatro de Harold Pinter'' ''(The absurd within four walls: the theater of Harold Pinter)'' by Editorial Universitaria, in [[Santiago, Chile]], in 1968 (124 pages).&lt;ref name=WorldCat&gt;Ariel Dorfman, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1400001?referer=di&amp;ht=edition El absurdo entre cuatro paredes: el teatro de Harold Pinter]''.

A critic of Pinochet, he has written extensively about the General's extradition case for the Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' and other publications, and in the book ''Exorcising Terror: The Incredible Unending Trial of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.'' Rather than distinguishing between politics and art, Dorfman believes "that one’s writing is deeply political," and, at its best, "engages the major dilemmas...of the community."&lt;ref name=Berman/&gt;

Dorfman's works have been translated into more than 40 languages and performed in over 100 countries. Besides poetry, essays and novels— ''Hard Rain'', winner of the Sudamericana Award; ''Widows''; ''The Last Song of Manuel Sendero''; ''Mascara''; ''Konfidenz''; ''The Nanny and the Iceberg'', and Blake's ''Therapy''—he has written short stories, including ''My House Is on Fire'', and general nonfiction including ''The Empire’s Old Clothes: What the [[Lone Ranger]], [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds''. He has won various international awards, including two [[Kennedy Center]] Theater Awards. In 1996, with his son, Rodrigo, he received an award for best television drama in Britain for ''Prisoners in Time.'' His poems, collected in ''Last Waltz in Santiago'' and ''In Case of Fire in a Foreign Land'', have been turned into a half-hour fictional film, ''Deadline,'' featuring the voices of [[Emma Thompson]], [[Bono]], [[Harold Pinter]], and others.

Dorfman's [[human rights]] play, ''Speak Truth to Power: Voices from Beyond the Dark''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speaktruth.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828221511/http://www.speaktruth.org/ |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on interviews with human rights defenders conducted by [[Kerry Kennedy Cuomo]]), premiered at the Kennedy Center in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 2000, and subsequently aired on [[PBS]] as part of its ''[[Great Performances]]'' series. The play starred [[Kevin Kline]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Alec Baldwin]], and [[John Malkovich]], among others, and was directed by [[Gregory Mosher|Greg Mosher]]. It has gone on to numerous performances around the world, including a run in [[New York City]]. On May 3, 2010, a "Speak Truth to Power" benefit for survivors of the [[2010 Chilean earthquake]] was put on by [[New York's Public Theater]], directed by [[David Esbjornson]], and featuring an all-star cast of [[Elias Koteas]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Gloria Reuben]], [[Paul Sorvino]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Stanley Tucci]], and [[Debra Winger]].

Dorfman's play ''The Other Side'' had its world premiere at the [[New National Theatre]] in [[Tokyo]] in 2004 and opened [[off-Broadway]] at the [[Manhattan Theater Club]] in 2005.  Other recent plays include ''Purgatorio'' at the [[Seattle Rep]] in 2005 and at the [[Arcola Theatre]] in London in 2008; ''Picasso’s Closet,'' a counterfactual history in which the [[Nazis]] murder [[Picasso]], had its premiere at [[Theater J]] in Washington, D.C. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/29/AR2006062900740.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Dorfman Limns a Tangle of Ethics in 'Picasso' | first=John | last=Barry | date=2006-06-30 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the subject of a feature-length documentary, ''A Promise to the Dead'', based on his memoir ''Heading South, Looking North'' and directed by Peter Raymont. The film had its world premiere at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2007. In November 2007, the film was named by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist. The list was narrowed to five films on January 22, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i587be3b0ca27043557eff60b69803664 |title=Shortlist for docu Oscar unveiled |accessdate=2007-12-21 |date=2007-11-20 |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705063437/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i587be3b0ca27043557eff60b69803664 |archivedate=2008-07-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Promise to the Dead'' was not among the five Oscar-nominated documentaries.

His latest works include the [[Lowell Thomas Award]]-winning travel book, ''Desert Memories''; a collection of essays, ''Other Septembers, Many Americas''; a novel he wrote with his youngest son, Joaquín, ''Burning City''; ''Americanos: Los Pasos de Murieta''; and a new volume of memoirs, ''Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile''. In 2007, his musical, ''Dancing Shadows'', opened in [[Seoul]], Korea. This collaboration with [[Eric Woolfson]], the principal composer for the [[Alan Parsons Project]], won five Korean “Tony” awards. In 2011, his play "Purgatorio" has its Spanish language premiere at the [[Teatro Español in Madrid]], starring [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Carme Elias]].

Dorfman currently has several film projects in development with his sons, Rodrigo and [[Joaquin Dorfman]], including a screen adaptation of his novel, ''Blake’s Therapy''.

Dorfman also writes regularly for such publications as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' (where he has a featured [[blog]]), ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[L'Unità]]''.

He is a member of ''L'Académie Universelle des Cultures'', in [[Paris]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

The '''Association for the Study of African American Life and History''' ('''ASALH''') is an organization dedicated to the study and appreciation of [[African-American History]].  It is a non-profit organization founded in Chicago, Illinois, on September 9, 1915, and incorporated in Washington, D.C. on October 2, 1915, as the '''Association for the Study of Negro Life and History''' (ASNLH) by [[Carter G. Woodson]], William D. Hartgrove, George Cleveland Hall, Alexander L. Jackson, and James E. Stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.berea.edu/cgwc/the-founding-of-the-association-september-9-1915/|title=The founding of the association September 9, 1915|first=Daryl Michael|last=Scott|publisher=Carter G. Woodson Center|accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is based in Washington, D.C. ASNLH was renamed the '''Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History''' in 1973.

ASALH's official mission is "to promote, research, preserve, interpret, and disseminate information about Black life, history, and culture to the global community."&lt;ref name=hisorg&gt;[http://www.historians.org/affiliates/assn_study_afro-am_life_his.htm American Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

ASALH's official vision is " to be the premier Black Heritage and learned society with a diverse and inclusive membership supported by a strong network of national and international branches to continue the Woodson legacy."&lt;ref name=hisorg /&gt;

ASALH created Negro History Week in 1926. Woodson selected the week to coincide with the birthdays of [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]].  Each year, Woodson established a national theme for the celebration.  Since 1976, ASALH extended the celebration for the entire month of February.

The organization publishes ''The [[Journal of African American History]]'' (formerly ''[[The Journal of Negro History]]''), and the ''Black History Bulletin'' (formerly the ''Negro History Bulletin'').  In 2005, ASALH established the ASALH Press, reissuing Carter G. Woodson's ''[[Mis-Education of the Negro]].'' The same year ASALH established ''The Woodson Review,'' a magazine that promotes its Annual Black History Theme, including it as part of its Black History Kit.  In 2005, ASALH discovered a previously unpublished manuscript by its founder, Carter G. Woodson, and published it in a special edition as ''Carter G. Woodson's Appeal: The Lost Manuscript Edition.''

ASALH is a membership organization with over twenty-five branches.

==ASALH Conventions==
Annually the organization strives to continue its research focus as well as efforts to share and disseminate historical information—for which the organization was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Mjagkij, N, ''Organizing Black America'', pg 69. Kindle Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the major ways the organization focuses it resources in this area is with the ASALH annual convention that takes place in the fall (usually September or October.) ASALH hosted its first convention in 1917, two years after the organization was founded. At that time the convention was biennial. During the first convention Woodson stated the goals of the organization as he saw them. ‘The organization primary responsibilities would be the publishing of an historical magazine, researching the achievements of Negros, directing a home study program along with writing and publishing books and monographs. Charles Harris Wesley, one of the organization’s early developers, was not pleased with the first convention because more race solvers and educators attended than historians, which is in opposition to ASALH’s vision as an historical research society.’&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J: “Woodson and Wesley: A Partnership in Building the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History”, ''The Journal of Negro History'', 83(98): 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the location of the convention rotates to a major US city and coincides with the annual black history theme. The 2008 convention took place in Birmingham, AL and the 2009 convention took place in Cincinnati, OH. the 2010 convention was held in Raleigh, NC and the 2011 conference was held in Richmond, VA. The 2012 convention will be held from September 26- September 30 in Pittsburgh, PA.  According to the Association, the annual convention draws over 1,000 participants.

At the convention ASALH organizes plenary sessions and workshops, facilitates scholarly presentations selected from the “Call for Papers,” sponsors a black history tour of famous landmarks in the city, and hosts a youth day for high school students in the area.

===Derived organizations===
Numerous organizations have risen out of the ASALH conventions. One such example is the Association of Black Women Historians (ABWH) founded at the 1977 ASALH convention in Washington, D.C. ABWH was founded by three women participants, Rosalyn Terbong-Penn, Eleanor Smith, and Elizabeth Parker.&lt;ref&gt;Mjagkij, N, ''Organizing Black America'', p. 70. Kindle Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Council of Black Studies was also conceptualized at an ASALH convention.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Balcón de Montezuma''', also known as "Balcon del Chiue" ({{IPA-es|balˈkon de monteˈsuma}}) is an [[archaeological site]] located at the Alta Cumbre ''[[ejido]]'', some {{convert|18|km|mi|1}} south of [[Ciudad Victoria]], in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[México]]. It is situated about one kilometer north of [[List of Mexican Federal Highways|Highway 101]], towards [[San Luis Potosí]].

This Huastec site is located some {{convert|203|km|mi|1}} north-west from the [[Las Flores (archaeological site)|Las Flores]] Huastec archaeological site.

==Background==
According to paleontological and archaeological records, the earliest settlements in Tamaulipas are dated to twelve thousand years before the Christian era, and are identified in the so-called "complex Devil", in allusion to a Canyon of the Sierra of Tamaulipas. Later, at the Tropic of cancer level, are the first manifestations of native civilization, linked to the discovery and domestication of corn and thus to the beginning of agricultural life and the grouping of permanent settlements. As a result, in this period began to appear manifestations of Mesoamerican cultures in this region.

Before the arrival of the Spanish invaders, the Tamaulipas territory was occupied by various ethnic groups, one of them were the [[Wastek]]s. [[Américo Vespucio]], famous Italian cartographer aftero whom the American continent was named, visited the Tamaulipas territory at the end of the 16th century and in his correspondence with Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco mentioned that the natives called the territory "lariab". During colonial times was known by other names: "Kingdom Guasteca, province of Amichel and Earth Garayana, Pánuco province, Comarca of Paul, Alifau and Ocinan, Magdalena Medanos and "New Santander". The current name comes from the founding "Tamaholipa" by Fray [[Andrés de Olmos]] in 1544.

In Tamaulipas, the Huastecs settled primarily along the lower basin of the Guayalejo River-Tamesí and in mountain valleys of Tanguanchín (Ocampo) and Tammapul (Tula). Politically they did not seem to constitute a State, but rather a series of Lordships. They were skilled craftsmen and possessed a complex religious cosmogony, insomuch that in the Huasteca emerged the concept of the Quetzalcoatl deity. As a culture located in a peripheral area of nuclear Mesoamerica, they held a long autonomy until in the late postclassical period the [[Aztecs|Mexicas]] subjected them to their domain to a portion of the Huasteca.

Other Huastec settlements with a great constructive work, are evident in the Balcón de Montezuma, an archaeological site located in the vicinity of the present capital of the State.

The Huastec culture large geographical development above is evident by the many sites scattered throughout the almost impenetrable mountains, as it is the case of the Sabinito, an interesting site currently in research, which speaks of an organized society of Mesoamerican type. However, there is evidence that during the postclassical period this cultural model was depleted, leaving the sierra inhabited by various groups of farmers, but of a lesser civilization level.

===Cultural development===
In the Tamaulipas sierras, three mesoamerican related archaeological phases are present; Laguna, Eslabones and Salta, covering a chronological period from 650 BCE to 1000 CE.&lt;ref name=Visit&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had an initial cultural Pantheon defined by a constant evolution and the emergence of scattered villages between the sierra that concentrated up to 400 homes located around squares and platforms; and small circular base structures. But it was around 500 CE when this culture reached its peak, to expand urban concentrations up to a thousand houses, which formed villages in the peaks of the hills, with a central core of small pyramids. Simple urban planning suggests the existence of a possibly theocratic and centralized government, and pottery indicate trade with the nuclear area of Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name=Visit    /&gt;

===The Huastecs===
[[Image:HuastecRoute.jpg|thumb|500px|'''Fig. 1.''' Approximate routes and dates of the proto-Huastec and other Maya-speaking groups]]
The '''Huastec''', also known as '''Huaxtec''', '''Wastek''' and '''Huastecos''', are a [[Native American (Americas)|native group]] of [[Mexico]], historically based in the [[Mexican state|state]]s of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]], [[Veracruz]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Tamaulipas]] concentrated along the route of the [[Pánuco River]] and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The ancient [[Huastec civilization|Huastec culture]] is thought to date back to approximately the 10th century BCE, although their most productive period of civilization is usually considered to be the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic era]] between the fall of [[Teotihuacan]] and the rise of the [[Aztec]] Empire. The Huastecs constructed temples on [[Mesoamerican pyramid|step-pyramid]]s, carved independently-standing sculptures, and produced elaborately painted pottery.

The Huastecs attained an important culture and built cities, yet usually wore no clothing. They were admired for their abilities as musicians by other [[Mesoamerica]]n peoples.

The Huastecs arrived in northern Mesoamerica between 1500 BCE&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; and 900 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Stresser-Pean&lt;/ref&gt;  The linguistic evidence is corroborated by archaeological discoveries.  In 1954, [[Richard Stockton MacNeish]] found ceramics and figurines from the mid-preclassical (Formative) period, called "Pavon de Panuco" in the Panuco River sites of the Huasteca, which resemble preclassical period objects from [[Uaxactun]], a [[Petén Basin|Petén]]-region [[List of Maya sites|Maya site]].&lt;ref&gt;Ochoa, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  A date not earlier than 1100 BCE for the Huastecs’ arrival at their present location seems most likely, since they probably did not arrive at the north-central Veracruz site of Santa Luisa until about 1200 BCE, the phase at the end of the early preclassical period known locally as the "Ojite phase".&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 897&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts of the period include Panuco-like basalt ''manos'' and ''metates''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 892&lt;/ref&gt;  The Huastecs remained in Santa Luisa, located east of Papantla near the Gulf coast, until supplanted or absorbed by the Totonacs around 1000 CE.

===Huastec language===
The '''Wastek''' or '''Huastec''' language is a [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] language of Mexico, spoken by the [[Huastec people|Huastec]]s. Though relatively isolated from them, it is related to the Mayan languages spoken further south and east in Mexico and Central America.

The language is called '''Teenek''' (with varying spellings) by its speakers, and this name has gained currency in Mexican national and international usage in recent years.

The now-extinct [[Chicomuceltec language]] is believed to have been most closely related to Wastek.

The first linguistic description of the Huastec language accessible to Europeans was written by [[Andrés de Olmos]], who also wrote the first grammatical descriptions of [[Nahuatl]] and [[Totonacan Languages|Totonac]].

[[Image:Huasteca.png|thumb|left|Approximate extent of Wastek-speaking area in Mexico]]

===Toponymy===
The name '''Tamaulipas''' ({{IPA-es|tamauˈlipas}}) is probably derived from '''Tamaholipa''', a [[Wastek language|Huastec]] term in which the ''tam-'' prefix signifies "place where." As yet, there is no scholarly agreement on the meaning of ''holipa'', the native population of Tamaulipas, now extinct, was referred to as the "Olives"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Tamaulipas probably means "Montes Altos" (high hills). Another version states that means "Place of olives", natives originating in Florida, USA.&lt;ref name=Enci   &gt;{{cite web |title=Tamaulipas y Tampico  |url=  http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_tamaulipas |publisher=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |language= Spanish |trans-title=|accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site Investigation===
This site was explored and restored between 1989 and 1990, by archaeologist Jesus Nárez. Based on the research, it is known that ancient houses found at the site—hut style with palm roofs—were built on top of the circular bases while their dead was buried under the floors. In the 1980s numerous human skeletal remains were found, both children and adults.&lt;ref name="arts&amp;history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=14102009125544|title=Work continued at Balcón de Montezuma|publisher=Arts &amp; History|language=Spanish|accessdate=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balcón de Montezuma is representative of small farming villages of the sierra that originated in the Late Classic period (600–900 CE) of Mesoamerican chronology.

==The site==
This site represents a village (400–1200[[Common Era|CE]]) composed of around 90 circular bases distributed in two plazas; and is located in the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] range, at an altitude of {{convert|1200|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="arts&amp;history"/&gt;

The site contains vestiges and architectonic styles of human groups that inhabited the Sierra Madre Oriental ([[Sierra Gorda]]) region and the [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]], whose culture and the [[Mesoamerica]]n profile shares features of the [[Huastec culture]] and the Southwestern United States.&lt;ref name="INAH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za02301.html |title=Balcón de Montezuma Official Web Page|publisher=[[INAH]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that so far no representations of their gods has been found, nor it is known if any of the buildings functioned as temples. The original entrance to the site was via a large stairway of more than 80 steps located on the western hillside; it was built as an adaptation to natural limestone hill protrusions.&lt;ref name="INAH"/&gt;

==Structures==
The site comprises more than 70 circular structures of different diameters and heights grouped into two small semi-circular plazas. These bases were built with limestone, overlaid without mortar, the core is made up of dirt, small stones and pottery remains. The site displays unique characteristics, such as a small stairway with 3 to 4 steps, recessed or superimposed, with a fan-shaped base. It is thought that the bases were houses circular foundations, with ''bajareque'' walls and palm leaf roofs.

The archaeological remains have traces of stone slabs paved surfaces.

Archaeological material found at the site revealed practices of its people such as smoking pipes, using crystal quartz – perhaps as amulets-, necklaces, stone disks and burial of the dead under the floor of the House, accompanied by ceramic offerings.&lt;ref name="INAH"/&gt;

{{wiktionary}}
'''Bimbo''' is a slang term for a well-built, attractive, somewhat dim woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Tom Dalzell]] | entry=bimbo | title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English | publisher=Routledge | year=2009 | page=75 | isbn=978-0-415-37182-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally used in the [[United States]] as early as 1919 for an unintelligent or brutish male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663824301|title=Oxford dictionary of word origins|others=Cresswell, Julia, 1950-, Oxford University Press.|isbn=0199547939|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=663824301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the early 21st century, the "stereotypical bimbo" appearance became that of an attractive woman, often blond and with a curvaceous figure and large breasts, possibly wearing heavy makeup and revealing clothing. It is also associated with "the [[dumb blonde]]" stereotype.&lt;ref name=eh149&gt;''Encyclopedia of Hair'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q=dumb&amp;f=false pp. 149-151]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The word bimbo derives itself from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''bimbo'',&lt;ref name=Etymonline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bimbo&amp;searchmode=none|title=Etymonline|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a masculine-[[Grammatical gender|gender]] term that means "(male) baby" or "young (male) child" (the feminine form of the Italian word is ''bimba''). Use of this term began in the [[United States]] as early as 1919, and was a slang word used to describe an unintelligent&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary, 1919"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; or brutish&lt;ref name="Slang of 1920s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://local.aaca.org/bntc/slang/slang.htm|title=Slang of 1920s|accessdate=23 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618074534/http://local.aaca.org/bntc/slang/slang.htm|archivedate=18 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; man, like in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

It was not until the 1920s that the term bimbo first began to be associated with females. In 1920, [[Frank Crumit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/FrankCrumit|title=My Little Bimbo Down on the Bamboo Isle|first=|last=Frank Crumit|date=20 October 2016|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billy Jones (1930s singer)|Billy Jones]], and [[Aileen Stanley]] all recorded versions of "My Little Bimbo Down on the Bamboo Isle", with words by [[Grant Clarke]] and music by [[Walter Donaldson]], in which the term "bimbo" is used to describe an island girl of questionable virtue. The 1929 [[silent film]] ''[[Desert Nights]]'' describes a wealthy female [[wikt:crook#Noun|crook]] as a bimbo and in ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'', an angry [[Bessie Love]] calls a chorus girl a ''bimbo''. The first use of its female meaning cited in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is dated 1929, from the scholarly journal ''American Speech'', where the definition was given simply as "a woman".

In the 1940s, bimbo was still being used to refer to both men and women, as in, for example the  comic novel ''[[Full Moon (novel)|Full Moon]]'' by [[P.G. Wodehouse]] who wrote of “bimbos who went about the place making passes at innocent girls after discarding their wives like old tubes of toothpaste”.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid Ó Muirithe, Words We Use: The Meaning of Words And Where They Come From,  Gill &amp; Macmillan Ltd, Oct 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term died out again for much of the 20th century until it became popular again in the 1980s, with political sex scandals.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Cord, The Unexpected Evolution of Language: Discover the Surprising Etymology of Everyday Words  Hayes Adams Media, Sep 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As bimbo began to be used increasingly for females, exclusively male variations of the word began to surface, like mimbo and  [[himbo]], a [[backformation]] of bimbo, which refers to an unintelligent but attractive man.&lt;ref name=Etymonline/&gt;

The term is sometimes associated with men or women who dye their hair blond, indicating that physical attractiveness is more important to them than other, non-physical traits&lt;ref name=eh149/&gt; and as an extension to "the [[dumb blonde]]" stereotype.&lt;ref name="eh149"/&gt;

==Usage in popular culture==

===Music===
*In 1953, Jim Reeves recorded the song "[[Bimbo (song)|Bimbo]]".
*In 1997, the Danish band [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]] used the word bimbo in their major hit "[[Barbie Girl]]," using the [[dumb blonde]] archetype as well ("I'm a blonde bimbo girl."). It was noted by [[Mattel]] in the legal conflict against Aqua and their record company for the representation of the popular [[Barbie doll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424996/19970912/story.jhtml |title=Aqua Now Faces Lawsuit Over "Barbie Girl" |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=12 September 1997 |accessdate=23 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224070146/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424996/19970912/story.jhtml |archivedate=24 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, the Swedish pop rock band [[Lambretta (band)|Lambretta]] released a song called "Bimbo".
*In 2012, [[Bridgit Mendler]] used the word bimbo in the song "Forgot to Laugh".
*In 2012, [[Every Time I Die]] released a song called "Underwater Bimbos from Outer Space".

===Internet===
*A beauty contest game called [[Miss Bimbo]] is an online game in which players attempt to use virtual characters to win contests, earn IQ points and impress virtual boys, through makeovers, clothing, exercise, and the purchase of operations such as [[facelift]]s and [[breast implants]]. Although the game itself does not promote such activities in real life and is often viewed as a parody, it has received condemnation in the media from parent groups, especially in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2008/03/30/2003407697|title=Parents upset over online Miss Bimbo game for children|accessdate=1 April 2008 |date= 30 March 2008|publisher=Taipei Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
*The term "'mimbo", to mean a male bimbo, was first coined in the episode "The Stall" of American sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theseinfelddictionary.com/2009/11/02/mimbo/|title=mimbo|first1=willow|last1=20|first2=2009 at 3:39 pm |last2=Reply|date=2 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of [[Elaine Benes]]'s boyfriend, Tony ([[Dan Cortese]]).
*In ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'''s [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 2)|season 2]] episode "The Storm", Gumball tells Carmen he isn't a "cheap, reliable bimbo". However, only in the United States dubbing was this word replaced with "coward" despite the closed captions exposing the word when on.

===Politics===

In American politics, the word was used in the 1990s  during [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations|Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct allegations]], leading to the invention of the term "Bimbo eruptions" to refer to  political sex scandals.&lt;ref&gt;Grant Barrett, Hatchet Jobs and Hardball: The Oxford Dictionary of American Political Slang ,  Oxford University Press, Apr 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression was also used in a 2014 report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/colin-powell-bill-clinton-bimbos-email-2016-9|title=Colin Powell wrote in an email that Bill Clinton was 'd---ing bimbos'|accessdate=29 November 2016 |date= 14 September 2016|publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Colin Powell]] explained his reluctance to vote for Hillary Clinton in light of her husband's continued affairs with "bimbos".

After the first 2015 Republican Presidential Debate, [[Donald Trump]] re-tweeted a message calling debate moderator and Fox News host [[Megyn Kelly]] a "bimbo" via Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/07/donald-trump-late-night-angry-tweets-megyn-kelly-and-it-is-epic/|title=Donald Trump late-night angry-tweets Megyn Kelly, and it is epic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''calligram''' is a text visually arranged in a way that it forms an image associated with the text's contents. It can be a [[Poetry|poem]], a phrase, a portion of [[scripture]], or a single word; the visual arrangement can rely on certain use of the [[typeface]], [[calligraphy]] or [[handwriting]], for instance along non-parallel and curved text lines, or in shaped paragraphs. The image created by the words illustrates the text by expressing visually what it says, or something closely associated; it can also, on purpose, show something contradictory with the text or otherwise misleading.

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]] was a famous calligram writer and author of a book of poems called ''[[Calligrammes]]''.

'''Calvert Watkins''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈwɒtkɪnz/]]; March 13, 1933 – March 20, 2013) was an American [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Philology|philologist]], known for his book ''[[How to Kill a Dragon]]''. He was [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[linguistics]] and the [[classics]] at [[Harvard University]] and later went to serve as professor-in-residence at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Early Life ==

=== Family ===
Calvert Watkins was born in [[Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] on March 13, 1933 to Ralph James Watkins, an [[economist]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2013|title=In Memoriam: Calvert Watkins|url=https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Melchert/inmemoriamcalvertwatkins.pdf|journal=The Journal of Indo-European Studies|volume=51|pages=506-526|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and government advisor,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dbcs.rutgers.edu/all-scholars/9203-watkins-calvert-ward|title=WATKINS, Calvert Ward|last=Gordon|first=Laura|website=Departmental Web Site Template {{!}} Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Willye Ward, a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] teacher who translated the personal memoirs of former Mexican president Gen.

Watkins, Translated Memoirs of Mexican President|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-10-07|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Watkins's childhood was spent in [[New York City]], and he graduated from [[Friends Seminary]] in [[Manhattan]] before beginning his career at Harvard University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Watkins's early exposure to Latin and Greek inspired him at the age of fifteen to decide to become an [[Indo-European studies|Indo-Europeanist]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Education ===
Watkins received his initial undergraduate degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1954, graduating [[Latin honors|summa cum laude]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in Linguistics in 1959.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/03/calvert-watkins-dies-at-80/|title=Calvert Watkins dies at 80|date=2013-03-28|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], Watkins also studied abroad at the [[École pratique des hautes études|École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in [[Paris]], France from 1954 to 1955 as well as the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]], School of Celtic Studies from 1957 to 1958.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Harvard ===
In 1959, Watkins was initially appointed the position of instructor at [[Harvard University]]. He would go on to become assistant professor in 1960, associate professor with tenure in 1962, and full professor in 1966.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1989 Watkins was appointed to the position of Victor. S Thomas Professor of Linguistics and Classics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Linguists influenced by Watkins during his tenure at Harvard include Goddard, Jasanoff, D. Gary Miller, [[Michael Silverstein]], [[Alice Harris (linguist)|Alice Harris]], [[Craig Melchert|H. Craig Melchert]], [[Alan Nussbaum]], Brent Vine, [[Mark Hale]], [[Andrew Garrett (linguist)|Andrew Garrett]], Joshua Katz and Benjamin Fortson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Brian D.|date=2000|title=Review of “Mír Cuirad: Studies in Honor of Calvert Watkins” by Jay Jasanoff, H.

Watkins remained dedicated to the research and development of historical linguistics throughout his entire academic and professional career. In 1982 he was a founding member of the "East Coast Indo-European Conference" in which he participated in a large majority of it's annual meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== University of California, Los Angeles ===
Upon his retirement from Harvard in 2003, Watkins moved to Los Angeles, California and began teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles alongside his wife, Stephanie Jamison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Watkins would continue to promote the importance of historical linguistics at UCLA by remaining active in the annual UCLA Indo-European Conference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2013, the 25th annual conference was dedicated to the memory of Watkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamison|first=Stephanie W.|last2=Melchert|first2=H. Craig|last3=Vine|first3=Brent|date=2014|title=Remembrance of Calvert Watkins|url=http://www.academia.edu/16032340/Remembrance_of_Calvert_Watkins|journal=Proceedings of the 25th Annual UCLA Indo-European Conference|volume=|pages=1-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Published Works ===
His doctoral dissertation at [[Harvard University]], ''Indo-European Origins of the Celtic Verb I''. ''The Sigmatic Aorist'' (Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1962), which deeply reflected the [[Structural linguistics|structuralist]] approach of [[Jerzy Kuryłowicz]], opened a fresh era of creative work in [[Celtic language|Celtic]] [[comparative linguistics]] and the study of the verbal system of [[Indo-European languages]].

Watkins, in a sense, completed his contribution to this area with his ''Indogermanische Grammatik'', vol. 3, part 1: ''Geschichte der indogermanischen Verbalflexion'' (1969). Meanwhile, his work on Indo-European vocabulary and poetics yielded a large number of articles on (among others) [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] material, presented directly in his ''Selected Writings'' and indirectly in his book, ''How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).

He contributed his expertise on [[Indo-European languages]] to the first edition of ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' and edited ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots''({{ISBN|0-618-08250-6}}).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== ''How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics'' ===
''[[How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics]]'' was published on November 16, 1995 through [[Oxford University Press]] and attempted to establish a formulaic method of [[Comparative (linguistics)|comparative linguistics]] which exemplified the importance of the poetic formula in order to better trace the development of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages by working backwards and identifying patterns from their mother language, Proto-Indo-European.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=William Bernard|date=1999|title=The Journal of American Folklore|url=https://ezproxy.missouriwestern.edu:2107/stable/541955?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=Vol 112, No. 444|pages=220–222|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into two main halves, the first of which acts as a definition and introduction the study of Indo-European poetics which is expanded upon by implementing Watkins' idea of the "dragon-slaying myth" and defending this concept through a number of case studies involving languages connected by a common theme.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L'Heureux|first=Marc G.|date=2016-06-16|title=Book Review of How to Kill a Dragon: aspects of Indo-European linguistics|url=https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/lingua/article/view/5633|journal=Lingua Frankly|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.6017/lf.v1i1.5633|issn=2333-6552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins expands upon the "dragon-slaying myth" in part two of the text by offering new research into his proposed formula of "HERO SLAY SERPENT"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, he also attempts to reconstruct an example of Proto-Indo-European through the comparative method of historical linguistics.

''Lingua Franca'' reviewer Marc L'Heureux commented that Watkins also implements historical evidence to favor the development of language such as the relationship between the patron and the poet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He further opined that through the ceremonious delivery from the poet, the word choices became preserved as historical evidence of the language in question. Thus the poet was not only a wielder of great power, according to Watkins as the patron's prestige was inherently tied to the poet's prowess, but a recorder of language that has allowed for research to be conducted in order to better understand the developement of ancient languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''How to Kill a Dragon'' received favorable acclaim and is now considered to be a definitive text which transformed the study of Indo-European poetics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''How to Kill a Dragon'' earned Watkins the 1998 Goodwin Award for Classical Studies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-to-kill-a-dragon-9780195144130?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#|title=How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics|date=2001-05-17|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514413-0|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''complementary distribution''', as distinct from [[contrastive distribution]] and [[free variation]], is the relationship between two different elements of the same kind in which one element is found in one set of environments and the other element is found in a non-intersecting (complementary) set of environments.

The term often indicates that two superficially-different elements are the same linguistic unit at a deeper level, though more than two elements can be in complementary distribution with one another.

==In phonology==
{{Main|Allophone}}

Complementary distribution is the distribution of phones in their respective phonetic environments in which one phone never appears in the same phonetic context as the other. When two variants are in complementary distribution, one can predict when each will occur because one can simply look at the environment in which the allophone is occurring. 

Complementary distribution is commonly applied to [[phonology]] in which similar [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] in complementary distribution are usually [[allophone]]s of the same phoneme. For instance, in English, {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[pʰ]}} are allophones of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/p/}} because they occur in complementary distribution.   {{IPA|[pʰ]}} always occurs when it is the [[syllable onset]] and followed by a [[lexical stress|stressed]] [[vowel]] (as in the word '''''p'''in''). {{IPA|[p]}} occurs in all other situations (as in the word ''s'''p'''in'').

There are cases of elements being in complementary distribution but not being considered allophones. For example, English {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} are in complementary distribution: {{IPA|[h]}} occurs only at the beginning of a syllable and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} only at the end. However, because they have so little in common in phonetic terms, they are still considered separate phonemes.
&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to Language'' by Victoria Fromkin&lt;/ref&gt;

==In morphology==
{{Main|Allomorph}}

The concept of complementary distribution is applied in the analysis of word forms ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]). Two different word forms ([[allomorph]]s) can actually be different "faces" of one and the same word ([[morpheme]]). An example is the English indefinite articles ''a'' and ''an''. The usages ''an aardvark'' and ''a bear'' are grammatical, but the usages ''*a aardvark'' and ''*an bear'' are ungrammatical (as is marked with "*" in linguistics).

:The form ''an'' is used before a word that begins with a vowel sound.
:That can be notated as "__ V".

:The form ''a'' is used before a word beginning with a consonant sound.
:That can be notated as "__ C".

:The "distribution" (usage according to environments) of the forms ''an'' and ''a'' is "complementary" because of three factors:
:(1) ''an'' is used if ''a'' is not used;
:(2) ''a'' is used if ''an'' is not used;
:(3) both environments together cover every legitimate potential environment for the word.

The forms ''an'' and ''a'' work together like a team and take care of every instance (environment) in which the English indefinite article is used, i.e. there are two different "forms" of the same "word" instead of two different words.

'''Detransitioning''' is the process of changing one's [[Gender expression|gender presentation]] and/or [[sex characteristics]] back to one's [[assigned sex]], following an earlier [[transgender transition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detransitioning: Going From Male To Female To Male Again|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/lgbt/detransitioning-male-female-male-again/|website=Vocativ|accessdate=1 September 2017|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detransitioning is also termed '''retransitioning'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transitioning Back To One’s Assigned Sex At Birth|url=http://transadvocate.com/transitioning-back-to-ones-assigned-sex-at-birth_n_9946.htm|website=The TransAdvocate|accessdate=1 September 2017 |language=en|date=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinician experiences==
A review of more than 100 international medical studies of post-operative transsexuals by the [[University of Birmingham]] found no robust scientific evidence that sex reassignment surgery is clinically effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/30/health.mentalhealth|work=[[The Guardian]]|title = Sex changes are not effective, say researchers }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some studies find that sex reassignment surgery improves the quality of life of most of those who undergo it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van de Grift |first1=Tim C. |last2=Elaut |first2=Els |last3=Cerwenka |first3=Susanne C. |last4=Cohen-Kettenis |first4=Peggy T. |last5=Kreukels |first5=Baudewijntje P.

Genital reconstructive surgeon [[Miroslav Đorđević|Miroslav Dordevic]] said that some [[transgender]] people regret having undergone the procedure and want to detransition. He said that this is particularly so for [[transgender women]] over 30,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/transgender-women-transgender-men-sex-change-sex-reassignment-surgery-676777  |title=Transgender surgery: regret rates highest in male-to-female reassignment operations |author=Borreli, Lizette|date=3 October 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dordevic"&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/the-new-taboo-more-people-regret-sex-change-and-want-to-detransition-surgeon-says | title =The new taboo: More people regret sex change and want to ‘detransition’, surgeon says  | last =Shute  | first =Joe  | date =2 October 2017  | website =[[National Post]]  | publisher =Postmedia  | access-date =1 November 2017  | quote =Dr [[Miroslav Đorđević|Miroslav Ðordevic]] says more people, particularly transgender women over 30, are asking for reversal surgery, yet their regrets remain taboo. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is a "taboo" in talking about issues relating to "regret".&lt;ref name = "Dordevic"/&gt;

In August 2017, the Philadelphia-based [[Mazzoni Center]]'s Trans Health Conference, which is an annual meeting of transgender people, advocates, and health care providers, canceled a panel discussion on detransitioning.  The conference organisers said, "When a topic becomes controversial, such as this one has turned on social media, there is a duty to make sure that the debate does not get out of control at the conference itself. After several days of considerations and reviewing feedback, the planning committee voted that the workshops, while valid, cannot be presented at the conference as planned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mazzonicenter.org/blog/response-cancellation-workshops  |title=Response to the cancellation of workshops |author=|date=29 August 2017|work=[[Mazzoni Center]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2017, [[Bath Spa University]]  refused permission for James Caspian, a counsellor who specialises in transgender therapy, to undertake research relating to people who had decided to reverse their gender reassignment operations. Caspian alleged that the reason for the refusal was that it was, "a potentially politically incorrect piece of research [which] carries a risk to the university".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41384473  |title=Bath Spa University 'blocks transgender research' |author=|date=25 September 2017|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/25/bath-spa-university-transgender-gender-reassignment-reversal-research |title=University 'turned down politically incorrect transgender research' |author=Weale, Sally|date=26 September 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public and professional opinions==
It is asserted that there is a lack of legal, medical and psychological assistance for those seeking to detransition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thefederalist.com/2017/11/16/three-transgenders-celebrate-election-victories-detransitioners-tell-different-story/  |title=While Three Transgenders Celebrate Election Victories, Detransitioners Tell A Different Story |author= Walt Heyer|work=[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]]|date=16 November 2017 |accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Distort}}
'''Distortion''' is the alteration of the original shape (or other characteristic) of something.  In [[communications]] and [[electronics]] it means the alteration of the [[waveform]] of an information-bearing [[signal]], such as an [[audio signal]] representing sound or a [[video signal]] representing images, in an electronic device or [[communication channel]]. Distortion is usually unwanted, and so engineers strive to eliminate or minimize it.  In some situations, however, distortion may be desirable.  For example, in [[FM broadcasting]] and [[noise reduction]] systems like the [[Dolby noise reduction|Dolby system]], an audio signal is deliberately distorted in ways that emphasize aspects of the signal that are subject to [[electrical noise]], then it is symmetrically "undistorted" after passing through a noisy communication channel, reducing the noise in the signal.  Distortion is also used as a [[Distortion (music)|musical effect]], particularly with electric guitars.

The addition of [[Electronic noise|noise]] or other outside signals ([[mains hum|hum]], [[interference (communication)|interference]]) is not considered distortion, though the effects of [[quantization distortion]] are sometimes included in noise. A quality measure that explicitly reflects both the noise and the distortion is the [[signal-to-noise-and-distortion]] (SINAD) ratio.

==Electronic signals==
[[File:Distorted waveforms square sine.svg|353px|thumb|right|Graph of a waveform and some distorted versions of the same waveform]]

In [[telecommunication]] and [[signal processing]], a noise-free [[system]] can be characterised by a [[transfer function]], such that the output &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a function of the input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = F(x(t))&lt;/math&gt;

When the transfer function comprises only a perfect [[gain (electronics)|gain]] constant ''A'' and perfect [[propagation delay|delay]] ''T''

: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = A\cdot x(t-T)&lt;/math&gt;

the output is undistorted. Distortion occurs when the transfer function ''F'' is more complicated than this. If ''F'' is a [[linear function]], for instance a filter whose gain and/or delay varies with frequency, the signal suffers linear distortion. Linear distortion does not introduce new frequency components to a signal but does alter the balance of existing ones.

This diagram shows the behaviour of a signal (made up of a [[square wave]] followed by a [[sine wave]]) as it is passed through various distorting functions.

# The first trace (in black) shows the input.  It also shows the output from a non-distorting transfer function (straight line).
# A [[high-pass filter]] (green trace) distorts the shape of a square wave by reducing its low frequency components.  This is the cause of the "droop" seen on the top of the pulses. This "pulse distortion" can be very significant when a train of pulses must pass through an AC-coupled (high-pass filtered) amplifier. As the sine wave contains only one frequency, its shape is unaltered.
# A [[low-pass filter]] (blue trace) rounds the pulses by removing the high frequency components. All systems are low pass to some extent. Note that the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the sine wave is different for the lowpass and the highpass cases, due to the phase distortion of the filters.
# A slightly [[non-linear]] transfer function (purple), this one gently compresses the peaks of the sine wave, as may be typical of a tube audio amplifier. This generates small amounts of low order harmonics.
# A hard-[[Clipping (audio)|clipping]] transfer function (red) generates high order harmonics. Parts of the transfer function are flat, which indicates that all information about the input signal has been lost in this region.

The transfer function of an ideal amplifier, with perfect gain and delay, is only an approximation. The true behavior of the system is usually different. [[Nonlinear]]ities in the transfer function of an [[active device]] (such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[operational amplifier]]s) are a common source of non-linear distortion; in passive [[electronic component|components]] (such as a [[coaxial cable]] or [[optical fiber]]), linear distortion can be caused by inhomogeneities, [[Reflection (electrical)|reflections]], and so on in the [[wave propagation|propagation]] path.

===Amplitude distortion===
{{Main|Amplitude distortion}}
{{See also|Clipping (signal processing)}}
Amplitude distortion is distortion occurring in a system, subsystem, or device when the output amplitude is not a linear function of the input amplitude under specified conditions.

===Harmonic distortion===
Harmonic distortion adds [[overtone]]s that are [[Integer|whole number]] multiples of a sound wave's frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Harmonic distortion may be expressed in terms of the relative strength of individual components, in [[decibel]]s, or the [[root mean square]] of all harmonic components: [[Total harmonic distortion]] (THD), as a percentage. The level at which harmonic distortion becomes  audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion.  Different types of distortion (like [[crossover distortion]]) are more audible than others (like [[soft clipping]]) even if the THD measurements are identical.  Harmonic distortion in [[radio frequency]] applications is rarely expressed as THD.

===Frequency response distortion===
{{See also|Frequency response}}
Non-flat frequency response is a form of distortion that occurs when different frequencies are amplified by different amounts in a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]. For example, the non-uniform frequency response curve of AC-coupled [[cascade amplifier]] is an example of frequency distortion. In the audio case, this is mainly caused by room acoustics, poor loudspeakers and microphones, long loudspeaker cables in combination with frequency dependent loudspeaker [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], etc.

===Phase distortion===
{{Main|Phase distortion}}
This form of distortion mostly occurs due to [[electrical reactance]]. Here, all the components of the input signal are not amplified with the same phase shift, hence making some parts of the output signal out of phase with the rest of the output.

===Group delay distortion===
Can be found only in [[dispersion (optics)|dispersive media]]. In a [[waveguide]], [[phase velocity]] varies with frequency. In a filter, group delay tends to peak near the [[cut-off frequency]], resulting in pulse distortion.  When analog long distance trunks were commonplace, for example in [[12 channel carrier]], group delay distortion had to be corrected in [[repeaters]].

==Correction of distortion==
As the system output is given by y(t) = F(x(t)), then if the inverse function F&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; can be found, and used intentionally to distort either the input or the output of the system, then the distortion is corrected.

An example of a similar correction is where LP/[[gramophone record|vinyl]] recordings or [[FM broadcasting|FM audio]] transmissions are deliberately pre-emphasised by a [[linear filter]], the reproducing system applies an inverse filter to make the overall system undistorted.

Correction is not possible if the inverse does not exist—for instance if the [[transfer function]] has flat spots (the inverse would map multiple input points to a single output point). This produces an uncorrectable loss of information. Such a situation can occur when an amplifier is overdriven—causing [[clipping (audio)|clipping]] or [[slew rate]] distortion when, for a moment, the amplifier characteristics alone and not the input signal determine the output.

===Cancellation of even-order harmonic distortion===
Many symmetrical [[electronic circuits]] reduce the magnitude of even harmonics generated by the non-linearities of the amplifier's components, by combining two signals from opposite halves of the circuit where distortion components that are roughly the same magnitude but out of phase.  Examples include [[Push–pull output|push-pull amplifiers]] and [[long-tailed pair]]s.

==Teletypewriter or modem signaling==
In binary [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] such as [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]], distortion is the shifting of the significant instants of the signal pulses from their proper positions relative to the beginning of the start [[pulse]]. The magnitude of the distortion is expressed in percent of an ideal unit [[pulse]] length. This is sometimes called 'bias' distortion.

Telegraphic distortion is a similar older problem, distorting the ratio between "mark" and "space" intervals.  [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3725787.html]

==Distortion in art==
In the art world, a distortion is any change made by an artist to the size, shape or visual character of a form to express an idea, convey a feeling or enhance visual impact. Often referred to as "abstraction," examples of distortion include "[[The Weeping Woman]]" by Picasso and "[[The Adoration of the Shepherds (El Greco)|The Adoration of the Shepherds]]" by El Greco.

{{Listen|filename=Distortion_effect.ogg|title=Distorted waveforms|description=An audio example of a short sample followed by different distorted versions of it.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In this context, distortion refers to any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually [[Clipping (music)|clipping]], [[harmonic distortion]], or [[intermodulation distortion]] ([[Mixing (physics)|mixing]] phenomena) caused by [[non-linear]] behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Audio Electronics by John Linsley Hood; page 162&lt;/ref&gt; Terms for specific types of nonlinear audio distortion include: [[crossover distortion]], [[slew-Induced Distortion]] (SID) and [[Intermodulation#Intermodulation in audio applications|transient intermodulation]] (TIM).

[[Distortion (music)|Distortion in music]] is often [[Tube sound#Intentional distortion|intentionally used as an effect]] when applied to an [[electric guitar]] signal in styles of [[rock music]] such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk rock]] (see also [[overdrive (music)|overdrive]] and [[distortion synthesis]]). Other forms of audio distortion that may be referred to are non-flat [[frequency response]], [[audio level compression|compression]], [[modulation]], [[aliasing]], [[quantization noise]], [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]] from analog  media such as [[vinyl records]] and [[magnetic tape]]. The human ear cannot hear [[phase distortion]], except that it may affect the [[stereo imaging]]. (See also: [[Audio system measurements]].)

In most fields, distortion is characterized as unwanted change to a signal.{{clear}}

==Optics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Angle of view]] --&gt;
{{Main|Distortion (optics)}}

In [[optics]], image/optical distortion is a divergence from [[rectilinear projection]] caused by a change in [[magnification]] with increasing distance from the [[optical axis]] of an optical system.

==Map projections==
{{Main|Map projection}}

In [[cartography]], a distortion is the misrepresentation of the area or shape of a feature. The [[Mercator projection]], for example, distorts by exaggerating the size of regions at high [[latitude]].

'''Eastern Pomo''', also known as '''Clear Lake Pomo''', is a nearly extinct [[Pomoan languages|Pomoan]] language spoken around [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]] in [[Lake County, California]] by one of the [[Pomo people]]s.

It is not mutually intelligible with the other Pomoan languages. Prior to contact with Europeans, it was spoken along the northern and southern shores of [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]] to the north of [[San Francisco]], and in the coast mountains west of [[Sacramento Valley]]. Eastern Pomo shared borders in the north with the [[Patwin language|Patwin]] and the [[Yuki language|Yuki]] languages, in the south with the [[Lake Wappo]], the [[Wappo]], the [[Southeastern Pomo]], the [[Southern Pomo]], the [[Central Pomo]], the [[Northern Pomo]], and the [[Lake Miwok]]. They also shared a border to the west with the Northern Pomo.

The southern and northern areas in which Eastern Pomo was spoken were geographically separate, and apparently represented differing dialects,split by certain lexical and phonological differences. Contemporary Eastern Pomo speakers refer to the north shore [[dialect]] area as [[Upper Lake, California|Upper Lake]], and the south shore dialect area as Big Valley.

== Usage ==
A documentation project for the language, which had not been written down, started in 2003 at the [[Big Valley Rancheria]].&lt;ref name=Kelsey&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Big Valley Rancheria
| accessdate = 2012-09-17

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, 59-year-old Loretta Kelsey was the one remaining Elem Pomo speaker, or "language keeper". A podcast interview is available which features Kelsey speaking the language. Although Kelsey is teaching younger speakers, it is not clear whether the language can be maintained based on her knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Eastern Pomo has five [[vowel]]s, which all occur both [[Vowel length|short and long]]. The vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} are all [[Roundedness|unrounded vowel]]s (respectively [[Close vowel|high]], [[Mid vowel|mid]], and [[Low vowel|low]]), and the vowels {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} are rounded vowels (high and mid, respectively). In many linguistic descriptions of Eastern Pomo, [[Americanist phonetic notation]] is used, and a mid-dot represents long vowels: '''a· e· i· o· u·'''.

There are no occasions in Eastern Pomo where multiple vowels appear in sequence within the same syllable. There is one occasion where two vowels are in sequence across a syllable boundary, and that is in the word {{IPA|/tʃéː.al/}}, meaning 'toward where' or 'whither.' Also, vowels do not occur word-initially in Eastern Pomo.

Eastern Pomo has thirty-eight consonants. The voiceless plosives have a three-way distinction for each [[Place of articulation|point of articulation]]: unaspirated (plain), aspirated, and ejective. The plosives also distinguish between [[Laminal consonant|lamino]]-[[Dental consonant|dental]] and [[Apical consonant|apico]]-[[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] points of articulation for each series, transcribed {{IPA|/t̪ t̪ʰ t̪ʼ/}} and {{IPA|/t̺ t̺ʰ t̺ʼ/}} respectively. {{IPA|/tʃ/}} is pronounced as an affricate, {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, in word-initial position, and as a voiceless [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] plosive, {{IPA|[c]}}, in word-medial position. {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] pre-palatal fricative, while {{IPA|/s/}} represents {{IPA|[s̺]}}, an apico-alveolar fricative, with a slightly [[Retroflex consonant|retroflexed]] tongue tip. In linguistic publications using [[Americanist phonetic notation]] the alveolar plosive series is distinguished from the dental one with the addition of under-dots: '''ṭ ṭʰ ṭ’'''; the palatal consonants {{IPA|/tʃ tʃʰ tʃʼ ʃ/}} are written '''č čʰ č’ š'''; the alveolar affricates {{IPA|/ts tsʰ tsʼ/}} are written '''c cʰ c’'''; and the voiceless nasals, semivowels, and liquid are written using capital letters: '''M N W Y L'''.

There are a number of restrictions on the distribution of the various phonemes. {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} are relatively rare in Eastern Pomo. Voiceless unaspirated (plain) stops; voiced stops; voiceless nasals, semi-vowels, and voiceless {{IPA|/l̥/}}; and the fricative {{IPA|/h/}} never occur in word-final position. {{IPA|/x/}} never occurs before {{IPA|/i/}}, and very rarely before {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. {{IPA|/h/}} only occurs at the beginning of syllables, and only occurs word-initially before {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} in words borrowed from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The voiceless nasals don't occur before the vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.&lt;ref&gt;McLendon 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The various pronunciations of the [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]] {{IPA|/r/}} are complex. Syllable-finally, it as a voiced alveolar trill, {{IPA|[r]}}, though word-finally, it has a fricative release. Word-medially, it is a voiced alveolar [[Flap consonant|flap]], {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. It is more frequently found initially in unstressed syllables than in stressed syllables, and occurs most commonly in syllable- and word-final position.

===Syllable Structure===

The most common syllable structure used is a two-syllable form, CV:CV(:)(C)(C), with primary stress on the second syllable (where "C" represents a consonant, "V" represents a vowel, ":" represents vowel length, and items enclosed in parentheses indicate that the position is optionally filled). An example of this is {{IPA|/biːt̺ʼéːmkʰ/}}, "maggots to move around on something; many blackbirds to be in a field." In word-medial position, the syllable boundary falls before the final consonant in a sequence. For example, the structure [CV(:)(C)(C)(:)] is used for non-final syllables in words. Non-final syllables in words will end in C, CC, C:, or CC: only if another syllable beginning with a consonant follows. Word-final syllables can take the shape CV:CC.

The following words illustrate possible syllable shapes for words in Eastern Pomo: 
*'''CV''' : {{IPA|/ká/}} 'house'
*'''CV:''' : {{IPA|/káː/}} 'for one to sit'
*'''CVC''' : {{IPA|/kál/}} 'to the house'
*'''CV:C''' : {{IPA|/káːm/}} 'stay, remain sitting!'
*'''CVCC''' : {{IPA|/dójkʼ/}} 'several each to grind with mortar and pestle'
*'''CV:CC''' : {{IPA|/xéːlkʼ/}} 'stretch'
*'''CV:CV''' : {{IPA|/muːká/}} 'wild wheat, any grain'
*'''CV:CV:''' : {{IPA|/maːkáː/}} 'look, search for something or someone'
*'''CV:CVCC''' : {{IPA|/maːt̺ʰinkʰ/}} 'to massage, press certain part of body with feet'
*'''CV:CV:CC''' : {{IPA|/biːt̺ʼéːmkʰ/}} 'maggots to move around on something; many blackbirds to be in a field'

Vowels do not occur in sequence (VV) within a syllable, nor across syllable boundaries. Sequences of two or more consonants within a syllable only occur at the end of a syllable, not initially. For example, {{IPA|/pʰorkʰ/}}, 'knock something (as acorns, fruit) off something (as tree)', shows a two consonant cluster in word-final position. 

Across syllable boundaries in the middle of a word, it is common for there to be two-consonant sequences without restrictions, except that unaspirated stops, voiced stops, voiceless nasals, voiceless semi-vowels, and {{IPA|/h/}} don't occur syllable-finally.

===Stress===
All roots carry primary stress. Most words begin with a two-syllable sequence of the sort, CV:CV (with primary stress on the V). The roots of polysyllabic words cannot always be isolated in this language, making it impossible to predict where the primary stress is going to fall solely on the type of morpheme. However, primary stress does occur on the second syllable of most words, including the words in which the roots cannot be isolated.

The weakest degree of stress falls on a syllable following a primarily or secondarily stressed syllable, and alternates on the following syllables. The syllables following the primarily stressed syllable alternates with every second syllable being slightly louder than the preceding unstressed syllable, but not as loud as the primarily or secondarily stressed syllable. 

Secondary stress occurs when a word contains two or more primary stressed syllables, in which case all but one primary stress is reduced to secondary. There are exceptions in certain syllables that are always secondarily stressed, regardless of the alternating pattern of lightly and heavily stressed syllables following the primarily stressed syllable. This type of secondary stress is included as part of the morpheme. Suffixes that have this type of stress include {{IPA|/-kiːmà/}} 'plural habitual', and {{IPA|/-bàja/}} 'sentence connective'.

===Phonological Processes===

Here are some examples of phonologically conditioned variation within the Eastern Pomo language involving one of the three processes: [[vowel harmony]], consonant [[ablaut]], or consonant and vowel deletion. 

'''Vowel Harmony''': This process affects the two high vowels, {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}. The vowel {{IPA|/u/}} lowers to become the mid vowel {{IPA|/o/}} in [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] prefixes. The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} lowers to become the mid vowel {{IPA|/e/}} if followed by {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/ʔ/}} and another {{IPA|/e/}}.

'''Consonant Ablaut''': This process affects aspirated stops (plosives) except {{IPA|/t̺ʰ/}}, and the fricative {{IPA|/x/}}. When aspirated stops are in morpheme-final position, and are followed by a morpheme beginning with a vowel, the aspirated stops (other than {{IPA|/t̺ʰ/}}) deaspirate to become the corresponding unaspirated stops, and {{IPA|/x/}} becomes {{IPA|/q/}}. For example, {{IPA|/xótʃʰ/}}, 'two', becomes {{IPA|/xótʃ-a/}}, 'two (things)'; and {{IPA|/kóːx/}}, 'to shoot' becomes {{IPA|/kóːq-a/}}, '(someone) shot something'. 

'''Deletion''':  This process affects suffixes beginning with the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/a/}}, or with the consonants {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}: 
*'''Vowel Deletion''' occurs when the morpheme before a suffix ends in a vowel, the suffix begins with /i/ or /a/, and the rest of the suffix does not consist only of this vowel. An example of this is the morpheme, {-aya}, indicating 'plural'.
*'''Consonant Deletion''' occurs in a similar situation, except instead of the vowel initializing the suffix, it is either {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}, and the previous morpheme ends in a consonant. This can be seen in the morpheme, {-yiNàl}, indicating 'indirect object'.

==Morphology==

The most important processes of Eastern Pomo morphology are suffixation and prefixation. There are half as many morphemes that serve as prefixes than suffixes. Other processes used are reduplication and compounding. The verbal or non-verbal function of a morphological unit is specified by the addition of inflectional suffixes, and/or syntactic relations. The inflectional suffixes fall into categories creating morphological classes; mainly, verbs, animates, substantives, and four minor classes, adverbial indefinites, locatives, directionals and directional preverbs. There are also uninflecteds, which include proper names, interjections and syntactic particles.

===Verbs===
Verbs are morphologically the most complex and syntactically the most important. There are eight optional position classes of suffixes for verbs, specifying categories of aspect, mode, plurality, locality, reciprocity, source of information ([[evidentials]]), and forms of syntactic relations. Stems may be inflected as a verb by means of suffixation, prefixation and reduplication.

===Animates===
Animates have two subclasses, pronouns and kinship terms. They are inflected for subject, object, [[Genitive case|genitive]], and [[Comitative case|comitative]] through the processes of suffixation and partial suppletion. Kinship terms distinguish between a person's own relative and another person's relative by means of suffixation and suppletion, and occur with two sets of possessive pronominal prefixes.

===Substantives===
Substantives have five subclasses, personal nouns, adjectives, nouns, demonstratives, and numerals. They are inflected for noun aspect. Nouns are inflected for possession and commitation, while personal nouns and adjectives are inflected for plurality through suffixation and suppletion.

===Uninflecteds===
Uninflecteds include proper nouns, interjections and syntactic particles. The basic morphological unit is the stem, which can be either common or unanalyzable. 

Common stems have a root with the canonical shape CV’(:). The difference between common stems and unanalyzable stems is that commons stems can include an additional single position class of instrumental prefixes with the shape CV(·)-, and/or a member of one or both of two position classes of manner suffixes, with the shape -C, -CC, or {{IPA|/-ː/}}. A common stem is often used to apply to a variety of situations, which may not be formally associated in the typical English perspective. For example, ''si·qál'', meaning both, 'pure, clean, all of one kind, homogeneous' and 'lick something like ice cream off fingers.' These two situations are distinguished through verbal and extra-linguistic context. And at the same time, a single event can be described by a variety of stems depending on what aspect of the act is in focus. 

Unanalyzable stems consist of a longer sequence of phonemes than roots, such as CVC, or CVCV. Some of these unanalyzable stems are borrowed from Spanish, such as ''pášalʔ'', 'to visit, a visit'.

===Suffixes===

Position Classes of Suffixes (Non-verb)
*I- Specifying: {-r}, {-·U}, {-yay}, {-l}
*II- Manner: {-n}
*III- Locative: {-w}, {-xa·m}, {-da}, {-a·ma·}, {-ya}, {-NA}
*IV- Directional: {-lal}
*V- Directional: {-ma}, {-wa}
*VI- Temporal Locative: {-Mi}, {-iday}
*VII- Number: {-i·nay}, {-aya}
*VIII: Deictic: {-ʔba·}
*IX: Syntactic: {-bax}, {-Mak’}, {-a}, {-al}, {-yiNàl}, {i·kò}, {-ba}, {-Nalal}, {-heʔè}, {-heʔ}

Position Classes of Suffixes (Verbs)
*I- {-kʰ}, {-k’}
*II- {-ma}, {-ʔwà·}, {-mli}
*III- {-qa}
*IV- {-ki}
*V- {-Mak’}
*VI- {-yaki}, {-kìl}, {-ki·mà}, {-baqay}
*VII- {-ayax}, {-ine}, {-baʔè}
*VIII (for dependent verb forming members)- {-iy}, {-qan}, {-in}, {-sa}, {-pʰi}, {-pʰila}, {-bàya}, {-iday}, {-ʔ}, {-Nalal}, {-ba}
*VIII (for independent verb forming members)- {-ya}, {-·hi}, {-·}, {-i·Nàʔ}, {-yaʔè·le}, {-iš}, {-è·}, {-ink’e}, {-·le}, {-baʔ}, {-im}, {-me}

An example of derivational suffixes are the gender suffixes, {-p’} for the masculine gender, and {-t’} for the feminine gender.

===Instrumental Prefixes===
There are 18 frequently used instrumental prefixes in Eastern Pomo, which are used to indicate how something was done. An example of one of the frequent forms is {da} meaning 'with or affecting the hand'. It is seen in the word ''da·kʰó·'', meaning 'grab at something, steady something with hand, catch with hand'.

===Stem Reduplication===
Stem reduplication signifies different types of distributiveness, meaning that the action affects many individuals or creates many distributed results. There are four types in Eastern Pomo: 
*reduplication of the root alone, {r}
*reduplication of the root plus a manner suffix, {ʔr}
*reduplication of an instrumental prefix plus a root, {R}
*reduplication of an instrumental prefix, root and manner suffix
It is clear that the reduplicated sequence comes after the base stem because of the fact that the primary stress associated with all roots is not reduplicated in the process. The amount of distributiveness is determined by the number of morphemes involved in the reduplication. For example, in the first type of reduplication, only the root is copied, and only its meaning is affected. In the second type, the root and a manner suffix are reduplicated, and both of their meanings are affected.

For example, in the word ''mi·ṭʰi’ṭʰik’i·l'', meaning 'kick something along, a little way at a time,' where only the root is reduplicated, it is possible that only one toe is used to do the kicking. The motion of spreading, as indicated in the phrase 'a little way at a time,' is the part that is distributed.

==Syntax==
Word order is not fixed, but predictable, in the Eastern Pomo language. Verbs are the head of the clause, and typically the final word in that clause. Generally, the order preceding the verb begins with an optional adverbial or locative complement, then the subject, object, instrument, and possibly another adverbial or locative complement.

===Case Marking===
The position of the agent is morphologically specified by one of the three suffixes: {-là·}, {-u·là·}, or {-yeʔèkʰ}. 
* bu·ráqalu·là· wi qa·néa = bear-&lt;small&gt;AGENT&lt;/small&gt; me bite = "I got bit by a bear"

The relation of instruments is marked by the suffix {-yay} when a morphologically marked subject and object are in the clause as well. The locative suffixes used to mark the locative complement are: {-w}, {-xa·m}, {-da}, {-a·ma·}, {-ya}, {-Na}, or {-iday}.

There is a syntactic relation of possession or dependency between the members of a phrase and the head of a phrase. Possession is marked morphologically by the genitive suffix {-bax} or a possessive pronoun:
* bó·bax ká·wkʰ = west-&lt;small&gt;GENITIVE&lt;/small&gt; people = "people from Ukiah"

Dependency is not morphologically marked, but is interpreted through paraphrasing or dropping words.

===Evidentials===

Grammatical [[evidentiality]] is expressed by four [[evidential]] [[suffix]]es that are added to verbs: ''-ink’e'' (nonvisual sensory), ''-ine'' (inferential), ''-·le'' (hearsay), ''-ya'' (direct knowledge):&lt;ref&gt;McLendon 2003:101-2&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Switch-reference===
Eastern Pomo, like the other Pomoan languages, exhibits a system of [[switch-reference]], whereby suffixes are used to mark whether a clause has the same or a different subject from the preceding clause. The suffixes also mark temporal, causative, and other distinctions. The switch-reference suffixes of Eastern Pomo are given in the table below:&lt;ref&gt;McLendon 1978:8, table 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| class="wikitable"
! Meaning
! Same Subject
! Different Subject
|-
| align="left"|Action of verb suffixed precedes in time that of main verb
| align="center"|-iy
| align="center"|-qan
|-
| align="left"|Action of verb (1) explains, justifies that of main verb,&lt;br&gt;(2) is simultaneous with that of main verb
| align="center"|-in
| align="center"|-sa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align="left"|Action of suffixed verb is prior to and a prerequisite&lt;br&gt;for the realization of the action expressed by the main verb

|-
| align="left"|Action of main verb continues over same period&lt;br&gt;or begins with time specified by suffixed verb
| align="center"|-bàya
| align="center"|-iday
|}

:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Occurs only with meaning (1)

An example of one of the switch-reference markers in context is the sentence '''há· xá· qákki&lt;u&gt;qan&lt;/u&gt;, wi q’a·lál ṭá·la''', "I took a bath, &lt;u&gt;so [same subject]&lt;/u&gt; I got sick".&lt;ref&gt;McLendon 1978:8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample Lexicon==

*'''la·bi’tʰ''' 'flash on and off' : {la·-} (occurs only with this root, meaning unknown) + {bi’-} 'position, be positioned' + {-tʰ} (suffix characterizes intermittent actions)
*'''qa·léy''' 'eaten up, eat up' : {qa·-} 'with jaws and teeth, with jaw-like action' + {lé-} 'extend, with even, smooth distribution, and by extension, completely include' + {-y} (perfective suffix indicating an action that is completed or accomplished)
*'''xá ku·ṭʰi’ski·''' 'splash water (with side of palm)' : {xá} 'water' + {ku·-} 'with a flat surface, such as the palm' + {ṭʰi-} 'motion which spreads or extends' + {-s} 'suffix indicating concentration, intensity' + {-ki} 'semelfactive' + {-·} 'stative mode'
*'''ba·q’ál''' 'finish talking, going to school, or job of cutting fish or apricots'
*'''da·q’áṭ’ki·''' 'scratch off'
*'''da·q’á·s''' 'scratch with nails'

'''Eimuntas Nekrošius''' (November 21, 1952 – November 20, 2018) was a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] [[theatre director]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Nekrošius was born in Pažobris village, [[Raseiniai district municipality]], [[Lithuania]] on November 21, 1952.

===Career===
In 1978, Nekrošius graduated from [[GITIS|Lunacharsky Institute of Theatre Arts]] in [[Moscow]]. After returning to Lithuania Nekrošius has been working in the [[Vilnius]] [[State Youth Theatre]] from 1978 until 1979. In 1979, he moved to the [[Kaunas State Drama Theatre]], where he stayed for a year until 1980. 1980, he returned to [[Vilnius]] State Youth Theatre, where he staged series of notable plays. In 1998 he founded a theatre ''Meno fortas'' (''Fortress of Art''). From 2012 to 2013, E.Nekrošius worked as an art director in [[Teatro Olimpico]],  [[Vicenza]]. Just before his sudden death he was working on production of ''Edipo a Colono'' by [[Ruggero Cappuccio]] which was planned to be shown in [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii]].

Between 1988 and 1992 he worked and staged performances in many countries - [[Austria]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Israel]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]].

Among the features characteristic to his plays are the soothing background music of a repetitive pattern throughout the performance, extensive use of dance and movement and unique [[Theatrical property|prop]]s on stage, as well as an employment of natural substances as water, fire, wind, ice and stone. The length of a single performance often exceeds conventional viewing time since Nekrošius favours complex and challenging pieces to stage, such as the ''[[Song of Songs]]'' or ''[[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]'' by [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]. According to Nekrošius, a production, must not only speak, but it must do so on several levels, using multiple systems of meaning, in concert, to achieve a cumulative, unified effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Patrick |first1=Chura |title=Reclaiming Shakespeare: Eimuntas Nekrošius's Lithuanian Othello |url=http://www.lituanus.org/2001/01_3_03.htm#Ref |website=lituanus.org |quote= Explaining his art, Nekrošius has said that a theater director is required to know how to read the production vertically, like a musical arrangement.  A production, Nekrošius believes, must not only speak, but it must do so on several levels, using multiple systems of meaning, in concert, to achieve a cumulative, unified effect. In this play, for example, a powerful musical score develops concurrently with an array of sound effects, extending the range of non-verbal auditory communication from director to audience. Italian critic Valentina Valentini, author of a book-length treatment of Nekrošius's work, has described this characteristic use of sound: In Nekrošius's theater, unspoken means of expression.|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On November 20, 2018, one day shy of his 66th birthday, Nekrošius died in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] after a [[heart attack]] at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Известный литовский режиссёр Някрошюс умер за сутки до своего дня рождения|url=https://life.ru/t/новости/1171159/izviestnyi_litovskii_riezhissior_niakroshius_umier_za_sutki_do_svoiegho_dnia_rozhdieniia|accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Euphronios Krater''' (or '''Sarpedon krater''') is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[terra cotta]] calyx-[[krater]], a bowl used for [[Ancient Greece and wine|mixing wine with water]]. Created around the year 515 BC, it is the only complete example of the surviving 27 vases painted by the renowned [[Euphronios]] and is considered one of the finest Greek vase [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in existence. Part of the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1972 to 2008, the vase was [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriated]] to [[Italy]] under an agreement negotiated in February 2006, and is now in the collection of the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn and Michael W. Cothren. ''Art History''. Fourth Edition, vol. 1. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2011. p119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/11/07/news/franceschini_il_cratere_di_eufronio_resta_a_cerveteri_-126844061/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Euphronios krater stands 45.7&amp;nbsp;cm (18 inches) in height and has a [[diameter]] of 55.1&amp;nbsp;cm (21.7 inches). It can hold about 45 L (12 gallons). The style of the vase is [[red-figure pottery]], in which figure outlines, details, and the background are painted with an opaque black slip while the figures themselves are left in the color of the unpainted terracotta ceramic clay. 
 
The krater is decorated with two scenes.&lt;ref name="SchefoldGiuliani1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl Schefold|author2=Luca Giuliani|title=Gods and Heroes in Late Archaic Greek Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA250|date=3 December 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32718-3|pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An episode from the [[Trojan War]] is shown on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]; this illustration depicts the death of [[Sarpedon]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Laodamia]]. The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the krater shows a contemporary scene of [[Athens|Athenian]] youths from the sixth century BC arming themselves before battle. In the scene of Sarpedon's death, the god [[Hermes]] directs the [[personification]]s of Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]) to carry the fallen away to his homeland for burial. While the subject of Sarpedon's death might normally be depicted as a stylized tableau, the figures in this scene are painted in naturalistic poses and with schematic, but accurate anatomy. This style is emblematic of the [[Pioneer Group]] of [[Archaic period in Greece|late Archaic]] painters, of whom Euphronios is considered the most accomplished. The scene of the anonymous Greek youths on the reverse shares this naturalistic style, using all the Pioneer Group's characteristic techniques of anatomical accuracy, natural poses, foreshortening, and spatial illusion.

Also characteristic of the Pioneer Group is the narrative tension created both by pairing these two scenes on the same piece, and by painting them in a common style. The death of Sarpedon, a quasi-mythological story which would be familiar to anyone viewing the krater, is an episode involving specific historical and mythological figures. The other scene, of the anonymous youths preparing for war, is both more general and explicitly contemporary. The young men are not heroes of legend; with their finely detailed features, they are given personality and character, but they could be any of the youthful soldiers in the Greek army. Both scenes are painted with similar styles, making the historical scene appear more contemporary; likewise, the contemporary scene begins to share some of the other's mythological qualities. The two scenes invite comparison between the narratives they depict; certainly, the hero Sarpedon was no less youthful than these anonymous boys, and Death and Sleep may well come for them as they did for him.

The vase is signed both by Euxitheos as [[Pottery|potter]] and [[Euphronios]] as [[Painting|painter]]. While it was customary for the painter to sign the finished work, it was less common for the potter to add his own name. The presence of both signatures indicates that Euxitheos felt the vase to be one of his finest works. Besides the artists' signatures on the obverse side, it also carries the inscription "Leagros is handsome." on the reverse. This inscription has allowed art historians to date the krater to approximately 520-510 BC, because at this time Leagros was considered the handsomest man in Greece. All names are written in [[Attic Greek|Attic letters]].

==History==
Records in Italian courts of an investigation indicate that the krater was [[Looted art|looted]] from an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[tomb]] in the Greppe Sant'Angelo near [[Cerveteri]] in December 1971. The krater was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by [[Robert E. Hecht]], an American [[antiquities]] dealer living in Rome, for [[United States dollar|US$]]1.2 million on November 10, 1972.&lt;ref name="LLC1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=7 December 1981|publisher=New York Media, LLC|pages=68–|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecht, who was accused of trafficking in [[illicit antiquities]], claimed to have acquired the krater from Dikran Sarrafian, a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] dealer, whose family had been in possession of the piece since 1920. Evidence suggests that Hecht may have purchased the krater in 1972 from [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]], an Italian dealer who was convicted of selling stolen art in 2005.&lt;ref name="WatsonTodeschini2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Watson|author2=Cecilia Todeschini|title=The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5uN8rvqaKYC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2007|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-438-5|pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecht denied the charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html?ref=world Euphronios Krater Returned - Art - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hoving]], director of the Met and the primary negotiator in the purchase, later said in his memoirs, ''Making the Mummies Dance'', "An intact red-figured Greek vase of the early sixth century B.C. could only have been found in Etruscan territory in Italy, by illegal excavators".&lt;ref name="Hoving1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hoving|title=Making the Mummies Dance: Inside The Metropolitan Museum Of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dItWAJxHT2MC|date=15 February 1994|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-88075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allay concerns, some six months after the krater was bought he prompted the Metropolitan Museum to send a private detective to Zurich in an endeavor to reinforce the cited Sarrafian provenance.&lt;ref name="HufnagelChappell2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Saskia Hufnagel|author2=Professor Duncan Chappell|title=Contemporary Perspectives on the Detection, Investigation and Prosecution of Art Crime: Australasian, European and North American Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXg3BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=28 October 2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-6313-9|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, following the trial of [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]] and related disclosures about antiquities smuggling, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Italian government signed an agreement under which ownership of the Euphronios krater and several other pieces of art was [[Art repatriation|returned]] to Italy in exchange for long-term loans of other comparable objects owned by Italy.  The krater remained on display at the Metropolitan Museum until January 2008, when it returned to Italy. It was unveiled in [[Rome]] on 18 January.&lt;ref&gt;Povoledo, Elisabetta, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html Ancient Vase Comes Home to a Hero’s Welcome]. New York Times (19 January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The krater was displayed at the  Villa Giulia [[National Etruscan Museum]] in Rome from 2008-2014 until it was moved as part of a temporary display in the Cerveteri Museum celebrating the UNESCO World Heritage Site affiliation for the necropolis at Banditaccia.  Following the increase of attendance at the museum, the Cultural Heritage Minister, Dario Franceschini, has announced that the krater will remain at the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/11/07/news/franceschini_il_cratere_di_eufronio_resta_a_cerveteri_-126844061/&lt;/ref&gt;

Details from the krater's obverse have been used as a book cover illustration.  The [[Penguin Classics]] deluxe edition of [[Robert Fagles|Robert Fagles']] English translation of the [[Iliad]] employs a close-up of Thanatos for its front cover, and a close-up of Sarpedon for its back cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |translator-last=Fagles |translator-first=Robert |editor1-last=Knox |editor1-first=Bernard |title=The Iliad |publisher=Penguin |date=1998 |edition=Penguin Classics Deluxe |isbn=9780140275360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Expanded Cinema''''' by [[Gene Youngblood]] (1970), the first book to consider video as an art form, was influential in establishing the field of [[media arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Manovich, Lev. 2002. "Ten Key Texts on Digital Art: 1970–2000". Leonardo. 35 (5): 567–569.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book he argues that a new, expanded cinema is required for a new consciousness. He describes various types of filmmaking utilizing new technology, including film [[special effects]], [[computer art]], [[video art]], multi-media environments and [[holography]].

== "Part One: The Audience and the Myth of Entertainment" ==
In the first part of the book, Youngblood attempts to show how ''expanded cinema'' will unite art and life. "Television's elaborate movie-like subjective-camera ''simulation'' of the first moon landing" (p46) showed a generation that reality was not as real as simulation. He says that he is writing "at the end of the era of cinema as we've known it, the beginning of an era of image-exchange between man and man" (p. 49). The ''[[future shock]]'' of the ''Paleocybernetic Age'' will change fundamental concepts such as intelligence, morality, creativity and the family (pp. 50–53). The ''[[Intermedia]] network'' of the mass media is contemporary man's environment, replacing nature. He uses recent scientific research into [[Body memory|cellular memory]] and inherited memory to support his claim that this network [[Pavlovian conditioning|conditions]] human experience. The ''[[Noosphere]]'' (a term Youngblood borrows from [[Teilhard de Chardin]]) is the organizing intelligence of the planet—the minds of its inhabitants. "Distributed around the globe by the intermedia network, it becomes a new ''technology'' that may prove to be one of the most powerful tools in man's history" (p. 57). He defends the universality of art against the localism of entertainment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intermedia network has made all of us artists by proxy. A decade of television-watching is equal to a comprehensive course in dramatic acting, writing, and filming...the mystique is gone—we could almost do it ourselves. Unfortunately too many of us do just that: hence the glut of sub-mediocre talent in the entertainment industry.
:— p. 58&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is what forces cinema to expand and become more complex. Mass media entertainment dulls people's minds. It is a closed, [[entropic]] system, adding nothing new. (pp. 59–65) Entertainment dwells on the past. We live in ''future shock'' so art should be an invention of a future (pp. 66–69). New systems need to be designed for old information. The artist is a ''design scientist''.

== "Part Two: Synaesthetic Cinema: The End of Drama" ==
Youngblood describes television as the [[software]] of the planet. It acts as a [[superego]] and shows us global reality. This renders cinema obsolete as a communicator of objective reality, and so frees it (pp. 78–80). He embraces a [[synesthesia|synaesthetic]] synthesis of opposites which are simultaneously perceived. He then goes on to draw a distinction between the [[syncretic]] montage of [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Pudovkin]] and the [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s montage of collision (pp. 84–86). He prefers metamorphosis to cuts (p86). Filmmakers that Youngblood think embody this synesthetic syncretism include: [[Stan Brakhage]] (p. 87), [[Will Hindle]], Pat O'Neill, John Schofill, and [[Ronald Nameth]]. Filmmakers that present ideas of [[polymorphous perversity|polymorphous]] eroticism, the blurring of sexual boundaries, include [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Carolee Schneemann]] (pp. 112–121). [[Michael Snow]]'s ''[[Wavelength (1966 film)|Wavelength]]'' is also an example of synaesthetic cinema's extra-objective reality (pp. 122–127). At the end of the second part of the book Youngblood writes about the rebirth of the cottage industry in the post-mass-audience age. Video tapes can be exchanged freely, films are becoming more personal, specializations are ending (pp. 128–134).

== "Part Three: Toward Cosmic Consciousness" ==
Youngblood analyses [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] to explore the "electronic age [[existentialism]]" (pp. 139–150). He examines [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s use of mechanical processes to create the ''Stargate sequence'' (pp. 151–156) and describes the work of [[Jordan Belson]] as an example of ''cosmic cinema'' (pp. 157–177).

== "Part Four: Cybernetic Cinema and Computer Films" ==
Youngblood defines the ''technosphere'' as a symbiosis between man and machine. The computer liberates man from specialization and amplifies intelligence (pp. 180–182). He draws comparisons between computer processing and human neural processing (pp. 183–184). Logic and intelligence is the brain's software. He predicts that computer software will become more important than [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and that in the future [[super-computers]] will design ever more advanced computers (pp. 185–188). His vision of the future is the ''Aesthetic Machine'': "Aesthetic application of technology is the only means of achieving new consciousness to match our environment" (p189). Creativity will be shared between man and machine. He points to the links between [[computer art]] and [[conceptual art|Conceptualism]], and the growing theoretical basis of art. In his [[cybernetic art]] exploration of ''Cybernetic Cinema'' he gives an account of early experiments using computers to draw and make films. He bemoans the fact that at the time of writing no computer has the power to generate real-time images and that computer art has to be made [[off-line]]. He does, though, foresee a future in which location shooting will become obsolete as all locations will be able to be simulated with computers (pp. 194–2006). Examples of filmmakers using computers, referred to by Youngblood, include: [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], [[James Whitney (filmmaker)|James Whitney]], [[Michael Whitney (filmmaker)|Michael Whitney]], [[John Stehura]], [[Stan VanDerBeek]] and [[Peter Kamnitzer]] (pp. 207–256).

== "Part Five: Television as a Creative Medium" ==
Youngblood describes the ''videosphere'', in which computers and televisions are extensions to man's central nervous system. He is optimistic about technological advances and predicts [[Video on demand|TV-on-demand]] by 1978 (pp. 260–264). He does acknowledge, however, that data retrieval is more complicated than data recording. The various processes involved in [[video synthesizer|video synthesizing]] are described: de-beaming, [[Keying (graphics)|keying]], [[Chroma key|chroma-keying]], [[feedback]], mixing, switching and [[linear video editing|editing]] (pp. 265–280). The work of [[Loren Sears]] is [[neuroesthetics|neuroesthetic]] because it treats television as an extension of the central nervous system (pp. 291–295). The curator [[Jim Newman (Dilexi Gallery, Other Minds)|James Newman]] moved from a traditional gallery to a conceptual gallery with his joint project with [[KQED-TV]], commissioning television work from [[Terry Riley]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[The Living Theater]], [[Robert Frank]] and [[Walter De Maria]] (pp. 292–293). [[Nam June Paik]] has worked creatively with television (pp. 302–308). [[Les Levine]] exploits the potential of [[closed-circuit television]] (pp. 337–344).

== "Part Six: Intermedia" ==
Youngblood sees the artist as an ecologist, involved with the environment rather than with objects (pp. 346–351). By way of example he cites the video displays at world expositions (specifically [[Roman Kroitor]]'s large-scale projections at [[Expo 67]] and [[Expo '70]] (pp. 352–358), and the ''Cerebrum'', an art/nightclub environment.  Artists such as [[Carolee Schneemann]] and [[Robert Whitman]] combine film projection with live performance (pp. 366–371). [[Wolf Vostell]] incorporates video experiments into environmental contexts (p. 383). Light shows are used in concerts and multiple projectors and video screens create complex environments.

== "Part Seven: Holographic Cinema: A New World" ==
Finally, Youngblood explores the creative potential of [[holography]].

==Key ideas==

* [[Intermedia]]
* [[Neuroesthetics]]
* [[Noosphere]]
* [[Synaesthesia]]

[[File:Der Haussekretär Hrsg Carl Otto Berlin ca 1900 F Titelseiten 3 Vorwort1.jpg|thumb|Foreword, to a 1900 book in German]]
A '''foreword''' is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of [[literature]].  Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells.  Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.

When written by the author, the foreword may cover the story of how the book came into being or how the idea for the book was developed, and may include thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pope| first = Geoff| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Foreword" Versus "Forward" | work = Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips| publisher = Macmillan Holdings, LLC| date = 18 November 2010| url = http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/forward-versus-foreword.aspx| format = | doi = | accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a [[preface]], a foreword is always signed.

Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an [[introduction (essay)|introduction]], rather than in the foreword or preface.

The pages containing the foreword and preface (and other front matter) are typically not numbered as part of the main work, which usually uses [[Arabic numerals]].  If the front matter is paginated, it uses lowercase [[Roman numerals]].  If there is both a foreword and a preface, the foreword appears first; both appear before the introduction, which may be paginated either with the front matter or the main text.

The word ''foreword'' was first used around the mid-17th century, originally as a term in [[philology]]. It was possibly a [[calque]] of [[German (language)|German]] ''Vorwort'', itself a calque of Latin ''praefatio''.

Raynouard was born at [[Brignoles]] in Provence, trained for the bar, and practiced at [[Draguignan]]. In 1791 he represented the [[département in France|department]] of [[Var (department)|Var]] in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Savarelli, ''Les administrateurs du département du Var, 1790–1897 : notices biographiques'', Éditions Olivier-Joulian, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; but after the fall of his party, the [[Girondist]]s, he went into hiding. Discovered and imprisoned in Paris, he wrote his play ''Caton d'Utique'' (1794) during his imprisonment.

In 1803 he won the [[Institut de France]]'s poetry prize. ''Éléonore de Bavière'' and ''Les Templiers'' were accepted by the [[Comédie-Française]]. ''Les Templiers'' was produced in 1805, and, over the opposition of [[Julien Louis Geoffroy|Geoffroy]], was a great success. Elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1807, elected to the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] in 1816, Raynouard was admitted ''secrétaire perpétuel'' of the [[Académie française]] in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrtée Taster, ''Histoire des quarante fauteuils de l'Académie française'', Éditions Lacroix, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1806 to 1814 he represented the [[département in France|department]] of [[Var (department)|Var]] in the [[Corps législatif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Urban | first=Sylvanus  | title=The Towneley Mysteries |magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine | volume=VI| issue=161   |page=566 |date=December 1837 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaklrCCQQgsC&amp;q=Raynouard#v=onepage&amp;q=Raynouard&amp;f=false | accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia | edition=1913 | title=François Juste Marie Raynouard | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Fran%C3%A7ois-Juste-Marie_Raynouard | accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raynouard wrote other plays, one of which, ''Les États de Blois'' (acted 1810), offended [[Napoleon]] by its freedom of speech. Realizing that the public taste had changed and that [[Romanticism]] would triumph, Raynouard abandoned the stage and devoted himself to linguistic studies. His researches into [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] were to an extent inaccurate, but his enthusiasm and perseverance opened the way for the study of the subject.

Raynouard is sometimes called the founder of [[Romance languages|Romance linguistics]], although his contribution was marked by a fundamental misconception: he believed that the Romance languages were derived from a common post-Latin language, which he called ''le roman'',&lt;ref&gt;This term he more or less equates with [[Old Provençal]]. Raynouard's contemporary [[August Schlegel]] (''[https://archive.org/details/observationssur00schlgoog Obsérvations sur la langue et la littérature provençales]'', pp. 39–) puts forward his own correction of this point.&lt;/ref&gt; and not directly from [[Latin (language)|Latin]], as is in fact the case.&lt;ref&gt;Iordan-Orr, ''An Introduction to Romance Linguistics: Its Schools and Scholars'', revised by R. Posner (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1970), pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Raynouard's chief works are ''Choix de poésies originales des troubadours'' (6 vols., 1816–1821), of which the sixth volume, ''Grammaire comparée des langues de l'Europe latine, dans leurs rapports avec la langue des troubadours'' (1821), was separately published; ''Lexique roman ou dictionnaire de la langue des troubadours comparée avec les autres langues de l'Europe latine'' (6 vols., 1838–1844).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica| title=François Just Marie Raynouard | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492549/Francois-Juste-Marie-Raynouard | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the last years of his life at [[Passy]].

Raynouard was Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]]. In the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]], a street and a square have been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Doniol, ''Histoire du XVI&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; arrondissement'' de Paris, Éditions Hachette, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brignoles]], a monument pays tribute to him near the house he was born in, and the [[Secondary education in France|secondary school (''lycée'')]] and a boulevard have been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=French | title=Historique – Lycée Raynouard | url=http://www.ac-nice.fr/raynouard/spip.php?article7 | publisher=Lycée Raynouard | year=2012 | accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French standard sizes for [[oil painting]]s''' refers to a series of different sized [[Canvas|canvases]] for use by artists. The sizes were fixed in the 19th century. Most artists{{Weasel inline|date=February 2017}}—not only French—used this standard, as it was supported by the main suppliers of [[Art materials|artist materials]]. Only some contemporary artist material suppliers continue to use these standards today, as most artists no longer differentiate canvas sizes by subject.

The main separation from size 0 (''toile de 0'') to size 120 (''toile de 120'') is divided in separate runs for faces/portraits (''figure''), landscapes (''paysage''), and marines (''marine'') which more or less keep the diagonal. That is, a ''figure 0'' corresponds in height to a ''paysage 1'' and a ''marine 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Haaf|first= Beatrix|title=Industriell vorgrundierte Malleinen. Beiträge zur Entwicklungs-, Handels- und Materialgeschichte| journal=Zeitschrift für Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung|volume = 1|pages = 7–71|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In modern times in the USA size is usually stated height by width, where as in this article it is width by height.

'''High-altitude adaptation in humans''' is an instance of [[evolutionary adaptation|evolutionary modification]] in certain human populations, including those of [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] in Asia, the [[Andes]] of the Americas, and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high [[altitudes]]. This adaptation means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|long-term physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]].

While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen [[respiratory system|respiration]] and blood [[circulatory system|circulation]], when compared to the general lowland population.&lt;ref name=fris&gt;{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC&amp;pg|pages=175–301 |isbn =0472095110|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hillary Mayell |title=Three High-Altitude Peoples, Three Adaptations to Thin Air|date=24 February 2004 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2004/02/0224_040225_evolution.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists started to notice the extraordinary physical performance of Tibetans since the beginning of Himalayan climbing era in the early 20th century.

In 1990, it was estimated that 4,594,188 Tibetans live on the plateau, with 53% living at an altitude over {{convert|3500|m|ft}}.

The Tibetans, who have been living in this region for 3,000 years, do not exhibit the elevated haemoglobin concentrations to cope with oxygen deficiency as observed in other populations who have moved temporarily or permanently at high altitudes. Instead, the Tibetans inhale more air with each breath and breathe more rapidly than either sea-level populations or Andeans. Tibetans have better [[oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for [[physical exercise|exercise]].

===Andeans===

In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate.&lt;ref name=beall07 /&gt; This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the [[fecundity|giving birth]] or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vitzthum |first1=Virginia J. |title=Fifty fertile years: anthropologists' studies of reproduction in high altitude natives |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179–189 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22357 |pmid=23382088}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in [[alveolus|alveolar]] area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in [[red blood cells]]. Though the physical growth in body size is [[stunted growth|delayed]], growth in lung volumes is accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisancho|first1=A.

===Ethiopians===

The peoples of the [[Ethiopian highlands]] also live at extremely high altitudes, around {{convert|3000|m|ft}} to {{convert|3500|m|ft}}. Highland Ethiopians exhibit elevated haemoglobin levels, like Andeans and lowlander peoples at high altitudes, but do not exhibit the Andean’s increased in oxygen-content of haemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Beall CM |year=2006|title=Andean, Tibetan, and Ethiopian patterns of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia |journal=Integr Comp Biol |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=18–24 |pmid=21672719 |doi=10.1093/icb/icj004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among healthy individuals, the average haemoglobin concentrations are 15.9 and 15.0 g/dl for males and females respectively (which is lower than normal, almost similar to the Tibetans), and an average oxygen saturation of haemoglobin is 95.3% (which is higher than average, like the Andeans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Beall CM, Decker MJ, Brittenham GM, Kushner I, Gebremedhin A, Strohl KP |year=2002 |title=An Ethiopian pattern of human adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=99 |issue=26 |pages=17215–17218 |pmid=12471159 |pmc=139295 |doi=10.1073/pnas.252649199 |last2=Decker |last3=Brittenham |last4=Kushner |last5=Gebremedhin |last6=Strohl |bibcode=2002PNAS...9917215B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Ethiopian highlanders do not exhibit any significant change in blood circulation of the brain, which has been observed among the Peruvian highlanders (and attributed to their frequent altitude-related illnesses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Claydon VE, Gulli G, Slessarev M, Appenzeller O, Zenebe G, Gebremedhin A, Hainsworth R |year=2008|title=Cerebrovascular responses to hypoxia and hypocapnia in Ethiopian high altitude dwellers  |journal=Stroke |volume=39 |issue=2|pages=336–342 |pmid=18096845  |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.491498|last2=Gulli|last3=Slessarev|last4=Appenzeller|last5=Zenebe|last6=Gebremedhin|last7=Hainsworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, similar to the Andeans and Tibetans, the Ethiopian highlanders are immune to the extreme dangers posed by high-altitude environment, and their pattern of adaptation is definitely unique from that of other highland peoples.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt;

==Genetic basis==

The underlying [[molecular evolution]] of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently.&lt;ref name=mue /&gt; Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which
have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of [[recent human evolution]]. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.&lt;ref name=bea00 /&gt;

=== Tibetans ===

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and [[oxygen saturation|blood-oxygen]] levels are adaptive as [[Fitness (biology)|Darwinian fitness]]. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two [[allele]]s for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beall CM, Song K, Elston RC, Goldstein MC |year=2004 |title=Higher offspring survival among Tibetan women with high oxygen saturation genotypes residing at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/39/14300 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101|issue=39 |pages=14300–14304 |pmid=15353580|pmc=521103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405949101|last2=Song |last3=Elston |last4=Goldstein |bibcode=2004PNAS..10114300B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 [[Han Chinese]] from [[Beijing]]. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (''[[EPAS1]]''). It was found that one [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) at ''EPAS1'' shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of [[phenotype|phenotypically observable]] evolution in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Native Village Youth |author2=Education news |title=Tibetans evolved at fastest pace ever measured |url=http://www.nativevillage.org/Archives/2011%20Archives/MAY%202011%20News/Tibetans%20Evolved%20at%20Fastest%20Pace%20Ever%20Measured.htm | date=May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population.&lt;ref name=yi /&gt; [[Mutations]] in ''EPAS1'', at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (''[[EGLN1]]'') (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (''[[PPARA]]''), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonson TS, Yang Y, Huff CD, Yun H, Qin G, Witherspoon DJ, Bai Z, Lorenzo FR, Xing J, Jorde LB, Prchal JT, Ge R |year=2010 |title=Genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/72 |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5987|pages=72–75 |pmid=20466884 |doi=10.1126/science.1189406|last2=Yang |last3=Huff |last4=Yun |last5=Qin |last6=Witherspoon |last7=Bai |last8=Lorenzo |last9=Xing |last10=Jorde |last11=Prchal |last12=Ge |bibcode=2010Sci...329...72S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Sherpas]], known for their Himalayan hardiness, exhibit similar patterns in the ''EPAS1'' gene, which further fortifies that the gene is under [[Selection (biology)|selection]] for adaptation to the high-altitude life of Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanaoka M, Droma Y, Basnyat B, Ito M, Kobayashi N, Katsuyama Y, Kubo K, Ota M |year=2012 |title=Genetic variants in EPAS1 contribute to adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Sherpas | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050566 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12|pages=e50566|pmid=23227185 |pmc=3515610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050566|last2=Droma |last3=Basnyat |last4=Ito |last5=Kobayashi |last6=Katsuyama |last7=Kubo |last8=Ota |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750566H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 indicates that the mutant ''[[EPAS1]]'' gene could have been inherited from archaic [[hominin]]s, the [[Denisovans]].&lt;ref name="Huerta-Sanchez et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huerta-Sánchez|first1=Emilia |last2=Jin |first2=Xin |last3=Asan |last4=Bianba |first4=Zhuoma|last5=Peter|first5=Benjamin M. |last6=Vinckenbosch|first6=Nicolas|last7=Liang|first7=Yu|last8=Yi|first8=Xin|last9=He|first9=Mingze|last10=Somel|first10=Mehmet|last11=Ni|first11=Peixiang|last12=Wang|first12=Bo|last13=Ou|first13=Xiaohua|last14=Huasang|last15=Luosang|first15=Jiangbai|last16=Cuo|first16=Zha Xi Ping |last17=Li |first17=Kui |last18=Gao |first18=Guoyi |last19=Yin |first19=Ye |last20=Wang|first20=Wei |last21=Zhang |first21=Xiuqing |last22=Xu |first22=Xun|last23=Yang |first23=Huanming |last24=Li |first24=Yingrui |last25=Wang |first25=Jian |last26=Wang |first26=Jun |last27=Nielsen |first27=Rasmus |title=Altitude adaptation in Tibetans caused by introgression of Denisovan-like DNA |journal=Nature |date=2014 |volume=512 |issue=7513 |pages=194–197 |doi=10.1038/nature13408 |pmid=25043035 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..194H |display-authors=8 |pmc=4134395}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EPAS1'' and ''EGLN1'' are definitely the major genes for unique adaptive traits when compared with those of the Chinese and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peng Y, Yang Z, Zhang H, Cui C, Qi X, Luo X, Tao X, Wu T, Ouzhuluobu, Basang, Ciwangsangbu, Danzengduojie, Chen H, Shi H, Su B|year=2011 |title=Genetic variations in Tibetan populations and high-altitude adaptation at the Himalayas | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/2/1075.full |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28|issue=2|pages=1075–81|pmid=21030426 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq290|last2=Yang |last3=Zhang |last4=Cui |last5=Qi |last6=Luo |last7=Tao |last8=Wu |last13=Chen |last14=Shi |last15=Su }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genome analysis in 2014 revealed that the Tibetans inherited an equal mixture of genomes from the Nepalese-Sherpas and Hans, and they acquired the adaptive genes from the sherpa-lineage.

===Andeans===

The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, ''EGLN1'' appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations.&lt;ref name=bigh /&gt; Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between ''EPAS1'' or ''EGLN1'' SNP [[genotype]]s and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bigham AW, Wilson MJ, Julian CG, Kiyamu M, Vargas E, Leon-Velarde F, Rivera-Chira M, Rodriquez C, Browne VA, Parra E, Brutsaert TD, Moore LG, Shriver MD |year=2013 |title=Andean and Tibetan patterns of adaptation to high altitude | journal=Am J Hum Biol|volume=25|issue=2|pages=190–197|pmid=23348729 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22358|last2=Wilson |last3=Julian |last4=Kiyamu |last5=Vargas |last6=Leon-Velarde |last7=Rivera-Chira |last8=Rodriquez |last9=Browne |last10=Parra |last11=Brutsaert |last12=Moore |last13=Shriver }}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou D, Udpa N, Ronen R, Stobdan T, Liang J, Appenzeller O, Zhao HW, Yin Y, Du Y, Guo L, Cao R, Wang Y, Jin X, Huang C, Jia W, Cao D, Guo G, Gamboa JL, Villafuerte F, Callacondo D, Xue J, Liu S, Frazer KA, Li Y, Bafna V, Haddad GG |title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=93|issue=S0002–9297(13)00331–5 | pages=452–62|year=2013 |pmid=23954164 |pmc=3769925 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|last2=Udpa |last3=Ronen |last4=Stobdan |last5=Liang |last6=Appenzeller |last7=Zhao |last8=Yin |last9=Du |last10=Guo |last11=Cao |last12=Wang |last13=Jin |last14=Huang |last15=Jia |last16=Cao |last17=Guo |last18=Gamboa |last19=Villafuerte |last20=Callacondo |last21=Xue |last22=Liu |last23=Frazer |last24=Li |last25=Bafna |last26=Haddad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopians===

The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the [[amhara people|Amhara]] have inhabited altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2400|m|ft}} for more than 70,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Human technical behavior in the African Middle Stone Age: The lithic assemblange of Porc-Epic Cave (Dire Dawa, Ethiopia)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10437-006-9000-7|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=177–197|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9000-7|pmid=|author=Pleurdeau D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and [[oromo people|Oromo]], revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same [[locus (genetics)|gene location]] do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alkorta-Aranburu G, Beall CM, Witonsky DB, Gebremedhin A, Pritchard JK, Di Rienzo A|year=2012 |title=The genetic architecture of adaptations to high altitude in Ethiopia | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003110|pmid=23236293| pmc=3516565 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110|last2=Beall |last3=Witonsky |last4=Gebremedhin |last5=Pritchard |last6=Di Rienzo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including ''[[CBARA1]]'', ''[[VAV3]]'', ''[[ARNT2]]'' and ''[[THRB]]''. Two of these genes (''THRB'' and ''ARNT2'') are known to play a role in the [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF-1 pathway]], a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies.

An '''invisible dictatorship''' was a term coined by [[Mikhail Bakunin]] to describe clandestine revolutionary leadership. Bakunin also used the terms '''invisible legion''' and '''invisible network''' to describe his concept of invisible dictatorship. 

==On invisible dictatorship==
In nineteenth century [[Europe]] the discussion of how a transitional revolutionary government might act took place since the days of [[Gracchus Babeuf]]. In 1828 [[Philippe Buonarroti]] published ''Conspiration pour l'Egalité dite de Babeuf, suivie du procès auquel elle donna lieu'' which proved to be very influential on [[Auguste Blanqui]] and the [[Revolution of 1848|revolutionaries of 1848]], from [[Louis Blanc]] to Bakunin. From this arose the concept of a small band of revolutionaries instituting an ''Educational Dictatorship'' which would raise the consciousness of the masses to the point that [[democracy]] could be introduced.

In the [[France|French]] [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|February Revolution of 1848]], the provisional government assumed power extralegally, through an announcement before a mass demonstration. Louis Blanc advocated that the provisional government should "regard themselves as dictators appointed by a revolution which had become inevitable and which was under no obligation to seek the sanction of universal suffrage until after having accomplished all the good which the moment required."&lt;ref&gt;[http://marxmyths.org/hal-draper/article2.htm#n10 The ‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’ in Marx and Engels]&lt;/ref&gt; He also reiterated the idea of the "dictatorship of Paris" over the country. Bakunin, having received funds from Blanc's provisional government, threw himself into the revolutionary movement in [[Bohemia]]. He subsequently described his aim as the establishment of a "government with unlimited dictatorial power," in which "all will be subjugated to a single dictatorial authority," through three secret societies based on "strict hierarchy and unconditional discipline." [[Hal Draper]] claims this was the first appearance of his concept of a "secret dictatorship" exercised by "Invisible Dictators." Bakunin also saw [[Prague]] playing the role of Paris: "The revolutionary government with unlimited dictatorial power must sit in Prague ... All clubs and journals, all manifestations of garrulous anarchy, will also be destroyed, and all will be subjugated to a single dictatorial authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Draper |first=Hal |authorlink=Hal Draper |title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution |volume=vol. 3 |publisher=Monthly Review Press |location=[[New York City|New York]] |date=1986-01-01 |isbn=0-85345-674-7 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Ford has described this as a '‘dual organisation’' principle, with a secret cadre of controllers manipulating a public front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/398/bakunin.html Democracy or anarchism] by Eddie Ford, [[Weekly Worker]], September 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866 Bakunin abandoned the idea of state or centralized authority, and his ideas of what a secret society should be changed accordingly:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/worldwidemovements/anarchisminrussia1.html History of Anarchism in Russia] by E. Yaroslavsky&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|"We are bitter foes of all official power, even if it were ultra-revolutionary power. We are enemies of all publicly acknowledged dictatorship; we are social-revolutionary anarchists. But you will ask, if we are anarchists, by what right do we wish to and by what method can we influence the people? Rejecting any power, by what power or rather by what force shall we direct the people's revolution? An invisible force--recognized by on one, imposed by no one--through which the collective dictatorship of our organization will be all the mightier, the more it remains invisible and unacknowledged, the more it remains without any official legality and significance.".&lt;br&gt; '' Bakunin's June 2, 1870 letter to Nechayev''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/bakuninnechayev.html Bakunin Rebukes Nechayev And His Chatechism For Vanguardism] by Jon Bekken (Anarchy Archives)&lt;/ref&gt;}}


This theme is also to be found in a letter sent by Bakunin to Albert Richard, a fellow member of the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Alliance of Social Democracy]] during the turmoil surrounding the [[Paris Commune]]:&lt;ref name="Letter to Albert Richard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bakunin|first1=Mikhail|title=Letter to Albert Richard|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/albert-richard.htm|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|They appeal for order, for trust in, for submission to those who, in the course and in the name of the Revolution, seized and legalized their own dictatorial powers; this is how such political revolutionaries reconstitute the State. We, on the contrary, must awaken and foment all the dynamic passions of the people. We must bring forth anarchy, and in the midst of the popular tempest, we must be the invisible pilots guiding the Revolution, not by any kind of overt power but by the collective dictatorship of all our allies [members of the anarchist vanguard organization International Alliance of Social Democracy], a dictatorship without tricks, without official titles, without official rights, and therefore all the more powerful, as it does not carry the trappings of power. This is the only dictatorship I will accept, but in order to act, it must first be created, it must be prepared and organized in advance, for it will not come into being by itself, neither by discussions, nor by theoretical disputations, nor by mass propaganda meetings...}}

==Invisible network==
Anarchist theorist George Woodcock developed the idea of what he called a "pure anarchism", defining it as "the loose and flexible affinity group which needs no formal organization and carries on anarchist propaganda through an invisible network of personal contacts and intellectual influences." However he argued that this was incompatible with mass movements like [[anarcho-syndicalism]] as they "make compromises with day-to-day situations" and because they have to "maintain the allegiance of masses of [workers] who are only remotely conscious of the final aim of anarchism."&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchism'', World Publishing, [[Cleveland]], 1962 pp. 273-4&lt;/ref&gt; However this viewpoint has been rejected by other anarchists such as [[Sam Dolgoff]], who countered "There is no "pure" anarchism. There is only the application of anarchist principles to the realities of social living."&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/relevance-dolgoff The Relevance of Anarchism to Modern Society] accessed 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Bakunin's use of the term  'invisible dictatorship' has been criticised from a number of view points, sometimes in an attempt to discredit anarchism by associating it with this term. Some anarchists have rejected these criticisms with the claim that anarchism is innately incompatible with the concept of coercion, quoting Bakunin himself on this. The concept of the invisible dictatorship is based more on intellectual leadership and carries no connotation of forced leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane McIntosh''' is a Scottish [[archaeologist]] and author.

McIntosh obtained a PhD from the [[University of Cambridge]] on contacts between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] and [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cic.ames.cam.ac.uk/pages/mcintosh.html|title=Jane McIntosh - The First Civilizations in Contact: Mesopotamia and the Indus|last=|first=|date=|website=Civilizations in Contact|publisher=Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.harappa.com/experts/jane-mcintosh|title=Jane McIntosh|last=|first=|date=|website=Harappa.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then began writing [[Popular science|popular books]] about archaeology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her first book, ''The Practical Archaeologist'' (1986), has been described as a "key reference"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Ben W.|date=1988|title=Review of The Practical Archaeologist: How We Know What We Know About the Past|jstor=43143687|journal=Central States Archaeological Journal|volume=35|issue=4|pages=234–234|doi=10.2307/43143687}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is recommended as an introduction to archaeology for beginners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NdIwaoME9IMC&amp;pg=RA2-SA3-PA34|title=Intrigue of the Past: Discovering Archaeology in Arizona|last=Agenbroad|first=Larry|last2=Ezzo|first2=Joseph A.|date=1995|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Heritage Education Program|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=34|language=en|chapter=Appendix 3: Resources|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q6hhCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14|title=Archaeology: The Basics|last=Gamble|first=Clive|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317542759|edition=3rd|location=London|pages=14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one reviewer of the revised edition (1999) felt that the lack of up-to-date information in some sections meant that it could not be "recommended as a reference source to the serious student of archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Iain|date=2000|title=The Practical Archaeologist: How We Know What We Know about the Past|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/rr.2000.14.2.46.104|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=14|issue=2|pages=46–46|doi=10.1108/rr.2000.14.2.46.104|issn=0950-4125|url-access=subscription|via=Emerald Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2001 book on the Indus Valley Civilisation, ''A Peaceful Realm'', was less well received.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8479">'''The Language Grid''' is a multilingual service platform on the Internet mainly for supporting Intercultural collaboration. It enables easy registration and sharing of language resources such as [[Online dictionary|online dictionaries]], bilingual [[Text corpus|corpora]], and [[machine translation]]s.

== Concept ==
The Language Grid is developed to increase the accessibility and usability of language resources. It takes the [[Service-orientation|service-oriented approach]] by wrapping existing language resources as atomic [[Web services]] and enables users to compose new services by combining atomic [[Web services]].

== Architecture ==
The architecture of the Language Grid is to increase the usability of language resources, and to decrease the risk to providers in opening their resources. By wrapping resources as services, providers can control their intellectual property rights. It is essential to define stakeholders, their roles and the social protocol among them. Every stakeholder related to service grids, a ''service grid user'', can take one or more roles in the following three categories.

* ''Service provider'' wraps language resources into language services, and deploys them on a grid. When registering services, access control policies can be specified for each service.
* ''Service consumer'' invokes registered language services from an application system. When invoking a composite language service, the request is sent to a workflow engine, which executes a workflow that combines one or more atomic language services.
* ''Grid operator'' manages and controls a service grid for service providers and consumers. Each service grid has a grid operator.

The institutional agreement reflects the intentions of the three roles of service grid users. From service providers’ point of view, protection of intellectual property rights is critical. To satisfy such demands, service usage is classified into the following three categories:

* ''Non-profit use'': services are used in public or non-profit settings. 
* ''Research use'': services intended to advance the field, not for commercial profit. 
* ''For-profit use'': services for commercial profit regardless of the type of organization.

Even in for-profit organizations, social responsibility activities are classified as non-profit use. This is because such activities are often conducted with public institutions or non-profit organizations. Conversely, the activities of public institutions or non-profit organizations for commercial profit are classified as for-profit use.

== Software ==
The Language Grid consists of four service layers: P2P Service Grid Layer, Atomic Service Layer, Composite Service Layer and Application System Layer.&lt;ref&gt;Toru Ishida (ed.) The Language Grid: Service-Oriented Collective Intelligence for Language Resource Interoperability, Cognitive Technologies Series, Springer, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The P2P Service Grid Layer is constructed by the Service Grid Server Software. 

The main components are Service Supervisor and Grid Composer.&lt;ref&gt;Yohei Murakami, Donghui Lin, and Toru Ishida (eds.) Services Computing for Language Resources, Cognitive Technologies Series, Springer, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The Service Supervisor controls service invocations according to the access control policies registered by service providers. Before service consumers invoke services on Composite Service Container and Atomic Service Container, it verifies whether the request satisfies the providers' access control policies. On the other hand, the Grid Composer coordinates distributed service grids operated by different grid operators in order to connect regional language services.&lt;ref&gt;Toru Ishida, Yohei Murakami, Donghui Lin, Takao Nakaguchi, and Masayuki Otani. Language Service Infrastructure on the Web: The Language Grid. Computer, vol. 51, No. 6, pp. 72-81, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Service Grid Server Software was developed by Language Grid Project, [[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology]]. The development started in 2006. From April 2010, this is an open-sourced software maintained by the open source project.&lt;ref&gt;Service Grid Open Source Project Community Site. http://langrid.org/oss-project/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The software is used to build the Language Grid, and also employed by LAPPS Grid funded by NSF.&lt;ref&gt;The Language Application Grid. http://www.lappsgrid.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The Department of Social Informatics of [[Kyoto University]] started single operation of the Language Grid in December 2007 for non-profit purpose and research purpose, which is named as Language Grid Kyoto Operation Center. In January 2011, the second operation center for Language Grid was started by the [[National Electronics and Computer Technology Center]] of Thailand, which is called Language Grid Bangkok Operation Center. Later, Language Grid Jakarta Operation Center in Indonesia and Language Grid Xinjiang Operation in China were started in 2012 and 2014 respectively. 

The four operation centers are connected with each other to realized the federated operation of the Language Grid, which enables sharing of language services among multiple Language Grids.

In May 2017, the operation of Kyoto Language Grid was moved from [[Kyoto University]] to NPO Language Grid Association. As of May 2018, 183 groups in 24 countries and regions had joined the Kyoto Language Grid, and 226 services are shared in the Federated Language Grid.

==Researches==
Researches of developing and using the Language Grid cover several areas including [[artificial intelligence]], [[services computing]] and [[human-computer interaction]].

Since 2006, research funds of the Language Grid have been provided by [[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology]], [[Japan Society for the Promotion of Science]], Strategic Information and Communications R&amp;D Promotion Programme of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]] in Japan, and Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society of Japan Science and Technology Agency.

In November 2015, a research collaboration of federated grid for language services was started among the Language Grid, [[European Language Resources Association]] and [[Linguistic Data Consortium]].

==Activities==
By using the language services in different ways based on the Language Grid, activities have been conducted by different communities. In 2006, Language Grid Association was formed among industry, government, academia, and citizens to advance the technologies and applications of the Language Grid.

=== Foreign Patient Support at Hospitals ===

When foreigners, fall ill in different countries, they may be unable to receive adequate medical attention because of their inability to communicate with Japanese medical doctors. The multilingual medical communication support system was developed by Wakayama University in cooperation with Kyoto Center for Multicultural Society. This NPO dispatched volunteer interpreters to several affiliated hospitals a total of 1700 times per year. The support system helps communication between foreign outpatients and medical staff at hospital reception desks. Using the system, hospital staff can ask outpatients about their symptoms, and provide guidance around each section in a hospital.

=== Multilingual Agricultural Support ===

NPO Pangaea and universities in Japan and Vietnam worked on an agricultural support project with two major goals: low rice productivity and the environmental burdens caused by the excessive use of agrichemicals. From 2011 to 2014, a four-month experiment was conducted each year in Vinh Long Province, which is located in the Mekong Delta. The goal was to provide timely and appropriate agriculture knowledge in rice harvesting to Vietnamese farmers by Japanese experts. Since Japanese experts cannot physically travel to all rural areas, they were highly motivated to use the Language Grid. However, because of low literacy rate in those areas, the farmers had difficulties in using computers and indeed in reading/writing messages. The youth-mediated communication (YMC) model was invented, where children act as mediators and bridge the gaps in language, knowledge and cultures between experts and farmers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15574">'''Legal information retrieval''' is the science of [[information retrieval]] applied to legal text, including [[legislation]], [[case law]], and scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2009, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate legal information retrieval is important to provide access to the law to laymen and legal professionals. Its importance has increased because of the vast and quickly increasing amount of legal documents available through electronic means.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;Jackson et al., p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Legal information retrieval is a part of the growing field of [[legal informatics]].

== Overview ==

In a legal setting, it is frequently important to retrieve all information related to a specific query. However, commonly used [[boolean search]] methods (exact matches of specified terms) on full text legal documents have been shown to have an average [[recall rate]] as low as 20 percent,&lt;ref name="Blair, D.C. 1985, p.293"&gt;Blair, D.C., and Maron, M.E., 1985, p.293&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that only 1 in 5 relevant documents are actually retrieved. In that case, researchers believed that they had retrieved over 75% of relevant documents.&lt;ref name="Blair, D.C. 1985, p.293"/&gt; This may result in failing to retrieve important or [[precedential]] cases. In some jurisdictions this may be especially problematic, as legal professionals are [[legal ethics|ethically]] obligated to be reasonably informed as to relevant legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association, Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.1, http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_1_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal Information Retrieval attempts to increase the effectiveness of legal searches by increasing the number of relevant documents (providing a high [[recall rate]]) and reducing the number of irrelevant documents (a high [[precision rate]]). This is a difficult task, as the legal field is prone to [[jargon]],&lt;ref&gt;Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; [[polysemes]]&lt;ref&gt;Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; (words that have different meanings when used in a legal context), and constant change.

Techniques used to achieve these goals generally fall into three categories: [[boolean search|boolean]] retrieval, manual classification of legal text, and [[natural language processing]] of legal text.

== Problems ==

Application of standard [[information retrieval]] techniques to legal text can be more difficult than application in other subjects. One key problem is that the law rarely has an inherent [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].&lt;ref name=LOIS1&gt;Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the law is generally filled with open-ended terms, which may change over time.&lt;ref name=LOIS1 /&gt; This can be especially true in [[common law]] countries, where each decided case can subtly change the meaning of a certain word or phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Saravanan, M. et al.  2009, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal information systems must also be programmed to deal with law-specific words and phrases. Though this is less problematic in the context of words which exist solely in law, legal texts also frequently use polysemes, words may have different meanings when used in a legal or common-speech manner, potentially both within the same document. The legal meanings may be dependent on the area of law in which it is applied. For example, in the context of European Union legislation, the term "worker" has four different meanings:&lt;ref name="Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 131"&gt;Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

#Any worker as defined in Article 3(a) of [[Directive 89/391/EEC]] who habitually uses display screen equipment as a significant part of his normal work.
#Any person employed by an employer, including trainees and apprentices but excluding domestic servants;
#Any person carrying out an occupation on board a vessel, including trainees and apprentices, but excluding port pilots and shore personnel carrying out work on board a vessel at the quayside;
#Any person who, in the Member State concerned, is protected as an employee under national employment law and in accordance with national practice;

In addition, it also has the common meaning: 
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person who works at a specific occupation.&lt;ref name="Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 131"/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Though the terms may be similar, correct information retrieval must differentiate between the intended use and irrelevant uses in order to return the correct results.

Even if a system overcomes the language problems inherent in law, it must still determine the relevancy of each result. In the context of judicial decisions, this requires determining the precedential value of the case.&lt;ref name=MaxwellA &gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Case decisions from senior or [[superior court]]s may be more relevant than those from [[lower court]]s, even where the lower court's decision contains more discussion of the relevant facts.&lt;ref name=MaxwellA  /&gt; The opposite may be true, however, if the senior court has only a minor discussion of the topic (for example, if it is a secondary consideration in the case).&lt;ref name=MaxwellA  /&gt; A information retrieval system must also be aware of the authority of the jurisdiction. A case from a binding authority is most likely of more value than one from a non-binding authority.

Additionally, the intentions of the user may determine which cases they find valuable. For instance, where a legal professional is attempting to argue a specific interpretation of law, he might find a minor court's decision which supports his position more valuable than a senior courts position which does not.&lt;ref name=MaxwellA  /&gt; He may also value similar positions from different areas of law, different jurisdictions, or dissenting opinions.&lt;ref name=MaxwellA /&gt;

Overcoming these problems can be made more difficult because of the large number of cases available. The number of legal cases available via electronic means is constantly increasing (in 2003, US appellate courts handed down approximately 500 new cases per day&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;), meaning that an accurate legal information retrieval system must incorporate methods of both sorting past data and managing new data.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2007, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

===Boolean searches===

[[Boolean search]]es, where a user may specify terms such as use of specific words or judgments by a specific court, are the most common type of search available via legal information retrieval systems. They are widely implemented by services such as [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], and [[Findlaw]].  However, they overcome few of the problems discussed above.

The recall and precision rates of these searches vary depending on the implementation and searches analyzed. One study found a basic boolean search's [[recall rate]] to be roughly 20%, and its precision rate to be roughly 79%.&lt;ref name="Blair, D.C. 1985, p.293"/&gt; Another study implemented a generic search (that is, not designed for legal uses) and found a recall rate of 56% and a precision rate of 72% among legal professionals. Both numbers increased when searches were run by non-legal professionals, to a 68% recall rate and 77% precision rate. This is likely explained because of the use of complex legal terms by the legal professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Saravanan M., et al. 2009, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manual classification===

In order to overcome the limits of basic boolean searches, information systems have attempted to classify case laws and statutes into more computer friendly structures. Usually, this results in the creation of an [[ontology]] to classify the texts, based on the way a legal professional might think about them.&lt;ref name="Maxwell, K.T. 2008, p. 2"&gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; These attempt to link texts on the basis of their type, their value, and/or their topic areas. Most major legal search providers now implement some sort of classification search, such as [[Westlaw]]'s “Natural Language”&lt;ref name=WL&gt;Westlaw Research, http://www.westlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; or [[LexisNexis]]' Headnote&lt;ref name=LN&gt;Lexis Research, http://www.lexisnexis.com&lt;/ref&gt; searches. Additionally, both of these services allow browsing of their classifications, via Westlaw's West Key Numbers&lt;ref name=WL /&gt; or Lexis' Headnotes.&lt;ref name=LN /&gt; Though these two search algorithms are proprietary and secret, it is known that they employ manual classification of text (though this may be computer-assisted).&lt;ref name="Maxwell, K.T. 2008, p. 2"/&gt;

These systems can help overcome the majority of problems inherent in legal information retrieval systems, in that manual classification has the greatest chances of identifying landmark cases and understanding the issues that arise in the text.&lt;ref name="Maxwell, K.T. 2008, p. 3"&gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, ontological searching resulted in a precision rate of 82% and a recall rate of 97% among legal professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Saravanan, M. et al.  2009, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The legal texts included, however, were carefully controlled to just a few areas of law in a specific jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Saravanan, M. et al. 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The major drawback to this approach is the requirement of using highly skilled legal professionals and large amounts of time to classify texts.&lt;ref name="Maxwell, K.T. 2008, p. 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schweighofer, E. and Liebwald, D. 2008, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; As the amount of text available continues to increase, some have stated their belief that manual classification is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural language processing===

In order to reduce the reliance on legal professionals and the amount of time needed, efforts have been made to create a system to automatically classify legal text and queries.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=AshleyA&gt;Ashley, K.D. and Bruninghaus, S. 2009, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelbart&gt;Gelbart, D. and Smith, J.C. 1993, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Adequate translation of both would allow accurate information retrieval without the high cost of human classification. These automatic systems generally employ [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) techniques that are adapted to the legal domain, and also require the creation of a legal [[ontology]]. Though multiple systems have been postulated,&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=AshleyA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelbart /&gt; few have reported results. One system, “SMILE,” which attempted to automatically extract classifications from case texts, resulted in an [[f-measure]] (which is a calculation of both recall rate and precision) of under 0.3 (compared to perfect f-measure of 1.0).&lt;ref name=AshleyB &gt;Ashley, K.D. and Bruninghaus, S. 2009, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably much lower than an acceptable rate for general usage.&lt;ref name=AshleyB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2009, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the limited results, many theorists predict that the evolution of such systems will eventually replace manual classification systems.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2009, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, K.D. and Bruninghaus, S. 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citation-Based ranking ===

In the mid-90s the Room 5 case law retrieval project used citation mining for summaries and ranked its search results based on citation type and count.  This slightly pre-dated the [[Page Rank]] algorithm at Stanford which was also a citation-based ranking.  Ranking of results was based as much on jurisdiction as on number of references.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Li Ao''' ({{zh|c=李敖|p=Lǐ Áo}}, also spelled '''Lee Ao'''; 25 April 1935 – 18 March 2018) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]]-[[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] writer, social commentator, historian, and independent politician.

Li has been called one of the most important modern East Asian [[list of essayists|essayists]] today; his critics have called him as an intellectual [[narcissism|narcissist]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} He was a vocal critic of both the main political parties in Taiwan today, the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. Although he favored reunification with the People's Republic of China (PRC), especially under the "[[One country, two systems]]" policy, Li rejected being labeled "[[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-Blue]]" because of his opposition to the Kuomintang. He was an advocate of [[Chinese nationalism]] and was given much media exposure in Taiwan due to his popularity as a writer.

==Background==
Li was born in [[Harbin]], [[Manchukuo]] to Li Dingyi ([[:zh:李鼎彝|李鼎彝]]), a professor of Chinese, and Zhang Kuichen ({{lang|zh-hant|張桂貞}}). His family had ancestry in [[Weifang|Wei County]] (modern-day Weifang), [[Shandong]] Province, and [[Fuyu County, Jilin|Fuyu County]], [[Jilin]] Province. When Li was two years old, the family moved to [[Beijing]], where Li's father worked in the government's opium suppression bureau.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Qin|first1=Amy|title=Li Ao, Writer and Political Firebrand in Taiwan, Dies at 82|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/obituaries/li-ao-taiwanese-dissident-who-fought-martial-law-dies-at-82.html|accessdate=30 March 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There, Li's father was accused of being a traitor to the Kuomingtang by his superiors.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;  Although his father was cleared of the accusations, Li began feeling enmity towards the party.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; The entire Li family, except for two children, moved to Taiwan at the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. Li received his bachelor's degree from [[National Taiwan University|National Taiwan University's]] Department of History in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hwang |first=Jim |url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=489&amp;ctNode=2198&amp;mp=9 |title=Li Ao (New Party): Exposing the Dark Side |journal=Free China Review |publisher=Taiwan Today |date=1 March 2000 |accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissident writer==
Li was credited for his contributions to the [[democracy|democratic]] movement in Taiwan between the 1960s and 1980s. In the 1960s, he was the editor-in-chief of ''Wenxing'' (文星), a magazine that promoted democracy and personal freedom. He was jailed by the [[Kuomintang]] government from 1971 to 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Butterfield| first = Fox| title = Chiang's Son Has Tightened Hold on Taiwan| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-06-15| date = 1977-04-09| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/09/archives/chiangs-son-has-tightened-hold-on-taiwan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again from 1981 to 1982,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} for helping a pro-[[Taiwan independence]] legal scholar, [[Peng Ming-min]], escape to Japan in 1970;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Loa Iok-Sin| title = Peng tells details of escape from KMT| work = Taipei Times| accessdate = 2017-06-15| date = 2008-09-21| url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/21/2003423802}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though Li himself had a long history of being an advocate of [[reunification]].

Throughout the 1970s, Li received much international attention for his imprisonment. He was highlighted by [[Amnesty International]] as one of the three most important political prisoners in Taiwan in 1974.

After his release, Li continued to publish articles in magazines and newspapers, criticizing the [[Kuomintang]] government. Ninety-six of his books were banned in Taiwan until 1991.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the 1980s he also sponsored numerous anti-Kuomintang magazines.

His novel ''Mountaintop Love'' ({{lang|zh-hant|《上山．上山．愛》}}), about a mother and a daughter who fall in love with the same man, though several years apart, established Li's status as a prominent novelist. His novel ''Martyrs' Shrine: The Story of the Reform Movement of 1898 in China'' (北京法源寺), is about the beginning and the failure of the [[Hundred Days' Reform]]. Li also published his [[autobiography]] in 2001, revealing more than ten of his romantic affairs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}  The bulk of his work, however, is non-fiction and consists mainly of essays and historical commentaries.

==Entry into politics==
Li strongly supported the idea of "[[One country, two systems]]" proposed by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. He believed that the [[Chinese reunification|unification of China]] was inevitable and at one point advocated immediate surrender of Taiwan to the PRC. He thought that an immediate reunification was more beneficial for Taiwan. This, combined with his past as a political dissident and his witty writing style, had made him a popular figure among the supporters of Chinese reunification. It also made him an unpopular figure among the supporters of [[Taiwan independence]].

Li participated in the [[ROC presidential election, 2000|presidential election in 2000]] as a candidate for the [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]]. Li usually played the role of a political gadfly, and his campaign was largely symbolic. He took the election as an opportunity to "educate" the people of Taiwan. Both Li and his party publicly encouraged people to vote for [[James Soong]]. During the presidential debates, Li even stated that he was not planning to vote for himself and that people should vote for Soong.

Since the 2000 presidential election, Li had bitterly spoken out against pro-independence Nobel laureate [[Yuan T. Lee]], who publicly supported [[Chen Shui-bian]]. He also accused former President [[Lee Teng-hui]] of corruption. In October 2004, Li ran in the [[ROC legislative election, 2004|December 11 legislative election]] as a non-partisan candidate of the South [[Taipei]] constituency, and was subsequently elected to be the last winning place. He took office as an independent legislator on 1 February 2005.

In February 2005, Li held a press conference, accusing the PFP leader, [[James Soong]] of having changed his opposition towards military weapons purchase from the United States under the influence of people of pro-American inclination, people with [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] backgrounds and arms traders who would receive kick-backs. Li threatened Soong that he would reveal the names of the people with CIA backgrounds, who were influencing Soong, to the general public unless Soong reverted to his previous opposition position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=中廣新聞網|title=李敖警告宋楚瑜軍購別鬆手 否則爆出身邊CIA臥底|url=http://news.yam.com/bcc/politics/200502/20050224323150.html|website=news.yam.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050506043707/http://news.yam.com/bcc/politics/200502/20050224323150.html|archivedate=May 6, 2005|date=February 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFP legislators dismissed the accusation and responded that Li Ao should reveal his evidence to support his story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=中廣新聞網|title=親民黨立委：李敖有證據就直接講|url=http://news.yam.com/bcc/politics/200502/20050224324480.html|website=news.yam.com|archiveurl=http://news.yam.com/bcc/politics/200502/20050224324480.html|archivedate=May 6, 2005|date=February 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, in June, Li claimed to the Taiwanese press that he had exclusive information from the CIA concerning the [[3-19 shooting incident]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} He alleged that the real motive of the killer was to assassinate the Vice-President [[Annette Lu]] in order to garner sympathy votes for [[Chen Shui-bian]], and that the killer had been condoned by the governing party for ulterior political reasons.  After flashing several allegedly CIA-endorsed documents to reporters, he mailed them to Annette Lu, claiming that she needed to know the truth about the assassination attempt to the full extent.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

On 19 September 2005, Li returned to Mainland China for the first time in 56 years.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} He was invited to give speeches at [[Peking University]], [[Tsinghua University]] and [[Fudan University]] where he was warmly received, and the trip was claimed to have had significant impact on observers of [[Cross-Strait relations]]. His speech at Peking University was particularly noteworthy as Li publicly urged the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to protect the [[freedom of speech]] as laid down in the constitution of the PRC. He also praised the achievement of the CCP in bringing economic progress and prosperity; at one point he even [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989#Forbidden topic in mainland China|alluded]] to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and took it as an example to sustain his point that freedom should be obtained through "cleverer" means, rather than mass revolutions that could result in numerous deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/23/international/asia/23china.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin China Lectured by Taiwan Ally], New York Times, September 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sina.com/taiwan_hk/1/2005/0921/46842.html Gadfly Taiwan writer calls for more academic freedom in address to mainland students], Associated Press, September 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zonaeuropa.com/20050924_1.htm Li Ao's Speech At Beijing University], English translation&lt;/ref&gt;

Li was a candidate for the [[Republic of China municipal elections, 2006|2006 Taipei Mayoral election]], and a candidate for the [[Republic of China legislative election, 2012|2012 Legislative Yuan elections]], campaigning in Taipei City District 8 under the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP) banner. Li also satirized Mao Zedong's [[Little Red Book]] in his article.

On 24 October 2006, Li sprayed [[tear gas]] and wielded a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] during a Legislative Yuan National Defense Committee meeting, forcing several members of the parliament to flee. He was attempting to stop debate on purchasing attack submarines and [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot]] anti-aircraft missiles for $16 billion from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6081738.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Taiwan MP in 'tear gas' protest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also wearing the [[Guy Fawkes mask]] from ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/06/1024/14/2U74K2Q7000120GU.html News.163.com: Li Ao wears gas mask and sprays tear gas in Legislative Yuan] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar}}

'''Male privilege''' is a concept within [[sociology]] for examining social, economic, and political advantages or rights that are available to [[men]] solely on the basis of their [[sex]]. A man's access to these benefits may vary depending on how closely they match their society's [[hegemonic masculinity|ideal masculine norm]].

[[Feminist]] scholarship in the area of [[women's studies]] during the 1970s produced the earliest academic studies of privilege. These studies began by examining barriers to [[Social equity|equity]] between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the [[intersectionality]] and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[social class]], [[sexual orientation]], and other forms of social classification.

== Overview ==

Special privileges and status are granted to males in [[patriarchal]] societies.&lt;ref name="Phillips &amp; Phillips"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Debby A. |last2=Phillips |first2=John R. |editor1-first=Jodi |editor1-last=O'Brien |title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society: Volume 2 |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-0916-7 |pages= 683–685 |chapter=Privilege, Male |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;pg=PT735}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keith |first1=Thomas |title=Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture: An Intersectional Approach to the Complexities and Challenges of Male Identity |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-31-759534-2 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_niDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29 |chapter=Patriarchy, Male Privilege, and the Consequences of Living in a Patriarchal Society |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are societies defined by male supremacy, in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, [[social privilege]] and control of property. With systemic subordination of women, males gain economic, political, social, educational, and practical advantages that are more or less unavailable to women.{{refn|name=Keith}} The long-standing and unquestioned nature of such patriarchal systems, reinforced over generations, tends to make privilege invisible to holders; it can lead males who benefit from such privilege to ascribe their special status to their owned individual merits and achievements, rather than to unearned advantages.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}}

In the field of [[sociology]], male privilege is seen as embedded in the structure of social institutions, as when men are often assigned authority over women in the workforce, and benefit from women's traditional caretaking role.&lt;ref name="Rohlinger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rohlinger |first=Deana A. |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=G. |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.M. |title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444392647 |pages=473–474 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;q=%22male+privilege%22 |chapter=Privilege}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privileges can be classified as either ''positive'' or ''negative'', depending on how they affect the rest of society.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} Women's studies scholar [[Peggy McIntosh]] writes: {{quote|We might at least start by distinguishing between positive advantages that we can work to spread, to the point where they are not advantages at all but simply part of the normal civic and social fabric, and negative types of advantage that unless rejected will always reinforce our present hierarchies.&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McIntosh |first1=Peggy |title=White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women's Studies |url=http://www.ehcounseling.com/materials/WHITE_PRIVILEGE_MALE_04-02-2003.pdf |publisher=Wellesley College, Center for Research on Women |location=Wellesley, MA |date=1988 |id=Working Paper 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Positive advantages include having such things as adequate nutrition, shelter, and health care, whereas negative advantages accompanying male privilege include such things as the expectation that a man will have a better chance than a comparably qualified woman of being hired for a job, as well as being paid more than a woman for the same job.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}}

==Scope==

Privilege is not shared equally by all males. Those who most closely match the ideal masculine norm benefit the most from privilege.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}}{{refn|name=Coston &amp; Kimmel}} In patriarchal societies this ideal, which is pervasive but unattainable for most men, has been described as being "white, heterosexual, stoic, wealthy, strong, tough, competitive, and autonomous".{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} [[Men's studies]] scholars refer to this ideal masculine norm as ''[[hegemonic masculinity]]''. While essentially all males benefit from privilege to some degree, those who visibly differ from the norm may not benefit fully in certain situations, especially in the company of other men that more closely match it.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} Men who have experienced [[bullying]] and [[domestic violence]] in youth, in particular, may not accept that they are beneficiaries of privilege. Such forms of coercive violence are linked to the idea of ''[[toxic masculinity]]'', a specific model of manhood that creates hierarchies of dominance in which some are favored and others are harmed.{{refn|name=Keith}}

The invisibility of male privilege can be seen for instance in discussions of the [[gender pay gap in the United States]]; the gap is usually referred to by stating women's earnings as a percentage of men's. However, using women's pay as the baseline highlights the dividend that males receive as greater earnings (32% in 2005).{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} In [[commerce]], male dominance in the ownership and control of [[financial capital]] and other forms of wealth has produced disproportionate male influence over the [[working class]]es and the hiring and firing of employees. In addition, a disproportionate burden is placed upon women in employment when they are expected to be solely responsible for [[child care]]; they may be more likely to be fired or be denied advancement in their profession, thus putting them at an economic disadvantage relative to men.{{refn|name=Keith}}

Biologically "male" privilege is only one of the many [[Hierarchy|power structures]] that may exist within a given society.&lt;ref name="Foucault1976"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel |title=The History of Sexuality, Volume I|year=1976|publisher=Vintage|isbn=0-679-72469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2017}} The term "male privilege" does not apply to a solitary occurrence of the use of power, but rather describes one of many systemic power structures that are interdependent and interlinked throughout societies and cultures.&lt;ref name="Narayan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Narayan|first=Uma|title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism.|year=1997|publisher=London: Routledge|isbn=0-415-91419-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed by Paula Rothernberg in her novel ''Invisible Privilege: A Memoir About Race, Class, and Gender'', male privilege often takes institutionalized and embedded forms from which men may directly benefit. These instances of male privilege systems may attribute to male over empowerment and can help explain man’s sense of centrality in some of the most powerful institutions.&lt;ref name=Rothenberg&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rothernberg |first1=Paula S. |title=Invisible Privilege: A Memoir About Race, Class, and Gender |date=2000 |publisher=University of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2017}}

An example of male privilege in institutionalized academic settings can be observed by the prevalence of men in how curriculums are formed and history and literature is taught across the [[United States]].{{refn|name=Rothenberg}}{{Better source|date=August 2017}} Historically, all those who have held the title of [[List of Presidents of the United States|President of the United States]] have been male. American government on the national level, including the [[United States Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives]], is also predominantly male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/economies/#economy=USA|title=Economies|newspaper=Global Gender Gap Report 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

The earliest academic studies of privilege appeared with [[feminist]] scholars' work in the area of [[women's studies]] during the 1970s. Such scholarship began by examining barriers to [[Social equity|equity]] between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the [[intersectionality]] and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[social class]], [[sexual orientation]], and other forms of social classification.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}}

[[Peggy McIntosh]], one of the first feminist scholars to examine male privilege,  wrote about both male privilege and [[white privilege]], using the metaphor of the "invisible knapsack" to describe a set of advantages borne, often unaware and unacknowledged, by members of privileged groups.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} According to McIntosh, privilege is not a result of a concerted effort to oppress those of the opposite gender; however, the inherent benefits that men gain from the systemic bias put women at an innate disadvantage. The benefits of this unspoken privilege may be described as special provisions, tools, relationships, or various other opportunities. According to McIntosh, this privilege may actually negatively affect men's development as human beings, and few question that the existing structure of advantages may be challenged or changed.{{refn|name=McIntosh}}

Efforts to examine the role of privilege in students' lives has become a regular feature of university education in North America.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}}&lt;ref name="Coston &amp; Kimmel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coston |first1=Bethany M. |last2=Kimmel |first2=Michael |year=2012 |title=Seeing Privilege Where It Isn't: Marginalized Masculinities and the Intersectionality of Privilege |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=97–111 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01738.x |issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; By drawing attention to the presence of privilege (including male, white, and other forms) in the lives of students, educators have sought to foster insights that can help students contribute to [[social justice]].{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} Such efforts include McIntosh's "invisible knapsack" model of privilege and the "Male Privilege Checklist".{{refn|name=Coston &amp; Kimmel}}

Historically, the third-person singular pronoun "[[he]]" is used as a sex-indefinite, [[generic antecedent|generic]] form for all people (e.g. "anyone can do it if he tries") whereas the use of "she" to refer to people in general is not allowed.&lt;ref name=wildman/&gt;&lt;ref name=bwh/&gt;&lt;ref name=kleinman/&gt; Masculine generics were first introduced by [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive grammarians]] in the 19th century who argued that "he" was the only correct sex-indefinite referent.&lt;ref name=henley/&gt;&lt;ref name=bodine/&gt;&lt;ref name=hegarty/&gt; Prior to that, singular "they" and "he or she" had been widely used in written and spoken English.&lt;ref name=henley/&gt;&lt;ref name=bodine/&gt;&lt;ref name=hegarty/&gt; In 1850 a special [[Interpretation Act 1850|Act of Parliament]] was passed in the [[United Kingdom]] that legally proscribed singular "they" and "he or she" in favor of "he", especially to shorten the language used in Acts of Parliament.&lt;ref name=henley&gt;{{Cite book |last= Henley |first= N.

==Criticism==

Many men may respond to discussions of male privilege by saying that they do not feel that they have been given any unearned advantages, such as in their struggles to find success in employment, education, or relationships.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} Advocates for [[men's rights]] and [[father's rights]] as well as [[anti-feminist]] men often accept that men's traditional roles are damaging to men but deny that men as a group have institutional power and privilege, and argue that men are now victims relative to women.&lt;ref name="Flood 2007 Men"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clatterbaugh |first=K. |editor1-last=Flood |editor1-first=Michael |display-editors=etal |title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge  |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-33343-6 |chapter=Anti-feminism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jh7y6ELc90YC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some self-identified feminist men take active roles in challenging oppressive [[sexism]], arguing that male privilege is deeply linked to the oppression of women. They describe men's oppressive behaviors as cultural traits learned within patriarchal social systems, rather than inborn biological traits.{{refn|name=Phillips &amp; Phillips}} Advocates within the broader [[men's movement]] oriented towards [[profeminism]] or anti-sexism argue that traditional [[gender role]]s harm both men and women. "Liberal" profeminism tends to stress the ways men suffer from these traditional roles, while more "radical" profeminism tends to emphasize male privilege and [[sexual inequality]].&lt;ref name="Flood 2007 Men"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flood |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Flood |editor1-last=Flood |editor1-first=Michael |display-editors=etal |title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities |date =2007 |publisher=Routledge  |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-33343-6 |chapter= Men's movement |chapterurl=http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20Men's%20Movements,%20IEMM%202007.pdf |pages=418&amp;ndash;422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men may be also be advocates of women's rights but fail to realize that their privilege as a whole, is a part of the issue at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|title=Women's Voices Feminist Visions|date=2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|page=54|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=November 2017}}

Reasons given for preferring sons to daughters include sons' role in religious family rites, which daughters are not permitted to perform, and the belief that sons are permanent members of the birth family whereas daughters belong to their husband's family after marriage in accordance with [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]] tradition. Other reasons include [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] customs whereby only sons can carry on the family name, the obligation to pay [[dowry]] to a daughter's husband or his family, and the expectation that sons will support their birth parents financially while it is regarded as undesirable or shameful to receive financial support from daughters.&lt;ref name=lai-wan/&gt;&lt;ref name=singh/&gt;

'''Mandan''' (Mandan: ''Nų́ų́ʔetaa íroo'') is an extinct [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] language of [[North Dakota]] in the United States.

== Use and revitalization efforts ==
By 2009, there was just one fluent speaker of Mandan, Dr. [[Edwin Benson]] (1931–2016).&lt;ref name="benson"&gt;''The Missoulian.'' 11 May 2009. Jodi Rave. "[http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2009/05/11/news/mtregional/news06.txt The last speaker: UND to honor Mandan, last to speak Nu'eta as 1st language]."&lt;/ref&gt; The language is being taught in local school programs to encourage the use of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandan is taught at [[Fort Berthold Community College]] along with the [[Hidatsa language|Hidatsa]] and [[Arikara language]]s.&lt;ref name="benson" /&gt; Linguist Mauricio Mixco of the [[University of Utah]] has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993. As of 2007, extensive materials in the Mandan language at the college and at the [[North Dakota Heritage Center]], in [[Bismarck, North Dakota]], remained to be processed, according to linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Mandan was initially thought to be closely related to [[Hidatsa language|Hidatsa]] and [[Crow language|Crow]]. However, since Mandan has had [[language contact]] with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured and is currently undetermined. Thus, Mandan is most often considered to be a separate branch of the Siouan family.

Mandan has two main [[dialect]]s: Nuptare and Nuetare. 

Only the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. In 1999, there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive.&lt;ref name="speakers"&gt;Personal communication from Mauricio Mixco in 1999, reported in Parks &amp; Rankin. 2001. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Benson]], the last surviving fluent Mandan speaker, died in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Edwin-Benson-last-known-fluent-speaker-of-Mandan-passes-away-at-85-405723515.html|title=Edwin Benson, last-known fluent speaker of Mandan, passes away at 85|last=Skurzewski|first=Joe|publisher=kfyrtv.com|date=December 9, 2016|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language received much attention from White Americans because of the supposedly lighter skin color of the Mandan people, which they speculated was due to an ultimate European origin. In the 1830s [[Prince Maximilian of Wied]] spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and prepared a comparison list of Mandan and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] words (he thought that the Mandan might be displaced Welsh).&lt;ref name="maximilian"&gt;Chafe. 1976b. p. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a Mandan/Welsh connection was also supported by [[George Catlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Catlin|Catlin, G.]] ''Die Indianer Nordamerikas'' Verlag Lothar Borowsky&lt;/ref&gt;

Will and Spinden (p.&amp;nbsp;188) reports that the [[medicine men]] had their own secret language.

==Morphology==

Mandan is a [[subject–object–verb]] language.

Mandan has a system of [[allocutive agreement]] and so different grammatical forms may be used that depend on the [[gender]] of the [[addressee]]. Questions asked of men must use the [[suffix]] ''-oʔsha:'' the suffix ''-oʔną'' is used to ask of women. Likewise, the [[indicative]] suffix is ''-oʔsh'' to address men, ''-oʔre'' to address women. The same goes for the [[Imperative mood|imperative]]: ''-ta'' (male), ''-ną'' (female).&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;Hollow. 1970. p. 457 (in Mithun 1999. p. 280).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandan verbs include a set of postural verbs, which encode the shapes of the subject of the verb:&lt;ref name="mithun2001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mithun | first = Marianne | title = The Languages of Native North America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | pages = 115–116 | isbn = 978-0-521-29875-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| ''wérex'' || &lt;u&gt;ną́k&lt;/u&gt;oʔsh
|-
| ''wérex'' || ną́k-oʔsh
|-
| pot ||  sit-&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 'A pot was there (sitting).'
|}

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| ''mį́ʔtixteną'' || &lt;u&gt;té&lt;/u&gt;roomąkoʔsh
|-
| ''mį́ʔti-xte-ną'' || &lt;u&gt;té&lt;/u&gt;-roomąkoʔsh
|-
| village-big-&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;emphatic&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;u&gt;stand&lt;/u&gt;-&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;narrative.past&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 'There was a big village.'
|}

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| ''mą́ątah'' || &lt;u&gt;mą́k&lt;/u&gt;omąkoʔsh
|-
| ''mą́ątah'' || &lt;u&gt;mą́k&lt;/u&gt;-omąkoʔsh
|-
| river || &lt;u&gt;lie&lt;/u&gt;-&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;narrative.past&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 'The river was there.'
|}

The English translations are not "A pot was sitting there," "A big village stood there," or "The river lay there." That reflects the fact that the postural categorization is required in such Mandan [[locative]] statements.

==Vocabulary==

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Mandan, like many other North American languages, has elements of [[sound symbolism]] in its vocabulary. A {{IPA|/s/}} sound often denotes smallness/less intensity, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} denotes medium-ness, {{IPA|/x/}} denotes largeness/greater intensity:&lt;ref name="soundsymb"&gt;Hollow &amp; Parks 1980. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''síire'' "yellow"
* ''shíire'' "tawny"
* ''xíire'' "brown"
* ''seró'' "tinkle"
* ''xeró'' "rattle"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10897">{{Forms of government}}
'''Mixed government''' (or a '''mixed constitution''') is a form of government that combines elements of [[democracy]] (polity), [[aristocracy]] and [[monarchy]], making impossible their respective degenerations which are conceived as [[anarchy]], [[oligarchy]] and [[tyranny]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filosofico.net/Antologia_file/AntologiaP/POLIBIO_%20QUELLA%20ROMANA_%20UNA%20COST.htm Polibio, Storie]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was popularized during [[classical antiquity]] in order to describe the stability, the innovation and the success of the [[republic]] as a form of government developed under the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitution]].

Unlike classical democracy, aristocracy or monarchy, under a mixed government rulers are elected by citizens rather than acquiring their positions by inheritance or [[sortition]] (at the Greco-Roman time, sortition was conventionally regarded as the principal characteristic of [[classical democracy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Headlam |first=James Wycliffe |title=Election by Lot at Athens |date=1891 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a mixed government was studied during the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Reason]] by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and others. It was and still is a very important theory among supporters of [[republicanism]]. Various schools have described modern polities, such as the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], as possessing mixed constitutions.

==Ancient Greek philosophers==
[[Plato]] in his book ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' divided governments into five basic types (four being existing forms and one being Plato's ideal form, which exists "only in speech"): 
*[[democracy]]: government by the many
*[[oligarchy]]: government by the few
*[[timocracy]]: government by the honored or valued
*[[tyranny]]: government by one for himself
*[[aristocracy]]: government by the best (Plato's ideal form of government)

Plato found flaws with all existing forms of government and thus concluded that aristocracy, which emphasizes virtue and wisdom, is the purest form of government. [[Aristotle]] largely embraced Plato's ideas and in his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] three types (excluding timocracy) are discussed in detail. Aristotle considers constitutional government (a combination of oligarchy and democracy under law) the ideal form of government, but he observes that none of the three are healthy and that states will cycle between the three forms in an abrupt and chaotic process known as the [[kyklos]] or [[anacyclosis]]. In his ''Politics'', he lists a number of theories of how to create a stable government. One of these options is creating a government that is a mix of all three forms of government.

[[Polybius]] argued that most states have a government system that is composed of "more than one" of these basic principles, which then was called a mixed government system.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich August Winkler (2012), ''Geschichte des Westens. Von den Anfängen in der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Third Edition, Munich (Germany), {{ISBN|978-3-406-59235-5}}, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Era==
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
The ideal of a mixed government was popularized by [[Polybius]], who saw the [[Roman Republic]] as a manifestation of Aristotle's theory (Millar, 2002). Monarchy was embodied by the [[consul]]s, the aristocracy by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and democracy by the elections and great public gatherings of the [[Roman assemblies|assemblies]]. Each institution complements and also checks the others, presumably guaranteeing stability and prosperity.  Polybius was very influential and his ideas were embraced by [[Cicero]] (Millar, 2002).

==Middle Ages==
[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] argued in his letter ''On Kingship'' that a monarchy, with some limitations set by an aristocracy and democratic elements, was the best and most just form of government. He also emphasized the monarch's duty to uphold the divine and [[natural law]] and abide by limitations imposed on the monarch by custom and existing law.

==Renaissance, Reformation and Enlightenment==
[[Cicero]] became extremely well regarded during the [[Renaissance]] and many of his ideas were embraced. Polybius was also rediscovered and the positive view of mixed governments became a central aspect of Renaissance political science integrated into the developing notion of [[republicanism]]. In order to minimise the misuse of political power, [[John Calvin]] advocated a mixture of [[aristocracy]] and [[democracy]] as the best form of government. He praised the advantages of democracy: "It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its overlords and magistrates". To further safeguard the rights and liberties of ordinary men and women, Calvin also favored the distribution of power to several political institutions ([[separation of powers]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in: ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', Third Edition, Stuttgart (Germany), 1958, col. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed government theories became extremely popular in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and were discussed in detail by [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Apart from his contemporaries, only Montesquieu became widely acknowledged as the author of a concept of separation of powers (although he wrote rather on their "distribution").&lt;ref&gt;Winkler (2012), pp. 184ff&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, for example, Heinrich August Winkler, the notion also influenced the writers of the [[United States Constitution]] who based the idea of [[checks and balances]], in part, upon the ancient theory.&lt;ref&gt;Winkler (2012), p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of Britain during the Victorian Era with a Parliament composed of the Sovereign (monarchy), a House of Lords (aristocracy) and House of Commons (democracy) is a prime example of a mixed constitution in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich August Winkler (2012), pp. 151ff&lt;/ref&gt; This political system had its roots in two closely related developments in seventeenth-century England. First, a series of political upheavals—the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] (Puritan Revolution), the [[exclusion crisis]] of 1679–1681, and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. Second, an intense public debate about the best, most liberal and most stable form of government. Its main participants were [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]], [[Algernon Sidney]] and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]]. Their thinking became the basis of the radical [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. It "described two sorts of threats to political freedom: a general decay of the people which would invite the intrusion of evil and despotic rulers, and the encroachment of executive authority upon the legislature, the attempt that power always made to subdue the liberty protected by mixed government. The [[American Revolution]] revealed that this radical Whig understanding of politics had embedded itself deeply in American minds. [...] Radical Whig perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] culture that had always verged on [[Puritanism]]. That moral decay threatened free government could not come as a surprise to a people whose fathers had fled England to escape sin".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Middlekauff (2005 ), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt; 18th-century Whigs, or [[commonwealthmen]], such as [[John Trenchard (writer)|John Trenchard]], [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Thomas Gordon]] and [[Benjamin Hoadly]] "praised the mixed constitution of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and they attributed English liberty to it; and like Locke they postulated a state of nature from which rights arose which the civil polity, created by mutual consent, guaranteed; they argued that a contract formed government and sovereignty resided in the people". So mixed government is the core of both the British form of modern-era democracy, [[constitutional monarchy]], and the American model: [[republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkler (2012), pp. 142ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff (2005), pp. 136ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas S. Kidd (2010), ''God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution'', New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|978-0-465-00235-1}}, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The "father" of the American constitution, [[James Madison]], stated in Federalist Paper No. 40 that the constitutional convention of 1787 created a mixed constitution. Madison referred to Polybius in Federalist Paper No. 63.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Heinrich August Winkler (2012), pp. 290ff&lt;/ref&gt; However, much more important was that "most" ideas that the American Revolutionaries put into their political system "were a part of the great tradition of the eighteenth-century commonwealthmen, the radical Whig ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff (2005), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==
One school of scholarship based mainly in the United States considers mixed government to be the central characteristic of a republic and holds that the United States has rule by the one (the President) (monarchy), the few (the Senate, which was originally supposed to represent the States) (aristocracy) and the many (House of Representatives) (democracy). Another school of thought in the United States says the Supreme Court has taken on the role of "The Best" in recent decades, ensuring a continuing separation of authority by offsetting the direct election of senators and preserving the mixing of democracy, aristocracy and monarchy.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===European Union===
According to a view, in the [[European Union]] context the [[Commission President]] represents the rule by the one while the Council represents the aristocratic dimension and the Parliament represents the democratic dimension.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=WpPjNSLk1twC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=FtGYsMMFVl&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=EU+mixed+constitution&amp;hl=it&amp;output=html_text Explaining the stability of the EU through the concept of a Mixed Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nancy Anne Kress''' (born January 20, 1948) is an American [[science fiction]] writer.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; She began writing in 1976 but has achieved her greatest notice since the publication of her [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula award|Nebula]]-winning 1991 novella ''[[Beggars in Spain]]'', which she later expanded into a novel with the same title. She has also won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novella]] in 2013 for ''After the Fall, Before the Fall, During the Fall'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2013/05/2012-nebula-awards-winners/|title=2012 Nebula Award Winners|journal=Locus Online|date = 18 May 2013|accessdate= 21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 for ''Yesterday's Kin''.

In addition to her novels, Kress has  written numerous short stories and is a regular columnist for ''[[Writer's Digest]]''.  She is a regular at [[Clarion workshop|Clarion writing workshops]] and at [[The Writers Center]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Home Page"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sff.net/people/nankress/ |publisher=Nancy Kress |title=Nancy Kress Home Page |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516055048/http://www.sff.net/people/nankress/ |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Winter of 2008/09, Nancy Kress was the  Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the [[University of Leipzig]]'s Institute for American Studies in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Picador Guest Professorship for Literature|url=http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de/picador|accessdate=21 July 2015|date = 2015|website=American Studies: Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Born '''Nancy Anne Koningisor '''in [[Buffalo, New York]] and grown up in [[East Aurora, New York|East Aurora]], she attended college at [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh|SUNY Plattsburgh]] and graduated with an M.A. in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.sfsite.com/10b/nk91.htm|title=A Conversation With Nancy Kress|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before starting her writing career she taught elementary school and then college English. In 1973, she moved to Rochester to marry Michael Joseph Kress.  They had two sons, and divorced in 1984.  At that time, she went to work at Stanton and Hucko, an advertising agency.
In 1998, she married fellow author [[Charles Sheffield]], who died in 2002 of a [[brain tumor]]. Kress moved back to [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to be near her grown children.&lt;ref name="Home Page" /&gt; She recently (2009) moved to Seattle.&lt;ref name="YearsBestSF"&gt;{{cite book |title=Year's Best SF15 |page=119 |author=David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer | publisher=Eos Books |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011 she married author Jack Skillingstead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nancykress.blogspot.com/2011/02/las-vegas.html|first=Nancy|last=Kress|title=Las Vegas|date=11 February 2011|website=Nancy's Blog|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wesleyan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evens|first1=Arthur|title=The Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction|date=2010|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Kress tends to write technically realistic [[hard science fiction]] stories, often set in a fairly near future.
Her fiction often involves [[genetic engineering]], and, to a lesser degree, [[artificial intelligence]].  There are many technologies shared between stories, including "genemod" to refer to genetic engineering, and foamcast, a lightweight and sturdy building material that appears in many of her novels and short stories. By conducting extensive research she keeps her topics within the realm of possibility; however, as Kress clarified for one [[Locus (magazine)]] interviewer, "[Sheffield] pronounces it ''science'' fiction, and I pronounce it science ''fiction''."&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt; She loves [[ballet]], and has written stories around it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10470">'''National memory''' is a form of [[collective memory]] defined by shared experiences and culture. It is an integral part to [[national identity]].

It represents one specific form of [[cultural memory]], which makes an essential contribution to national [[group cohesion]]. Historically national communities have drawn upon commemorative ceremonies and monuments, [[myth]]s and rituals, glorified individuals, objects, and events in their own history to produce a common narrative&lt;!--worldview, conception--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory, History, and Colonialism|url=https://www.ghil.ac.uk/fileadmin/redaktion/dokumente/bulletin/GHIL%20Bulletin%20Supplement%201%20(2009).pdf|publisher=German Historical Institute London|accessdate=3 March 2017|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lorraine Ryan, national memory is based on the public's reception of national historic narratives and the ability of people to affirm the legitimacy of these narratives.
&lt;!--'''National remembrance''' ...--&gt;

==Conflicting versions, dynamicity, manipulation and subjectivity==
National memory typically consists of a shared interpretation of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=prague&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paces|first1=Cynthia|title=Prague Panoramas: National Memory and Sacred Space in the Twentieth Century|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=9780822977674|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ZztTm-zrjIYC|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interpretations can vary and sometimes compete.&lt;ref name=prague/&gt; They can get challenged and augmented by a range of interest groups, fighting to have their histories acknowledged, documented and commemorated and reshape national stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weedon|first1=Chris|last2=Jordan|first2=Glenn|title=Collective memory: theory and politics|journal=Social Semiotics|date=April 2012|volume=22|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1080/10350330.2012.664969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often national memory is adjusted to offer a politicized vision of the past to make a political position appear consistent with national identity.&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Samuel J.|title=Twice-divided Nation: The Civil War and National Memory in the Transatlantic World|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109024135|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=S7oq4-MZcr4C|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it profoundly affects how historical facts are perceived and recorded and may circumvent or appropriate facts.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; A repertoire of discursive strategies functions to emotionalize national narrative and nationalize personal pasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Geoffrey M.|title=Emotional Remembering: The Pragmatics of National Memory|journal=Ethos|date=December 1999|volume=27|issue=4|pages=505–529|doi=10.1525/eth.1999.27.4.505|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229796645_Emotional_Remembering_The_Pragmatics_of_National_Memory|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memory has been used calculatedly by governments for dynastic, political, religious and cultural purposes since as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillis|first1=John R.|title=Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691029253|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WAB4sd2nFyMC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing of memory by the [[culture industry]] and its instrumentalisation for political purposes can both be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

Lorraine Ryan notes that individual memory both shapes and is shaped by national memory, and that there is a competition between the dominant and individual memories of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lorraine|title=Cosmopolitan memory and national memory conflicts: On the dynamics of their interaction|journal=Journal of Sociology|date=28 November 2012|volume=50|issue=4|pages=501–514|doi=10.1177/1440783312467097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyung Park states that the nation is continuously revived, re-imagined, reconstituted, through shared memories among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Hyung yu|title=Shared national memory as intangible heritage|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=April 2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=520–539|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.11.013|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256987216_Shared_national_memory_as_intangible_heritage_Re-imagining_Two_Koreas_as_One_Nation|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memories may also conflict&lt;!--/collide--&gt; with the other nations' collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomian|first1=Krzysztof|title=Divided memory: European sites of memory as political and cultural phenomenon|url=http://www.enrs.eu/pl/articles/219-divided-memory|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=pl-pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the media==
Reports that are narrated&lt;!--/written--&gt; in terms of national memory characterize the past in ways that merge the past, the present and the future into "a single ongoing tale".&lt;ref name="medmem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garde-Hansen|first1=Joanne|title=Media and Memory|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748688883|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xdpvAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Nora]] argues that a "democratisation of history" allows for emancipatory versions of the past to surface:&lt;ref name=ww2.0&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruyn|first1=Dieter De|title=World War 2.0: Commemorating War and Holocaust in Poland through Facebook|issn=2043-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|National memory cannot come into being until the historical framework of the nation has been shattered. It reflects the abandonment of the traditional channels and modes of transmission of the past and the desacralisation of such primary sites of initiation as the school, the family, the museum, and the monument: what was once the responsibility of these institutions has now flowed over into the public domain and been taken over by the media and tourist industry|source=Nora 1998, 363&lt;ref name="medmem"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;}}
&lt;!--More: &lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;--&gt;

However, national history being passed on by the culture industry, such as by [[historical films]], can be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

===International media===
{{See also|Global news flow|Category:Cultural exchange|International communication}}
Nations' memories can be shared across nations via media such as the [[Internet]]&lt;!-- and thereby help globalize national memories--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ANDREWS|first1=MAGGIE|last2=BAGOT-JEWITT|first2=CHARLIE|last3=HUNT|first3=NIGEL|title=Introduction: National memory and war|journal=Journal of War &amp; Culture Studies|date=8 December 2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=283–288|doi=10.1386/jwcs.4.3.283_7|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269606175_Introduction_National_memory_and_war|language=en|issn=1752-6272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects and functions ==
National memory can be a force of cohesion as well as division and conflict. It can foster constructive national reforms, international communities and agreements,&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; dialogue as well as deepen problematic courses and rhetoric.

[[Identity crisis]] can occur due to bad memories (such as national crimes)&lt;!--cn--&gt; or the absence of a belief in a shared past.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Often new developments, processes, problems and events are [[Sensemaking|made sense of]] and contextualized by drawing from national memory.

== Critical national memory ==
Critical history or historic memory cuts from national memory's tradition centric to national heritage and orients itself towards a specialized study of history in a more [[sociological]] [[Historical sociology|manner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koshar|first1=Rudy J.|title=Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and National Memory in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807862629|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=yVzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that the unthinkable ought not to be unmasked but that instead what made it thinkable should be reconstructed and that the difficulty of discussing the non-places or the bad places of national memory make it necessary to include forgetfulness and amnesia in the concept.&lt;ref name=places&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montaño|first1=Eugenia Allier|title=Places of memory. Is the concept applicable to the analysis of memorial struggles?

National memory may lead to questioning the nation as it is as well as its identity and imply a societal negotiation of what the country wishes to be as a nation. To understand the links between memory, forgetfulness, identity and the imaginary construction of the nation analysis of the discourse in the places of memory is fundamental as in all writings of national history an image of the nation is being restructured.&lt;ref name=places/&gt;

==Films==
===''Night at the Museum'' (2006)===
{{Main|Night at the Museum}}
When Larry Daley ([[Ben Stiller]]), a divorced father who can't seem to keep a job for more than a week, applies for a job at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], he is assigned as a night guard. However, a seemingly easy job turns out to be a wild ride when he finds that an ancient spell has caused the "inhabitants" of the museum to come to life.

===''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian'' (2009)===
{{Main|Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian}}
Two years after the previous film, several of the exhibits are transferred to the Smithsonian in Washington, DC, and Dexter the monkey steals the tablet of Ahkmenrah, Larry must break in and team up with his old friends, and new ally Amelia Earheart to get it back from Ahkmenrah's resurrected evil brother Kahmunrah before morning.

===''Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb'' (2014)===
{{Main|Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb}}
Five years after the previous film, Larry discovers that the tablet of Ahkmenrah's magic is failing. So he, his now-teenage son Nick, along with Teddy Roosevelt, Sacagewea, Jedidiah, Octavius, Dexter, Attila the Hun, and a new caveman figure named Laaa (who looks like Larry) travel to a fictional version of the [[British Museum]] to undo the curse with the help of Ahkmenrah's parents, and the narcissistic Sir Lancelot of Camelot before the tablet's magic disappears forever.

'''''Not Private Eye''''' was a one-off spoof of the British satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="Magforum"&gt;Magforum [http://www.magforum.com/notprivateeye.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The spoof of ''Private Eye'' was published in December 1986 by [[Robert Maxwell]], to celebrate his £55,000 [[libel]] victory over ''Private Eye'' caused by an accusation of attempted [[Cash for Honours|cash for peerages]]. It was printed using the facilities of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', of which Maxwell was the owner.

''Private Eye'', meanwhile, was trying to sell a Christmas edition (at £1 rather than the then-usual 45p) in order to cover the costs of the libel case, estimated at £255,000. [[W H Smith]] was refusing to stock it.&lt;ref name="Magforum"&gt;Magforum [http://www.magforum.com/notprivateeye.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time [[Peter Cook]] led a "raid" on the ''Mirror'' offices which, according to [[Ian Hislop]], he began by sending a crate of [[whisky]] to the people working on ''Not Private Eye'', guessing that they would prefer not to be doing it. The group then successfully entered the Mirror offices, removed the proof copy of ''Not Private Eye'', drank champagne in Maxwell's office and were eventually removed by security after they phoned up Maxwell in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Hislop"&gt; ''Parkinson'' interview of Ian Hislop, 25 March 2002 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=162-xDvinkI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Private Eye: The First 50 Years, Adam Macqueen&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The spoof edition largely copied the style of ''Private Eye'' but attacked its editorial team, including a cover which portrayed the editor [[Richard Ingrams]] in a Nazi uniform talking to [[Adolf Hitler]]. The speech bubble said "And if anyone objects, we say we were only doing it for a laugh".

Another example of such anti-''Private Eye'' humour was included in the cartoon strips, one of which, entitled "Carlisle St, an everyday tale of libelling folk", featured caricatures of the ''Private Eye'' team making attacks against others as a means of making money.

The cover of ''Not Private Eye'' also featured an altered version of ''Private Eye'' mascot Gnitty, who was shown to be facing the wrong way (compared to his usual pose on the ''Private Eye'' cover) and was smiling.&lt;ref name="Magforum"&gt;Magforum [http://www.magforum.com/notprivateeye.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre's library is named the '''Leopold Muller Memorial Library'''. It is housed in the basement of the Clarendon Institute.  It comprises one of the best collections of books and periodicals in Jewish Studies in Europe and serves as a resource for scholars, students and visiting fellows of the Centre. The core of the Library consists of several rare collections and archives; among those one finds a large collection of materials donated by Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/louisjacobs.html |title=Louis Jacobs Collection – Leopold Muller Memorial Library |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331201859/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/louisjacobs.html |archivedate=31 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loewe Pamphlets Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |title=Loewe Pamphlets – Leopold Muller Memorial Library |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315100643/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Herbert Loewe]] and his elder son, the library of Jacob H.

{{EU history}}

'''Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters''' ('''PJCC''') was the third of the [[three pillars of the European Union]] (EU). It was named '''Justice and Home Affairs''' ('''JHA''') before 2003. The pillar existed between 1993 and 2009, when it was absorbed into a consolidated [[European Union]] structure and became the [[area of freedom, security and justice]].

The pillar focused on co-operation in law enforcement and combating [[racism]]. It was based more around intergovernmental cooperation than the other pillars meaning there was little input from the [[European Commission]], [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/police_judicial_cooperation_en.htm Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708113858/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/police_judicial_cooperation_en.htm |date=2007-07-08 }} EU Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; It was responsible for policies including the [[European Arrest Warrant]].

==History==
It was created, on the foundations of the [[TREVI]] cooperation, as the Justice and Home Affairs pillar by the [[Maastricht treaty]] in order to advance cooperation in criminal and justice fields without member states sacrificing a great deal of sovereignty. Decisions were taken by consensus rather than majority (which was the case in the [[European Community]] areas) and the [[Supranationalism|supranational]] [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]] had little input.

The [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] transferred the areas of illegal [[immigration]], [[visa (document)|visas]], [[refugee|asylum]], and judicial co-operation in civil matters to the integrated European Community. The term ''Justice and Home Affairs'' later covers these integrated fields as well as the intergovernmental third pillar. The pillar was renamed "Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters" to reflect its reduced scope.

Before the Maastricht Treaty, member states cooperated at the intergovernmental level in various sectors relating to free movement and personal security ("group of co-ordinators", CELAD, TREVI) as well as in customs co-operation (GAM) and judicial policy. With Maastricht, Justice and Home Affairs co-operation aimed at reinforcing actions taken by member states while allowing a more coherent approach of these actions, by offering new tools for coordinating actions.

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which entered into force in December 2009, abolished the entire pillar system. The PJC areas and those transferred from JHA to the Community were once more grouped together in creating an [[area of freedom, security and justice]].
===EU evolution timeline===
{{EU evolution timeline}}

==Responsibilities==
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] established that, while reaching the objectives of the Union, and notably the freedom of movement, the member states consider the following as areas of common interest under Justice and Home Affairs:
#Asylum;
#Rules concerning the entrance of external borders;
#Immigration policies and policies concerning third countries' citizens:
#*Conditions of entry and circulation for foreign citizens in the territory of the Union;
#*Conditions of residence for foreign citizens in the territory of Member States, comprising families and employment access;
#*Fight against irregular immigration, residence and work of foreigners within the territory of the Union;
#Combating illicit drugs where this is not covered by point 7), 8) and 9);
#Fight against international fraud where this is not covered by points 7), 8) and 9);
#Judicial co-operation in civil matters;
#Judicial co-operation in penal matters;
#Customs co-operation;
#Police co-operation for preventing and fighting terrorism, drugs trade and other grave forms of international criminality, comprising, if necessary, certain aspects of customs co-operation.

There were three EU agencies under the PJC pillar: [[Eurojust]], [[Europol]] and [[European Police College]] (Cepol).

The '''prepared-core technique''' is means of producing [[stone tool]]s by first preparing common [[lithic core|stone cores]] into shapes that lend themselves to knapping off flakes that closely resemble the desired tool and require only minor touch-ups to be usable. In contrast to earlier techniques, where cores themselves were the end product shaped and trimmed down by removal of flakes, in prepared-core technique large flakes are the product and the core is used to produce them. This shift made it faster and more resource-efficient, as multiple tools could be struck from a single piece of starting material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle Paleolithic Tool Technologies|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/stsmith/classes/anth3/courseware/LithicTech/8_Middle_Paleolithic_Tool.html|publisher=University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Anthropology|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21065">The [[rock art]] of south [[Oran Province|Oran]], are prehistoric engravings dating from the [[Neolithic]] period, which are found in the south of [[Oran Province]], [[Algeria]], in the Saharan [[Atlas Mountains]], in the regions (from west to east) of [[Figuig]], [[Ain Sefra]], [[El-Bayadh]], [[Aflou]] and [[Tiaret]]. Comparable engravings have been described, even further east, around [[Djelfa]] and in the region of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]. Although in the past some archaeologists affirmed that these engravings derived from European [[Upper Paleolithic art]], this theory is today definitively rejected.

==History==
Less famous than the rock art at the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] site, the South Oran engravings have however been the subject of study since 1863. The most important works are notably those of A. Pomel (from 1893 to 1898), Stéphane Gsell (from 1901 to 1927), G. B. M. Flamand (from 1892 to 1921), [[Leo Frobenius]] and [[Hugo Obermaier]] (in 1925), l'Abbé [[Henri Breuil]] (from 1931 to 1957), L. Joleaud (from 1918 to 1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (from 1935 to 1955).

In 1955 and 1964 [[Henri Lhote]] had visits of several months to the region which allowed him to complete his former researches, to add hundreds of new descriptions and in 1970 to publish ''Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais'' in the series ''Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques'' (CRAPE) directed at [[Algiers]] by Mouloud Mammeri.&lt;ref&gt;Published:Arts et Métiers graphiques, Paris, 210 pages et reproductions photographiques.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable part of the work was particularly devoted to the engravings of the El-Bayadh region. For Henri Lhote the South Oran region constitutes one of the "three great centres of art of the antelope age"&lt;ref name="Lhote"&gt;Henri Lhote, ''Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais'', (Arts et Métiers graphiques, Paris).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}} with Tassili ("Oued Djèrat") and [[Fezzan]].

==Date==
In this work Lhote tells that a hearth found at the "Station of Méandre", near to [[Brézina]], had been dated to 3900 years B.C., without this figure being capable of "being attributed to a definite category of the engravings which ornament the 'walls' of the station."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|193, n. 1}} The oldest of these engravings, on the other hand, show many affinities with those of Tassili which he proposes the minimum date of around 5000. There is therefore room, according to him, to "adopt it also for the South-Oranian material until better information may be forthcoming."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|163}}&lt;br /&gt;

==Chronology==

=== Older classifications===
A. Pomel, relying on identifications of animals which were later disputed, is at the root of the position of some authors who think that the engravings belong to the [[Palaeolithic]] age.

Stéphane Gsell, on the other hand, considered the most ancient engravings showing [[antelope]] and [[elephants]] to be [[Neolithic]], and he distinguished from them the images of [[Sheep|rams]], which according to him reflect an [[Ancient Egyptian]] ritual, which, like the depictions of ''caballins'' he attributed to the historical period.

The classification proposed by G. B. M. Flamand based on a study of techniques and patinas distinguished a first group of naturalistic engravings ([[hartebeest]], elephant, [[rhinoceros]], rams, donkeys, horses, antelopes), a second, libyco-berber group (engravings of decadent style, little horses, [[camel]]s, alphabetic characters) and two late groups (Arab inscriptions and modern graffiti).

For Hugo Obermaier there exist two sub-groups in the neolithic engravings, the older being of naturalistic style (hartebeest), the more recent of sub-naturalistic style (less elaborated and smaller-scale subjects). The cult of the ram with the sphere was, according to him, native to the populations of North Africa before having been adopted by the Egyptians.

Henri Breuil for his part distinguished three stages. In Stage I, contemporary with the end of the [[Capsian]], he places the large hartebeest with ringed horns, the elephants, and the very style-accomplished  as well as large human figures (Ksar El Amar). Stage II, which he attributes to the Lower Neolithic, brings together the large ram of Bou Alem, the hartebeest, rhinoceros, elephants and other animals in less accomplished style. The ram, for him, had not yet been domesticated but only tamed, and its cult is rather the origin than the reflex to the Egyptian belief. Stage III includes the figures in decadent style.

Raymond Vaufrey, studying the industry of flint implements found at the foot of the engraved rocks, takes the naturalistic figures to the "Neolithic of the Capsian tradition" deriving from the Neolithic of Egypt, and places them between 4200 and 2000 B.C. The ram, which he considers domesticated, is only a transposition of the Egyptian cult of [[Ammon]] and the representations of it cannot be older than 2200 B.C. For Henri Lhote however, there is no any archaeological argument which should cause one to separate the rams, supposed to be later, from the giant hartebeest, elephants or rhinoceros. Being like them of Neolithic age, they cannot derive from the Egyptian ram, and need not on that account be considered as the ancestors of a cult of which the ram of Ammon would constitute a late sequel.

==Classification of Henri Lhote==
Henri Lhote distinguished seven series in the mural art of the South Oranian.
[[Image:Kef el Akhal.cl.1.jpg|thumb|left|Kef el Akhal, large Hartebeest]]

1. Large engravings of monumental naturalistic style, or Large-scale Hartebeest style.    Beside the great hartebeest, elephants and rhinoceros, Lhote placed the numerous ostriches and antelopes, boars, lions and panthers. The animals are represented absolutely in profile apart from the hartebeest, in relative profile (the two-eyed formula being frequent). Lhote placed in this ensemble the human images which accompany them (of which the hands and feet have almost always six digits). No human figure with animal head having been found, he observed that "the hartebeest ensembles of the Saharan Atlas differ from those of Tassili-n-Ajjer and of Fezzan where these figures are running.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|197}} The author also thinks that the domestication of the dog was achieved in this period and that the South Oranian presents the most ancient rock testimonies to it. This first stage also includes the "mythic animals". All these engravings are made by a punctuation of little dots or hollows, more or less connected, and then most often by a polishing apparently helped by a wooden utensil with the addition of wet sand. Some engravings show a beginning of polishing in the endoperigraphic area (head), others a complete polishing.
[[Image:Tazina 1.jpg|Tazina|thumb|right|Tazina, animals in the style of the "School of Tazina"]]

2. Small engravings in naturalistic style, or small-scale hartebeest stage. The stage would be constituted by the collection of engravings of more reduced size, of which the style has been designated as "School of Tazina" after the name of one of the sites. These naturalistic images show the same fauna (hartebeest, elephant and rhinoceros) as those of the preceding group but in very conventionalised forms, the legs and tails of the animals being very thinned out, the lines of the horns and the muzzle prolonged in a 'fantastic' way (Flamand), the lengthening of the body, the hind-quarters and the heads having inspired faulty identifications. The style is however not uniform and on certain murals these characteristic deformations co-exist with more realistic depictions. From a technical standpoint the finish of the engravings is regular, no trace surviving of a preliminary dotting-out, and the patina is similar to that of the preceding stage. The human depictions show the same character but the terminal parts of the limbs, hands and feet are generally rounded-off.
[[Image:Koudia Abd El Hak.cl.1.jpg|thumb|left|Koudia Abd El Hak, superimposed engravings.]]
From a chronological viewpoint, a single station (Koudiat Abd El Hak) shows an indisputable over-drawing, a little antelope with attenuated legs being overdrawn by a large elephant, although another would appear to be later than it. This fact obliged Lhote "to ask himself if the small-scale school might be earlier than that of the large engravings, or even if the two schools might have been contemporary." This latter hypothesis would have implied the existence "of two different gatherings of humans living side by side or, at the least, two artistic schools operating in parallel."

In his analysis Lhote shows that beyond the great similarity of the fauna represented and of the presence of the "orant-ram" association in both stages, the "orant-hartebeest" association was not indicated in the second, whereas the antelopes there are more numerous and the lions rarer. He adds that "the small-scale style extends towards the south Moroccan as far as the Rio de Oro, although the large-scale style remained confined in the south oran area, with certain migrations towards the north-east." The author's opinion therefore leans therefore towards the existence of two groups. Furthermore, the style of the small-scale art, by comparison with the static forms of the large-scale figures, reflects "rather an art which has already attained conventional formulae", "more advanced in the sense of a more evolved creative impulse" and therefore later. But in this hypothesis one should be able to rediscover traces of this so distinctive style in the later group of the decadent engravings, even though these seem, to the contrary, to derive from the large-scale school. In his conclusions the author considers that the small-scale engravings, often thought of as later decadent reminiscences, would be as old as those of the large hartebeest and elephants. "Whichever solution may prevail", concluded Lhote, one should consider that the identity of the fauna in each of the two groups indicates that there could not have been a great lapse of time between them, and that, despite the variation of styles, one can ask oneself if they do not represent two expressions of one and the same art."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|173}}
[[Image:Gouiret bent saloul, 3.jpg|thumb|left|Gouiret bent Saloul, human figure sexually displayed, with axe and shield]]

3. Engravings of sub-naturalistic style or decadent hartebeest stage. These are characterized by the mediocrity of their style and technique, reduced to a fairly clumsy dotting and an irregular final polishing. Their patina is clearer than for the two preceding stages, an observation confirmed by the fact that they are often found on the same murals. Their dimensions are more reduced than the first group, but larger than those of the second, with which they have nothing in common. The most common theme is of sexually displayed human figures, in a semi-crouching position, seen frontally, often together with numerous lions and ostriches. The fauna, less varied than in the two first groups, still includes the last representations of hartebeest of which the horns are not always ringed, and images of elephants, cattle and panthers. The association of man-ram disappears, which seems "to mark a rupture on the environment of the foregoing stages and shows an evolution of religious beliefs", replaced by the man-lion association, hartebeest and elephants no longer holding the place which they had formerly occupied. It is, according to Lhote, "the end, very degraded, of that remarkable artistic epoch of the south Oranian.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|174}}

4. Engravings of the sub-naturalist style of the husbandmen or the [[bovid]]ian stage. [[Image:Gouiret bent Saloul.cl.1.jpg|thumb|right|Gouiret bent Saloul.]] The domestic cow with long or short horns sometimes wearing little spheres dominates this stage, the fauna being composed otherwise of elephants, antelope and ostriches, while images of humans are rare. The engravings are in various different styles, the formula schematic and massive, called "quadrangular" by H. Breuil, seeming like the most ancient. The main group of these engravings are not found in south Oran but in the valley of the Saoura (Sahara): Lhote supposes "a different origin to that of the preceding groups", showing "secondary infiltrations which have come from the south." For the author, "this bovidian civilization has certainly emerged from a Saharan milieu, but it has only made a very superficial appearance in the south Oran," following the tracks from the Hills of Ksour, having perhaps "another direct contact with the Sahara in the region of Brésina."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|175}}

5. Engravings of schematic carriages, which ought to occupy a comparable chronological position to that of the carriages of the Sahara.

6. Libyco-[[Berber People|Berber]] engravings.

7. Modern Arabo-Berber engravings.

[[Image:Bou Alem.cl.Gr bélier.jpg|thumb|upright|Bou Alem, the largest ram.]]
For F. Cominardi, analysing most recently the superimposition of engravings at "Koudiat Abd el Hak",&lt;ref&gt;F. Cominardi, Chebka Dirhem I nouvelle station rupestre des Monts des Ksour, dans ''Lybica '', Vol XXIV, CRAPE, Algiers, 1976, pp. 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt; it seems accepted that the naturalistic large-scale stage and the naturalistic small-scale stage (the most ancient level being constituted of very tiny engravings, the most recent by works of slightly superior execution) were contemporary, at least within a single epoch, "the first not being extinguished before the second began." The author leans, "on account of the arguments of the more evolved schematic style, towards placing the naturalistic large-scale stage in the first place, and to making the naturalistic small-scale stage begin before the disappearance of the former." [[Image:R'cheg Dirhem.cl.2bis.jpg|thumb|left|R'cheg Dirhem, hartebeest and human.]]According to F. Cominardi, "It would be during the lapse of time while they coexisted, that the engravings of the plaque of Koudiat were made. Were these two so differentiated artistic worlds brought into being by different peoples? It is possible.  It could be explained that they dwelt rarely together on the same rocks, and that the school of Tazina should be so individualized geographically." "If the small-scale naturalistic stage is, by comparison with the older stage, if not contemporary, at least starting to unfold during that time, one could, provisionally, place it between the 6th and the 4th millennium."

==Interpretation==
Henri Lhote identified among the south Oran engravings 41 images of rams or of sheep-like creatures, which is comparatively few in the sum of the representations, "especially as this figure includes small scale images and the uncertain ones of the decadent school."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|178}} Their symbolic attributes (spheroids, manes, collars) remain very variable, in contrast to those of the Egyptian ram of Ammon, which was furnished right from the start with the symbols which it would always keep, one could claim, according to the author, that they had not yet been fixed in a definitive fashion and we find ourselves here looking at a cult which was just beginning to take form." The difference "shows, if it were still necessary to show, that the South Oranians had not adopted the cult from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|180}}

In 13 cases the engraved rams are associated with human figures. Analyzing their possible relations, the author's conclusion is "that the Ram played a religious role of first importance to the south-Oranians, that its association with man, though he may have been in a praying position, should have been armed with an axe, shows that it certainly had the character of a divinity which one would ask things of and which one might, on suitable occasions, sacrifice."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|180}} This role, he adds, "is well attested in the two hartebeest stages of large and small scale, but disappears in the age of the decadent style where nothing of it remains except the mere vestige."

The representations of hartebeest, more numerous (73 for the region) and in 13 cases associated with the presence of a human, show despite the absence of the spheroid "which may have been the object of rites associating it with men,"&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|181}} that it "held an eminent place in the beliefs of the ancient populations of the South Oranians.&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|183}} As for the lion, represented with facing head in the old hartebeest stage where it is only a single time associated with a man, but shown in profile in the decadent style where its associations with humans are on the contrary quite frequent, it seems to have replaced hartebeest and rams. One should be able, according to Lhote, "to interpret this phenomenon as a radical modification in the behaviour of south Oranians, a real change, unless it represents the arrival of new human populations."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|183}}

For Henri Lhote, "the south Oran engravings are certainly among the oldest artistic and cultic manifestations of Africa which we know of, and the beliefs of which they are the reflection may perhaps have helped to influence the later populations of the [[Nile valley]] and of black Africa where [[animism]] was to undergo so great a development."&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|182–3}}

==Who were the artists?==
Conjectures on the identities of the artists have been many. Lhote tells that some have believed them to belong to the black populations ancestral to the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and the [[Hausa people|Hausas]]. But the [[Tuareg]], the Egyptians and the ancestors of the [[Berber People|Berbers]] have also been invoked. They have also been thought to have been the [[Cro-Magnon]]s, the husbandmen and farmers of Asiatic origin, the Harratines, the Proto-Libyans and the [[Bushmen]]. In the absence of discoveries in the region of neolithic human remains and of an adequate understanding of the ambiguity of the images, "one should avoid any absolute identification" or "definitive option".&lt;ref name="Lhote"/&gt;{{rp|196–8}}

The '''Sahibi river''',  also called the '''Sabi River''' , is an [[ephemeral]], rain-fed river flowing through [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]] and [[Delhi]] states in India.&lt;ref name="AKjain"/&gt; It drains into [[Yamuna]] at [[Delhi]], where its channeled course is also called the [[Najafgarh drain]], which also serves as [[Najafgarh drain bird sanctuary]]. Sahibi is a seasonal river which is 120&amp;nbsp;km long and flows from [[Aravalli hills]] in Rajasthan to Haryana,&lt;ref name=mas14&gt;[https://indiariversblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/04/haryana-rivers-profile/#more-235 Haryana rivers profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mas11&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/ropeway-for-tourist-pull-at-barrage-site/articleshow/57678931.cms Ropeway for tourist pull at barrage site], [[Times of India]], 17 Mar 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  of which 100&amp;nbsp;km is in Haryana.

Several [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]] sites (also identified as late Harappan phase of [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] culture)&lt;ref name=IVCOCP&gt;{{Citation | last = Gupta | first = S.P. (ed.) | title = The lost Sarasvati and the Indus Civilization | place = Jodhpur | publisher = Kusumanjali Prakashan | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found along the banks of Sahibi river and its tributaries such as [[Krishnavati river]], [[Dohan river]] (originates near [[Neem Ka Thana]] in Alwar district) and Sota River (merges with Sahibi river at [[Behror]] in Alwar district).&lt;ref name=culture1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0391023586 Cultural Contours of India: Dr. Satya Prakash Felicitation Volume, Vijai Shankar Śrivastava, 1981]. {{ISBN|0391023586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drainage pattern for all these rivers is [[Drainage system (geomorphology)#Dendritic drainage pattern|dendritic]].

==Geography==
The Sahibi River originates from the eastern slopes of the Saiwar Protected Forest hills in [[Aravalli Range]] near Jitgarh and [[Manoharpur]] in [[Sikar district]] of [[Rajasthan]] state. After covering about 157&amp;nbsp;km distance in the [[Rajasthan]] state. After gathering volume from a hundred [[tributary|tributaries]], the Sahibi River forms a broad stream around [[Alwar]] and [[Kotputli]].

=== Tributaries ===
These west to north-west flowing rivers originate from the western slopes of [[Aravalli range]] in Rajasthan, flow through semi-arid historical [[Shekhawati]] region, drain into southern Haryana.

===Catchment area===
The [[Catchment area (hydrology)|catchment area]] of the Sahibi River encompasses the following cities and towns: [[Sikar]], [[Jaipur]], and [[Alwar]] in northeastern [[Rajasthan]] state; [[Bawal]], [[Rewari]], [[Pataudi]], and [[Jhajjar district]] in southern [[Haryana]] state; and [[Delhi]] state.

====Rajsthan====
The [[Catchment area (hydrology)|catchment area]] of the Sahibi River in [[Rajasthan]] is {{convert|4523.67|km2|mi2}} of Jaipur, Alwar and Sikar Districts, between latitudes 27°16' and 28°11' and longitudes 75°42' and 76°57'. Sahibi Basin falls in three Districts of Rajasthan namely: [[Alwar district]] (62.11%), [[Jaipur district]] (29.30%) and [[Sikar district]] (8.59%).

Mean Annual Rainfall in Sahibi Basin is 627.60&amp;nbsp;mm. Highest maximum temperature ranges from 45.45-45.99&amp;nbsp;°C with a mean value of 45.8&amp;nbsp;°C, while Lowest minimum temperature ranges from 1.64-3.14&amp;nbsp;°C with a mean value of 2.45&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Haryana====
It leaves [[Rajasthan]] state beyond [[Kotkasim]] in [[Alwar district]] near village Ujauli and covers a total distance of about 222&amp;nbsp;km up to Dhasa Bund.

It enters [[Haryana]] state at Jhabua, near the city of [[Rewari]] in  [[Rewari district]], after which it re-enters first [[Rajasthan]] state near [[Kotkasim]], and then [[Haryana]] again  near the village of Jarthal. The dry riverbed near Jarthal is {{convert|2|km|mi}} wide. During light [[monsoon]] rainfall, the river's flat and sandy bottom absorbs all rainwater. [[Masani barrage]] on the river lies near Dahuhera. During heavy rains, the river has defined course up to [[Pataudi]] railway station  and branches off into two smaller streams to [[Jhajjar]], finally reaching the outskirts of Delhi through [[Najafgarh drain]] and ending at the [[Yamuna|Yamuna River]].

====Delhi====
{{Main|Najafgarh drain}}
The '''Najafgarh Drain''' or '''Najafgarh Nallah''' (''nullah'' in [[Hindi]] means ''drain'') is another name for the Sahibi River, which continues its flow through Delhi where it is channelised for flood control purposes. It is a tributary to the Yamuna River, into which it flows. The Najafgarh Drain gets its name from the once famous and huge [[Najafgarh Lake]] near the town of [[Najafgarh]] in southwest Delhi. The Najafgarh Drain is the capital’s most polluted body of water due to the direct inflow of untreated sewage from surrounding populated areas. Assessing the water quality of wetlands in wildlife habitats, a January 2005 report by the Central Pollution Control Board rated the Najafgarh Drain under category D, along with 13 other highly polluted wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=138509 Blot across the Capital: Najafgarh most polluted]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Sunday, 10 July 2005,[[The Indian Express]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=118627Environment minister raises a stink over Najafgarh jheel]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 22 February 2005, The Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/najafgarh-basin-delhis-most-polluted-area/558870/ Najafgarh basin Delhi’s most polluted area], 25 December 2009, The Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-25/pollution/28101026_1_industrial-clusters-industrial-hubs-najafgarh-drain Najafgarh drain 11th among highly polluted industrial clusters], 25 Dec 2009, The [[Times of India]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=191225Najafgarh drain causes less pollution in Yamuna now]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 4 July 2006, The Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barrages and bridges===
Several bridges cross the Sahibi River. A bridge on State Highway 14 crosses the river between Behror and Sodawas (Behror to Alwar Road). On State Highway 52, a bridge crosses the river between Ajaraka and Dadhiya. The [[Masani barrage]] is also used as the bridge on [[National Highway 919 (India)|NH 919]] which merges with [[National Highway 48 (India)|NH 48]] (Delhi-Jaipur-Mumbai, formerly NH 8) at this barrage near [[Dharuhera]], [[Rewari]].&lt;ref name=masani1&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/toll-plaza-on-nh-8-to-be-shifted-says-nitin-gadkari/ "Toll plaza on NH 8 to be shifted, says Nitin Gadkari."], [[Indian Express]], 14 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Railway bridges between Ajaraka and [[Bawal]] and near [[Pataudi]] also cross the river. A railway bridge near Nangal Pathani also crosses the river.

==History==
Prior to 1960, the rain-fed Sahibi River entered Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Lake (Jheel) basin, creating a seasonal lake. A vast area more than {{convert|300|km2|mi2}} was submerged in some seasons. In the following decades, the Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa was channelised by digging a wide drain and connecting it directly to the Yamuna River, completely draining the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel.

The Sahibi River flooded in 1977. In response, the Masani barrage was constructed on Delhi-Jaipur highway near [[Masani]] village, Rewari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/Haryana/Rewari.pdf GROUND WATER INFORMATION BOOKLET REWARI DISTRICT, HARYANA], Contributors: Dr. Sunil Kumar, Scientist – ‘B’, Prepared under supervision of Sushil Gupta Regional Director.

The construction of dams has restricted the flow of water on the Sahibi River and it is now rare for water overflow from monsoon rains to reach up the Masani Barrage.

===Indus Valley Civilisation sites in the area===

Parts of Rajasthan and Haryana that Sahibi river flows through are arid and have only seasonal moonsoon rainfall, in the past river might have held perennial flow as evident by the presence of several [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sites on the banks of present-day Sahibi River meanders and its tributaries. Several sites have been found in many locations to establish a pattern of settlement of widespread [[Indus Valley Civilization]] along the banks of Sahibi and its tributaries. Archaeological excavation have proven that [[Indus Valley Civilization]] people lived here before the [[Harappa]]n and pre-[[Mahabharata]] periods.&lt;ref name=Pear1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMI1/&gt;

Among the finds are handmade and wheel-made pottery dated to 3309–2709 BCE and 2879–2384 BCE found on the banks of the Sahibi River at Jodhpura.&lt;ref name=Pear1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMI1/&gt;

Other findings include pottery found on the Sahibi riverbed at [[Hansaka]] in the [[Rewari district]] by [[INTACH]]-Rewari.&lt;ref name=Pear1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMI1/&gt;

A red stone statue of [[Vamana]] Dev, now displayed at the Shri Krishna Museum, [[Kurukshetra]] was unearthed in 2002 on the Sahibi riverbed near [[Bawal]].&lt;ref name=Pear1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMI1/&gt;

In various other places on Sahibi riverbed, many artifacts have been found, including arrowheads, fishhooks, spearheads, awls, and chisels.&lt;ref name=Pear1&gt;A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India from the stone age to the 12th century, Pearson 2009, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MMI1&gt;[http://www.indiamapped.com/rivers-in-india/sahibi-river/ India Mapped - Sahibi river]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification with Vedic rivers ===
{{See also|Drishadvati river}}
Several modern scholars identify the old [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]] (of which Tangri river is a tributary) as the [[Sarasvati river]] and the Sahibi River with the [[Drishadvati river]] of [[Vedic period]], on the banks of which in the Vedic state of [[Brahmavarta]], [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus-Sarasvati civilisation]] or Vedic Sanskriti developed. Such scholars include Bhargava&lt;ref&gt;"Location of Brahmavarta and Drishadwati River is important to find earliest alignment of Saraswati River", Sudhir Bhargava, International Conference, 20–22 Nov. 2009, "Saraswati-a perspective" pages 114–117, [[Kurukshetra University]], Kurukshetra, Organised by: Saraswati Nadi Shodh Sansthan, Haryana.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drishadwati]] River had formed one border of the [[Vedic]] state of [[Brahmavarta]] while other was Saraswati river. This is mentioned in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', and the ''Brahmin Granths'' texts also.

==Ecology==
This is an important part of ecological corridor along the route of Sahibi river which traverses from Aravalli hills in Rajasthan to [[Yamuna]] via [[Masani barrage]], [[Matanhail#Forest| Matanhail forest]], [[Chhuchhakwas|Chhuchhakwas-Godhari]], [[Khaparwas Wildlife Sanctuary]], Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, Outfall Drain Number 8 and 6, [[Sarbashirpur]], [[Sultanpur National Park]], [[Basai]] and The Lost Lake (Gurugram). It lies 5km northwest of Bhindawas Bird Sancturay and 46 km northwest of Sultantpur National Park via road. 

===Ecological concerns===
Entire 100&amp;nbsp;km stretch of Sahibi river and its  streams (Sota river, Kotkasim drain and [[Indori river]]) in Haryana are [[Ecological death|ecologically dead]].&lt;ref name=mas14/&gt; [[Gurugram]] also dumps polluted discharge in the riverbed of Sahibi.&lt;ref name=mas14/&gt; In some of its reaches, from Mandawar and [[Kotkasim]] to Haryana border, meandering of the river causes bank erosion.

===Restoration===
[[Government of Haryana]] is coordinating with [[Government of Rajasthan]] to ensure water reaches usually-dry [[Masani barrage]] and dying seasonal Sahibi river. Another govt. project is being implemented to direct the extra water of Yamuna river during monsoon to Masani barrage through Jawahar Lal Nehru Canal and [[Western Yamuna Canal]] (c. July 2015).&lt;ref name=masani3&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/centre-of-aiims-to-come-up-in-rewari-district-khattar-115070400731_1.html "Centre of AIIMS to come up in Rewari district: Khattar ."], [[Business Standard]], 4 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saints Christopher, Jerome and Louis of Toulouse''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Giovanni Bellini]], executed in 1513, and housed in the church of [[San Giovanni Crisostomo]], [[Venice]].

==History==
The painting dates to Bellini's late career, when he had adopted [[Giorgione]]'s tonalism. It had been commissioned in 1494 by the Venetian merchant   Giorgio Diletti. It is however signed and dated 1513, but it is not known why there were some twenty years between the commissioning and the execution.

==Description==
The layout is that of the [[Holy Conversation]] typical of the Venetian tradition, largely owed to works by  Bellini himself, with an arch opening to a landscape in the background, and three figures of saints. Instead of the usual throne with the Virgin, there is St. Jerome, portrayed as a hermit, on a rock, while reading the Bible. Below, separated by a parapet where is the cartouche with the signature, are St. Christopher and a Saint bishop.

The latter had been originally identified as St. Augustine based on text on the book  (''[[De civitate Dei]]''), which was later revealed to be apocryphal, as it is not placed on the front cover. Basing on the presence of lilies on the cloak, those of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]], the character has been recognized as [[St. Louis of Toulouse]].

The saints were perhaps chosen depending from [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] themes, with St. Louis symbolizing the contemplative and liturgic life, and St. Christopher symbolizing preaching. According to this view, Jerome would thus be the highest point of spiritual life. The arch above him is a symbol of the Catholic church, and has a Greek inscription of the Psalm 14, referring to St. Jerome as the sage mentioned in it. The use of Greek derives from San Cristomo's role as church of the Greek-speaking Venetians.

{{Human history and prehistory}}
This '''timeline of human prehistory''' comprises the time from the first appearance of ''Homo sapiens'' in Africa 300,000 years ago to the [[History of writing|invention of writing]] and the beginning of [[historiography]], after 5,000 years ago. 
It thus covers the time from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] (Old Stone Age) to the very beginnings of the [[world history]].

All dates are approximate subject to revision based on new discoveries or analyses.

"By ~130 ka two distinct groups of anatomically modern humans co-existed in Africa: broadly, the ancestors of many modern-day Khoe and San populations in the south and a second central/eastern African group that includes the ancestors of most extant worldwide populations. Early modern human dispersals correlate with climate changes, particularly the tropical African “megadroughts” of MIS 5 (marine isotope stage 5, 135–75 ka) which paradoxically may have facilitated expansions in central and eastern Africa, ultimately triggering the dispersal out of Africa of people carrying haplogroup L3 ~60 ka. Two south to east migrations are discernible within haplogroup L0. One, between 120 and 75 ka, represents the first unambiguous long-range modern human dispersal detected by mtDNA and might have allowed the dispersal of several markers of modernity. A second one, within the last 20 ka signalled by L0d, may have been responsible for the spread of southern click-consonant languages to eastern Africa, contrary to the view that these eastern examples constitute relics of an ancient, much wider distribution."&lt;/ref&gt;
