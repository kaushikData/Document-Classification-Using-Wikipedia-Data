{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement Macroeconomics''' (also known as '''AP Macroeconomics''', '''AP Macro''', '''APMa''', or simply '''Macro''') is an [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] [[macroeconomics]] course and exam offered by the [[College Board]].

Study begins with fundamental economic concepts such as [[scarcity]], [[opportunity costs]], [[Production‚Äìpossibility frontier|production possibilities]], specialization, [[comparative advantage]], [[Demand (economics)|demand]], [[Supply (economics)|supply]], and [[price determination]].

Major topics include measurement of economic performance, national income and price determination, fiscal and [[monetary policy]], and international economics and growth.

==Criticism==
Tawni Ferrarini, James Gwartney, and John Morton have argued that the examination does not adequately cover recent advances in the field, writing that "[t]he AP macroeconomics exam and resources largely reflect the simplistic Keynesian view from the 1960s and 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;Tawni H. Ferrarini, James D. Gwartney, and John S. Morton, "Advanced Placement Economics: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(1) (January 2011), 67.

The '''Acad√©mie royale de langue et de litt√©rature fran√ßaises de Belgique''' (The Royal Academy of French Language and Literature of Belgium [ARLLFB]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] institution which brings together personalities who, through their works, writings, lectures or speeches, have contributed most eminently to the illustration of the [[French language]], either by studying its origins and its evolution, or by publishing works of imagination or criticism. It includes both Belgian and foreign members.

The Royal Academy of French Language and Literature of Belgium, also named the "Destr√©enne", was founded in 1920&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canalacademie.com/ida1369-L-Academie-royale-de-langue-et-litterature-francaises-de-Belgique.html Canal Acad√©mie], www.canalacademie.com. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://connaitrelawallonie.wallonie.be/fr/histoire/timeline/16-fevrier-1921-premiere-seance-de-lacademie-de-langue-et-de-litterature Connaitre la Wallonie], connaitrelawallonie.wallonie.be. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; by king [[Albert I of Belgium]], at the suggestion of [[Jules Destr√©e]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belgianstamps.eu/BELGIUM/1971/be1971-08.html Belgian stamps, "King Alber I and Jules Destr√©e"], www.belgianstamps.eu.&lt;/ref&gt; minister in charge of Science and Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.be/index.php?id=detail_article&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_cfwbarticlefe_cfwbarticlefront%5Baction%5D=show&amp;tx_cfwbarticlefe_cfwbarticlefront%5Bcontroller%5D=Document&amp;tx_cfwbarticlefe_cfwbarticlefront%5Bpublication%5D=953&amp;cHash=cf409e63b3d22f064314a7d184eb3376 F√©d√©ration Wallonie Bruxelles], www.culture.be. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Academy of Belgium]], the "Teresian", founded in 1772 by Empress [[Maria Theresa]] of [[Austria]].

==Founding principles==
There are three founding principles:

* It will bring together imaginative writers, novelists, playwrights, poets and [[philologist]]s, in a broad sense, specialists of ancient texts, grammarians, linguists and historians of literature. Principle justified in the following terms: "The total meaning of a language is revealed only in terms of its constant transformation."
* The second: the Academy should elect foreign members not only from [[France]], but also from [[Canada]], French-speaking [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], from all countries where the French language is "spoken, honored, cultivated, and which are like the intellectual provinces of French civilization".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=vRihCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=Acad%C3%A9mie+royale+de+langue+et+de+litt%C3%A9rature+fran%C3%A7aises+de+Belgique&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifou296vHTAhULSRoKHc-XD0E4ChDoAQhPMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Acad%C3%A9mie%20royale%20de%20langue%20et%20de%20litt%C3%A9rature%20fran%C3%A7aises%20de%20Belgique&amp;f=false "Dictionnaire amoureux de la Belgique" Yazar: Jean-Baptiste BARONIAN], [[Google Books]]. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third: the Academy should include female members: "women of letters gave too many unquestionable proofs of talent to think of removing them from a literary society".

== History and composition ==
The initial nucleus of the Academy named ten writers: [[Henri Carton de Wiart]], [[Georges Eekhoud]], [[Iwan Gilkin]], [[Albert Giraud]], [[Hubert Krains]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Albert Mockel]], [[:fr:Fernand S√©verin]], [[Paul Spaak]], [[:fr:Gustave Vanzype]]. And for the philological section, its first four members were representatives of the [[University of Li√®ge|Li√®ge]] school of philology: [[:fr:Maurice Wilmotte]], [[:fr:Auguste Doutrepont]], [[Jules Feller]] and [[Jean Haust]].

The autonomy of the Academy is assured by the recommendation that the elections take place by co-optation. 
Its composition is defined as follows: thirty members of Belgian origin, including twenty literary writers and ten philologists; Ten foreign members, including six writers and four philologists for a total of forty members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arllfb.be/organisation/academiciens.html Organisation, Acad√©miciens], ARLLFB. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year following creation, the newly invited members included [[Anna de Noailles]], [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], Swiss novelist [[:fr:Benjamin Vallotton]] and the French grammarian [[Ferdinand Brunot]].

From its foundation to the present day, the Academy has counted one hundred and twenty-four Belgian members, of whom eleven were women, and forty-nine foreign members from either France, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Romania, Quebec, Great Britain, China, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Israel, The Netherlands, Peru or Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arllfb.be/organisation/historique.html Historique], ARLLFB. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Academy of French Language and Literature of Belgium also awards literary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arllfb.be/prixlitteraires/index.html Prix Litt√©rairaires], ARLLFB. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.actualitte.com/article/culture-arts-lettres/remise-des-prix-a-l-academie-royale-de-langue-et-de-litterature-francaises-de-belgique/24920  Actualitte.com, Remise des Prix √† l'acad√©mie Royale de langue et de litt√©rature fran√ßaises de Belgique]. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asia Theological Association''' ('''ATA''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ataasia.com/about/aboutus.html Asia Theological Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309060346/http://www.ataasia.com/about/aboutus.html |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of 8 Regional International Evangelical Accrediting Associations of ICETE (The International Council for Evangelical Theological Education).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icete-edu.org/ ICETE&lt;/ref&gt; The other 7 members, or sponsors, of ICETE cover the other continents. ATA is a [[Nongovernmental organization|nongovernmental association]] formed by [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]]s in [[Asia]] to confer [[educational accreditation|accreditation]] to [[seminary|theological institutions]] in [[Asia]].

==History==
ATA was formally established in 1970 as a direct outcome of the Asia-South Pacific Congress of Evangelism held in [[Singapore]] in 1968. It grew out of a concern that "evangelicals had neglected theological scholarship in the past and that the Asian church leadership was increasingly being influenced by Western [[liberal theology]]."&lt;ref name=Mangoes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yung|first1=Hwa|title=Mangoes Or Bananas?: The Quest for an Authentic Asian Christian Theology|date=1997|publisher=[[Oxford Centre for Mission Studies]]|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m16FLYH7_0sC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary goal was to develop "evangelical scholars, thinkers and teachers" for the leadership of the Asian church.&lt;ref name=Mangoes /&gt;

Accreditation services were rendered to institutions in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ataasia.com/pdfs/Accreditation%20Manual%20revised%20Dec%202007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905154258/http://www.ataasia.com/pdfs/Accreditation%20Manual%20revised%20Dec%202007.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }} ATA Accreditation Manual&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has developed in serving its member theological institutions in teaching evangelical biblical theology and in the training of Christian pastors and church workers. Its operating principles include strengthening partnership, enhancing scholarship, furthering academic excellence, fostering spiritual and ministerial formation, and mobilizing resources to fulfill global Christian mission within diverse Asian cultures. The main reason for the establishment of ATA was to be an aid to theological institutions in contextualising theology in the Asian context. Through this Christian pastors and Christian churches can be aided to be more effective in supporting Christian ministry more effectively with other Asians in their own context. Today the majority of Evangelical [[Bible college]]s in Asia are members of ATA.

The ATA's Statement of Faith indicates that theologically it "follows mainstream [[evangelicalism]] in the west."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yung|first1=Hwa|title=Christian Theology in Asia|chapter=Mission and evangelism: evangelical and pentecostal theologies in Asia|date=2008|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXh3iq94MWIC&amp;pg=PA257|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
Asia Theological Association accredits theological seminaries in the Asian region.
 
ATA is the Asian sponsor of the International Council for Evangelical Theological Education (ICETE),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icete-edu.org/ International Council for Evangelical Theological Education sponsor list]&lt;/ref&gt; the theological education network covering all the continents that operates under the auspices of the [[World Evangelical Alliance]] (WEA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldevangelicals.org/members/globalpartners.htm WEA Global Partners&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively partners ATA with established accreditation bodies from other regions of the world, such as [[The Association for Biblical Higher Education]] (ABHE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abhe.org/index.htm Association for Biblical Higher Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717104351/http://www.abhe.org/index.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in North America.

ICETE is the umbrella organisation, and it includes in its membership of 8 sponsors the ABHE (The Association for Biblical Higher Education),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icete-edu.org/ listing ABHE as one of the 8 member associations or sponsors.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a North American accrediting body recognised by CHEA (The Council for Higher Education Accreditation).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ixfHHc0?url=http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp |date=2012-04-06 }} National Faith-Related Accrediting Organizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chea.org/pdf/2011_2012_Directory_of_CHEA_Recognized_Organizations.pdf (page 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The ATA published two journals: the ''Journal of Asian Evangelical Theology'' and the ''Journal of Asian Mission''. Both are published twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journals |url=http://www.ataasia.com/journals |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112120200/http://www.ataasia.com/journals |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 January 2012 |publisher=Asia Theological Association |accessdate=27 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8956">The '''Bristol Dinosaur Project''' is a public engagement and educational initiative run by the [[University of Bristol]]. It began in 2000, and since then the Bristol Dinosaur Project team has visited hundreds of schools and spoken to tens of thousands of children, as well as appearing at science fairs in [[Bristol]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Benton, M.

==Background==
The Bristol dinosaur, ''[[Thecodontosaurus]] antiquus'', was found in 1834, and named in 1836, and did not achieve much recognition locally, either at the time of discovery, in the 1830s, nor later, when it was restudied, in the 1870s, 1900s, or 1990s. Then, after the re-examination of specimens collected in the 1830s, still located in [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Benton, M. J. | authorlink =Michael J. Benton |author2= Juul, L.|author3= Storrs, G.W.|author4= Galton, P. M. | year = 2000 | title = Anatomy and systematics of the prosauropod dinosaur ''Thecodontosaurus antiquus'' from the Upper Triassic of southwest England  | url = | journal = [[Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology]] | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 77‚Äì108 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2000)020[0077:AASOTP]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the collection of additional specimens from [[Tytherington, Gloucestershire|Tytherington]] quarry, in the 1970s, local palaeontologists and geologists realised there was potential to use the newly reinvigorated research programme as a means to include the public, especially local children, in the excitement of scientific discovery.

==Funding==
Initially, the Bristol Dinosaur Project was funded by the [[University of Bristol]] using widening participation funds. These were funds intended to reach out to local schools that did not have a reputation for sending many children to university. By sending students to visit those schools, it was hoped that children might be inspired, work hard, and then later apply to study at university.

Then, the Bristol Dinosaur Project received substantial funding from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], and it was able to operate at a much more ambitious level, from 2010-2013. After that funding cycle, the [[University of Bristol]] continued funding of the project for widening participation purposes.

==Engagement==

From the start, the Bristol Dinosaur Project sought to engage children in two age groups, 7-9-year olds, and 14-15-year olds. With younger children, it has always been very easy to engage their enthusiasm - it is enough to pass round a dinosaur bone or tooth, and they are thrilled to be handling the real thing. With the teenagers, it is more important to let them see how much fun a career in science, or a related field, can be. At that age, young people are making important choices that may affect the rest of their lives - whether to engage with their academic studies or not, whether to focus on science or other disciplines.

A recent evaluation report about the Bristol Dinosaur Project by David Owen, summarised the learning and engagement side of the project as follows:

Since May 2010 the project engaged with over 136 schools and more than 13,200 pupils.  The majority of these pupils were Key Stage 1-2 (11,000) with the remainder being Key Stage 3-4 (2,000).  In total the project delivered 216 day visits to schools, reaching schools across Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset.  The project also visited some schools in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, South Wales, Gloucestershire and one in the West Midlands.  Interviews confirmed that the project had developed an excellent reputation across the city with teachers, schools and organisations that support schools.  This was largely attributed to the high quality resources and the professionalism of the volunteers and staff delivering the workshop.   A major part of the schools‚Äô outreach was the development of fossil walks; these were particularly targeted at Key Stage 3-4.  Young people had the chance to visit Aust Cliffs, South Gloucestershire or Charmouth, Dorset, to find fossils and discover more about how they formed and what life was like in the past. 

In addition to its work with schools, the project team developed a wide range of partnerships with organisations across the city, in order to better engage new audiences and hard-to-reach adults and young people with the project.  Evidence collected for this report suggested that the partnerships would have lasting impacts beyond the HLF funding, and in particular had connected the discovery of the Bristol Dinosaur with the cultural heritage of the city.

In three years the project visited a wide range of annual or one-off public events and festivals including the Bristol Festival of Nature, At-Bristol, the Cheltenham Science Festival, Arnos Vale Cemetery, libraries across South Gloucestershire, and Bristol‚Äôs City Museum &amp; Art Gallery.  The project visited over 30 one-off or annual events in total, with the project team estimating a reach of 18, 000 people (children and adults).   These figures do not include the 650,000 people who visit the Bristol Zoo each year. 
 
The reach of the Bristol Dinosaur Project was recognised as a key success, and is a major part of how the project reached new audiences.  However, in building the partnerships that delivered this reach, the project was able to piggyback on the efforts of other organisations to engage hard-to-reach groups of young people and adult. The project also sought to involve adults and young people from hard-to-reach groups in a more sustained and transformational manner.

In 2018, the Bristol Dinosaur Project was featured in the "Jurassic Make Off" series, a sponsored YouTube collaboration between the [[Let's Play]] channels [[Game Grumps]] and [[The Yogscast]], where Education Officer Rhys Charles was cast as a competition judge alongside Ben Ebbrell of [[Sorted Food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmooBeT4Ep0|title=Jurassic Make Off - Part One|first=Game|last=Grumps|date=2018-07-30|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laboratory work==

Laboratory work has always been the key component of the Bristol Dinosaur Project. The 1975 find from Tytherington Quarry consisted of some 4 tonnes of fossiliferous rock, and numerous technical staff and student volunteers have laboured over the years to remove the fossilized bones from the rock.

The HLF funding allowed one side of a new palaeontology laboratory to be built at the University of Bristol. This was used for the preparation and curatorial work done with over 4 tonnes of rock containing the remains of ''Thecodontosaurus'' and associated micro-fauna. For the first 2 years, the creation and development of a new research collection was one of the main activities in the laboratory. A new volunteering program was developed at the University, and hundreds of volunteers (University students and external volunteers) worked under the preparator¬¥s guidance and supervision in order to process several hundred kilograms of rock by means of acid digestion, mostly using [[acetic acid]]. This process, even though very slow and painstaking, provided great results for the project¬¥s laboratory and research team: several thousand microfossils were recovered, studied and classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van den Berg, T. |author2= Whiteside, D.

J. | year = 2012 | title = The Late Triassic microvertebrate fauna of Tytherington, UK  | url = | journal = [[Proceedings of the Geologists' Association]] | volume = 123 | issue = 4| pages = 638‚Äì648 |doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2012.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of a new summer research program enabled undergraduate and master students to take part in top research projects, with the aim for scientific publications, while developing their laboratory and scientific skills.
 
The second year of the project marked the beginning of curatorial and preparation work. Tons of rock were prepared using mechanical or chemical techniques. Thousands of dinosaur bones were extracted and fully curated into a new research collection. Both micro- and macrofossil collections are now housed at the University¬¥s museum, and are available for further research studies.

'''Charles Bargue''' (c. 1826/1827 ‚Äì April 6, 1883) was a [[France|French]] painter and lithographer noted for devising an influential drawing course.

==Life and career==
[[Image:Bargue The Chess Game.jpg|thumb|''The Chess Game'', by Charles Bargue]]
He is mostly remembered for his ''Cours de dessin'', one of the most influential classical drawing courses conceived in collaboration with [[Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me]]. The course, published between 1866 and 1871 by [[Goupil &amp; Cie]], comprised 197 [[lithograph]]s printed as individual sheets, was to guide students from plaster casts to the study of great master drawings and finally to drawing from the living model. The Charles Bargue Drawing Course is used by many academies and ateliers which focus of [[classical realism]]. Among the artists whose work is based on the study of Bargue's plate work are Pablo Picasso&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glueck|first1=Grace|title=In the Days When Artists Were Taught How to Draw|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/books/art-review-in-the-days-when-artists-were-taught-how-to-draw.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent van Gogh]], who copied the complete set in 1880/1881, and (at least a part of it) again in 1890.

Bargue was a student of Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me.  Bargue worked closely with G√©r√¥me and was influenced by his style, which included Orientalist scenes and historical genre.  Bargue's last painting was completed by G√©r√¥me and is now conserved in the Malden Public Library, [[Malden, Massachusetts]], USA. He travelled extensively through North Africa, and the Balkans, during which time he executed many portraits of local people with meticulous detail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''Clinical pastoral education''' (CPE) is [[education]] to teach [[pastoral care]] to [[clergy]] and others. CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice [[chaplains]] and spiritual care providers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt; Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; CPE is both a [[multicultural]] and [[interfaith]] experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm |title =Frequently Asked Questions about ACPE Clinical Pastoral Education |work =The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Inc |at = See section [http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm#faq1 What is Clinical Pastoral Education?] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theory==
An underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the "[[Reflective Practice|Action-Reflection]]" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose "verbatims" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, [[Richard Clarke Cabot|Richard Cabot]], a physician and adjunct lecturer at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], published an article in ''[[Survey Graphic]]'' suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stokoe |first=Rodney J.R. |year=2005 |origyear=1974 |title=Clinical Pastoral Education |type=Reprint |journal=The Nova Scotia Medical Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=26‚Äì28 |issn=0029-5094 |url=http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-20 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171141/http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }} The reprint is available as part of the project: {{cite web |url=http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |title=Living Human Memories |work=CASC/ACSS The Canadian Association for Spiritual Care |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622230836/http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the Rev. [[Anton Boisen]] placed theological students at the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403034355/http://www.aapc.org/content/brief-history-pastoral-counseling American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accrediting bodies==

CPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspea.org.au/anzacpe.php&lt;/ref&gt; The six constituent associations are: [[New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education]] (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education.

In the United States, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an [[education accreditation|accrediting]] organization for CPE programs by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html|title =Specialized Accrediting Agencies| publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate = 2013-07-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, all CPE training and accreditation is done through [http://www.spiritualcare.ca/ CASC], the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care / Association Canadienne de Soins Spirituels.

'''Cognician''' is a web-based, [[e-learning]] platform for [[personal development]] and [[organisational development]] produced by Cognician Software (Pty) Ltd. The company is located in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]] and was founded by brothers Barry Kayton and Patrick Kayton in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognician Profile|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/cognician|work=CrunchBase|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Cognician is an online [[software platform]] that allows users to explore a particular topic by guiding them through an interactive question-and-answer process inspired by the [[Socratic method]] and the theory of [[cognitive apprenticeship]]. Content is packaged in applets called coaching guides, or cogs for short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognician: An impressive new web-based brainstorming tool|url=http://www.innovationmanagement.se/imtool-articles/cognician-an-impressive-new-web-based-brainstorming-tool/|publisher=Innovation Management.se|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cog consists of two complementary parts: a series of questions designed to provoke [[higher-order thinking]] and a [[Sidebar (publishing)|sidebar]] that contains supporting material in the form of text, images or video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Distefano|first=Dorothy|title=Cognician ‚Äì Productivity Thought Process Expansion|url=http://cognician.appappeal.com|publisher=App Appeal|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users respond to the questions in the chat space, which is designed to resemble an [[IRC]]. However the chat is not a live, synchronous chat. It is a pre-scripted, structured conversation which gives users a thinking agenda and enables them to develop their thoughts on the topic. Cogs are similar to [[workbook]]s in that they bring structure to a complex activity, but the experience of using a cog has the semblance of a live conversation with a person.

== Management ==
The Cognician management team consists of Barry Kayton and Patrick Kayton who are [[CEO]] in USA and South Africa respectively, Robert Stuttaford ([[Chief technology officer|CTO]]) and Victoria Skye Grulke ([[Chief operating officer|COO]]). Cognician's employees include software developers (responsible for the platform), researchers, writers and editors (responsible for content development), and graphic designers (responsible for what users see when interacting with the platform). In this respect, Cognician is a typical [[Digital Content Creation]] (DCC) business.

== Architecture ==
Cognician's core [[business logic]], website, web application and backend systems are implemented using [[Clojure]]. Cognician uses [[Datomic]], a distributed database also built with Clojure, as well as [[Memcached]] for transitory cache and [[RabbitMQ]] for message queuing. Cognician hosts on [[Amazon EC2]] and [[Amazon S3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuttaford|first=Robert|title=Cognician's new architecture with Clojure and Datomic|url=https://speakerdeck.com/robertstuttaford/cognicians-new-architecture-with-clojure-and-datomic|publisher=Speaker Deck|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea for Cognician came from a seminar in creative thinking that Barry Kayton was running at the Graduate School of Business at the University of Cape Town in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kayton|first=Barry|title=The Origin of Cognician|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4lDdm7Mw20|work=Interview on YouTube|publisher=Cognician Software (Pty) Ltd|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kayton brothers worked part-time developing a prototype of the Cognician platform, initially investing their own money in the project and later raising seed capital from angel investors.

In January 2010, at the Geek Retreat in Stanford, the Kayton brothers decided that Cognician would no longer be a [[stealth startup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kayton|first=Patrick|title=Coming Out of Stealth|url=http://dogreatthings.co.za/guide/nav/technology/deciding_when_to_launch/coming_out_of_stealth|publisher=Old Mutual|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2010, Robert Stuttaford joined as CTO and began building Cognician as an Adobe AIR Application. In its earliest alpha version Cognician took the form of a mind map and the company founders described the app as a kind of [[extended mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frey|first=Chuck|title=Mind mapping and the "extended mind"|url=http://mindmappingsoftwareblog.com/mind-mapping-and-the-extended-mind/|work=The Mindmapping Software Blog|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, Cognician was officially registered as a company in Cape Town, South Africa. The company has set up subsidiaries in the United States (San Carlos, CA) and the United Kingdom (London).

==Awards and recognition==
In 2010, Cognician received local and international recognition at the Cape Town Activa Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City announces winners of Entrepreneurship Competition|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/MediaReleases/Pages/CityannounceswinnersofEntrepreneurshipCompetition.aspx|publisher=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seedcamp Johannesburg, the Seedcamp London finals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seedcamp Week 2010: Europe fires up the warp drive for the Enterprise|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/seedcamp-week-2010-europe-fires-up-the-warp-drive-for-the-enterprise/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by being named one of Europe's top 11 startups at the TechCrunch Europas Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SA startup selected as TechCrunch 'Best New Startup'|url=http://tech4africa.com/tag/cognician/|publisher=Tech4Africa|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2013, the Kayton brothers were among 17 high impact entrepreneurs selected by [[Endeavor (non-profit)|Endeavor]] to join its global network of entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17 High-Impact Entrepreneurs from Brazil, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey Join the Endeavor Network|url=http://www.endeavor.org/blog/joburg-49th-isp/|publisher=Endeavor|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2014, Cognician's Leadership Accelerator program received the Best Soft Skills Solution award at DevLearn's DemoFest in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eLearning DemoFest 2014|url=http://www.elearningguild.com/DevLearn/content/3438/devlearn-2014-conference--expo--elearning-demofest/|publisher=eLearning Guild|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2017, Recruiting Daily selected Cognician as one of the top 100 HR technologies and recruiting tools worth watching in Q1 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100+ HR Technologies and Recruiting Tools Worth Watching in Q1 2017|url=http://recruitingdaily.com/hr-technologies-to-watch-q1-2017/|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pivot ==
Cognician's initial aim was to work with publishers to adapt non-fiction books into cogs for the consumer market ([[Business-to-consumer|B2C]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atagana|first=Michelle|title=Cognician: A thought is a terrible thing to waste|url=http://ventureburn.com/2011/02/cognician-a-thought-is-a-terrible-thing-to-waste/|publisher=VentureBurn|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Cognician launched their first book-to-cog adaption which was based on ''The Decision book'' by Mikael Krogerus and Roman Tsch√§ppeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World‚Äôs first decision making engine is launched|url=http://www.profilebooks.com/worlds-first-decision-making-engine-is-launched/|publisher=Profile Books|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the company soon found traction selling to enterprises ([[Business-to-business|B2B]]) and decided to [[Lean Startup#Pivot|pivot]]. In July 2011 the company signed its first enterprise contract with The Allan Gray Orbis Foundation for the creation of 120 cogs aimed at developing high impact leaders and entrepreneurs among its fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction To Cognician|url=http://allangrayorbis.babel.za.net/press/article/news/28/an-introduction-to-cognician|publisher=The Allan Gray Orbis Foundation|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other clients followed, including De Beers, DNV-GL, Incitec Pivot Limited, Lloyds Register, Rodan + Fields, Diageo, Beam Suntory, Dimension Data, Cindy Solomon &amp; Associates, The Allan Gray Orbis Foundation, Allan Gray Limited, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Bank, Competitive Capabilities International, Telkom, Standard Bank, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognician Profile|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/cognician|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crazy English''''' ({{zh|s=ÁñØÁãÇËã±ËØ≠|p=Fƒìngku√°ng Yƒ´ngy«î}}) is a [[brand name]] related to a non-traditional method [[English language learning and teaching|learning English]] in mainland [[China]] conceived by [[Li Yang (Crazy English)|Li Yang]]. Li believes that the traditional way of learning English in China is ineffective.  Li Yang's method places heavy emphasis on practicing English orally.  His method can be described with the slogan "By shouting out loud, you learn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anthony|first=John|title=Access to International English|publisher=Cappelen Damm|page=16|url=http://issuu.com/cdundervisning/docs/pages_from_til_blabok-utgave|author2=Richard Burgess |author3=Robert Mikkelson |accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways it remains similar to the traditional pedagogic practices of Chinese education in that it still relies on repetition and recitation. Members of the school administration in China often disapprove of the method because they believe it goes against the traditional Chinese values of modesty and restraint.

== History ==
For over a decade China has been gripped by the ‚ÄúEnglish Fever‚Äù phenomenon as the country increasingly associates English language skills with success in the business world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/28/crazy-english|title=Crazy English|last=Osnos|first=Evan|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though China states that it has the largest number, 300 million, of English speakers in the world, the number of people who translate their  reading and writing skills to spoken word decreases substantially.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8757375/What-is-Crazy-English-and-who-is-Li-Yang.html|title=What is Crazy English and who is Li Yang?|last=Moore|date=2011-09-12|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue with students not being comfortable or confident in speaking English opened the door for Li Yang‚Äôs Crazy English method of teaching.

Yang, like many others, struggled with speaking in English. In preparation for his TEM 4 English exam, Yang found that while practicing English he would often time find himself shouting English passages and class exercises aloud; this made him more confident. After only four months of using his new method of studying Yang placed second in his class on the exam.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=Amber|date=April 2008|title=A Survey of Li Yang Crazy English|url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp180_crazy_english.pdf|journal=Sino-Platonic Papers|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating Yang started to work as an electrical engineer but also taught English in his spare time using his method of teaching English as a ‚Äúshouted language‚Äù. He later quit his job in 1994 to start his own English teaching company ‚ÄúLi Yang English Promotion Studio" to promote his technique" which he named ‚ÄúCrazy English‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the following years, Yang‚Äôs method would gain popularity beginning after Ouyang Weijian, the leader of an elementary school asked Yang to teach for a crowd of about five thousand people, Weijian would later go on to join Yang‚Äôs company as his business manager.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spotlightenglish.com/listen/crazy-english|title=Crazy English|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major contribution to Crazy English‚Äôs rise to fame was director Zhang Yuan‚Äôs 1999 documentary Fengkuang Yingyu (‚ÄúCrazy English‚Äù) which gained Crazy English attention, especially in the Western world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Crazy English popularity continued to grow causing more than 20 million people to sign up for a course.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eventually the Chinese government recognized Crazy English as a legitimate teaching method by allowing Yang to teach in Beijing, to teach soldiers on top of the Great Wall of China, as well as conduct Intensive Training Camps to prepare for the 2008 Olympics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Today ‚ÄúLi Yang English Promotion Studio" is a multi-million dollar business that employs over 150 people with Yang still at the helm as director and principal speaker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ‚ÄúCrazy English‚Äù comes from the fact that Yang‚Äôs methods are so different from traditional Chinese classroom norms &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; of being restrained. Crazy English goes against these traditions as the method utilizes physical and mental engagement. The word ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù is not to be synonymous with insanity but instead, stand for Yang‚Äôs belief that everything in life should be done wholeheartedly with passion and abandon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "Crazy stands for the single-minded pursuit of dreams. Crazy stands for the total devotion to your work. Crazy stands for the passion of commitment to reach the goal," says the course's guidebook.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Methodology ==
Li Yang‚Äôs unconventional method of teaching English includes screaming popular and random English phrases at a rapid pace and occasionally, involves hand movements in patterns that reflect the word‚Äôs pronunciation. In a survey on Crazy English students identified Li Yang‚Äôs technique as one which does not include grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing, or listening comprehension. In 2003, Li in an interview with Kripal Singh said, ‚Äú[Chinese students] have no problem writing, they have no problem reading. That‚Äôs why I trigger their power of speaking.‚Äù &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Crazy English highlights various aspects of learning a language without using any traditional ways like learning grammar or reading textbooks, pronunciation is the backbone of this methodology. Crazy English follows the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as its standard for giving pronunciation notation. Li Yang employed several native English speakers to incorporate exaggerated American pronunciation in his lecture to develop conversation practicality.

Crazy English also makes significant use of gesticulation. Amber R. Woodward offers the example of Crazy English students learning ‚Äòi as in like‚Äô by making the right hand‚Äôs index finger, drawing a complete clockwise circle; similarly, for ‚Äòth as in three‚Äô holding the right hand above the head, bending his hand at the wrist with a flat palm, and moving arm from right to left over one‚Äôs head, also for ‚Äòa as in made‚Äô holding the right hand above the head, bending hand at the wrist with a flat palm, moving arm from front to back over his head.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These gesticulations were ridiculed for not being consistent with the hand movements in his various lectures.

Li Yang chooses not to provide vocabulary lists or grammar notes for the words and phrases he uses. In his lectures, Yang sometimes translates English words or phrases into Chinese to focus on the emotion behind the word by reminding the audience of the Chinese translation to make the learning of the word faster. Crazy English uses simple forms of vocabulary and grammar this is why the translation in order to invoke feeling is not necessary every time. Crazy English lectures mostly contain English phrases and not full sentences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The psychological aspect of the Crazy English method is related to its emphasis on improving speech. Students practice his technique by going behind buildings or on rooftops and shouting English. They also go to his rallies and shout together; this helps them overcome their shyness (everybody is doing it, so nobody is embarrassed). Li‚Äôs frequently used slogan, ‚ÄúCrazy English! Crazy life! Crazy world! I love this crazy game, so let‚Äôs go!‚Äù signifies the method Li wants his students to adapt to this mindset in order to learn English in his way.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù in Crazy English signifies Li Yang‚Äôs want for students to have rage and passion in their studies and to fulfill their dreams by giving up their fear of failing.

== Advantages ==
Crazy English encourages students to shout out English words whether behind buildings, on rooftops, or at organized rallies. Shouting together with others helps people overcome their shyness, because if everyone is doing it nobody is embarrassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odditycentral.com/pics/crazy-english-to-learn-the-language-by-shouting-out.html|title=Crazy English - English Learning Program by Li Yang|website=www.odditycentral.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-10|date=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional Chinese hierarchies, youths are not encouraged to show a mastery of skills that surpass the skills of their adult counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Li Yang‚Äôs proponents argue that his method of teaching may help Chinese students get over their inhibitions to learning and practicing English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Crazy-English/article14785006.ece|title=Crazy English|date=2007-06-30|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li believes that most Chinese are brought up with modesty and a lack of confidence‚Äîthat they are afraid of losing face in front of family, friends, educators, and even strangers. Common English teaching methods in China reflect this fear of failure and accommodate students by allowing them to learn English without practicing speaking, preparing dialogues, or giving individual oral presentations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
However, an opposer of Crazy English notes that Li Yang only says English words without giving any further details about the context in how, when, where, and what condition does one word should and could be applied&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.uii.ac.id/index.php/jee/article/view/6508/5878|title=Account Suspended|website=journal.uii.ac.id|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another opposer comments that Li does not spend effort on structuring any cohesion between vocabulary or sentences; he assumes that students get enough of that in the classroom. Instead, he uses ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù sentences shouted at high decibels and funny hand movements to engage his audience in participation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/ 2009-08/25/content_18395429.html|title=Crazy English|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In additional challenger also notes that students rarely ‚Äì if not never ‚Äì are presented with a situation in which they need just to parrot a native speaker.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Another argues that because of crazy english many students have come to believe that english has no standards which results in their english not sounding American or British.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 1996 Yang‚Äôs method became popular in Guangdong province against the will of the local English teachers. To counter, the local government prohibited Yang from giving seminars in the area for six months. Chengdu, Sichuan also banned Li from teaching for an extended span of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critics of Crazy English say that the promotion of Crazy English over the past 15 years has resulted in most students believing English has no standard, and that some even mistake American English for the standard one, which has made most students in China after 16 years of studying English sound neither British nor American. As a result, many are so confused with the two different kinds of English accents that they choose to keep their mouths shut.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Critics also describe crazy english as a technique only appropriate for certain situations. For example a taxi driver who needs to only a few sentences to communicate with english speaking customers but not as the main method to teaching students in a classroom setting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Critics note that although Li advocates fluency in pronunciation, his dismissal of fluency in content is slightly problematic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''European Association for the Education of Adults''' (EAEA) is a European [[NGO]] whose purpose is to link and represent European organisations directly involved in adult learning. The main focus is to promote adult learning and access to and participation in non-formal adult education for all, particularly for groups currently under-represented. EAEA aims at influencing EU policies on non-formal adult education and [[lifelong learning]] and cooperates with the institutions of the European Union and with international organisations as the [[Council of Europe]], the [[International Council for Adult Education]] (ICAE) and [[UNESCO]].

==History==
Previously known as the European Bureau for Adult Education, EAEA has its roots in the [[Folk high school]]s in Europe, and in particular in those of the Netherlands. In the first years after the Second World War, the Netherlands Folk high school movement saw it as its mission to strive for a Europe wide cooperation of Folk high schools.

The "Centre Europ√©en de la Culture" established in 1949 in Geneva developed, under the directorship of [[Denis de Rougemont]], the idea of having a number of "Foyers de Culture" throughout Europe in and through which European culture in its diversity and unity could be experienced and spread. Oscar Guermonprez, director of the Bergen Folk high school in the Netherlands, imagined in this context an office for documentation and information, with an advisory council representing the whole field of adult education.

The European Bureau for Adult Education was founded in 1953 by representatives from a number of European countries. The Bureau was formally established in Bergen, hosted by the Agency for European Folk high school work. Oscar Guermonprez was the first President.

==EAEA Grundtvig Award==
The EAEA Grundtvig Award rewards every year projects in adult education that offer innovative or original ideas, partnerships and methodologies in adult learning. The EAEA Grundtvig Award was launched in 2003 by EAEA in order to celebrate excellence in adult education. Each year the Award has a different theme.

The Award is named after [[Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig]] (1783‚Äì1872), a Danish educator mainly influential in the development of non-formal adult education in Europe and worldwide. He provided the adult education sector a foundational philosophy that underpins much of the work in lifelong learning and laid the ground work for the development of learning centres, in all kinds of contexts, from residential educational institutions to agricultural co-operatives.

==Younger Staff Training ==
EAEA organises an annual training "European Adult Education and Lifelong Learning ‚Äì Introduction for younger staff". The objectives are to learn about European developments in adult education and lifelong learning, to exchange information and knowledge about each other's organisations, to understand advocacy work at European level and adult education backgrounds, to learn about EAEA and other key civil society organisations.

'''Gaisce ‚Äì The President's Award''' ({{lang-ga|Gaisce ‚Äì Gradam an Uachtar√°in}}) is an [[award]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], earned by young people between the ages of 15 and 25 for participating in several activities for a certain period. There are three awards: [[bronze]], [[silver]] and [[gold]].

The term "gaisce" is from the [[Irish language]] and can be translated as "achievement". The award was established by a trust deed under the patronage of the [[President of Ireland]] on 28 March 1985. In 1988 the award became part of the Duke of Edinburgh's [[International Award Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intaward.org/ireland |title=Ireland &amp;#124; The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award |accessdate=5 January 2014 |publisher=The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profile of the award was raised substantially following the first award ceremonies performed by President Hillery in 1989.

==Overview==
[[File:Gaisce ‚Äì The President's Award Ireland.JPG|thumb|Gaisce Award]]
Every participant has the support of a "PAL" (President's Award Leader). It is not a competition, the only person you compete with is yourself. The PAL guides you through the challenges and sets appropriate activities.

Gaisce's mission is to contribute to the development of all young people through the achievement of personal challenges. Awards can be entered directly (without a previous award) or indirectly (from a previous award). There are four challenges in each award, which all must be outside school (except [[European Computer Driving Licence|ECDL]]):

The award is presented at a regional ceremony by either a famous person (bronze/silver) or the President of Ireland (gold).

==Affiliation with Scouting Ireland==
Gaisce is now closely affiliated with [[Scouting Ireland]]. It is integrated into the new 'One Program' for those who are at the qualifying age. Scouting Ireland has an award scheme called the [[Chief Scout Award (Scouting Ireland)|Chief Scout Award]] which is an award that runs in conjunction with the Gaisce, although it is considered by many to be more difficult. Scout, Venture Scout, and Rover Scout Chief Scout Awards are affiliated with the Bronze, Silver and Gold Gaisce Awards. Through the Chief Scout Award you can in turn earn your Gaisce, but this does not work the other way around; if you have completed your Gaisce you do not receive your Chief Scout Award as well. All leaders who have been invested into Scouting Ireland and who have the appropriate training can take the role of being a PAL, if they so desire.

Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], which was designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name="Metropolis 2010 Nov" /&gt; Ranalli attended [[Mount Saint Michael Academy]] high school in New York City and graduated in 1964.&lt;ref name="St. Michael Yearbook 1964" /&gt; From 1967 to 1968, he attended [[New York Institute of Technology]], and [[Pratt Institute School of Architecture|Pratt Institute]], [[Brooklyn, New York]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Architecture]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Institute|first1=Pratt|title=Alumni Directory|date=1995|page= 263|publisher=Bernard C. Harris Publishing Co., Inc.|location=White Plains, New York|oclc=33266982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Ranalli attended [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], earning a [[Master of Architecture]] in 1974. Upon graduation, he traveled on a research grant throughout Europe before returning to New York.&lt;ref name="Metropolis 2010 Nov" /&gt;

== Career ==
Ranalli founded his firm, "George Ranalli, Architect", in [[New York City|New York]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Profile: George Ranalli Architect|journal=Architectural Digest|date=August 15, 1991|volume=48|issue=9|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early on, architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] described Ranalli in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article as one of the "better younger architects" working in the [[Modernist]] idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Architecture View; Modernism Reaffirms Its Power|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/arts/architecture-view-modernism-reaffirms-its-power.html|newspaper = [[New York Times]]|date = November 24, 1985|access-date = July 22, 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = [[Paul Goldberger|Paul]]|last = [[Paul Goldberger|Goldberger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberger stated that Ranalli's designs were tied "as closely to the ancient craft of building as to the modern business of churning out huge commercial projects, yet they bespeak a consistent awareness of the realities of our age as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW; Taking the Pulse of New American Architecture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/01/arts/architecture-view-taking-the-pulse-of-new-american-architecture.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[Michael Sorkin]] described Ranalli as  "a creator and preserver of worlds, a precisionist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorkin|first1=Michael|title=Exquisite corpse : writing on buildings|date=1991|publisher=Verso|location=London;New York:|isbn=0860913236|pages=x,365p.:ill.;25cm|edition= 1st|url=https://www.worldcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranalli is credited with carrying forward the lessons of Italian architect [[Carlo Scarpa]] into new settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern;|first1=Robert A M|last2=Fishman|first2=David|last3=Tilove|first3=Jacob|title=New York 2000 : architecture and urbanism between the Bicentennial and the Millennium|date=2006|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=1580931774|pages=1520 pages : color illustrations ; 29 cm|url=https://www.worldcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooker|first1=Graeme|last2=Stone|first2=Sally|title=From organisation to decoration : an interiors reader|date=2012|publisher=Routledge,|location=London|isbn=9780415436199|pages=xvii, 294 pages : illustrations ; 26 cm|edition= 1st|url=https://www.worldcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture critic [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote that Ranalli's "purpose is to move modernism into an enriched and more deeply referenced style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huxtable|first1=Ada Louise|title=Breaking All the Rules With New York's Public Building Design|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124218023213113609|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Yale University]] granted Ranalli a [[Master of Arts degree]], [[honoris causa]].

He was in the [[United States|U.S.]] from 1942 to 1945, having been interned as a [[Jew]] at the [[Drancy internment camp]] (north-east of [[Paris]]) and then escaped.

He began his career as a follower of [[Henri Bergson]] and the American pluralist philosophers [[William James]] and [[George Santayana]]. He is known as one of those introducing [[Hegelian]] thought in France in the 1930s (his book on Hegel was published in 1929), ahead of [[Alexandre Koj√®ve]]'s more celebrated lectures. He was also a champion in French thought of the [[Denmark|Danish]] proto-[[existentialist]] [[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]]. These enthusiasms, which became the significant books ''Le malheur de la conscience dans la philosophie de Hegel'' (1929) and ''[[Kierkegaardian Studies|√âtudes kierkegaardiennes]]'' (1938) were controversial, in the prevailing climate of thought. However, he influenced a number of key thinkers including [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In the second issue of ''[[Ac√©phale]]'', [[Georges Bataille]]'s review, Jean Wahl wrote an article titled "[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and the Death of God", concerning [[Karl Jaspers]]' interpretation of this work. He became known as an anti-systematic philosopher, in favour of philosophical innovation and the concrete.

==In exile==
While in the USA, Wahl with [[Gustave Cohen]] and backed by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] founded a 'university in exile', the ''[[√âcole Libre des Hautes √âtudes]]'', in [[New York City]]. Later, at [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] where he had a position, he set up the ''D√©cades de Mount Holyoke'', also known as ''Pontigny-en-Am√©rique'', modelled on meetings run from 1910-1939 by French philosopher Paul Desjardins (November 22, 1859 - March 13, 1940) at the site of the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] of [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. These successfully gathered together French [[intellectual]]s in wartime exile, ostensibly studying the English language, with Americans including [[Marianne Moore]], [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[Roger Sessions]]. Wahl, already a published poet, made translations of poems of Stevens into French. He was also an avid reader of the [[Four Quartets]] and toyed with the idea of publishing a poetical refutation of the poem. (See, e.g., his "[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=73&amp;issue=6&amp;page=7 On Reading the Four Quartets]." )

==Post World War II==
In post-war France Wahl was an important figure, as a teacher and editor of learned journals. In 1946 he founded the [[Coll√®ge philosophique]], influential center for non-conformist intellectuals, alternative to the Sorbonne.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmanuel Levinas]] ''√âthique et infini'', 1982, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1950, he headed the ''[[Revue de M√©taphysique et de Morale]]''.

Wahl translated the second hypothesis of the ''[[Parmenides (Plato)|Parmenides]]'' of [[Plato]] as "''Il y a de l'Un''", and [[Jacques Lacan]] adopted his translation as a central point in psychoanalysis, as a sort of antecedent in the Parmenides of the analytic discourse. This is the existential sentence of psychoanalytic discourse according to Lacan, and the negative one is "''Il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel'' " &amp;mdash; there is no such a thing as a sexual relationship.

==History==

The Foundation is currently working with both their San Francisco and Stuttgart branches to focus on enhancing, celebrating, and sharing their heritage and tradition of innovation through their projects, additional mobile educational outreach, and design excellence for the next generation of technical innovators.&lt;ref name="worth" /&gt;

==Past Projects==

The Foundation marked each mentorship with a specific project that falls within a sector of interest. The general sectors of interest for the Foundation are science and research; art, design and architecture; community and ethics; and business and technology.&lt;ref name="worth" /&gt;

===Global Health Scholars Project===
The pilot project for the mentoring program was led by Dr. David Bangsberg, M.D., a leader in HIV treatment strategies and founding dean&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalhealthdelivery.org/ghdi/faculty/david-bangsberg&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Portland State University School of Public Health]], who mentored Dr. Conrad Muzoora, M.D., a Ugandan medical researcher, head of internal medicine at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://med.must.ac.ug/conrad-muzoora&lt;/ref&gt; The two focused on working together from 2008-2013 in order to successfully research treatment options for patients with HIV/AIDS in addition to at least one other infectious disease like tuberculosis and bring positive change by empowering the next generation of doctors and researchers who will remain in Uganda to fight life-threatening infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney Pulitzer.

===World Trade Center Documentary Arts Project===
In a partnership between the Maybach Foundation and Silverstein Properties, four photographers were given the opportunity to document the rebuilding of the [[World Trade Center (2001‚Äìpresent)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] and mentored by Joe Woolhead, the official photographer of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref&gt;https://joewoolhead.wordpress.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; The four photographers were Marika Asatiani ([[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Benjamin Jarosch ([[New York City|New York]], [[United States]]),  Nicole Tung (New York, USA), and Vicky Roy ([[New Delhi]], [[India]]). The goal of the project was for the proteges to become skilled documentary photographers and produce a collection of images that capture the rebuilding of one of the US's most prominent landmarks, developing a generation of photographers who will raise awareness about political, cultural, and social issues.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;Cole, Patrick.

===Julian Schnabel--Vahakn Arslanian Arts Mentorship===
Coinciding with the [[Venice Biennale]] 2011, the Maybach Foundation founded their art mentoring program, forming a collaborative mentorship between [[Julian Schnabel]] and [[Vahakn Arslanian]], both New York-based artists. The goal of the mentorship project was to develop the creative potential of promising young artists who have overcome adversity and to use art to challenge the way we see the world and look to the future, these two were chosen because they were kindred spirits aiming to break down the prevailing aesthetic and establish a new way of seeing, much in the way of the revolutionary work of Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler. 
With the assistance of Maybach, the two were able to work together using automobile parts in art pieces to create several exhibitions for the 2011 Venice Biennale, 2011&lt;ref&gt;Daimler's Diverse Involvement at the Fourth St Moritz Art Masters. MarsMediaSite, Daimler, 26 Aug. 2011 URL:media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Daimlers-diverse-involvement-at-the-fourth-St-Moritz-Art-Masters.xhtml?oid=9915766.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Moritz Art Masters Event]], and a 2012 exhibition entitled Holy, Heavenly in the West Village, sponsored by the foundation, Maybach Manufaktur, and Vito Schnabel.

===David LaChapelle--Garret Suhrie Photography Mentorship===
The arts mentorship project paired promising young artistic talent with established leaders in the art world to highlight their creativity. Up-and-coming photographer Garret Suhrie was mentored&lt;ref&gt;Dumitrache, A. (2010, August 27). Maybach Backs Photographer David LaChapelle. Retrieved September 25, 2017, from URL:https://www.autoevolution.com/news/maybach-backs-photographer-david-lachapelle-23875.html&lt;/ref&gt; by star photographer [[David LaChapelle]] as a means to motivate society to appreciate and preserve nature as a way to survive urban chaos, using art to challenge the way the natural world is viewed.&lt;ref&gt;http://garretsuhrie.com/pages/about&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrie documented the decaying industrial facilities in his home city of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], displaying the original sights hidden amongst the natural world. Suhrie's resulting works from the period were showen at the Maybach Center of Excellence Event in [[Stuttgart, Germany]], where he donated two of his photographs to the Daimler Art Collection. In 2011, Suhrie was featured at the St. Moritz Art Walk.&lt;ref&gt;http://garretsuhrie.com/portfolio/press-published&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culinary Arts: Food Movement Leadership Project===
Through this project the Maybach Foundation paired Tessa Tricks, a post-graduate student in the anthropology of food from the [[UK]], with Sarah Weiner and other leaders&lt;ref&gt;http://seedlingprojects.org/team/&lt;/ref&gt; from the Seedling Projects organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://seedlingprojects.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Tessa Tricks was nominated by Aine Morris of the Sustainable Food Trust organization&lt;ref&gt;http://sustainablefoodtrust.org/contributors/aine-morris/&lt;/ref&gt;  in the UK for her exceptional resume and experience in the [[Slow Food]] movement. The project allowed Tricks to forge relationships for future collaboration, investigate examples of best practices from the USA sustainable food movement, and help organize the 2014 Good Food Awards with her mentor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodfoodawards.org/2014-winners/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culinary Arts: Sustainable Fishing===
After earning her Masters in Public Administration from [[Cornell University]] and becoming active in the Maine Seafood Marketing Network, Amanda LaBelle was mentored by Monique Coombs, the Director of Marine Programs for the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mainecoastfishermen.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mainecoastfishermen.org/staff&lt;/ref&gt; The program explored opportunities for integrating seafood into Maine's local food systems and bridged the gap between agriculture and fisheries in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;Finn, J.

[[File:Michael Park Rudolf Steiner School.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Michael Park Rudolf Steiner School in [[Auckland]]]]
'''Michael Park School''' is a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]] located in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]

The founding of Michael Park School and Kindergarten arose out of a community vision for [[Rudolf Steiner]] education in Auckland which culminated in the school opening on the present site in 1979, beginning with a kindergarten and lower school classes. Today Michael Park is an integrated Area School, providing seamless education for students from Playgroup (children aged 2‚Äì3 years), Nursery (2¬Ω - 4 years), [[Kindergarten]] (4‚Äì6 years), lower school (6‚Äì14 years) to high school (students aged 14‚Äì18 years). The Steiner School refers to the years [[Year 2|2]] to [[Year 13|13]] as ''Class 1'' to ''Class 12''.

== Steiner's Philosophy ==
Unlike 'conventional' state schools, the [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] philosophy encourages a slightly later development, and a more creative environment.

Another unique aspect of Michael Park is their keen eye for aesthetics. The belief is that more graceful architecture will be beneficial to student's learning, meaning that there are less right angles in the school buildings and more curves.

===Independent Study===
One of the key things making Rudolf Steiner schools unique is the year-long project of each and every 7th Form/Year 13 student. The student is encouraged to learn or develop a skill, complete an exercise and assist the community. Some recent projects have included: learning to play a [[musical instrument]], making a [[short film]], learning authorship or painting, restoration/building of cars, boats, etc.

The student study is assessed on many levels including the presentation of an oral speech, and development of records (i.e., keeping a diary or their efforts) and compiling a visual display to represent their work and what they've learned over the course of the year.

The final result of the Independent Study contributes substantially to their Steiner certificate results for the year.

== Qualifications ==
This is a state integrated school (i.e., they are largely funded by [[Government subsidies|Government subsidy]]). This way, '''Michael Park School''' students can participate in both government standard assessment, [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] as well as [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] School Certificate. Currently Steiner School Certificate is offered at Level 1.

==Sporting success==

Michael Park has had an unusually high proportion of students representing New Zealand in sport, particularly [[lacrosse]]. Their school team, the MPS Storm, contained eight members of the Under-19 New Zealand Men's Lacrosse team, including the captain, Toby Delamore.

It is an independent organisation whose statutory objectives are to enhance the understanding and knowledge of people about financial matters (including the UK financial system) and to enhance their ability to manage their own financial affairs.  The service provides free money advice and guidance online and by telephone.

The service was launched in April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK financial advice service launched|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12960667|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; superseding the Moneymadeclear-branded service provided by the [[Consumer Financial Education Body]]. Prior to 2010, the service had been a division of the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA). It was set up by the UK Government and is paid for by a statutory levy on the financial services industry.&lt;ref name=Milligan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Brian|title=Budget 2016: Money Advice Service to be abolished|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic goals and direction of the Money Advice Service are set by a 12-member board. The board is appointed by, but acts independently of, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The service has an independent Chairman and board appointed by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA). The FCA‚Äôs appointments of the Chair and Chief Executive are subject to the approval of [[HM Treasury]].

In April 2012 the Money Advice Service took on additional responsibility for funding and improving the quality, consistency and availability of UK debt advice, a statutory function as set out in the [[Financial Services Act 2012]].

In March 2017 the Money Advice Service launched the new Standard Financial Statement (SFS), an initiative designed to bring greater consistency to the way organisations assess people‚Äôs finances when they are in debt.

The Money Advice Service also lead the work of a wide range of organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop the UK Financial Capability Strategy
a ten-year plan to address people‚Äôs skills and knowledge around money management, their attitudes and motivations that hold them back and their access to products and services.

In March 2016 [[HM Treasury]] announced that the service would become part of a new guidance body that would see the [https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en Money Advice Service], The [[Pensions Advisory Service]] and [[Pension Wise]] combine to form a new single guidance body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|title=Money Advice Service to be abolished|last=Milligan|first=Brian|date=2016-03-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/financialguidanceandclaims.html Financial Guidance and Claims Bill] seeks to establish the new statutory body by [[Royal assent|Royal Assent]] from Autumn/Winter 2018.  The new guidance body will be accountable to Parliament, with responsibility for coordinating the provision of debt advice, money guidance, and pension guidance, ensuring that people across the UK are able to seek the help and advice they need to manage their finances.

The Bill entered the [[House of Lords]] for its first reading on 22 June 2017 and moved to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for its first reading on 22 November 2017.

The [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/queens-speech-2017-background-briefing-notes Queen's Speech of June 2017] announced that the new single body would be funded through existing levies on pension schemes and the financial services industry.

'''The National Council for the Training of Journalists''' ('''NCTJ''') was founded in 1951 as organisation to oversee the training of journalists for the newspaper industry in the United Kingdom and is now playing a role in the wider media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nctj.com/about-us/| title=About Us| work=NCTJ web site| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927170530/http://www.nctj.com/about-us/| archivedate=27 September 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a self-appointed body and does not hold any statutory powers from central government, meaning students and those seeking to enter the media industry do not have to legally hold one of its qualifications to obtain work as a journalist.

==Purpose==
The NCTJ delivers the premier training scheme for journalists in the United Kingdom &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nctj.com/about-us/who-we-are|title=Who we are|last=|first=|date=|work=NCTJ web site|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|access-date=9 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCTJ offers a range of qualifications for those beginning a career in journalism and for those who want to continue their professional development. The Level 3 Diploma in Journalism introduced in 2007 and the Level 5 National Qualification in Journalism (NQJ) introduced in 2013 have been joined by apprenticeship and foundation certificate qualifications. Qualifications cover news, magazine, production, sports, business and finance, online, video, radio and television journalism. Courses are vocational, focusing on skills convergence and multimedia journalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The NCTJ is a charity for all media with a professional awarding body recognised by Ofqual, Qualification Wales and CCEA Northern Ireland, an accreditation board, Student Council, focus groups and forums, and the annual Journalism Skills Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nctj.com/about-us/who-we-are|title=NCTJ website|last=|first=|date=9 February 2018|work=NCTJ|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCTJ alumni include [[Mark Austin (journalist)|Mark Austin]], [[Piers Morgan]], [[Kay Burley]], [[John Inverdale]], [[Reshmin Chowdhury]], [[Geordie Greig]] and [[Helen Skelton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nctj.com/careers/nctj-alumni/index.html | title=Alumni| work=NCTJ web site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being the examining body, the NCTJ offers short training courses to refresh candidates' knowledge prior to them sitting exams, and also for professionals looking for related training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nctj.com/Training-Courses|title=Training courses|last=|first=|date=9 February 2018|work=NCTJ web site|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCTJ is also a professional awarding body recognised by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulator [[Ofqual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Detail/Index/1108?category=organisations&amp;query=nctj|title=The Register of Regulated Qualifications: NCTJ Training details|website=register.ofqual.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diploma in Journalism==

The Diploma in Journalism is a Level 3 qualification that is made up of four mandatory subjects ‚Äì essential journalism, essential journalism e-portfolio, essential journalism ethics and regulation and essential media law and regulation ‚Äì and a selection of elective skills modules &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nctj.com/journalism-qualifications/diploma-in-journalism|title=Diploma in Journalism|website=www.nctj.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet the gold standard, candidates have to achieve grades A-C in all subjects plus 100wpm shorthand.

==NQJ==
The National Qualification in Journalism (NQJ) is a Level 5 qualification that examines all-round competence in a range of essential journalism skills.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nctj.com/journalism-qualifications/National-Qualification-in-Journalism-NQJ|title=National Qualification in Journalism|website=www.nctj.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be eligible to sit the NQJ, candidates must have achieved the gold standard in the Diploma in Journalism and have undertaken a period of 18 months' full-time employment on a newspaper or news agency. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==The ''Oxdown Gazette''==
The ''Oxdown Gazette'' was a fictional newspaper used by the NCTJ as a setting for its journalism exam papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=35161&amp;sectioncode=1 | title=Farewell then, Oxdown | date=11 August 2006 | work=Press Gazette | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421114345/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=35161&amp;sectioncode=1 | archivedate=21 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, trainee journalists would have to write reports on fires, floods, rail crashes and fatal accidents in the imaginary town of Oxdown. The idea was to replicate, as far as possible, the sense of local knowledge trainees would have if working for a real paper.

In 2006, the NCTJ decided that it would no longer use Oxdown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nctj.com/latestnews.php?news_id=news_id&amp;newsid=53 | title=Farewell to Oxdown | date=26 September 2006 | work=NCTJ web site | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121041231/http://www.nctj.com/latestnews.php?news_id=news_id&amp;newsid=53 | archivedate=21 November 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì instead, a variety of locations and publications would feature on its exam papers. This did not go down well with some journalists and journalism lecturers, who had a sentimental attachment to the fictional town and launched a campaign to save it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=30976 | title=NCTJ's Oxdown faces final disaster | date=23 June 2006 | work=Press Gazette | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517192855/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=30976 | archivedate=17 May 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Occupy movement''' was an international [[Progressivism#Contemporary_mainstream_political_conception|progressive]], [[social movement | socio-political movement]] against [[social equality|social]] and [[economic inequality]] and the lack of "real [[democracy]]" around the world. It aimed primarily to advance social and economic justice and new forms of democracy. The movement had many different scopes; local groups often had different focuses, but among the movement's prime concerns were how [[Corporatocracy|large corporations]] (and the [[global financial system]]) control the world in a way that disproportionately benefited a minority, undermined democracy, and was unstable.{{refn|&lt;ref name="the99declaration"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unitethe99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lessighp"/&gt;}} "Occupy" formed part of what [[Manfred Steger]] called the "global justice movement".&lt;ref&gt;

The first Occupy protest to receive widespread attention, [[Occupy Wall Street]] in New York City's [[Zuccotti Park]], began on 17 September 2011. By 9 October, Occupy protests had taken place or were ongoing in [[List of Occupy movement protest locations |over 951 cities across 82 countries, and in over 600 communities in the United States]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street protests go global"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street protests continue worldwide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; Although most active in the United States, by October 2012 there had been Occupy protests and occupations in dozens of other countries across every inhabited continent. For the first month, overt police repression remained minimal, but this began to change by 25 October 2011 when police first attempted to forcibly remove [[Occupy Oakland]]. By the end of 2011, authorities had cleared most of the major camps, with the last remaining high-profile sites ‚Äì in [[Washington, D.C.]] and in London ‚Äì evicted by February 2012.{{refn|&lt;ref name="globalCrackdown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cityBycity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Authorities clear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smash"/&gt;}}

The Occupy movement took inspiration in part from the [[Arab Spring]],&lt;ref name="Where now for the Occupy protesters?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tahrir Square protesters send message of solidarity to Occupy Wall Street"/&gt; from the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|2009 Iranian Green Movement]], and from the Spanish Indignados Movement, as well as from the overall global wave of [[anti-austerity protests]]. The movement commonly uses the slogan "[[We are the 99%]]" and the #Occupy [[hashtag]] format; it organizes through websites such as Occupy Together.&lt;ref&gt;

 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="From a single hashtag, a protest circled the world"/&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the movement, which [[Cornel West]] described as a "democratic awakening", is difficult to distill to a few demands.&lt;ref name="westc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost22"/&gt; On 12 October 2011, [[Los Angeles City Council]] became one of the first governmental bodies in the United States to adopt a resolution stating its informal support of the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="City Council Unanimously Passes Occupy L.A. Resolution - Protesters Struggle to Distance Themselves From Democrats, Unions - Los Angeles News - The Informer"/&gt; In October 2012, the Executive Director of Financial Stability at the [[Bank of England]] stated that the protesters were right to criticise and had persuaded bankers and politicians "to behave in a more moral way".&lt;ref name="Andy"/&gt;

==Background==
In 2009 and 2010, students across the University of California [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|occupied campus buildings in protest]] against budget cuts, tuition hikes, and staff cutbacks that had resulted from the Great Recession of 2008. According to [[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent Magazine]], "It was in the context of the California student movement that the slogan 'Occupy Everything, Demand Nothing' first emerged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/from-master-plan-to-no-plan-the-slow-death-of-public-higher-education|title=From Master Plan to No Plan: The Slow Death of Public Higher Education|work=dissentmagazine.org|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Huffington Post'' noted that "During one incident in March of 2010, 150 protesters were arrested for trying to occupy part of Interstate 80 in protest of the budget cuts and tuition hikes, displaying a banner that read 'Occupy everything,' while shutting down the roadway for an hour, and were crushed by the same kind of overwhelming police force that was later mobilized against Occupy encampments across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/10/thousands-gather-for-occupy-cal-protest_n_1086963.html|title=Occupy Cal Berkeley Protest Draws Thousands, As Two Years Of Occupation Come Home|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Adbusters]]'' editor [[Micah White]], who designed the original [[Occupy Wall Street]] concept, traveled to California for the protests and took part in the occupation of [[Wheeler Hall]].  He wrote enthusiastically for ''Adbusters'' about the "revolutionary potential of [the students] struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/blackspot-blog/open-letter-students.html|title=An Open Letter to Students|work=adbusters.org|accessdate=19 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006073640/https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/blackspot-blog/open-letter-students.html|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2011 Spanish protests|Spanish Indignados movement]] began in mid-May 2011, with camps at [[Madrid]] and elsewhere. According to sociologist [[Manuel Castells]], by the end of the month there were already hundreds of camps around Spain and across the world.&lt;ref name="Castells"/&gt; For some journalists and commentators the camping in Spain marked the start of the global occupy movement, though it is much more commonly said to have begun in New York during September.&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JesseJ"/&gt;
On 30 May 2011, a leader of the ''Indignados'', inspired by the [[Arab Spring]], [[Gwangju Democratization Movement|5.18 Movement]] of 1980, and [[June Democracy Movement]] of 1987&lt;ref name="Frayer19052011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="From Europe to the US, protesters are inspired by Arab spring"/&gt; called for [[15 October 2011 global protests|a worldwide protest on 15 October]].&lt;ref name="Democracia Real Ya prepara una convocatoria mundial para el 15 de octubre"/&gt; In mid-2011, the Canadian-based group [[Adbusters Media Foundation]], best known for its advertisement-free [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] magazine ''[[Adbusters]]'', proposed a peaceful occupation of [[Wall Street]] to protest [[Regulatory capture|corporate influence]] on democracy, address a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent [[global financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Adbusters co-founder [[Kalle Lasn]] registered the ''OccupyWallStreet.org'' web address on 9 June.&lt;ref name="preoccupied"/&gt; According to [[Micah White]], the senior editor of the magazine, "[we] basically floated the idea in mid-July into our [email list] and it was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world, it just kind of snowballed from there."&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt;

One of the inspirations for the movement was the [[Democracy Village]] set up in 2010, outside the [[British Parliament]] in [[London]]. The protest received additional attention when the internet hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] encouraged its followers to take part in the protests, calling protesters to "flood lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and Occupy Wall Street".&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonmessage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adbusters3"/&gt; They promoted the protest with a poster featuring a dancer atop Wall Street's iconic [[Charging Bull]].&lt;ref name="inline.poster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nation.FAQ"/&gt; The first protest was held at [[Zuccotti Park]] in New York City on 17 September 2011,&lt;ref name="twsC65"/&gt; the tenth anniversary of the re-opening of Wall Street trading after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The protests were preceded by a similar [[Occupy Dataran]] movement in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in July, seven weeks before Occupy Wall Street.&lt;ref name="New democratic occupation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Great Occupation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="occupydataran-chronology"/&gt;

==="We are the 99%" slogan===
{{Main|We are the 99%}}
[[File:Occupy protesters, Bennington, VT.jpg|thumb|Occupy protesters with "We are the 99%" signs in [[Bennington, Vermont]]|alt=A group of seven people holding hand-lettered cardboard signs along a city street. The largest says "We are the 99%".]]

The phrase "The 99%" is a [[political slogan]] used by participants in the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="dcourier"/&gt; It was originally launched as a [[Tumblr]] blog page in late August 2011.&lt;ref name="motherjonesfoundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy"/&gt; It refers to the concentration of wealth among the top 1% of income earners compared to the other 99 percent;&lt;ref name="cbsprotestsspread"/&gt; the top 1 percent of income earners nearly tripled after-tax income over the last thirty years according to a [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) report.&lt;ref name="ref name"/&gt;

The report was released just as concerns of the Occupy Wall Street movement were beginning to enter the national political debate.&lt;ref name="WashPostBloomberg"/&gt; According to the CBO, between 1979 and 2007 the incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%. Since 1979 the average pre-tax income for the bottom 90% of households has decreased by $900, while that of the top 1% increased by over $700,000, as federal taxation became less [[Progressive tax|progressive]]. From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 income earners in the U.S. saw their income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%.&lt;ref name="Stupid"/&gt; In 2009, the average income of the top 1% was $960,000 with a minimum income of $343,927.&lt;ref name="CNNstats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBPP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doubled"/&gt;

In 2007, the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15% ‚Äîan example of the [[Pareto principle]]. Financial inequality (total net worth minus the value of one's home)&lt;ref name="ucsc"/&gt; was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.&lt;ref name="ForbesJacobs"/&gt;

However, after the [[Great Recession]] which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%, further widening the gap between the 1% and the 99%.&lt;ref name="ForbesJacobs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="levyinstitute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucsc1"/&gt; During the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%. In this period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any time since 1928.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This is in stark contrast with surveys of U.S. populations that indicate an "ideal" distribution that is much more equal, and a widespread ignorance of the true [[income inequality]] and [[wealth inequality]].&lt;ref name="psychological"/&gt;

==Goals==
During the early weeks, the movement was frequently criticized by the news media for having no clearly defined goals. Speaking on 7 October 2011, Kalle Lasn of Adbusters said that, in the early stages, the lack of demands was the "mysterious part" that allowed the movement to grow.&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street: All day, all week"/&gt; By late October, Adbusters had been trying to "rally it around a single, clear demand" for a [[Robin Hood tax]], with a global march in support of the Robin Hood tax planned for 29 October.&lt;ref name = "Obamasupports" &gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/052226f8-f80c-11e0-a419-00144feab49a.html#axzz1b2gyVWm5|title= Obama extends support for protesters|work= [[Financial Times]]|author= Shannon Bond|date = 16 October 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobinHood"/&gt; [[Naomi Wolf]] argued that the impression created by much of the media that the protestors did not have clear demands was false. Wolf argued that they did have clear demands including a desire to end what they saw as the [[Money trail|corrupting effect]] of money on politics.&lt;ref name="The shocking truth about the crackdown on Occupy"/&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine stated that the claims of [[Kalle Lasn]] and [[Micah M. White]] were specific: tighten banking-industry regulations, ban [[high-frequency trading]], arrest all 'financial fraudsters' responsible for the 2008 crash, and form a Presidential commission to investigate and prosecute corruption in politics.&lt;ref name="preoccupied"/&gt; According to ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', protesters wanted more and better jobs, more equal distribution of income, bank reform, and a reduction of the influence of corporations on politics.&lt;ref name="lowenstein"/&gt; The movement has also been described as broadly [[Anti-capitalism|anticapitalist]].&lt;ref name="Seize the Ponies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reflections for the US Occupy Movement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="An Occupy Road Trip"/&gt;

Some commentators such as [[David Graeber]] and [[Judith Butler]] criticized the idea that the movement must have clearly defined demands; they argued that issuing demands is counterproductive for the Occupy movement, because doing so would legitimize the very power structures the movement seeks to challenge.&lt;ref name="graeber1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy as Form"/&gt; In late November, the London contingent of the Occupy movement released their first statement on corporations, in which they called for measures to end [[tax evasion]] by wealthy firms. The reason for the delay in articulating a clear demand was given as the time it takes to reach a consensus with the sometimes slow processes of ''[[participatory democracy]]''.&lt;ref name="Occupy London sets out agenda on how it wants to change the economic world"/&gt; In November "Occupy London Stock Exchange", an offshoot of Occupy London, said that they were working on a global collaboration of various occupations that reflected the voices of diverse movements worldwide.&lt;ref name="Help us draft the global statement for the Occupy movement"/&gt; The global movement has been called the reinvention of politics, revolution, and utopia in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="ics"/&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Hands signals-Occupy-A4.svg|thumb|Assembly hand signals]]
Activists have used web technologies and social media like [[IRC]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] to coordinate events.&lt;ref name="cnn7102011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = MD Conover &amp; C Davis &amp; E Ferrara &amp; K McKelvey &amp; [[Filippo Menczer|F Menczer]] &amp; A Flammini |title = The Geospatial Characteristics of a Social Movement Communication Network |journal = [[PLoS ONE]] |volume = 8 |issue = 3 |year = 2013 |pages = e55957 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0055957 |pmid=23483885 |pmc=3590214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = MD Conover &amp; E Ferrara &amp; [[Filippo Menczer|F Menczer]] &amp; A Flammini |title = The Digital Evolution of Occupy Wall Street |journal = [[PLoS ONE]] |volume = 8 |issue = 5 |year = 2013 |pages = e64679 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0064679 |pmid=23734215 |pmc=3667169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indymedia]] helped the movement with communications, saying there had been conference calls on [[Skype]] with participants from up to 80 locations. Interactive [[live streams]] of events by [[independent journalists]] such as [[Tim Pool]] were used to augment [[Mainstream media]] coverage. The progressive provider [[May First/People Link]] offered cost-free memberships for dozens of groups, including groups in Iran and Germany, to host websites, emails, and email lists securely. The movement went further to attempt to promote its causes through multi-media and art, which has been gathered and archived by institutions such as the [[National Museum of American History]] and [[New York Historical Society]]. The aim of much of the art produced was to visually impact the mainstream through imagery to attempt to create solidarity and unity among the "99%".&lt;ref name="groundswellcollective"/&gt;

The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund released a model community bill of rights, promoting laws that strip corporations of their personhood rights and elevating the rights of citizens, for occupy organizers to adopt locally.&lt;ref name="YesMagazine"/&gt; In December 2011, [[Occupy Homes]] embarked on a movement to assist home owners who had lost or were scheduled to lose their homes due to [[foreclosure]] as a result of what they called the illegal practices used by banks that took advantage of consumers. The group planned to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions.&lt;ref name="Les-2011"/&gt;

===Structure===
[[File:Occupy Wall Street Washington Square Park 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|The General Assembly meeting in [[Washington Square Park]], New York City, on 8 October 2011]]
The movement has been described as having an "overriding commitment" to [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-will-extremists-hijack-occupy-wall-street"/&gt; Much of the movement's democratic process occurs in "working groups," where any protester is able to have their say. Important decisions are often made at [[General assembly (Occupy movement)|General assemblies]],&lt;ref name="asamblea"/&gt; which can themselves be informed by the findings of multiple working groups. Decisions are made using the [[consensus]] model of participatory democracy. This often features the use of [[Occupy movement hand signals|hand signals]] to increase participation and operating with discussion facilitators rather than leaders ‚Äì a system that can be traced in part to the [[Quaker]] movement several centuries ago, to [[Athenian democracy|participatory democracy in ancient Athens]], and to the [[spokescouncil]]s of the 1999 [[anti-globalization movement]].&lt;ref name="From Occupy Wall Street to Occupy Everywhere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="byConcensus"/&gt;

At the assemblies, working group proposals are made to meeting participants, who comment upon them using a process called a ''stack''; a queue of speakers that anyone can join. In New York City, Occupy Wall Street uses what is called a [[progressive stack]], in which people from [[marginalized groups]] are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, with [[facilitator]]s, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to "step forward, or step back" based on which group they belong to, meaning that women and minorities get to go to the front of the line, while white males must often wait for a turn to speak.&lt;ref name="byConcensus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Where Are the Women at Occupy Wall Street?"/&gt; The progressive stack concept has been criticized by some outside the movement as "forced equality" and "unfair."&lt;ref name="OWS protesters have strange ideas about fairness"/&gt;

===Nonviolence===
The occupy movement began with a commitment to nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/10/17/occupy_wall_streets_struggle_for_non_violence/|title=Occupy Wall Street's struggle for nonviolence |publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occupywallst.org/article/everyone-has-right-occupy-space-safely/|title=Everyone has the Right to Occupy Space, Safely|publisher=OccupyWallSt.org|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycga.net/resources/documents/declaration/|title=Principles of Solidarity|publisher=NYC General Assembly|accessdate=30 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002110413/http://www.nycga.net/resources/documents/declaration/|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent references were made to the writings of nonviolent theorist Dr. [[Gene Sharp]] whose work was reported to have influenced nonviolent struggle movements in Serbia and the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arrow |first=Ruaridh |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12522848 |title=Gene Sharp: Author of the nonviolent revolution rulebook |publisher=BBC |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study groups were organised across the US Occupy camps discussing Sharp's 198 methods of nonviolent action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiaarchitects.com/events/occupy-amherst-gene-sharp |title=Events at the Nacul Center |publisher=TIA Architects |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his book [[From Dictatorship to Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dingalingy |url=http://occupyoakland.org/2012/02/new-guide-to-liberation-from-gene-sharp-a-the-albert-einstein-institute-for-non-violent-action-ofr-httpwww-aeinstein-orgselflibselfliberation-pdf/ |title=New guide to liberation from Gene Sharp at the Albert Einstein Institute |publisher=Occupy Oakland |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occupynashville.org/2012/11/22/non-violent-revolution-book-studydiscussion-to-start-soon/ |title=¬ª "Non-violent revolution"- book study/discussion to start soon / Occupy Nashville |publisher=Occupynashville.org |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=23 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119005731/http://occupynashville.org/2012/11/22/non-violent-revolution-book-studydiscussion-to-start-soon/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sagealliance.net/meetings/gene_sharp_discussion_group_4-26-2012 |title=Gene Sharp Study/Discussion Group |publisher=SAGE Alliance |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=23 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222110824/http://sagealliance.net/meetings/gene_sharp_discussion_group_4-26-2012 |archivedate=22 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent film about his work [[How to Start a Revolution]] by Ruaridh Arrow which premiered in Boston on 18 September was screened in Occupy camps across the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=occupylsx |url=http://occupylsx.org/?tag=gene-sharp |title=gene sharp &amp;#124; Occupy the London Stock Exchange |publisher=Occupylsx.org |date=29 November 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=16 Dec 11 |url=http://occupymaine.org/voices/25-sun-18-2011-7pm-film-how-to-start-a-revolution |title=Film: How to Start a Revolution |publisher=Occupymaine.org |accessdate=23 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222034703/http://occupymaine.org/voices/25-sun-18-2011-7pm-film-how-to-start-a-revolution |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occupyboston.org/2011/11/09/how-start-revolution-film-screening-occupy-boston-tonight-7pm/ |title="How To Start a Revolution" Film Screening at Occupy Boston tonight, 7pm |publisher=Occupy Boston |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occupybellinghamwa.org/ai1ec_event/film-how-to-start-a-revolution-at-the-pickford-2/?instance_id= |title=Film: "How to Start a Revolution" at the Pickford ¬ª Occupy Bellingham |publisher=Occupybellinghamwa.org |date=10 March 2012 |accessdate=23 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509115938/http://www.occupybellinghamwa.org/ai1ec_event/film-how-to-start-a-revolution-at-the-pickford-2/?instance_id= |archivedate=9 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sharp himself warned that many of the tactics the movement were employing were not effective. In an Al Jazeera interview, he said, "The [Occupy] protesters don't have a clear objective, something they can actually achieve. If they think they will change the economic system by simply staying in a particular location, then they are likely to be very disappointed. Protest alone accomplishes very little."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/12/201112113179492201.html |title=Q&amp;A: Gene Sharp ‚Äì Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2011, sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] congratulated Spanish occupiers for the fact that not a single violent incident had been reported after 11 days of camping all over Spain.&lt;ref name = "Castells"/&gt; Castells said that nonviolence was of fundamental importance, and was echoed by various other sociologists and social historians including Lester Kurtz, Prof. [[Maurice Isserman]] and Prof. [[Tom Juravich]].&lt;ref name = "Castells"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "violent fringe"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Credibility"/&gt; Juravich and others have, however, said that conflict can be important in attracting attention, with much to be gained if occupiers are seen as victims of the violence, providing occupiers keep their own aggression strictly within limits.&lt;ref name = "violent fringe"/&gt; In the words of one occupier, it can help them gain media coverage if they "make things a little sexy and badass" .  The Direct Action Working Group of Occupy Wall Street endorsed [[diversity of tactics]] from the earliest days of the encampment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/05/occupy-wall-street-direct-action|title=Occupy Wall Street: the direct action committee driving the protest's success|author=Karen McVeigh|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all occupiers have upheld the commitment to nonviolence, with aggressive tactics being used in Spain from as early as 15 June, and with some journalists saying the New York branch of the movement did initially accept protestors who had not signed up to nonviolence.&lt;ref name = "earnest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="militant"/&gt;

In September, sympathetic coverage given to the movement by the media was substantially increased after the circulation of a video of pepper spray being used by a police commander against peaceful female protestors.&lt;ref name = "violent fringe" &gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011-11-13/occupy-movement-violent-fringe/51188258/1|title= 'Occupy' movement faces challenge from violent fringe|work= [[USA Today]]|author= Rick Hampton|date=14 November 2011|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early October, [[Naomi Klein]] congratulated New York occupiers for their commitment to nonviolence.&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street: The Most Important Thing in the World Now"/&gt; By November 2011, media sources began to report an increase in violence, with allegations of sexual assault and incidents of violence from occupiers against the police, including one officer allegedly stabbed with scissors.&lt;ref name = "violent fringe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence and the 'Occupy' Movement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York police arrest dozens of anti-Wall Street protesters"/&gt; Some occupy camps responded by requiring that all occupiers sign a resolution to be nonviolent if they wished to stay.&lt;ref name="Credibility"/&gt; Rick Hampton for [[USA Today]] said the vast majority of occupy members have been nonviolent.&lt;ref name = "violent fringe" /&gt; Reviewing the global movement in December 2011, [[Anthony Barnett (writer)|Anthony Barnett]] said its nonviolence remained an immense strength.&lt;ref name = "Long"/&gt;

=== Social media ===
The beginning of the Occupy Movement was reliant on the usage of social media accounts for the dispersal of information. These accounts were very useful and helped tremendously. The social media accounts eventually became hierarchical and failed their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/bsi/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f929568d-a8c7-4e69-a795-7856e708a478@sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4212&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9YnNpLWxpdmU=#AN=118988689&amp;db=bth|title=Social media teams as digital vanguards: the question of leadership in the ...: Business Source|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{who|date=July 2017}} believe, in order to have been more successful, the social media accounts should have been more heavily regulated and kept to a standard. In addition, a study was published that followed how Occupy user interests changed in time from 1 June 2011 to 31 August 2012. It showed 40% of users produced Occupy related content during peak activity of the movement. But, it was not sustained over the following year, with the user ratio dropping to less than 5% in the last three months of the study period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conover|first=Michael D.|last2=Ferrara|first2=Emilio|last3=Menczer|first3=Filippo|last4=Flammini|first4=Alessandro|date=2013-05-29|title=The Digital Evolution of Occupy Wall Street |journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e64679|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064679 |pmc=3667169|pmid=23734215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to the movement from celebrities were both in-person and online. Some find it controversial that rich celebrities made appearances at the Occupy Wall Street Movement, but [[Kanye West]] justified his appearance as helping give power back to the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/899857024/87160CD9172E49B8PQ/1?accountid=14496|title=Celebs make Occupy Wall Street fashionable|last=|first=|date=|website=search.proquest.com|publisher=|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other celebrities such as [[Yoko Ono]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/yokoono/status/120309562246053889|title=Yoko Ono on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Ruffalo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/markruffalo/status/127729339205824512|title=Mark Ruffalo on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Moore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/MMFlint/statuses/130399167674728448|title=Michael Moore on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; tweeted and showed their support.

Many hold{{who|date=October 2017}} that the success of OWS has led to the success of [[Bernie Sanders]] and his political platform, disrupting the political conversation about environmental impact and economic equality.

==Chronology of events==
{{See also|Timeline of Occupy Wall Street}}
The [[WikiLeaks]] endorsed news site WikiLeaks Central began promoting the idea of a "US Day of Rage,"&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt; on 10 March 2011. The Canadian editor in chief [[Heather Marsh]], and the American WikiLeaks Central writer [[Alexa O'Brien]] modeled the concept after the Day of Rages being held at that time in the Middle East and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name="georgiebc" /&gt; Early promotion by the WikiLeaks Twitter and blog was reported&lt;ref name="Dorling" /&gt; as being instrumental in the group's success.&lt;ref name="Dorling" /&gt; It was renamed Occupy Wall Street after the idea publicized on an email list&lt;ref name="Adbusters sparks Wall Street protest" /&gt; and online blog.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} 13 July 2011, by Vancouver-based non-profit Canadian group [[Adbusters]].&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy Canada rallies spread in economic 'awakening'" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Branding of the Occupy Movement" /&gt; The Occupy Wall Street protests began on 17 September 2011 in downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Occupy SF" /&gt; On 9 October 2011, activists in cities in over 25 countries repeated calls for [[15 October 2011 global protests|a global protest on 15 October]].&lt;ref name="cnn7102011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="15october" /&gt; A list of events for 15 October included 951 cities in 82 countries.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt; On 15 October events were held in many cities worldwide.&lt;ref name="bangkokpost" /&gt;

===17 September to 14 October 2011===
On 17 September 2011, 1,000 protesters gathered in downtown Manhattan walking up and down Wall Street. About 100 to 200 people stayed overnight in Zucotti Park, two blocks north of Wall Street. By 19 September, seven people had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Areas Blocked as Police Arrest Seven in Protest" /&gt;
{{anchor|Anthony Bologna}}
At least 80 arrests were made on 24 September after protesters started marching uptown and forcing the closure of several streets. Most of the 80 arrests were for blocking traffic, though some were also charged with [[disorderly conduct]] and resisting arrest. Police officers also used a technique called [[kettling]] which involves using orange nets to isolate protesters into smaller groups.&lt;ref name="80 Arrested as Financial District Protest Moves North" /&gt; Videos which showed several penned-in female demonstrators being hit with [[pepper spray]] by a police official were widely disseminated, sparking controversy. That police official, later identified as [[Inspector#United States|Deputy Inspector]] Anthony Bologna, was shown in other videos hitting a photographer with a burst of spray.

[[File:Wallst14occupy.jpg|thumb|Protesters rallying near New York police headquarters, with [[St. Andrew's Church (New York City)|St. Andrew's Church]] in the background]]
Public attention to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern that was to be repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police. [[Clyde Haberman]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "If the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever choose to recognize a person who gave their cause its biggest boost, they may want to pay tribute to Anthony Bologna," calling the event "vital" for the still nascent movement.&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt; On 1 October 2011, protesters set out to march across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. ''The New York Times'' reported that more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, "The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway." A spokesman for the [[New York Police Department]], Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused.&lt;ref name="700arrest" /&gt;

On 4 October, a group of protesters who were arrested on the bridge filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging that officers had violated their constitutional rights by luring them into a trap and then arresting them.&lt;ref name="NYT Bridge Lawsuit" /&gt; In June 2012, a federal judge ruled that the protesters had not received sufficient warning of arrest pending entrance onto the Brooklyn Bridge. Although video evidence showed the police warning protesters by bullhorn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-battle-of-brooklyn-bridge|title=The Battle of Brooklyn Bridge|work=Shareable|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after reviewing it, Judge Jed S. Rakoff sided with plaintiffs, saying, "a reasonable officer in the noisy environment defendants occupied would have known that a single bull horn could not reasonably communicate a message to 700 demonstrators".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

On 5 October 2011, joined by union members, students, and the unemployed, the demonstration swelled to the largest yet with an estimated 15,000 marchers joining the protest. Smaller protests continued in cities and on college campuses across the country. Thousands of union workers joined protesters marching through the Financial District. The march was mostly peaceful‚Äîuntil after nightfall, when scuffles erupted. About 200 protesters tried to storm barricades blocking them from Wall Street and the Stock Exchange. Police responded with pepper spray and penned the protesters in with orange netting. Inspired by Occupy Wall Street, British protesters organized an [[OccupyLSX|occupation of the London Stock Exchange]] to bring attention to what they saw as unethical behavior on the part of banks. One of the organizers of the protest said the protests were to be focused against "increasing social and economic injustice in this country." In his opinion, "the Government has made sure to maintain the status quo and let the people who caused this crisis get off scot-free, whilst conversely ensuring that the people of this country pay the price, in particular those most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="guardian protests london" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sydney morning herald protests london" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro attracts facebook" /&gt;

===15 October to 4 November===
[[File:Occupy Ljubljana crowd 1.jpg|thumb|A crowd of protestors in [[Congress Square]], Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 15 October 2011]]
On [[15 October 2011 global protests]] were staged around the world, with thousands of protesters staging demonstrations in 900 cities including Auckland, Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo, S√£o Paulo, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, and many other cities. In Frankfurt, 5,000 people protested at the European Central Bank and in Zurich, Switzerland's financial hub, protesters carried banners reading "We won't bail you out yet again" and "We are the 99 percent." Protests were largely peaceful; however, a protest in Rome that drew thousands turned violent.&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; Thousands of Occupy Wall Street protesters gathered in [[Times Square]] in New York City and rallied for several hours.&lt;ref name="ChicagoSun-Times-WallStreet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews2" /&gt; Several hundred protesters were arrested across the U.S., mostly for refusing to obey police orders to leave public areas. In Chicago there were 175 arrests, about 100 arrests in Arizona (53 in [[Tucson]], 46 in Phoenix), and more than 70 in New York City, including at least 40 in Times Square.&lt;ref name="Hundreds arrested in 'Occupy' protests" /&gt; Multiple arrests were reported in Chicago, and about 150 people camped out by city hall in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street: How long can it last?" /&gt;

In the early morning hours of 25 October, police cleared and closed an Occupy Oakland encampment in [[Frank Ogawa Plaza]] in Oakland, California.&lt;ref name="Police clear Occupy Oakland camps, arrest dozens" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jesse" /&gt; The raid was chaotic and violent, but Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan expressed his pleasure concerning the operation because neither the police nor the public suffered any injuries.&lt;ref name="Occupy Oakland Gets Shut Down" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bender1" /&gt; A street march that afternoon protesting the closure culminated in a confrontation between police and protesters, who sought to re-establish the Ogawa Plaza encampment. During this confrontation, protester Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a tear-gas projectile or smoke canister fired by police.&lt;ref name="bender1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott Olsen injuries prompt review as Occupy Oakland protests continue" /&gt; By 29 October 2011, there were around 2,300 Occupy protest camps across around 2,000 cities worldwide.&lt;ref name="'Occupy Auckland' protest speaks with many voices" /&gt; On 2 November, protesters in [[Oakland, California]], shut down the [[Port of Oakland]], the fifth busiest port in the nation. Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city; however, a member of the Occupy movement was quoted by the BBC as estimating as many as 30,000 may have taken part.&lt;ref name="bbc-15568057" /&gt;

On 4 November 2011, "Occupy the Roads" (OTR) started traveling throughout the U.S. to bring the message of Occupy, in order to educate the people on various issues facing the general public and shine a light on the inequities and political injustice. OTR has been to every major Occupy Event in support of all occupied cities, traveling over 31,000 miles and visiting 42 States and 160 cities since inception. One side of the RV (named the "V"- from the chant "Whose V? RV") has been decorated with stickers, posters, and event notices from around the Country representing a billboard for the Occupy movement. On the other side is 31&amp;nbsp;ft of graphics in support for Bradley/Chelsey Manning and WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===5 to 25 November===
On 5 November, protesters held "Bank Transfer Day", marching on banks and other financial institutions to urge Americans to move their money from big corporate banks to smaller community credit unions. It was reported that an estimated 600,000 people took their money out of major banks.&lt;ref name="theweek" /&gt; On 11 November, [[Remembrance Day]] in Canada, police forcibly removed tents from Victoria Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia and arrested 15 protestors.&lt;ref name="Arrests as Halifax Cops Evict Occupy protesters" /&gt; On the night of 14 November, a coordinated crackdown was undertaken by authorities around the world, with several camps being forcibly cleared including Zuccotti Park in New York, Oakland,&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt; Oregon,&lt;ref name="'Occupy Auckland' protest speaks with many voices3" /&gt; Denver and Zurich. For some of the other camps such as the one at St Pauls in London, no physical action was taken, but on 15 November authorities stepped up legal action to gain authorization for a forcible eviction. ''Financial Times'' editor [[Richard Lambert]] suggested that the shift to confrontational tactics by authorities would be more likely to spur on the movement rather than cause it to disband.&lt;ref name="globalCrackdown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cityBycity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Its camp is gone, but the Occupy movement will grow" /&gt; However, John Gapper, chief business commentator at the ''FT'', offered a different view. Gapper said that it may be advantageous that the camps were being closed down, as they were beginning to alienate even members of the public who were initially fully sympathetic with the movement.&lt;ref name="A better way to occupy Wall Street" /&gt; During a demonstration at [[UC Davis]] on 18 November 2011, campus police Lieutenant [[John Pike (police officer)|John Pike]] used [[pepper spray]] on seated students.&lt;ref name="UCD police chief placed on administrative leave" /&gt; The incident drew national attention and led to further demonstrations, petitions, and calls for Chancellor [[Linda P.B. Katehi]] to resign. (See: [[UC Davis pepper-spray incident]])&lt;ref name="wordpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbslocal" /&gt; On 22 November, occupiers [[Human microphone|mic checked]] President Obama to draw his attention to the treatment they had received from the police, including thousands of arrests.&lt;ref name="cbsnews4" /&gt;

===26 November to 31 December 2011===
[[File:CarolineLucasBOI06Dec11.jpg|thumb|Green party leader [[Caroline Lucas]] discussing green economics with occupiers at London's ''Bank of Ideas'' on 6 December 2011]]
By December, occupiers had begun to divert their energies beyond [[protest camp]]s and a narrow focus on the banks, instead seeking to engage further with mainstream politics and joining forces with established activist groups to support causes broadly compatible with the interests of "the 99%". Interviewing one of the informal leaders of the movement, ''Financial Times'' journalist Shannon Bond found that issues of concern included: "the unemployment rate, household debt, student debt, the lack of prospects for people graduating from college and foreclosures."&lt;ref name="spreads"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a65f048-201b-11e1-8462-00144feabdc0.html|title= Occupy sets its sights beyond Wall Street|work= [[Financial Times]]|author= Shannon Bond|date=7 December 2011|accessdate=9 December 2011}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., [[Occupy Homes]] joined with other existing human rights activists groups and began to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions.&lt;ref name="Les-2011" /&gt;  On 1 December, two evicted activists in Portland, Oregon, planted a table on the plaza of Portland's City Hall and lit a candle, igniting a Prayer Vigil/Occupation of City Hall that lasted 18 months. On 22 December ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that some of the cities which had forcefully disbanded occupy camps were now facing legal challenges.&lt;ref name="Cities that broke up Occupy camps now face lawsuits over free speech, use of force" /&gt;

===1 January 2012 to 2016===
On 2 January 2012, [[Occupy Nigeria]] began, sparked by Nigeria's President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] announcing the ending of fuel subsidies in the country.  There was support from the global movement, but most of the activity took place in Nigeria itself, with a report from [[The Christian Science Monitor|CSM]] saying strikes were effectively shutting down whole cities.  On 16 January Jonathan responded by announcing he would bring prices back down by partially restoring the fuel subsidy.&lt;ref name="Occupy Nigeria victory: president to cut fuel prices" /&gt;

While students have been involved with Occupy since its inception, early 2012 has seen increasing formal interaction between the Occupy movement and academia. In the US, universities including [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[Roosevelt University|Roosevelt]] have begun offering courses about the movement, in the case of Columbia the course includes field work where students join in with Occupy activities. In Great Britain, Occupy's outwork teams are planning school visits to give talks about the movement and related issues.&lt;ref name="Occupy protest movement to go into schools" /&gt;&lt;ref name="University offers Occupy Wall Street course where students earn class credit by working 'in the field'" /&gt;&lt;ref name="University offers Occupy Wall Street course where students earn class credit by working 'in the field'5" /&gt;

On 23 January, EGT LLC (Export Grain Terminal) and the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] (ILWU) reached a tentative agreement, mediated by [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state governor [[Christine Gregoire]].&lt;ref name="ILWU, EGT reach tentative deal in Longview labor dispute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Port of Longview signs off on ILWU and EGT settlement" /&gt;  The agreement resolved a year-long dispute, paving the way for ILWU Local 21 workers to work inside the $200 million grain terminal at the [[Port of Longview]] in south-west [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].  This came after "Occupy the Ports" protests which shut down multiple ports on the west coast of the United States on 12 December.  The goals of those protests included support of longshoremen and truckers in disputes with EGT and terminal operator SSA Marine (partially owned by [[Goldman Sachs]]).&lt;ref name="bbc-occupy-west-coast-ports-shut-down" /&gt;
[[File:"Occupy DC" sign and tents from the Occupy Movement in downtown D.C.jpg|thumb|"Occupy DC" sign and tents in downtown Washington, D.C. October, 2011]]
A worldwide poll conducted in January 2012 found that only one third (37%) of respondents were familiar with the movement. Of the respondents who were aware of the movement, supporters of the movement outweighed those in opposition two to one.&lt;ref name="Jan2012Global" /&gt; In late January, Occupy protested at the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merkel tells Davos forum Europe will fix debt problem" /&gt; On 17 March, [[Occupy Wall Street]] attempted to mark six months of the movement, by reoccupying [[Zuccotti Park]], the location of the first Occupy camp. Protestors were soon cleared away by police, who made over 70 arrests.&lt;ref name="Dozens arrested as Occupy Wall Street marks anniversary with fresh protests" /&gt; On 1 May, the Occupy movement marked a resurgence with a [[May Day]] general strike that took place in cities across the U.S., including New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Occupy movement returns for May Day protests in D.C., New York and around U.S." /&gt; This included a revival of the [[Free University of New York]].&lt;ref name="maydaynyc" /&gt;

On the weekend of 15 and 16 September, members of the Occupy movement gathered in Union Square, with direct action training on the 15th and a celebration of the movement on the 16th. On 17 September, the Occupy movement celebrated its first anniversary with several marches and general assemblies which were attended by thousands of protesters.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The longest US "re-occupation" started on 1 December 2011, when evicted activists from the [[Occupy Portland]] camp set up a table on the plaza of Portland's City Hall and lit a candle, igniting the [[Occupy Portland#24/7 Prayer Vigil to Lift the Camping Ban|24/7 Prayer Vigil to Lift the Camping Ban]], referring to the city's anti-"camping" ordinances that were cited during the eviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/12/in_downtown_portland_occupy_tu.html Occupy Portland turns into a City Hall prayer vigil against anti-camping ordinance].

After an approximate 2 year hiatus in activism on location, the Occupy Movement organized the [[Occupy ICE]] phase in order to protest the actions of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office regarding the detention of undocumented immigrants presenting themselves at the southern US border points to seek asylum. While small groups of protestors emerged across the country in protest of the separation of families who were detained during immigration processing, a group swarmed the ICE facility in SOHO, NYC, causing it to shutdown temporarily. In Washington state, hundreds of Occupy ICE activists took over a portion of the grounds of the Portland ICE building.

===Denmark===
On 15 October 2011, 2,000 protesters showed up on the square in front of the city hall of Copenhagen, protesting in sympathy with OWS. Immediately after the demonstration an "Occupy Copenhagen" camp was established. The camp, internally nicknamed "Plaza One Love", lived through harsh climate conditions and a couple of eviction attempts for two months, until it was torn down by the Municipality of Copenhagen and Danish police, on 21 December. The movement has shifted to a mobile camp tactic, and still holds GA every Wednesday and other activities throughout the week.&lt;ref name="politiken"/&gt;

According to French protestors, relations with the police have varied considerably. Some police joined them for coffee and friendly discussion, but otherwise were hostile and confiscated blankets and food, leaving protesters sleeping in the cold outdoors without protection. On 11 November, following a call made on social networks, some 400 additional people joined the occupation.&lt;ref name="Nouveau ressemblent des indign√©s de la D√©fense"/&gt; Occupy protests have also begun at Nantes, Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille,&lt;ref name="Huit personnes ont √©t√© plac√©es en garde √† vue apr√®s la dispersion par la police d'une"/&gt; Perpignan and more than 50 cities.&lt;ref name="Manifestation des Indign√©s.

===Mexico===
Occupy began in [[Mexico City]] on 11 October 2011, with a hunger strike in front of the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]] highrise. Edur Velasco, a 56-year-old labor economist and university professor, was on a 42-day-long hunger strike sitting in a tent outside Mexico City's stock market, demanding that the government guarantee greater access to higher education among the youth.&lt;ref name="Faces and reasons behind 'Occupy"/&gt; Days after his initiative, it came as a surprise to see the multiplication of tents setting up outside the stock exchange building. Police remained discreetly around the corner sitting in their trucks.&lt;ref name="Willing to die for change"/&gt;

Occupy Mexico did not achieve the level of popularity it gained in other areas. This is attributed to the fact that Mexico's Occupy protesters, which were focused on poverty and workers' rights, failed to resonate with a public enthralled by the violence of the [[Mexican Drug War]].&lt;ref name="Parish Flannery"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parish Flannery|first1=Nathaniel|title=Occupy Mexico?

Also known as Baluwatar Satyagraha, Occupy Baluwatar is a peaceful protest movement calling on the Nepali state to better address the widespread problem of impunity and gender-based violence. Since 28 December 2012, protesters have gathered outside the prime minister's official residence in Baluwatar from 9:00 to 11:00 am daily. The protesters created a coherent set of demands, divided into short- and long-term goals, which they presented to then prime minister Baburam Bhattarai. The short-term demands called on the state, including the police and the judiciary, to properly investigate and prosecute the guilty in five specific cases which took place immediately prior to the movement's start. The long-term demands focused on policy reform in the arenas of migration and rape laws, among others.

Occupy Nigeria is an anti-fuel subsidy removal protest that started in Nigeria on 2 January 2012 in response to fuel subsidy removal by the Federal government of Nigeria on 1 January 2012. It is a movement against corruption in Government &amp; public service, insensitive &amp; inhuman treatment of Nigerians by Government &amp; Security agents. The movement ended on 16 January 2012 following agreement between the government and the organized labour leaders which saw a partial restoration of the subsidy regime. Fuel pump price in Nigeria has since then been fixed at the official rate of 97 naira per litre while it practically sells for as high as 130 naira in some major cities including Port Harcourt, one of the cities in the oil-producing states in Nigeria.

The protest in Dublin was organized by "Pots &amp; Pans ‚Äì Ireland", and #OccupyDameStreet protest group, who then invited Real Democracy Now! Shell to Sea, Tir na Saor and many other non political groups to participate and all set up camp outside the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] in solidarity with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement in New York.

===South Africa===
{{Main|Taking Back South Africa!}}
In South Africa, a movement called ''Taking Back South Africa!'' sprung up as an initiative primarily aimed at protesting and inciting [[Protest|mass action]] against the economic and [[social inequality]] in the country. It consists of a loose informal affiliation of on-the-ground groups and individuals across South Africa as well as internet based groups. During the 2016 Fees Must Fall movement, protest groups also adopted the slogan #Occupy4FreeEducation in response to the government's perceived lack of interest in dealing with the issue.&lt;ref name="wordpress8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook9"/&gt;

===South Korea===
Hundreds of protesters held rallies in the South Korean capital of [[Seoul]] on 15 and 22 October in 2011 under the slogan of "Occupy Seoul". Protesters focused on issues such as a recent free trade agreement with the United States as well as costs of tuition and rent.&lt;ref name="hourb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seoul joins Occupy Wall Street movement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S. Korean activists hold another 'Occupy Seoul' protests"/&gt;

"Occupy Seoul" began as a part of [[15 October 2011 global protests]]. Protesters gathered in several places in Seoul, including [[Yeouido]] (financial hub of Seoul) where protesters rallied under the slogan of "Occupy Yeouido: 99% against Financial Exploitation of 1%." Three primary requirements demanded by these protesters were: (1) clarifying the responsibility of the bureaucracy, (2) financial regulations, and (3) compensations for the victims of failed financial policies of Korean government. Other protesters, led by leftist organizations such as [[People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy]], gathered in front of Seoul train station and Daehanmoon. However, they failed to enter the Seoul City Hall Plaza as they had planned, as their protest permit was rejected by the police due to an exhibition that was already taking place in the Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cho|first=Jae-hyun|title=Occupy Seoul: Anti-Wall Street protests land on Seoul|url=http://news1.kr/articles/402729|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=News1|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were considerable support from public, there were also criticisms regarding the nature of the protest. Unlike the original Occupy movement which started out as the anti-capitalist protest, many of the catchphrases of Occupy Seoul contained anti-government or anti-American messages. One of the observers has argued that "South Korea overcame the 2008 financial crisis relatively well and there was no serious crisis in financial sector. It is hard to find the legitimate basis of the protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Hoon-sang|title=Occupy Movements in 80 countries today; Seoul joins with an overnight protest|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20111015/41115765/1|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=Dong-A Ilbo|date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What started as an environmentalist protest against plans to replace Taksim Gezi Park developed into wider anti-government demonstrations. Demands issued on 4 June included

# the end of the sale of public facilities such as parks, forests and beaches to private investors, 
# the right of public expression,

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, Occupy [[Belfast]] initiated its protest outside the offices of [[Invest NI]] on 21 October 2011. Occupy Belfast took residence at Writer's Square, in the [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|Cathedral Quarter]].&lt;ref name="newsletter"/&gt; It also took control of a disused building owned by the Bank of Ireland, renaming it the People's Bank, with plans to open a library and homeless accommodation to be a community hub.&lt;ref name="brightgreenscotland"/&gt; It was expected that an Occupy [[Derry]] would take place in the near future.

Occupy [[Coleraine]] took over the [[University of Ulster]] Common Room for three weeks in December 2013.&lt;ref name=BeleTele&gt;{{cite news|last1=Black|first1=Rebecca|title=Occupy Coleraine student protesters say fight is not over|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/occupy-coleraine-student-protesters-say-fight-is-not-over-29946013.html|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Belfast Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group protested the demolition of the historic student-teacher shared space, due for refurbishment as a senior management corporate dining room.&lt;ref name=TheImpartialReporter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noble|first1=Kylie|title=My heroes of 2013: the students who took part in 'Occupy Coleraine.'|url=http://ohsointricate1994.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/my-heroes-of-2013-the-students-who-took-part-in-occupy-coleraine/|website=OhSoIntricate|publisher=The Impartial Reporter|accessdate=24 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128194904/http://ohsointricate1994.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/my-heroes-of-2013-the-students-who-took-part-in-occupy-coleraine/|archivedate=28 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupy camps were established in the financial district of [[St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh]] on 15 October 2011. St. Andrews Square is the home of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] headquarters in the [[Dundas House]] mansion. [[Edinburgh City Council]] subsequently officially backed [[Occupy Edinburgh]] and the Occupy movement worldwide. Protesters from [[Occupy Glasgow]] set up in the civic [[George Square]] on 15 October but after the council obtained a court order moved to [[Kelvingrove Park]], where the council agreed to provide running water, toilets and safety fences.

====Wales====
In Wales, Occupy [[Cardiff]] originally set its camp-site outside Cardiff Castle but it was disbanded by police, and some protesters were arrested. Charges were later dropped following calls from trade unionists, lawyers and politicians including [[Plaid Cymru]] leader [[Leanne Wood]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician [[Tony Benn]] and demonstrations outside Cardiff magistrates court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/occupy-protesters-cardiff-drops-case Occupy Cardiff protesters claim victory after CPS drops case].

[[File:Oakland General Strike 2011-11-02.jpg|thumb|One of the marches to the Port of Oakland during the [[2011 Oakland General Strike]] on 2 November 2011]]
The [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests began in [[New York City]] on 17 September 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; By 9 October, [[List of Occupy movement protest locations|similar demonstrations]] were either ongoing or had been held in 70 major cities and over 600 communities across the U.S.&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; The movement rejects existing political institutions and attempts to create alternative ones through direct action and direct democracy.&lt;ref name="graeber1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="David Graeber, the Anti-Leader of Occupy Wall Street"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupy and anarchism's gift of democracy"/&gt; Occupy protesters' slogan, "We are the 99%", asserts that the "99%" pay for the mistakes of the "1%".
The original location of choice by the protesters was 1 Chase Plaza, the site of the "Charging Bull" statue, but when police discovered the planned site, it was fenced off and nearby Zuccotti Park was chosen. There was scant media coverage till 24 September when a large march forcing the closure of several streets resulted in 80 arrests. Police used a technique called "netting", the use of orange plastic nets to corral protesters, and the march received extensive media coverage when a video of several "netted" young women being pepper sprayed was widely circulated.&lt;ref name="Occupy Oakland: demonstrators prepare for police action ‚Äì Monday 11 November 2011"/&gt;

Media coverage was again sparked on 1 October, when New York City protesters attempted to march across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge and even escorting them partway across before they began to make [[mass arrest]]s. On 25 October, police officers cleared two [[Occupy Oakland]] protest camp sites. Police fired [[tear gas]] canisters at the protestors, allegedly in response to objects being thrown at them.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Protest organizers said that many of the troublemakers were not part of the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="Some Cities Begin Cracking Down on 'Occupy' Protests."/&gt; The raid was described as "violent and chaotic at times"&lt;ref name="Occupy Oakland Gets Shut Down11"/&gt; and resulted in over 102 arrests. Scott Olsen, a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and [[Iraq War]] veteran, suffered a [[bone fracture|skull fracture]] caused by a [[projectile]] that witnesses believed was a tear gas or smoke canister fired by the police.&lt;ref name="Reuters Olsen"/&gt; On 2 November, protesters in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California, shut down the [[Port of Oakland]], the fifth busiest port in the nation. Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city.&lt;ref name="bbc-15568057" /&gt;
[[File:Day 60 Occupy Wall Street November 15 2011 Shankbone 43.JPG|thumb|Zuccotti Park closed to overnight camping on 15 November 2011]]
At about 1:00&amp;nbsp;am on 15 November, police cleared the Zuccotti Park encampment. Many journalists complained that the police had made a deliberate decision to keep journalists away from the park during the raid.&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street: police evict protesters - as it happened"/&gt; New York City journalists responded to what they perceived as "alarming suppression, abuse and arrests of reporters" by forming "The Coalition for the First Amendment" to "monitor police-press relations as a way of spotlighting police activities that threaten constitutional protections".&lt;ref name="Coalition For the First Amendment"/&gt; Executive Director [[Alison Bethel McKenzie]] of the [[International Press Institute]] commented: "It is completely unacceptable to hinder reporting on a subject that is undoubtedly of public interest. Such reporting is vital to democracy, and authorities at every level of government ‚Äì federal, state and local ‚Äì must honour their constitutional obligation not to infringe upon the freedom of the press."&lt;ref name="IPI: Journalists Arrested Across the U.S. - TrustMedia"/&gt;

On 6 December, [[Occupy Homes]], an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, embarked on a "national day of action" to protest the mistreatment of homeowners by big banks, who they say made billions of dollars off the [[housing bubble]] by offering [[predatory loan]]s and indulging in practices that allegedly took advantage of consumers. In more than two dozen cities across the nation the movement took on the housing crisis by re-occupying foreclosed homes, disrupting bank auctions and blocking evictions.&lt;ref name="Les-2011"/&gt; On 17 September 2012, protesters returned to Zuccotti Park to mark the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the occupation.&lt;ref name="NYT-2012anniv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ST-2012anniv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Politiker-2012anniv"/&gt;

==Reactions==
{{main|Reactions to the Occupy movement}}

===Political===
* Brazil‚Äî[[President of Brazil|President]] [[Dilma Rousseff]] said, "We agree with some of the expressions that some movements have used around the world [in] demonstrations like the ones we see in the US and other countries."&lt;ref name="latercera"/&gt;
* Canada‚ÄîFinance Minister [[Jim Flaherty]] expressed sympathy with the protests, stating "There's growing worry about a lack of opportunities for the younger generation ‚Äì particularly in the United States ‚Äì and it's up to governments to ensure youth are able to capitalize on their education and find good jobs." He later commented, "I can understand some legitimate frustration arising out of that."&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street Protests hit Canada"/&gt;
* India‚Äî[[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] described the protests as "a warning for all those who are in charge of the processes of governance".&lt;ref name="Occupy Wall Street protests a warning: PM"/&gt;
* Iran‚ÄîSupreme Leader [[Ayatollah Khamenei]] voiced his support for the Occupy Movement saying, "Ultimately, it will grow so that it will bring down the capitalist system and the West."&lt;ref name="lach"/&gt;
* United Kingdom‚ÄîOn 21 October 2011, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] said the protests were about fairness. "There are voices in the middle who say, 'Look, we can build a better financial system that is more sustainable, that is based on a better and proportionate sense of what's just and fair and where people don't take reckless risks or, if they do, they're penalized for doing so.'"&lt;ref name="Ex-British Chief Gorden Brown States Protests Seek Fairness"/&gt; On 6 November 2011, Opposition leader [[Ed Miliband]]: "The challenge is that they reflect a crisis of concern for millions of people about the biggest issue of our time: the gap between their values and the way our country is run." He mentioned that he is "determined that mainstream politics, and the Labour Party in particular, speaks to that crisis and rises to the challenge".&lt;ref name="Ed Miliband warns of St Paul's protest 'danger signals'"/&gt; On Saturday 26 November 2011, Edinburgh City Council set a worldwide precedent by voting in favour of the motion to support the aims and sentiments of Occupy Edinburgh and the Occupy movement as a whole. This motion was presented by the [[Scottish Green Party]], was seconded by the [[Scottish Labour Party]] and was slightly amended by the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]]. The only party not to back the motion was the [[Scottish Conservative Party]]. "We regard this as a fantastic step forward in the opening of dialogue with the Scottish government.", stated Occupy Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Occupy Edinburgh ecstatic with official recognition"/&gt;
* United States‚Äî[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] spoke in support of the movement, but also asked protesters not to "demonize" finance workers.&lt;ref name="Obamasupports"/&gt; Local authorities in the United States have collaborated to develop strategies to respond to the Occupy movement and its encampments, and political leaders in eighteen United States cities consulted on cracking down on the Occupy movement, according to Oakland Mayor [[Jean Quan]], who participated in a conference call.&lt;ref name="alternet"/&gt; Within a span of less than 24 hours, municipal authorities in [[Denver]], [[Occupy Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City]], [[Occupy Portland|Portland]], [[Occupy Oakland|Oakland]], and [[Occupy Wall Street|New York City]] sent in police to crack down on the encampments of the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="thetakeaway"/&gt; In a markedly different approach, the city administration and police in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], have worked with Occupy New Haven&lt;ref name="occupynewhaven1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.occupynewhaven.org/ |work=occupynewhaven.org |date=13 November 2012 |title=What Is The Occupy Movement All About? |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the safety of protesters occupying the upper section of the New Haven Green.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newhavenindependent"/&gt; Until 18 April 2012, Occupy New Haven,&lt;ref name="occupynewhaven1"/&gt; has been running continuously on the Green for 186 days until they were removed by police.&lt;ref name="Occupy New Haven official website"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20120418/occupy-new-haven-encampment-cleared-out-13-protesters-arrested-videos-photos Occupy New Haven encampment cleared out; 13 protesters arrested (videos, photos)]. 18 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Venezuela‚Äî[[President of Venezuela|President]] [[Hugo Ch√°vez]] condemned the "horrible repression" of the activists and expressed solidarity with the movement.&lt;ref name="Hugo Chavez condemns 'horrible repression' of Wall Street protests"/&gt;

===Media===
''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' has had various articles covering the movement.&lt;ref name="The Fight for 'Real Democracy' at the Heart of Occupy Wall Street"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Why Occupy Wall Street is Not the Tea Party of the Left"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How Occupy Wall Street Works"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Future of History"/&gt; In the January/February 2012 issue, [[Francis Fukuyama]] argued that the Occupy movement was not as influential as the right-wing Tea Party movement. "One of the most puzzling features of the world in the aftermath of the financial crisis," he wrote, "is that so far, populism has taken primarily a right-wing form, not a left-wing one."&lt;ref name="Francis Fukuyama on the decline of the middle class - PNHP's Official Blog"/&gt; In contrast, a survey for the think tank [[Center for American Progress]] suggested that the Occupy movement has succeeded in substantially boosting the coverage of the job crisis in the American media.&lt;ref name="ObamaReflects"/&gt;

===Other===
Egyptian protesters from [[Tahrir Square]] have lent their support of the movement. A message of solidarity issued by a collective of Cairo-based protesters declared: "As the interests of government increasingly cater to the interests and comforts of private, transnational capital, our cities and homes have become progressively more abstract and violent places, subject to the casual ravages of the next economic development or urban renewal scheme. An entire generation across the globe has grown up realizing, rationally and emotionally, that we have no future in the current order of things."&lt;ref name="To the Occupy movement ‚Äì the occupiers of Tahrir Square are with you"/&gt;
In early December 2011, business magnate [[Richard Branson]] said the movement is a "good start", that they have been protesting for valid reasons, and that if the business community takes some of their concerns on board they will have made a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/11/22/one-percenter-richard-branson-supports-occupy-protests/|title='One Percenter' Richard Branson Supports 'Occupy' Protests|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2011, [[Jesse Jackson]] said that [[Jesus Christ]], [[Gandhi]], and [[Martin Luther King]] were all occupiers, and that: "Occupy is a global spirit, which is now sweeping the nation and the world, fighting for justice for all of God's children".&lt;ref name = "JesseJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesse Jackson speaks at Occupy London: 'Occupy is a spirit whose time has come' - video"/&gt; A global survey of 23 countries published by [[Ipsos]] on 20 January 2012 found that around 40% of the world's citizens are familiar with the movement. Over twice as many reported a favourable response to the movement compared to those who dislike it. Support for the movement varied markedly among countries, with South Korea (67%), Indonesia (65%), and India (64%) reporting the highest sympathy ‚Äì while Australia (41%), Japan (41%), and Poland (37%) reporting the lowest.&lt;ref name="Jan2012Global"/&gt;

==Impact==
Some known impacts to date include the following:

===Social impact===
In the United States, the protests have helped shift the focus of national dialogue from the federal budget deficit to economic problems many ordinary Americans face, such as unemployment,&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt; the large amount of student and other [[consumer debt|personal debt]] that burdens middle class and working class Americans,&lt;ref name="tikkun"/&gt; and other major issues of social inequality, such as homelessness.&lt;ref name="alternet13"/&gt; The movement appears to have generated a national conversation about income inequality, as evidenced by the fact that print and broadcast news mentioned the term "income inequality" more than five times more often during the last week of October 2011 than during the week before the occupation began.&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt; Longer term effects are much less clear, as according to Google search trends, in the years since 2012 interest has waned. Occupy movement raised awareness regarding what organizers consider undeserved wealth and lack of fairness in American society.&lt;ref name="nytimes-99-percenters-and-53-percenters-face-off"/&gt; Labor unions have become bolder in the tactics they employ and have been using digital social media more effectively thanks to the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; In New York City, the Occupy Wall Street protest has also provided hundreds of protesters to help in picket actions conducted by labor unions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Offshoots of the Occupy movement, such as [[Rolling Jubilee]], a project of Strike Debt, have bought millions in "zombie debt," money that individuals owe that they have no financial means to pay, including medical debt, to free the debtors from the obligation to pay it off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20130509/BETTERLIFE05/305090068/-Zombie-debt-part-1-1-million-Louisville-medical-bills-bought-by-Wall-Street-protesters 'Zombie Debt' Part of $1.1 Million in Louisville Medical Bills Bought by Wall Street Protesters: Louisvillian's Medical Bill Among Those Wiped out by Nonprofit Group] The Courier-Journal 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2014, Rolling Jubilee claims to have cancelled more than $15 million in medical debt and $4 million in private student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Pleasant, Christa Hillstrom and James Trimarco (17 September 2014).

On 10 November 2011, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that the word "occupy" had been the "most commonly used English word on the internet and in print" over the past 12 months according to a top ten list published by media analysis company [[Global Language Monitor]].&lt;ref name="wardrop1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Top Words of 2011"/&gt; In January 2012, members of the [[American Dialect Society]] voted with an overwhelming majority for "Occupy" as the word of the year for 2011.&lt;ref name="Linguists name 'occupy' as 2011's word of the year"/&gt; Numerous news shows and radio shows have been using the term "1%" and "99%" TV shows such as ''The Middle'', ''Revenge'' and, ''The Office'' have made references to Occupy, and, in July 2012, the City of Vancouver added the word to its list of reserve names for civic assets such as streets and buildings.&lt;ref name="vancouver"/&gt; In December 2012, the Television show Conan launched a contest called "Occupy Conan."

===Political impact===
On 27 December 2011, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' argued that the movement had had a global impact, altering "the terms of the political debate."&lt;ref name="Capitalism is dead; long live capitalism"/&gt; However, some sympathetic commentators such as Anthony Barnett have suggested that in Spain, where the movement once had the support of well over 70% of the population with millions taking part, the popularity of ''Occupy'' is now past its peak and has achieved no consequences of any significance.&lt;ref name = "Long"/&gt; However, there were numerous successes at local levels,&lt;ref name="Thank You, Anarchists"/&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' has reported that Spanish protesters caused their government to pass various laws including new limits on the amounts banks can "claw" back from defaulting borrowers.&lt;ref name="earnest"/&gt;
In November 2011, U.S. Congressman [[Ted Deutch]], member of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], introduced the "Outlawing Corporate Cash Undermining the Public Interest in our Elections and Democracy (OCCUPIED) Constitutional Amendment," which would overturn the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' recognizing corporate constitutionally protected free speech rights and would ban corporate money from the electoral process.&lt;ref name="house"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thinkprogress"/&gt;

In March 2012, former U.S. [[Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] called on activists to "occupy democracy", explaining that "Our democracy has been hacked. It no longer works to serve the best interests of the people of this country."&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; Also in November 2011, [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] said that the Occupy movement had started to dynamically shape the global policy response to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis]], being mentioned so often at [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|the 2011 G20 summit]] that if Occupy had been a brand "it would have a profile to die for among the super-elite".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Various journalists along with [[Jared Bernstein]] former chief economist and economic adviser to [[Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], have suggested that Occupy influenced the President's January 2012 [[State of the Union address]], with the movement creating the political space for Obama to shift to the economic left and speak about the desirability of the rich paying a greater share of the tax burden. Inequality has remained a central theme of President Obama's reelection campaign, yet he no longer mentions the Occupy movement by name, which analysts say reflects the fact that by early 2012 Occupy had become a divisive issue, unpopular with some of the public.&lt;ref name="ObamaReflects"/&gt;&lt;ref name="State of the union: President Obama addresses inequality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="democracynow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="No more inaction on income inequality"/&gt;

Three years later, income inequality had become a major part of the political discourse and ''[[The Atlantic]]'' Magazine declared "The Triumph of Occupy Wall Street"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/the-triumph-of-occupy-wall-street/395408/ |title=The Triumph of Occupy Wall Street| publisher=The Atlantic | first=Michael | last=Levitin | date=10 June 2015 | accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National monitoring and crackdown==
Government documents released in December 2012 pursuant to [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests by the [[Partnership for Civil Justice Fund]] reveal FBI monitoring of what became known as the Occupy movement since at least August 2011, a month before the protests began.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy |title=Revealed: how the FBI coordinated the crackdown on Occupy|last=Wolf|first=Naomi |date=29 December 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, 22 December 2012, "[http://www.justiceonline.org/commentary/fbi-files-ows.html FBI Documents Reveal Secret Nationwide Occupy Monitoring]"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI]], the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], local police, regional law enforcement "counterterrorism" [[fusion center]]s, and private security forces of major banks formed the [[Domestic Security Alliance Council]] (DSAC) to collect and share information about, and to share plans to target and to arrest Occupy protesters. Banks met with the FBI to pool information about participants of the Occupy movement collected by corporate security, and the FBI offered to bank officials its plans to prevent Occupy events that were scheduled for a month later.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=grant&gt;Grant, Drew (24 December 2012). "Just Because You Are Paranoid Doesn't Mean the FBI Wasn't Monitoring You: Occupy Wall Street Edition". ''The New York Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI officials met with New York Stock Exchange representatives on 19 August 2011, notifying them of planned peaceful protests.&lt;ref name=browdie&gt;Browdie, Brian (26 December 2012). "FBI Relayed Information About Occupy Movement to Financial Institutions". [[American Banker]]&lt;/ref&gt; FBI officials later met with representatives of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]] and [[Zions Bank]] about planned protests.&lt;ref name=browdie /&gt; The FBI used informants to infiltrate and monitor protests; information from informants and military intelligence units was passed to DSAC, which then gave updates to financial companies.&lt;ref name=Grey&gt;Grey, Barry (27 December 2012).

[[International Business Times]]. 30 December 2012. Retrieved 31 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
Following actions by police and municipal officials to use force in closing various Occupy tent camps in public spaces, lawsuits have been filed, while others are being planned.&lt;ref name="niedowski"/&gt; Civil liberties organizations filed separate law suits against the FBI for refusing to turn over documents requested pursuant to the [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) regarding the FBI's role in surveillance of the Occupy movement and the FBI's sharing of intelligence about Occupy events with private corporate security officials.&lt;ref name="ACLU 2012-09-14"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|date=14 September 2012|title=FOIA Documents Show FBI Was Watching Occupy Protestors, Some Docs Still Secret on National Security Grounds|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech-national-security/foia-documents-show-fbi-was-watching-occupy-protestors-some-docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI withheld documents requested under the FOIA citing the reason that the withholding was "in the interest of national defense or foreign policy."&lt;ref name="ACLU 2012-09-14"/&gt;

In 2013, MIT doctoral student [[Ryan Shapiro]], collecting research on the role of the FBI in the Occupy movement, sent the FBI three FOIA requests regarding "a potential plan to gather intelligence against the leaders of [Occupy Wall Street-related protests in [[Houston]]] and obtain photographs, then formulate a plan to kill the leadership [of the protests] via suppressed [[sniper]] rifles."  When the FBI refused the request, Shapiro filed a federal complaint in Washington, D.C., and subsequently obtained 17 pages (most of the requested documentation was ruled withheld due to the possibility to "disclose the identity of a confidential source.") The redacted FBI document confirmed the Houston plot and contradicted an earlier claim by the FBI that it had never opened an investigation on the Occupy movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Courthouse News Service]]|date=6 February 2015|title=FBI Gets OK on Alleged Murder Plot Info Cache|url=https://www.courthousenews.com/fbi-gets-ok-on-alleged-murder-plot-info-cache/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/18/fbi-ordered-to-justify-shielding-of-records-sought-about-alleged-occupy-sniper-plot/ | title=FBI Ordered to Justify Shielding of Records Sought About Alleged 'Occupy' Sniper Plot | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| date=18 March 2014 | accessdate=23 March 2014 | author=Gershman, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End==
By 2015, there were no more Occupy events chasing the same original goals. Instead, there were multiple reported protests that had similar methods to the Occupy movement, with different goals.

"Occupy" has since become a style of protest, as [[Occupy Silicon Valley]] is aimed at tech wealth as well as general inequality caused by technology and its advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/22/notable-wall-street-strategist-tech-rally-may-lead-to-calls-to-redistribute-silicon-valleys-wealth.html|title=Occupy Silicon Valley: The next populist movement may be aimed at tech wealth, report says|first=Evelyn|last=Cheng|date=22 May 2017|work=cnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Apart from the dismissals made by political conservatives, there have also been appreciative criticisms from more [[left-wing]] scholars. One such critique concerns itself with the way in which the Occupy movement has focused its demands around a narrowly modern understanding of freedom that differs little from the claims of mainstream liberal pluralism:

{{quote| The modern ideology of freedom ... provides its point of departure. This singular dominance of the modern becomes clear in the long list of demands that follow. Practicality dominates and there is not a single demand for relief from the ontological dominance of modern practices and subjectivities that abstract, codify, rationalize and objectify our lives. Though the ideals and demands ... are laudable, they are not that much different in form from the Millennium Goals of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2013 | last1= Steger | first1= Manfred B. | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= 'Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies' | url= https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies | journal= Perspectives on Global Development and Technology | volume=12 | issue=1‚Äì2 | pages=37‚Äì38. | doi=10.1163/15691497-12341240}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

International activists involved in the Occupy Movement have seen it stall due a lack of synergy to work with other alternative movements calling for change. The biggest criticism is that the movement is without depth, without a lasting vision of an alternative future.

In her critique of the Occupy movement, American political philosopher [[Jodi Dean]] argues that the focus on autonomy, leaderlessness and horizontality paved the way for conflicts and disillusionment within the movement:

{{quote|Emphasis on autonomy encouraged people to pursue multiple, separate and even conflicting goals rather than work toward common ones. Celebration of horizontality heightened skepticism toward organizing structures  like the General Assembly  and the Spokes Council, ultimately leading to the dissolution of both. assertions of leaderlessness as a principle incited a kind of paranoia around leaders who emerged but could not be acknowledged or held accountable as leaders. So rather than solving the problem of left political organization  by focusing on process and immediate questions of action, as anarchism suggests, Occupy Wall Street in fact poses it anew. It pushes us to think again about the role of a communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dean|first=Jodi|date=2012 |title=The Communist Horizon|url=|location= |publisher=Verso|page=210 |isbn=978-1844679546|author-link=Jodi Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Remarks from Occupy Wall Street participant [[Justine Tunney]], a [[Google]] software engineer, who called on President Obama to appoint [[Eric Schmidt]] "CEO of America", have also sparked criticism, including from the vast majority of other Occupy participants, many of whom have observed that her politics are inconsistent with horizontalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/20/occupy-founder-obama-eric-schmidt-ceo-america|title=Occupy founder calls on Obama to appoint Eric Schmidt 'CEO of America'|author=Alex Hern|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2014/03/20/eric-schmidt-ceo-of-america-wtf/|title=Eric Schmidt, CEO of America?

Many [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests have included [[anti-zionist]] and [[anti-semitism|anti semitic]] slogans and signage such as "Jews control Wall Street" or "Zionist Jews who are running the big banks and the Federal Reserve". As a result, the Occupy Wall Street Movement has been consistently confronted with accusations of anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Jennifer Rubin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/occupy-wall-street-does-anyone-care-about-the-anti-semitism/2011/03/29/gIQA43p8rL_blog.html|title=Occupy Wall Street: Does anyone care about the anti-Semitism?|work=The Washington Post|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph Berger"&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Berger|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/nyregion/occupy-wall-street-criticized-for-flashes-of-anti-semitism.html?_r=0|title=Cries of Anti-Semitism, but Not at Zuccotti Park|work=The New York Times|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/10/19/rnc-says-dems-silent-as-anti-semitic-tone-emerges-at-occupy-wall-street.html|title=Republicans Accuse Dem Leaders of Silence in Face of 'Anti-Semitic' Tone Occupying Protest Movement|work=Fox News|date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/12/wall-street-protester-proclaims-the-jews-control-wall-st-in-zuccotti-park-rant/|title=OWS Protester Proclaims 'The Jews Control Wall St.' In Zuccotti Park Rant|work=CBS News|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abe Greenwald |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/anti-semitism/occupy-wall-street-has-an-anti-semitism-problem/ |title=Occupy Wall Street Has an Anti-Semitism Problem |work=Commentary Magazine|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Abraham Foxman, national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] stated that "it's not surprising that in a movement that deals with economic issues you're going to get bigots that believe in this stereotype...[however] they are not expressing or representing a larger view."&lt;ref name="Joseph Berger"/&gt;

The '''Pavilion Theatre and Ballroom''', located in the Westover Road in [[Bournemouth]], is a venue for year-round entertainment. Built in the 1920s, it retains its splendour and elegant styling and is Bournemouth's regular home for West End stage shows, Opera, Ballet, Pantomime and Comedy as well as for corporate presentations and dinner dances, product launches and small conferences.

Owned by [[Bournemouth (borough)|Bournemouth Borough Council]] and managed by BH Live, the Pavilion operates alongside its sister venue, The [[Bournemouth International Centre]].

Advocated as early as 1859, proposals for a Pavilion building incorporating a concert room, reading rooms and cafes were first authorised by the municipal authorities in 1892.  The architectural competition was won by a young and unknown firm of architects called Home and Knight.  On 19 March 1929, the building was opened by [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|HRH The Duke of Gloucester]].  It had cost ¬£250,000.

Initially the Pavilion's main auditorium was not called a theatre, but a Concert Hall, and within a few years it became apparent that it had shortcomings in presenting staged productions.  As a result, in 1933 the stage was enlarged, both in depth and height, and it was reopened as a theatre in July 1934.  Numerous further alterations have been undertaken since, including the addition of two storeys to either side of the main entrance in the early 1950s, and the replacement of the large fountain in the forecourt by a smaller one in 1968.  In 1998 the building was listed [[Listed building|Grade II]] and its future has therefore been protected.

'''Plato''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|p|l|e…™|t|o ä}};{{Ref label|A|a|none}}{{sfn|Jones|2006}} {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Œ†ŒªŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ|Œ†ŒªŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ]]}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} ''Pl√°t≈çn'', {{IPA-el|pl√°.t…îÀên|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]; 428/427 or 424/423{{Ref label|B|b|none}} ‚Äì 348/347 BC) was a [[philosopher]] in [[Classical Greece]] and the founder of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in the [[Western world]]. He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the development of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived‚Äîa rigorous and systematic examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method‚Äîcan be called his invention" ({{cite web |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Plato |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/ |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |publisher=Stanford University |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=3 April 2014 |ref=harv}})&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike nearly all of his [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophical contemporaries]], Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John M.; Hutchinson, D. S., eds. (1997): "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his teacher, [[Socrates]], and his most famous student, [[Aristotle]], Plato laid the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Britannica|464109}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred North Whitehead]] once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato."{{sfn|Whitehead|1978|p=39}} In addition to being a foundational figure for Western science, philosophy, and mathematics, Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of [[Western religion]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault]], [http://rebels-library.org/files/foucault_hermeneutics.pdf ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato was the innovator of the written [[dialogue]] and [[dialectic]] forms in philosophy. Plato appears to have been the founder of Western [[political philosophy]], with his [[Plato's Republic|''Republic'']], and [[Plato's Laws|''Laws'']] among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from a philosophical perspective. Plato's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been [[Socrates]], [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Pythagoras]], although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Though influenced primarily by Socrates, to the extent that Socrates is usually the main character in many of Plato's writings, he was also influenced by Heraclitus, Parmenides, and the Pythagoreans" (http://www.iep.utm.edu/plato/).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Plato as "...one of the most dazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most penetrating, wide-ranging, and influential authors in the [[history of philosophy]]. ... He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word ‚Äúphilosopher‚Äù should be applied. But he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived‚Äîa rigorous and systematic examination of [[ethical]], [[political]], [[metaphysical]], and [[epistemological]] issues, armed with a distinctive method‚Äîcan be called his invention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who studied with him), [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] would be generally agreed to be of the same rank."&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Plato |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/ |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |publisher=Stanford University |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=3 April 2014 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life of Plato}}
Due to a lack of surviving accounts, little is known about Plato's early life and education. The philosopher came from one of the wealthiest and most politically active families in&amp;nbsp;Athens. Ancient sources describe him as a bright though modest boy who excelled in his studies. His father contributed all which was necessary to give to his son a good education, and, therefore, Plato must have been instructed in grammar, music, gymnastics and philosophy by some of the most distinguished teachers of his era.

====Birth and family====
The exact time and place of Plato's birth are unknown, but it is certain that he belonged to an aristocratic and influential family. Based on ancient sources, most modern scholars believe that he was born in Athens or [[Aegina]]{{Ref label|C|c|none}} between 429 and 423 BC. His father was [[Ariston (Athenian)|Ariston]]. According to a disputed tradition, reported by [[Diogenes Laertius]], Ariston traced his descent from the [[king of Athens]], [[Codrus]], and the king of [[Messenia]], [[Melanthus]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', III&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Nails|2002|p=53}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's mother was [[Perictione]], whose family boasted of a relationship with the famous Athenian [[legislator|lawmaker]] and [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] [[Solon]].&lt;ref name="LaI"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', I&lt;/ref&gt; Perictione was sister of [[Charmides]] and niece of [[Critias]], both prominent figures of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], the brief [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[regime]], which followed on the collapse of Athens at the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (404‚Äì403 BC).&lt;ref name="TW1"&gt;{{harvnb|Guthrie|1986|p=10}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Taylor|2001|p=xiv}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|2005|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Plato himself, Ariston and Perictione had three other children; these were two sons, [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]] and [[Glaucon]], and a daughter [[Potone]], the mother of [[Speusippus]] (the nephew and successor of Plato as head of his philosophical Academy).&lt;ref name="TW1" /&gt; The brothers Adeimantus and Glaucon are mentioned in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' as sons of Ariston,&lt;ref name="PlRep368a"&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Republic|368a}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|2005|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably brothers of Plato, but some have argued they were uncles.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[James Adam (classicist)|James Adam]], some have held that "Glaucon and Adeimantus were uncles of Plato, but [[Eduard Zeller|Zeller]] decides for the usual view that they were brothers" ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D2%3Apage%3D368 source]).&lt;/ref&gt; But in a scenario in the ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'', [[Xenophon]] confused the issue by presenting a Glaucon much younger than Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'', 3.6.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0208&amp;layout=&amp;loc=3.6.1 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional date of Plato's birth (428/427), the year after the death of prominent Athenian statesman [[Pericles]], is based on a dubious interpretation of Diogenes Laertius, who says, "When [Socrates] was gone, [Plato] joined [[Cratylus|Cratylus the Heracleitean]] and Hermogenes, who philosophized in the manner of [[Parmenides]]. Then, at twenty-eight, Hermodorus says, [Plato] went to [[Euclid of Megara|Euclides in Megara]]." As [[Debra Nails]] argues, "The text itself gives no reason to infer that Plato left immediately for Megara and implies the very opposite."{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=247}} In his ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'', Plato notes that his coming of age coincided with the taking of power by the Thirty, remarking, "But a youth under the age of twenty made himself a laughingstock if he attempted to enter the political arena." Thus, Nails dates Plato's birth to 424/423.{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=246}}

According to some accounts, Ariston tried to force his attentions on Perictione, but failed in his purpose; then the [[Twelve Olympians|god]] [[Apollo]] appeared to him in a vision, and as a result, Ariston left Perictione unmolested.&lt;ref name="Ap1"&gt;Apuleius, ''De Dogmate Platonis'', 1&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', I&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Suda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend related that, when Plato was an infant, bees settled on his lips while he was sleeping: an augury of the sweetness of style in which he would discourse about philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Divinatione]]'', I, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Ariston appears to have died in Plato's childhood, although the precise dating of his death is difficult.&lt;ref name="TN"&gt;{{harvnb|Nails|2002|p=53}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Taylor|2001|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perictione then married [[Pyrilampes]], her mother's brother,&lt;ref name="NA229"&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Charmides|158a}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Nails|2003|pp=228‚Äì229}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had served many times as an ambassador to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian court]] and was a friend of [[Pericles]], the leader of the democratic faction in Athens.&lt;ref name="P13"&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Charmides|158a}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [[s:Lives/Pericles#13|IV]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrilampes had a son from a previous marriage, Demus, who was famous for his beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Gorgias|481d}} and {{Citeplato|Gorgias|513b}}&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ Aristophanes, ''Wasps'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0044;query=card%3D%233;layout=;loc=54 97]&lt;/ref&gt; Perictione gave birth to Pyrilampes' second son, Antiphon, the half-brother of Plato, who appears in ''[[Parmenides (Plato)|Parmenides]]''.&lt;ref name="P126c"&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Parmenides|126c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to reticence about himself, Plato often introduced his distinguished relatives into his dialogues, or referred to them with some precision: Charmides has a dialogue named after him; Critias speaks in both ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'' and ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]''; and Adeimantus and Glaucon take prominent parts in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.{{sfn|Guthrie|1986|p=11}} These and other references suggest a considerable amount of family pride and enable us to reconstruct Plato's [[family tree]]. According to Burnet, "the opening scene of the ''Charmides'' is a glorification of the whole [family] connection ... Plato's dialogues are not only a memorial to Socrates, but also the happier days of his own family."{{sfn|Kahn|2004|p=186}}

====Name====
According to [[Diogenes La√´rtius]], the philosopher was named ''Aristocles'' ({{lang|grc|·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøŒ∫Œª·øÜœÇ}}) after his grandfather.{{sfn|La√´rtius|1925|loc=¬ß 4}} It was common in Athenian society for boys to be named after grandfathers (or fathers). But there is only one inscriptional record of an Aristocles, an early Archon of Athens in 605/4 BC. There is no record of a line from Aristocles to Plato's father, Ariston. However, if Plato was not named after an ancestor named Plato (there is no record of one), then the origin of his renaming as ''Plato'' becomes a conundrum.&lt;ref name="Sedley 21-2"&gt;[[David Sedley]], ''Plato's Cratylus'', Cambridge University Press 2003, [https://assets.cambridge.org/052158/4922/sample/0521584922ws.pdf pp. 21‚Äì22].&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of Diogenes account for this fact by claiming that his [[wrestling]] coach, Ariston of Argos, dubbed him ''Platon'', meaning "broad," on account of his robust figure&lt;ref name="LaIV"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', IV&lt;/ref&gt; or that Plato derived his name from the breadth ({{lang|grc|œÄŒªŒ±œÑœçœÑŒ∑œÇ}}, ''platytƒìs'') of his eloquence, or else because he was very wide ({{lang|grc|œÄŒªŒ±œÑœçœÇ}}, ''plat√Ωs'') across the forehead.&lt;ref name="LaN"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', IV&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Notopoulos|1939|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a scholar has argued that even the name Aristocles for Plato was a much later invention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although ''Platon'' was a fairly common name (31 instances are known from Athens alone{{sfn|Guthrie|1986|loc=p. 12 (footnote)}}), the name does not occur in Plato's known family line. Another scholar, however, claims that "there is good reason for not dismissing [the idea that Aristocles was Plato's given name] as a mere invention of his biographers", noting how prevalent that account is in our sources.&lt;ref name="Sedley 21-2"/&gt; The fact that the philosopher in his maturity called himself ''Platon'' is indisputable, but the origin of this naming must remain moot unless the record is made to yield more information.

====Education====
[[File:Dionysus-or-Plato-Herculaneum-papyri-Villa-of-the-Papyri-Barker.jpg|thumb|Bust excavated at the [[Villa of the Papyri]], possibly of [[Dionysus]], Plato or [[Poseidon]].]]

[[Apuleius]] informs us that [[Speusippus]] praised Plato's quickness of mind and modesty as a boy, and the "first fruits of his youth infused with hard work and love of study".&lt;ref name="Ap2"&gt;Apuleius, ''De Dogmate Platonis'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Plato must have been instructed in grammar, music, and [[gymnastics]] by the most distinguished teachers of his time.&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', IV&lt;br&gt;‚Ä¢ {{harvnb|Smith|1870|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dicaearchus]] went so far as to say that Plato wrestled at the [[Isthmian games]].&lt;ref name="LaV"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', V&lt;/ref&gt; Plato had also attended courses of philosophy; before meeting Socrates, he first became acquainted with [[Cratylus]] (a disciple of [[Heraclitus]], a prominent [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher) and the Heraclitean doctrines.&lt;ref name="Ar987a"&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052&amp;query=section%3D%2315&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.987b 987a]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ambrose]] believed that Plato met [[Jeremiah]] in Egypt and was influenced by his ideas. [[Augustine]] initially accepted this claim, but later rejected it, arguing in "[[The City of God]]", that "Plato was born a hundred years after Jeremiah prophesied." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Craig|editor1-first=Edward|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415073103|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hebrew]]-language chronology works {{by whom|date=July 2017}} argue that, based on [[seder hadoroth]] chronology, Jeremiah's final year of prophecy was 411 BCE (3350 [[Hebrew Calendar|HC]]), at which time Plato was a teenager&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah‚Äôs ministry was active from the thirteenth year of [[Josiah]], king of Judah (3298 [[Hebrew Calendar|HC]], 463 BCE, until after the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of [[Solomon‚Äôs Temple]] in 403 BCE (3358 [[Hebrew Calendar|HC]].{{original research inline|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he initially perceived Jeremiah to be absurd.&lt;ref&gt;''Torath Ha'ola'' (http://hebrewbooks.org/11920, [[remah|Rabbi Meir Isserles]], p.

Plato may have traveled in [[Italy]], [[Sicily]], [[Egypt]] and [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].{{sfn|McEvoy|1984}} Said to have returned to Athens at the age of forty, Plato founded one of the earliest known organized schools in Western Civilization on a plot of land in the Grove of Hecademus or Academus.{{sfn|Cairns|1961|p=xiii}} The [[Academy]] was a large enclosure of ground about six [[Stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] outside of Athens proper. One story is that the name of the Academy comes from the ancient hero, [[Academus]]; still another story is that the name came from a supposed former owner of the plot of land, an Athenian citizen whose name was (also) Academus; while yet another account is that it was named after a member of the army of [[Castor and Pollux]], an [[Regions of ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]] named Echedemus.{{sfn|Robinson|1827|p=16}} The Academy operated until it was destroyed by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 84 BC. Many intellectuals were schooled in the Academy, the most prominent one being Aristotle.{{sfn|Dillon|2003|pp=1‚Äì3}}{{sfn|Press|2000|p=1}}

Throughout his later life, Plato became entangled with the politics of the city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. According to Diogenes Laertius, Plato initially visited Syracuse while it was under the rule of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]].{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=73}} During this first trip Dionysius's brother-in-law, [[Dion of Syracuse]], became one of Plato's disciples, but the tyrant himself turned against Plato. Plato almost faced death, but he was sold into slavery. Then Anniceris&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[Anniceris]] the Cyrenaic philosopher.&lt;/ref&gt; bought Plato's freedom for twenty [[Mina (unit)|minas]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D1 Book iii, 20]&lt;/ref&gt; and sent him home. After Dionysius's death, according to [[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Plato's ''Seventh Letter'']], Dion requested Plato return to Syracuse to tutor [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius II]] and guide him to become a philosopher king. Dionysius II seemed to accept Plato's teachings, but he became suspicious of Dion, his uncle. Dionysius expelled Dion and kept Plato against his will. Eventually Plato left Syracuse. Dion would return to overthrow Dionysius and ruled Syracuse for a short time before being usurped by [[Calippus of Syracuse|Calippus]], a fellow disciple of Plato.

A variety of sources have given accounts of Plato's death. One story, based on a mutilated manuscript,{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=194}} suggests Plato died in his bed, whilst a young [[Thracian]] girl played the flute to him.{{sfn|Schall|1996}} Another tradition suggests Plato died at a wedding feast. The account is based on Diogenes Laertius's reference to an account by Hermippus, a third-century Alexandrian.{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=195}} According to [[Tertullian]], Plato simply died in his sleep.{{sfn|Riginos|1976|p=195}}

==Intellectual influences on Plato==
===Pythagoras===
[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Pythagoras based on traditional iconography at the Museum Capitolini, Rome.]]
{{See also|Pythagoreanism}}
Although Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of [[Pythagoras]] upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to [[R. M. Hare]], this influence consists of three points: (1) The [[Republic (Plato)|platonic Republic]] might be related to the idea of "a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as "for substantial theses in [[science]] and [[morals]]". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a "mystical approach to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and its place in the material world". It is probable that both were influenced by [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;R.M. Hare, Plato in C.C.W. Taylor, R.M. Hare and Jonathan Barnes, Greek Philosophers, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999 (1982), 103‚Äì189, here 117‚Äì9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=History of Western Philosophy |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |publisher=Routledge |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-415-07854-2 |location= |pages=120‚Äì124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. These ideas were very influential on [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]] and Plato.&lt;ref name=McFarlane&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarlane|first1=Thomas J.|title=Plato's Parmenides|url=http://www.integralscience.org/platoparmenides.html|website=Integralscience|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans,&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cicero]] repeats this claim: "They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean" (''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'').&lt;ref&gt;Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Karamanolis notes that&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy‚Äîincluding Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/numenius|title=Numenius|author=George Karamanolis|year=2013|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{See also|Metaphysics}}
These two philosophers, following the way initiated by pre-Socratic Greek philosophers like Pythagoras, depart from [[mythology]] and begin the metaphysical tradition that strongly influenced Plato and continues today.&lt;ref name="McFarlane" /&gt;

The surviving fragments written by [[Heraclitus]] suggest the view that all things are continuously changing, or becoming. His image of the river, with ever-changing waters, is well known.  According to some ancient traditions like that of Diogenes La√´rtius, Plato received these ideas through Heraclitus' disciple [[Cratylus]], who held the more radical view that continuous change warrants [[skepticism]] because we cannot define a thing that does not have a permanent nature.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Large|first1=William|title=Heraclitus|url=http://www.arasite.org/WLnew/Greeks/heraclitus.html|website=Arasite|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parmenides]] adopted an altogether contrary vision, arguing for the idea of changeless [[Being]] and the view that change is an illusion.&lt;ref name="McFarlane" /&gt; John Palmer notes "Parmenides‚Äô distinction among the principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that must belong to what must be, simply as such, qualify him to be seen as the founder of metaphysics or [[ontology]] as a domain of inquiry distinct from [[theology]]."&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides|title=Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=John Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas about change and permanence, or becoming and Being, influenced Plato in formulating his ''theory of forms''. According to this theory, there is a world of perfect, eternal, and changeless ''forms'', the realm of Being, and an imperfect sensible world of becoming that partakes of the qualities of the forms, and is its instantiation in the sensible world.&lt;ref name="Large" /&gt;

===Socrates===
{{Main|Socratic problem}}
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Socrates]] at the [[Louvre]].]]
The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his [[Apology (Plato)|''Apology of Socrates'']] that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d‚Äì34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 [[Mina (unit)|minas]] on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by [[Meletus]] (38b). In the ''[[Phaedo]]'', the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, "Plato was ill". (''Phaedo'' 59b)

Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the [[Second Letter (Plato)|''Second Letter'']], it says, "no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, [[Xenophon]] and [[Aristophanes]] seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form.{{sfn|Strauss|1964|pp=50‚Äì51}}

Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to [[Theory of forms|Forms]] to Plato and Socrates (''Metaphysics'' 987b1‚Äì11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding.

==Plato's use of myth==
''Mythos'' and ''logos'' are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of ''tale or history''. Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a ''nonverifiable account'', and logos a ''rational account''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chappel|first1=Timothy|title=Mythos and Logos in Plato|url=https://www.academia.edu/10450689|publisher=Open University|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use.

Plato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth.{{Ref label|D|d|none}} First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edelstein|first1=Ludwig|title=The Function of the Myth in Plato's Philosophy|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|date=October 1949|volume=X|issue=4|pages=463‚Äì481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently, then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Partenie|first1=Catalin|title=Plato's Myths|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-myths/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|As old man, Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]''&lt;!-- this should link to an article about the famous artwork --&gt;, a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his hand. Plato holds his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]].]]

===Recurrent themes===
Plato often discusses the father-son relationship and the question of whether a father's interest in his sons has much to do with how well his sons turn out. In ancient Athens, a boy was socially located by his family identity, and Plato often refers to his characters in terms of their paternal and fraternal relationships. Socrates was not a family man, and saw himself as the son of his mother, who was apparently a midwife. A divine fatalist, Socrates mocks men who spent exorbitant fees on tutors and trainers for their sons, and repeatedly ventures the idea that good character is a gift from the gods. Plato's dialogue [[Crito]] reminds Socrates that orphans are at the mercy of chance, but Socrates is unconcerned. In the ''Theaetetus'', he is found recruiting as a disciple a young man whose inheritance has been squandered. Socrates twice compares the relationship of the older man and his boy lover to the father-son relationship (''Lysis'' 213a, ''Republic'' 3.403b), and in the ''Phaedo'', Socrates' disciples, towards whom he displays more concern than his biological sons, say they will feel "fatherless" when he is gone.

In several of Plato's dialogues, Socrates promulgates the idea that [[knowledge]] is a matter of recollection, and not of learning, observation, or study.{{sfn|Baird &amp; Kaufmann|2008}} He maintains this view somewhat at his own expense, because in many dialogues, Socrates complains of his forgetfulness. Socrates is often found arguing that knowledge is not empirical, and that it comes from divine insight. In many middle period dialogues, such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Republic'' and ''Phaedrus'' Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the [[afterlife]]. More than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and opinion, perception and [[reality]], [[nature]] and custom, and body and soul.

Several dialogues tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a‚Äìc), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetry, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.

Socrates and his company of disputants had something to say on many subjects, including politics and art, religion and science, justice and medicine, virtue and vice, crime and punishment, pleasure and pain, rhetoric and rhapsody, human nature and sexuality, as well as love and wisdom.

===Metaphysics===
{{Main|Platonic realism}}
&lt;!-- Socrates is a character in Plato's dialogues! --&gt;
"Platonism" is a term coined by scholars to refer to the intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the ''Republic'', Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', he says such people are ''eu amousoi'' (Œµ·Ωñ ·ºÑŒºŒøœÖœÉŒøŒπ), an expression that means literally, "happily without the muses" (''Theaetetus'' 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, and people like him, access to higher insights about reality.

Socrates' idea that reality is unavailable to those who use their senses is what puts him at odds with the common man, and with common sense. Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his [[Allegory of the Cave]], and more explicitly in his description of [[the divided line of Plato|the divided line]]. The Allegory of the Cave (begins ''Republic'' 7.514a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible ("noeton") and that the visible world ("(h)oraton") is the least knowable, and the most obscure.

Socrates says in the ''Republic'' that people who take the sun-lit world of the senses to be good and real are living pitifully in a den of evil and ignorance. Socrates admits that few climb out of the den, or cave of ignorance, and those who do, not only have a terrible struggle to attain the heights, but when they go back down for a visit or to help other people up, they find themselves objects of scorn and ridicule.

According to Socrates, physical objects and physical events are "shadows" of their ideal or perfect forms, and exist only to the extent that they instantiate the perfect versions of themselves. Just as shadows are temporary, inconsequential epiphenomena produced by physical objects, physical objects are themselves fleeting phenomena caused by more substantial causes, the ideals of which they are mere instances. For example, Socrates thinks that perfect justice exists (although it is not clear where) and his own trial would be a cheap copy of it.

The Allegory of the Cave (often said by scholars to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that only people who have climbed out of the cave and cast their eyes on a vision of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the "[[philosopher king|philosopher-king]]", the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are wise enough to choose a good master. This is the main thesis of Socrates in the ''Republic'', that the most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bachelorandmaster.com/creationofknowledge/allegory-of-the-cave.html#.WLGXw4WcHIV |title=Plato's The Allegory of the Cave: Meaning and Interpretation  |website=Bachelor and Master |access-date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of Forms===
{{Main|Theory of Forms}}

The theory of Forms (or theory of Ideas) typically refers to the belief that the material world as it seems to us is not the real world, but only an "image" or "copy" of the real world. In some of Plato's dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating [[Platonic realism|a solution]] to the [[problem of universals]]. The forms, according to Socrates, are [[archetype]]s or [[Abstraction|abstract]] representations of the many [[Type (metaphysics)|types]] of things, and [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] we feel and see around us, that can only be perceived by reason ({{lang|grc|ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ}}). (That is, they are [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]].) In other words, Socrates was able to recognize two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is apparent.

===Epistemology===
{{Main| Platonic epistemology}}

Many have interpreted Plato as stating‚Äîeven having been the first to write‚Äîthat [[knowledge]] is [[justified true belief]], an influential view that informed future developments in epistemology.{{sfn|Fine|2003|p=5}} This interpretation is partly based on a reading of the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' wherein Plato argues that knowledge is distinguished from mere true belief by the knower having an "account" of the object of her or his true belief ({{citeplato|Theaetetus|201c‚Äìd}}). And this theory may again be seen in the ''Meno'', where it is suggested that true belief can be raised to the level of knowledge if it is bound with an account as to the question of "why" the object of the true belief is so ({{citeplato|Meno|97d‚Äì98a}}).{{sfn|McDowell|1973|p=230}} Many years later, [[Edmund Gettier]] famously demonstrated the problems of the justified true belief account of knowledge. That the modern theory of justified true belief as knowledge which Gettier addresses is equivalent to Plato's is accepted by some scholars but rejected by others.{{sfn|Fine|1979|p=366}} Plato himself also identified problems with the ''justified true belief'' definition in the ''Theaetetus'', concluding that justification (or an "account") would require knowledge of ''differentness'', meaning that the definition of knowledge is [[circular reasoning|circular]] ({{citeplato|Theaetetus|210a‚Äìb}}).{{sfn|McDowell|1973|p=256}}

Later in the ''[[Meno (Plato)#Dialogue with Meno's slave|Meno]]'', Socrates uses a geometrical example to expound Plato's view that knowledge in this latter sense is acquired by [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|recollection]]. Socrates elicits a fact concerning a geometrical construction from a slave boy, who could not have otherwise known the fact (due to the slave boy's lack of education). The knowledge must be present, Socrates concludes, in an eternal, non-experiential form.

In other dialogues, the ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'', and the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', Plato himself associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships to one another (which he calls "expertise" in [[Dialectic]]), including through the processes of ''collection'' and ''division''.{{sfn|Taylor|2011|pp=176‚Äì187}} More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if one derives one's account of something experientially, because the world of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. And opinions are characterized by a lack of necessity and stability. On the other hand, if one derives one's account of something by way of the non-sensible forms, because these forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them. That apprehension of forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato's theory in the ''Theaetetus'' and ''Meno''.{{sfn|Lee|2011|p=432}} Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be at the base of the "account" required for justification, in that it offers [[Foundationalism|foundational]] knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an [[infinite regression]].{{sfn|Taylor|2011|p=189}}

===The state===
{{main|The Republic (Plato)}}
[[File:POxy3679 Parts Plato Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]], with fragment of Plato's ''Republic'']]
Some of Plato's most famous doctrines are contained in the ''Republic'' as well as in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and the ''Statesman''. Because these doctrines are not spoken directly by Plato and vary between dialogues, they cannot be straightforwardly assumed as representing Plato's own views.

Socrates asserts that societies have a tripartite class structure corresponding to the appetite/spirit/reason structure of the individual soul. The appetite/spirit/reason are analogous to the castes of society.{{sfn|Bl√∂ssner|2007|pp=345‚Äì349}}

* ''Productive'' (Workers)&amp;nbsp;‚Äì the labourers, carpenters, plumbers, masons, merchants, farmers, ranchers, etc. These correspond to the "appetite" part of the soul.
* ''Protective'' (Warriors or Guardians)&amp;nbsp;‚Äì those who are adventurous, strong and brave; in the armed forces. These correspond to the "spirit" part of the soul.
* ''Governing'' (Rulers or Philosopher Kings)&amp;nbsp;‚Äì those who are intelligent, rational, self-controlled, in love with wisdom, well suited to make decisions for the community. These correspond to the "reason" part of the soul and are very few.

In the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], Socrates locates the parts of the soul within the human body: Reason is located in the head, spirit in the top third of the [[torso]], and the appetite in the middle third of the torso, down to the [[navel]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Timaeus|44d}} &amp; {{Citeplato|Timaeus|70}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dorter|2006|p=360}}

According to this model, the principles of [[Athenian democracy]] (as it existed in his day) are rejected as only a few are fit to rule. Instead of rhetoric and persuasion, Socrates says reason and wisdom should govern. As Socrates puts it:

: "Until philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophise, that is, until political power and philosophy entirely coincide, while the many natures who at present pursue either one exclusively are forcibly prevented from doing so, cities will have no rest from evils,... nor, I think, will the human race." (''Republic'' 473c‚Äìd)
[[File:Plato i sin akademi, av Carl Johan Wahlbom (ur Svenska Familj-Journalen).png|thumb|Plato in his academy, drawing after a painting by Swedish painter Carl Johan Wahlbom]]

Socrates describes these "philosopher kings" as "those who love the sight of truth" (''Republic'' 475c) and supports the idea with the analogy of a captain and his ship or a doctor and his medicine. According to him, sailing and health are not things that everyone is qualified to practice by nature. A large part of the ''Republic'' then addresses how the educational system should be set up to produce these philosopher kings.

In addition, the ideal city is used as an image to illuminate the state of one's soul, or the [[Free will|will]], [[reason]], and [[Interpersonal attraction|desire]]s combined in the human body. Socrates is attempting to make an image of a rightly ordered human, and then later goes on to describe the different kinds of humans that can be observed, from tyrants to lovers of money in various kinds of cities. The ideal city is not promoted, but only used to magnify the different kinds of individual humans and the state of their soul. However, the [[philosopher king]] image was used by many after Plato to justify their personal political beliefs. The philosophic soul according to Socrates has reason, will, and desires united in virtuous harmony. A philosopher has the [[moderate]] love for [[wisdom]] and the [[courage]] to act according to wisdom. Wisdom is [[knowledge]] about the [[Goodness and value theory|Good]] or the right relations between all that [[Existence|exist]]s.

Wherein it concerns states and rulers, Socrates asks which is better‚Äîa bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant. He argues that it is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the ''Republic'' as Socrates describes the event of mutiny on board a ship.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, {{citeplato|Republic|488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates suggests the ship's crew to be in line with the democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Socrates' description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.

According to Socrates, a state made up of different kinds of souls will, overall, decline from an [[aristocracy]] (rule by the best) to a [[timocracy]] (rule by the honorable), then to an [[oligarchy]] (rule by the few), then to a [[democracy]] (rule by the people), and finally to [[tyranny]] (rule by one person, rule by a tyrant).{{sfn|Bl√∂ssner|2007|p=350}} Aristocracy in the sense of government (politeia) is advocated in Plato's Republic. This regime is ruled by a [[philosopher king]], and thus is grounded on wisdom and reason.

The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses throughout much of the ''Republic'', as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work. In Book VIII, Socrates states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Republic|550b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oligarchy is made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy are in control.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Republic|554a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he likes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Republic|561a‚Äìb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of [[rich and poor]]. It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeplato|Republic|571a}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bl√∂ssner|2007|p=350}}{{sfn|Dorter|2006|pp=253‚Äì267}}

For a long time, Plato's unwritten doctrine{{sfn|Rodriguez-Grandjean|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reale|1990}}. Cf. p. 14 and onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kr√§mer|1990}}. Cf. pp. 38‚Äì47.&lt;/ref&gt; had been controversial. Many modern books on Plato seem to diminish its importance; nevertheless, the first important witness who mentions its existence is Aristotle, who in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (209 b) writes: "It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there [i.e. in ''Timaeus''] of the participant is different from what he says in his so-called ''unwritten teachings'' ({{lang|grc|·ºÑŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ± Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±}})." The term "{{lang|grc|·ºÑŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ± Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±}}" literally means ''unwritten doctrines'' and it stands for the most fundamental metaphysical teaching of Plato, which he disclosed only orally, and some say only to his most trusted fellows, and which he may have kept secret from the public. The importance of the unwritten doctrines does not seem to have been seriously questioned before the 19th century.

A reason for not revealing it to everyone is partially discussed in ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (276 c) where Plato criticizes the written transmission of knowledge as faulty, favoring instead the spoken [[logos]]: "he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful ... will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually." The same argument is repeated in Plato's ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]'' (344 c): "every serious man in dealing with really serious subjects carefully avoids writing." In the same letter he writes (341 c): "I can certainly declare concerning all these writers who claim to know the subjects that I seriously study ... there does not exist, nor will there ever exist, any treatise of mine dealing therewith." Such secrecy is necessary in order not "to expose them to unseemly and degrading treatment" (344 d).

It is, however, said that Plato once disclosed this knowledge to the public in his lecture ''On the Good'' ({{lang|grc|Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏Œø·ø¶}}), in which the Good ({{lang|grc|œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏œåŒΩ}}) is identified with the One (the Unity, {{lang|grc|œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºïŒΩ}}), the fundamental ontological principle. The content of this lecture has been transmitted by several witnesses. [[Aristoxenus]] describes the event in the following words: "Each came expecting to learn something about the things that are generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness. But when the mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and astronomy, and finally the statement Good is One seemed to them, I imagine, utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others rejected it."&lt;ref&gt;''Elementa harmonica'' II, 30‚Äì31; quoted in {{harvnb|Gaiser|1980|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] quotes [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], who states that "according to Plato, the first principles of everything, including the Forms themselves are One and Indefinite Duality ({{lang|grc|·º° ·ºÄœåœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ Œ¥œÖŒ¨œÇ}}), which he called Large and Small ({{lang|grc|œÑ·Ω∏ ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∏ ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåŒΩ}})", and Simplicius reports as well that "one might also learn this from Speusippus and Xenocrates and the others who were present at Plato's lecture on the Good".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;see {{harvnb|Tar√°n|1981|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their account is in full agreement with Aristotle's description of Plato's metaphysical doctrine. In ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' he writes: "Now since the Forms are the causes of everything else, he [i.e. Plato] supposed that their elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly the material principle is the Great and Small [i.e. the Dyad], and the essence is the One ({{lang|grc|œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºïŒΩ}}), since the numbers are derived from the Great and Small by participation in the One" (987 b). "From this account it is clear that he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also tells us what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms‚Äîthat it is this the duality (the Dyad, {{lang|grc|·º° Œ¥œÖŒ¨œÇ}}), the Great and Small ({{lang|grc|œÑ·Ω∏ ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∏ ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåŒΩ}}). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil" (988 a).

The most important aspect of this interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is the continuity between his teaching and the neoplatonic interpretation of [[Plotinus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Plotinus]] describes this in the last part of his final ''[[Enneads|Ennead]]'' (VI, 9) entitled ''On the Good, or the One'' ({{lang|grc|Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏Œø·ø¶ ·º¢ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºëŒΩœåœÇ}}). Jens Halfwassen states in [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-08-16.html ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen'] (2006) that "Plotinus' ontology‚Äîwhich should be called Plotinus' [[henology]]‚Äîis a rather accurate philosophical renewal and continuation of Plato's unwritten doctrine, i.e. the doctrine rediscovered by Kr√§mer and Gaiser."&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ficino]]&lt;ref&gt;In one of his letters (Epistolae 1612) [[Ficino]] writes: "The main goal of the divine Plato ... is to show one principle of things, which he called the One ({{lang|grc|œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºïŒΩ}})", cf. {{harvnb|Montoriola|1926|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been considered erroneous by many but may in fact have been directly influenced by oral transmission of Plato's doctrine. A modern scholar who recognized the importance of the unwritten doctrine of Plato was [[Heinrich Gomperz]] who described it in his speech during the 7th [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in 1930.{{sfn|Gomperz|1931}} All the sources related to the {{lang|grc|·ºÑŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ± Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±}} have been collected by Konrad Gaiser and published as ''Testimonia Platonica''.{{sfn|Gaiser|1998}} These sources have subsequently been interpreted by scholars from the German ''T√ºbingen School of interpretation'' such as Hans Joachim Kr√§mer or Thomas A. Szlez√°k.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief description of the problem see for example {{harvnb|Gaiser|1980}}. A more detailed analysis is given by {{harvnb|Kr√§mer|1990}}. Another description is by {{harvnb|Reale|1997}} and {{harvnb|Reale|1990}}. A thorough analysis of the consequences of such an approach is given by {{harvnb|Szlezak|1999}}. Another supporter of this interpretation is the German philosopher [[Karl Albert]], cf. {{harvnb|Albert|1980}} or {{harvnb|Albert|1996}}. [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] is also sympathetic towards it, cf. {{harvnb|Grondin|2010}} and {{harvnb|Gadamer|1980}}. Gadamer's final position on the subject is stated in {{harvnb|Gadamer|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialectic===
The role of [[dialectic]] in Plato's thought is contested but there are two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition.{{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} [[Simon Blackburn]] adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is "the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position."{{sfn|Blackburn|1996|p=104}} A similar interpretation has been put forth by Louis Hartz, who suggests that elements of the dialectic are borrowed from [[Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartz, Louis. 1984. ''A Synthesis of World History''. Zurich: Humanity Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, opposing arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time. Each new idea exposes a flaw in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate continually approaches the truth. Hartz's is a teleological interpretation at the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of knowledge and thus reach "the end of history." [[Karl Popper]], on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for "visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances."{{sfn|Popper|1962|p=133}}

==Dialogues{{Anchor|Works|Plato's dialogues}}==
{{see also|Stephanus pagination}}
Thirty-five dialogues and thirteen letters (the [[Epistles (Plato)|''Epistles'']]) have traditionally been ascribed to Plato, though modern scholarship doubts the authenticity of at least some of these. Plato's writings have been published in several fashions; this has led to several conventions regarding the naming and referencing of Plato's texts.

The usual system for making unique references to sections of the text by Plato derives from a 16th-century edition of Plato's works by [[Henri Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]]. An overview of Plato's writings according to this system can be found in the [[Stephanus pagination]] article.

[[File:Timaeus stephanus pages 32 33.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Volume 3, pages 32‚Äì33, of the 1578 Stephanus edition of Plato, showing a passage of ''Timaeus'' with the Latin translation and notes of [[Jean de Serres]]]]
One tradition regarding the arrangement of Plato's texts is according to [[tetralogy|tetralogies]]. This scheme is ascribed by Diogenes Laertius to an ancient scholar and court astrologer to [[Tiberius]] named [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]].

The works are usually grouped into ''Early'' (sometimes by some into ''Transitional''), ''Middle'', and ''Late'' period.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Reeve (Delta Kappa Epsilon Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f2yn0T8U-a8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Plato+works&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=59IaVcuIC5DnaKyNgKgM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Plato%20works&amp;f=false ''A Plato Reader: Eight Essential Dialogues'' (p. vi)], Hackett Publishing, 2012 {{isbn|1603849173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Barrow (Professor of Philosophy of Education at Simon Fraser University, Canada and Fellow of The Royal Society of Canada), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkG_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=Plato+works+groupings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Dt8aVdHHH8zWaufggNAE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Plato%20works%20groupings&amp;f=false ''Plato'': Appendix 2: Notes on the authenticity and Groupings of Plato's works], Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014 {{isbn|1472504852}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This choice to group chronologically is thought worthy of criticism by some (Cooper ''et al''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCB33OPRE-AC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=Plato+works+groupings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eQMbVcerGo3saLzngdAF&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Plato%20works%20groupings&amp;f=false''Platonic Writings/Platonic Readings'' (page x)] (edited by [http://www.bu.edu/philo/people/faculty/full-time/charles-l-griswold/ CL Griswold Jr]), Penn State Press, 2010 {{isbn|0271044810}}.&lt;/ref&gt; given that it is recognised that there is no absolute agreement as to the true chronologicity, since the facts of the temporal order of writing are not confidently ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;JM Cooper (Stuart Professor of Philosophy, Princeton University, 1997); DS Hutchinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv9AKY_DBVYC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=Plato+works+groupings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-waVd_NKJPWasapgpAI&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Plato%20works%20groupings&amp;f=false ''Complete Works'' (p. xii)], Hackett Publishing, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronologicity was not a consideration in ancient times, in that grouping of this nature are ''virtually absent'' (Tarrant) in the extant writings of ancient Platonists.&lt;ref&gt;H Tarrant (Professor of Classics at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wFdMO4_wm-sC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Plato+works+groupings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=swIbVeqvN8fPaPWXgKgM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Plato%20works%20groupings&amp;f=false ''Plato's First Interpreters''], Cornell University Press, 2000 {{isbn|080143792X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings of doubted authenticity===
Jowett mentions in his Appendix to Menexenus, that works which bore the character of a writer were attributed to that writer even when the actual author was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Jowett|B Jowett]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1682/1682-h/1682-h.htm ''Menexenus'': Appendix I (1st paragraph)].&lt;/ref&gt;

For below:

(*) if there is no consensus among scholars as to whether Plato is the author, and (‚Ä°) if most scholars agree that Plato is ''not'' the author of the work.&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which scholars consider a dialogue to be authentic is noted in {{harvnb|Cooper|1997|pp=v‚Äìvi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spurious writings====
The following works were transmitted under Plato's name, most of them already considered spurious in antiquity, and so were not included by Thrasyllus in his tetralogical arrangement. These works are labelled as ''Notheuomenoi'' ("spurious") or ''Apocrypha''.
* ''[[Axiochus (dialogue)|Axiochus]]'', ''[[Definitions (Plato)|Definitions]]'', ''[[Demodocus (dialogue)|Demodocus]]'', ''[[Epigrams (Plato)|Epigrams]]'', ''[[Eryxias (dialogue)|Eryxias]]'', ''[[Halcyon (dialogue)|Halcyon]]'', ''[[On Justice]]'', ''[[On Virtue]]'', ''[[Sisyphus (dialogue)|Sisyphus]]''.

===Composition===
No one knows the exact order Plato's dialogues were written in, nor the extent to which some might have been later revised and rewritten. A significant distinction of the early Plato and the later Plato has been offered by scholars such as E.R. Dodds and has been summarized by Harold Bloom in his book titled ''Agon'': "E.R. Dodds is the classical scholar whose writings most illuminated the Hellenic descent (in) ''The Greeks and the Irrational'' ... In his chapter on Plato and the Irrational Soul ... Dodds traces Plato's spiritual evolution from the pure rationalist of the ''Protagoras'' to the transcendental psychologist, influenced by the Pythagoreans and Orphics, of the later works culminating in the ''Laws''."{{sfn|Bloom|1982|p=5}}

[[Lewis Campbell (classicist)|Lewis Campbell]] was the first{{sfn|Burnet|1928b|p=9}} to make exhaustive use of [[stylometry]] to prove objectively that the ''Critias'', ''Timaeus'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', and ''Statesman'' were all clustered together as a group, while the ''Parmenides'', ''Phaedrus'', ''Republic'', and ''Theaetetus'' belong to a separate group, which must be earlier (given Aristotle's statement in his ''Politics''&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058&amp;layout=&amp;loc=2.1264b 1264b24-27].&lt;/ref&gt; that the ''Laws'' was written after the ''Republic''; cf. Diogenes Laertius ''Lives'' 3.37). What is remarkable about Campbell's conclusions is that, in spite of all the stylometric studies that have been conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato's works that can now be said to be ''proven'' by stylometry is the fact that ''Critias'', ''Timaeus'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', and ''Statesman'' are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others earlier.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=xiv}}

Increasingly in the most recent Plato scholarship, writers are skeptical of the notion that the order of Plato's writings can be established with any precision,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kraut|2013}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Rowe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though Plato's works are still often characterized as falling at least roughly into three groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Brickhouse|Smith}}|Brickhouse &amp; Smith]].&lt;/ref&gt; The following represents one relatively common such division.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Guthrie|1986}}; {{harvnb|Vlastos|1991}}; {{harvnb|Penner|1992}}; {{harvnb|Kahn|1996}}; {{harvnb|Fine|1999b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It should, however, be kept in mind that many of the positions in the ordering are still highly disputed, and also that the very notion that Plato's dialogues can or should be "ordered" is by no means universally accepted.

Among those who classify the dialogues into periods of composition, Socrates figures in all of the "early dialogues" and they are considered the most faithful representations of the historical Socrates.{{sfn|Dodds|2004}} They include ''The Apology of Socrates'', ''Charmides'', ''Crito'', ''Euthyphro'', ''Ion'', ''Laches'', ''Lesser Hippias'', ''Lysis'', ''Menexenus'', and ''Protagoras'' (often considered one of the last of the "early dialogues"). Three dialogues are often considered "transitional" or "pre-middle": ''Euthydemus'', ''Gorgias'', and ''Meno''.

Whereas those classified as "early dialogues" often conclude in [[aporia]], the so-called "middle dialogues" provide more clearly stated positive teachings that are often ascribed to Plato such as the theory of Forms. These dialogues include ''Cratylus'', ''Phaedo'', ''Phaedrus'', ''Republic'', ''Symposium'', ''Parmenides'', and ''Theaetetus''. Proponents of dividing the dialogues into periods often consider the ''Parmenides'' and ''Theaetetus'' to come late in this period and be transitional to the next, as they seem to treat the theory of Forms critically (''Parmenides'') or only indirectly (''Theaetetus'').{{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=251}} Ritter's stylometric analysis places ''Phaedrus'' as probably after ''Theaetetus'' and ''Parmenides'',{{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=77}} although it does not relate to the theory of Forms in the same way. The first book of the ''Republic'' is often thought to have been written significantly earlier than the rest of the work, although possibly having undergone revisions when the later books were attached to it.{{sfn|Brandwood|1990|p=251}}

The remaining dialogues are classified as "late" and are generally agreed to be difficult and challenging pieces of philosophy. This grouping is the only one proven by stylometric analysis.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=xiv}} While looked to for Plato's "mature" answers to the questions posed by his earlier works, those answers are difficult to discern. Some scholars{{sfn|Dodds|2004}} indicate that the theory of Forms is absent from the late dialogues, its having been refuted in the ''Parmenides'', but there isn't total consensus that the ''Parmenides'' actually refutes the theory of Forms.{{sfn|Meinwald|1991}} The so-called "late dialogues" include ''Critias'', ''Laws'', ''Philebus'', ''Sophist'', ''Statesman'', and ''Timaeus''.{{sfn|Dodds|2004}}

===Narration===
Plato never presents himself as a participant in any of the dialogues, and with the exception of the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', there is no suggestion that he heard any of the dialogues firsthand. Some dialogues have no narrator but have a pure "dramatic" form (examples: ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', ''[[Euthyphro]]''), some dialogues are narrated by Socrates, wherein he speaks in first person (examples: ''[[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]]'', ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''). One dialogue, ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', begins in dramatic form but quickly proceeds to Socrates' narration of a conversation he had previously with the sophist for whom the dialogue is named; this narration continues uninterrupted till the dialogue's end.
[[File:Anselm Feuerbach - Das Gastmahl. Nach Platon (zweite Fassung) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Painting of a scene from Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' ([[Anselm Feuerbach]], 1873)]]
Two dialogues ''Phaedo'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' also begin in dramatic form but then proceed to virtually uninterrupted narration by followers of Socrates. ''Phaedo'', an account of Socrates' final conversation and hemlock drinking, is narrated by Phaedo to Echecrates in a foreign city not long after the execution took place.&lt;ref&gt;"The time is not long after the death of Socrates; for the Pythagoreans [Echecrates &amp; co.] have not heard any details yet" ({{harvnb|Burnet|1911|p=5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Symposium'' is narrated by Apollodorus, a Socratic disciple, apparently to Glaucon. Apollodorus assures his listener that he is recounting the story, which took place when he himself was an infant, not from his own memory, but as remembered by Aristodemus, who told him the story years ago.

The ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' is a peculiar case: a dialogue in dramatic form embedded within another dialogue in dramatic form. In the beginning of the ''Theaetetus'' (142c‚Äì143b), [[Euclid of Megara|Euclides]] says that he compiled the conversation from notes he took based on what Socrates told him of his conversation with the title character. The rest of the ''Theaetetus'' is presented as a "book" written in dramatic form and read by one of Euclides' slaves (143c). Some scholars take this as an indication that Plato had by this date wearied of the narrated form.{{sfn|Burnet|1928a|loc=¬ß177}} With the exception of the ''Theaetetus'', Plato gives no explicit indication as to how these orally transmitted conversations came to be written down.

===Trial of Socrates===
{{Main|Trial of Socrates}}
The trial of Socrates is the central, unifying event of Plato's dialogues. Because of this, ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' is among the most frequently read of his works. In the ''Apology'', Socrates tries to dismiss rumors that he is a [[sophism|sophist]] and defends himself against charges of disbelief in the gods and corruption of the young. Socrates insists that long-standing slander will be the real cause of his demise, and says the legal charges are essentially false. Socrates famously denies being wise, and explains how his life as a philosopher was launched by the [[Oracle at Delphi]]. He says that his quest to resolve the riddle of the oracle put him at odds with his fellow man, and that this is the reason he has been mistaken for a menace to the city-state of Athens.

If Plato's important dialogues do not refer to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that play a part in it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210d) and the ''[[Euthyphro]]'' (2a‚Äìb) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges. In the ''[[Meno]]'' (94e‚Äì95a), one of the men who brings legal charges against Socrates, [[Anytus]], warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people. In the ''[[Gorgias]]'', Socrates says that his trial will be like a doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e‚Äì522a). In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation. The ''Apology'' is Socrates' defense speech, and the ''[[Crito]]'' and ''Phaedo'' take place in prison after the conviction. In the ''[[Protagoras]]'', Socrates is a guest at the home of [[Callias III|Callias]], son of [[Hipponicus]], a man whom Socrates disparages in the ''Apology'' as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees.

===Unity and diversity===
Two other important dialogues, the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' and the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', are linked to the main storyline by characters. In the ''Apology'' (19b, c), Socrates says [[Aristophanes]] slandered him in a comic play, and blames him for causing his bad reputation, and ultimately, his death. In the ''Symposium'', the two of them are drinking together with other friends. The character Phaedrus is linked to the main story line by character (Phaedrus is also a participant in the ''Symposium'' and the ''Protagoras'') and by theme (the philosopher as divine emissary, etc.) The ''Protagoras'' is also strongly linked to the ''Symposium'' by characters: all of the formal speakers at the ''Symposium'' (with the exception of Aristophanes) are present at the home of Callias in that dialogue. [[Charmides]] and his guardian [[Critias]] are present for the discussion in the ''Protagoras''. Examples of characters crossing between dialogues can be further multiplied. The ''Protagoras'' contains the largest gathering of Socratic associates.

In the dialogues Plato is most celebrated and admired for, Socrates is concerned with human and political virtue, has a distinctive personality, and friends and enemies who "travel" with him from dialogue to dialogue. This is not to say that Socrates is consistent: a man who is his friend in one dialogue may be an adversary or subject of his mockery in another. For example, Socrates praises the wisdom of [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] many times in the ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', but makes him look like a fool in the ''[[Euthyphro]]''. He disparages sophists generally, and [[Prodicus]] specifically in the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', whom he also slyly jabs in the ''Cratylus'' for charging the hefty fee of fifty [[drachma]]s for a course on language and grammar. However, Socrates tells Theaetetus in his [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|namesake dialogue]] that he admires Prodicus and has directed many pupils to him. Socrates' ideas are also not consistent within or between or among dialogues.

===Platonic scholarship===
[[File:Herma of Plato - 0042MC.jpg|thumb|right|"The safest general characterisation of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato." (Alfred North Whitehead, ''[[Process and Reality]]'', 1929).]]

Although their popularity has fluctuated over the years, the works of Plato have never been without readers since the time they were written.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=vii}} Plato's thought is often compared with that of his most famous student, Aristotle, whose reputation during the Western [[Middle Ages]] so completely eclipsed that of Plato that the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers referred to Aristotle as "the Philosopher". However, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the study of Plato continued.

The only Platonic work known to western scholarship was Timaeus, until translations were made at a time post the fall of [[Constantinople]], which occurred during 1453,&lt;ref&gt;C. U. M. Smith - [https://books.google.com/books?id=NcTHBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=neuroscience+twentieth+century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KLiOVeXlO8zd7QbIxr2wDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=neuroscience%20twentieth%20century&amp;f=false Brain, Mind and Consciousness in the History of Neuroscience (page 1)] Springer Science &amp; Business, 1 Jan 2014, 374 pages, ''Volume 6 of History, philosophy and theory of the life sciences SpringerLink : B√ºcher'' {{isbn|9401787743}} [Retrieved 2015-06-27]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Gemistos Plethon]] brought Plato's original writings from Constantinople in the century of its fall. It is believed that Plethon passed a copy of the Dialogues to [[Cosimo de' Medici]] when in 1438 the [[Council of Ferrara]], called to unify the Greek and Latin Churches, was adjourned to Florence, where Plethon then lectured on the relation and differences of Plato and Aristotle, and fired Cosimo with his enthusiasm;{{sfn|Lackner|2001|p=21}} Cosimo would supply [[Marsilio Ficino]] with Plato's text for translation to Latin. During the early Islamic era, [[Iran|Persian]] and Arab scholars translated much of Plato into Arabic and wrote [[Close reading|commentaries]] and interpretations on Plato's, Aristotle's and other Platonist philosophers' works (see [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]). Many of these comments on Plato were translated from Arabic into Latin and as such influenced Medieval scholastic philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Burrell|1998}} and {{harvnb|Hasse|2002|pp=33‚Äì45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], with the general resurgence of interest in classical civilization, knowledge of Plato's philosophy would become widespread again in the West. Many of the greatest early modern scientists and artists who broke with [[Scholasticism]] and fostered the flowering of the Renaissance, with the support of the Plato-inspired [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] (grandson of Cosimo), saw Plato's philosophy as the basis for progress in the arts and sciences. His political views, too, were well-received: the vision of wise philosopher-kings of the ''Republic'' matched the views set out in works such as [[Niccol√≤ Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]''. More problematic was Plato's belief in [[metempsychosis]], transmigration of the soul, as well as his ethical views (on [[polyamory]] and [[euthanasia]] in particular), which did not match those of Christianity. It was Plethon's student [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]] who reconciled Plato with Christian theology, arguing that Plato's views were only ideals, unattainable due to the [[fall of man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Harris |year=2002 |accessdate=9 February 2015 |title=Byzantines in Renaissance Italy |website=ORB: The Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies |publisher=College of Staten Island, City University of New York |url=http://the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030930225420/http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 September 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, Plato's reputation was restored, and at least on par with Aristotle's. Notable Western philosophers have continued to draw upon Plato's work since that time. Plato's influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. He helped to distinguish between [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] by widening the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]] and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. He regarded "logistic" as appropriate for business men and men of war who "must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops," while "arithmetic" was appropriate for philosophers "because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|1991|p=86}}: 'Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who "must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops." The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician "because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."'&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's resurgence further inspired some of the greatest advances in logic since Aristotle, primarily through [[Gottlob Frege]] and his followers [[Kurt G√∂del]], [[Alonzo Church]], and [[Alfred Tarski]]. [[Albert Einstein]] suggested that the scientist who takes philosophy seriously would have to avoid systematization and take on many different roles, and possibly appear as a Platonist or Pythagorean, in that such a one would have "the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research."{{sfn|Einstein|1949|pp=683‚Äì684}}

Many recent philosophers have diverged from what some would describe as the [[ontology|ontological]] models and [[moral]] ideals characteristic of traditional Platonism. A number of these postmodern philosophers have thus appeared to disparage Platonism from more or less informed perspectives. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] notoriously attacked Plato's "idea of the good itself" along with many fundamentals of Christian morality, which he interpreted as "Platonism for the masses" in one of his most important works, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]] ''(1886). [[Martin Heidegger]] argued against Plato's alleged obfuscation of ''[[Being]] ''in his incomplete tome, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927), and the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] argued in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Plato's alleged proposal for a [[utopia]]n political regime in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' was prototypically [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. The political philosopher and professor [[Leo Strauss]] is considered by some as the prime thinker involved in the recovery of Platonic thought in its more political, and less metaphysical, form. Strauss' political approach was in part inspired by the appropriation of Plato and Aristotle by medieval [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] [[political philosophy|political philosophers]], especially [[Maimonides]] and [[Al-Farabi]], as opposed to the Christian metaphysical tradition that developed from [[Neoplatonism]]. Deeply influenced by Nietzsche and Heidegger, Strauss nonetheless rejects their condemnation of Plato and looks to the dialogues for a solution to what all three latter day thinkers acknowledge as 'the crisis of the West.'

===Textual sources and history===
[[File:Clarke Plato page 1 recto.jpg|thumb|First page of the ''Euthyphro'', from the Clarke Plato (Codex Oxoniensis Clarkianus 39), 895 AD. The text is [[Greek minuscule]].]]
{{See also|List of manuscripts of Plato's dialogues}}
Some 250 known manuscripts of Plato survive.{{sfn|Brumbaugh|Wells|1989}} The texts of Plato as received today apparently represent the complete written philosophical work of Plato and are generally good by the standards of [[textual criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irwin|2011|pp=64 &amp; 74}}. See also {{harvnb|Slings|1987|p=34}}: "... primary MSS. together offer a text of tolerably good quality" (this is without the further corrections of other sources).&lt;/ref&gt; No modern edition of Plato in the original Greek represents a single source, but rather it is reconstructed from multiple sources which are compared with each other. These sources are medieval manuscripts written on vellum (mainly from 9th to 13th century AD Byzantium), papyri (mainly from late antiquity in Egypt), and from the independent ''testimonia'' of other authors who quote various segments of the works (which come from a variety of sources). The text as presented is usually not much different from what appears in the Byzantine manuscripts, and papyri and testimonia just confirm the manuscript tradition. In some editions however the readings in the papyri or testimonia are favoured in some places by the editing critic of the text. Reviewing editions of papyri for the ''Republic'' in 1987, Slings suggests that the use of papyri is hampered due to some poor editing practices.{{sfn|Slings|1987|p=31}}

In the first century AD, [[Thrasyllus of Mendes]] had compiled and published the works of Plato in the original Greek, both genuine and spurious. While it has not survived to the present day, all the extant medieval Greek manuscripts are based on his edition.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|pp=viii‚Äìxii}}

The oldest surviving complete manuscript for many of the dialogues is the Clarke Plato (Codex Oxoniensis Clarkianus 39, or Codex Boleianus MS E.D. Clarke 39), which was written in Constantinople in 895 and acquired by [[Oxford University]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/philosophy/collections/manuscripts |title=Manuscripts&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Philosophy Faculty Library |date=2 March 2012 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214520/http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/philosophy/collections/manuscripts |archivedate= 2 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clarke is given the [[sigla|siglum]] ''B'' in modern editions. ''B'' contains the first six tetralogies and is described internally as being written by "John the Calligrapher" on behalf of [[Arethas of Caesarea]]. It appears to have undergone corrections by Arethas himself.{{sfn|Dodds|1959|pp=35‚Äì36}} For the last two tetralogies and the apocrypha, the oldest surviving complete manuscript is Codex Parisinus graecus 1807, designated ''A'', which was written nearly contemporaneously to ''B'', circa 900 AD.{{sfn|Dodds|1959|p=37}} ''A'' must be a copy of the edition edited by the [[patriarch]], [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]], teacher of Arethas.&lt;ref&gt;RD McKirahan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EmtFGKmWa60C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=the+original+Plato+text&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eBYMVenyOZXsaJmQgcgE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20original%20Plato%20text&amp;f=false ''Philosophy Before Socrates: An Introduction with Texts and Commentary'' (2nd ed.), Hackett Publishing, 2011, p. 1] {{isbn|1603846123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RS Brumbaugh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=If5YWCbJhHoC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=the+first+copy+of+plato+is+9th+century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ahcMVbqzGMT1aoqIgdgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20first%20copy%20of%20plato%20is%209th%20century&amp;f=false ''Plato for the Modern Age'' (p. 199)], University Press of America, 1991 {{isbn|0819183563}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Duffy [https://books.google.com/books?id=1aj0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=philosophy+Photos,+Arethas+teacher+Plato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qyEMVXLW3Wrw64C4BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20Photos%2C%20Arethas%20teacher%20Plato&amp;f=false ''Byzantine Philosophy and Its Ancient Sources'': "The lonely mission of Michael Psellos"] edited by K Ierodiakonou (Oxford University Press, 2004) {{isbn|0199269718}}.&lt;/ref&gt;''A'' probably had an initial volume containing the first 7 tetralogies which is now lost, but of which a copy was made, Codex Venetus append. class. 4, 1, which has the siglum ''T''. The oldest manuscript for the seventh tetralogy is Codex Vindobonensis 54. suppl. phil. Gr. 7, with siglum ''W'', with a supposed date in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Dodds|1959|p=39}} In total there are fifty-one such Byzantine manuscripts known, while others may yet be found.{{sfn|Irwin|2011|p=71}}

To help establish the text, the older evidence of papyri and the independent evidence of the testimony of commentators and other authors (i.e., those who quote and refer to an old text of Plato which is no longer extant) are also used. Many papyri which contain fragments of Plato's texts are among the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]. The 2003 [[Oxford Classical Texts]] edition by Slings even cites the Coptic translation of a fragment of the ''Republic'' in the [[Nag Hammadi library]] as evidence.{{sfn|Slings|2003|p=xxiii}} Important authors for testimony include [[Olympiodorus the Younger]], [[Plutarch]], [[Proclus]], [[Iamblichus]], [[Eusebius]], and [[Stobaeus]].

During the early Renaissance, the Greek language and, along with it, Plato's texts were reintroduced to Western Europe by Byzantine scholars. In September or October 1484 [[Filippo Valori]] and [[Francesco Berlinghieri]] printed 1025 copies of [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino's]] translation, using the printing press at the Dominican convent S.Jacopo di Ripoli.&lt;ref&gt;J Hankins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BLgfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=the+manuscript+tradition+of+Plato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lpsLVZKJMNT7as3ggqgE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20manuscript%20tradition%20of%20Plato&amp;f=false ''Plato in the Italian Renaissance'' Vol. 1 (p. 300)], BRILL, 1990 {{isbn|9004091610}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Allen|1975|p=12}} Cosimo had been influenced toward studying Plato by the many Byzantine Platonists in Florence during his day, including [[George Gemistus Plethon]].

The 1578 edition&lt;ref&gt;''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'' edidit Henricus Stephanus, Genevae, 1578.&lt;/ref&gt; of Plato's complete works published by Henricus Stephanus ([[Henri Estienne]]) in [[Geneva]] also included parallel Latin translation and running commentary by Joannes Serranus ([[Jean de Serres]]). It was this edition which established standard [[Stephanus pagination]], still in use today.{{sfn|Suzanne|2009}}

===Modern editions===
The [[Oxford Classical Texts]] offers the current standard complete Greek text of Plato's complete works. In five volumes edited by [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]], its first edition was published 1900-1907, and it is still available from the publisher, having last been printed in 1993.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|pp=xii &amp; xxvii}}&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/category/academic/series/classicalstudies/oct.do Oxford Classical Texts&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Classical Studies &amp; Ancient History Series]''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition is still in progress with only the first volume, printed in 1995, and the ''Republic'', printed in 2003, available. The ''Cambridge Greek and Latin Texts'' and ''Cambridge Classical Texts and Commentaries'' series includes Greek editions of the ''Protagoras'', ''Symposium'', ''Phaedrus'', ''Alcibiades'', and ''Clitophon'', with English philological, literary, and, to an extent, philosophical commentary.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cambridge.org/ca/knowledge/series/series_display/item3936986/Cambridge-Greek-and-Latin-Classics/ Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Series]''.

Dodds]]' of the ''Gorgias'', which includes extensive English commentary.{{sfn|Irwin|1979|pp=vi &amp; 11}}{{sfn|Dodds|1959}}

The modern standard complete English edition is the 1997 [[Hackett Publishing Company|Hackett]] ''Plato, Complete Works'', edited by John M.

==Plato in the arts==
[[Plato's Academy mosaic]] was created in the villa of [[T. Siminius Stephanus]] in [[Pompeii]], around 100 BC to 100 CE. ''[[The School of Athens]]'' [[fresco]] by [[Raphael]] features Plato also as a central figure.

:"And he learnt gymnastics under Ariston, the Argive wrestler. And from him he received the name of Plato on account of his robust figure, in place of his original name which was Aristocles, after his grandfather, as Alexander informs us in his Successions of Philosophers. But others affirm that he got the name Plato from the breadth of his style, or from the breadth of his forehead, as suggested by Neanthes."
Seneca mentions the meaning of Plato's name in connection to a [[Stoicism#Ethics and virtues|moral lesson]]:&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistulae'', VI 58:29-30; translation by Robert Mott Gummere&lt;/ref&gt;
:''{{lang|la|Illud simul cogitemus, si mundum ipsum, non minus mortalem quam nos sumus, providentia periculis eximit, posse aliquatenus nostra quoque providentia longiorem prorogari huic corpusculo moram, si voluptates, quibus pars maior perit, potuerimus regere et coercere. Plato ipse ad senectutem se diligentia protulit. Erat quidem corpus validum ac forte sortitus et illi nomen latitudo pectoris fecerat, sed navigationes ac pericula multum detraxerant viribus; parsimonia tamen et eorum quae aviditatem evocant modus et diligens sui tutela perduxit illum ad senectutem multis prohibentibus causis.}}''
:"Let us at the same time reflect, seeing that Providence rescues from its perils the world itself, which is no less mortal than we ourselves, that to some extent our petty bodies can be made to tarry longer upon earth by our own providence, if only we acquire the ability to control and check those pleasures whereby the greater portion of mankind perishes. Plato himself, by taking pains, advanced to old age. To be sure, he was the fortunate possessor of a strong and sound body (his very name was given him because of his broad chest); but his strength was much impaired by sea voyages and desperate adventures. Nevertheless, by frugal living, by setting a limit upon all that rouses the appetites, and by painstaking attention to himself, he reached that advanced age in spite of many hindrances."

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} The [[Philologist|grammarian]] [[Apollodorus of Athens]] argues in his ''Chronicles'' that Plato was born in the first year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad (427 BC), on the seventh day of the month [[Thargelion]]; according to this tradition the god [[Apollo]] was born this day.&lt;ref name="LaII"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', II&lt;/ref&gt; According to another biographer of him, [[Neanthes of Cyzicus|Neanthes]], Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death.&lt;ref name="LaII" /&gt; If we accept Neanthes' version, Plato was younger than [[Isocrates]] by six years, and therefore he was born in the second year of the 87th [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympiad]], the year [[Pericles]] died (429 BC).{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=32}} According to the ''[[Suda]],'' Plato was born in [[Aegina]] in the 88th Olympiad amid the preliminaries of the [[Peloponnesian war]], and he lived 82 years.&lt;ref name="Suda"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Suda}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Thomas Browne]] also believes that Plato was born in the 88th Olympiad.{{sfn|Browne|1672}} [[Renaissance]] [[Platonist]]s celebrated Plato's birth on November 7.{{sfn|Nails|2006|p=1}} [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] estimates that Plato was born when Diotimos was [[archon#Ancient Greece|archon eponymous]], namely between July 29, 428 BC and July 24, 427 BC.{{sfn|Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|2005|p=46}} Greek philologist Ioannis Kalitsounakis believes that the philosopher was born on May 26 or 27, 427 BC, while [[Jonathan Barnes]] regards 428 BC as year of Plato's birth.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedic Dictionary The Helios Volume V (in Greek)|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her part, [[Debra Nails]] asserts that the philosopher was born in 424/423 BC.{{sfn|Nails|2006|p=1}} According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] Plato died at the age of 81 on the same day he was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Epistulae, VI, 58, 31: ''natali suo decessit et annum umum atque octogensimum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} Diogenes Laertius mentions that Plato "was born, according to some writers, in Aegina in the house of Phidiades the son of Thales". Diogenes mentions as one of his sources the ''Universal History'' of [[Favorinus]]. According to Favorinus, Ariston, Plato's family, and his family were sent by Athens to settle as [[cleruchy|cleruch]]s (colonists retaining their Athenian citizenship), on the island of Aegina, from which they were expelled by the Spartans after Plato's birth there.&lt;ref name="LaIII"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Plato'', III&lt;/ref&gt; Nails points out, however, that there is no record of any Spartan expulsion of Athenians from Aegina between 431‚Äì411 BC.{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=54}} On the other hand, at the [[Peace of Nicias]], Aegina was silently left under Athens' control, and it was not until the summer of 411 that the Spartans overran the island.&lt;ref name="Th5.18.8.92"&gt;Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 5#5:18|5.18]] &lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Thucydides, [[s:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 8#8:92|8.92]]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Nails concludes that "perhaps Ariston was a cleruch, perhaps he went to Aegina in 431, and perhaps Plato was born on Aegina, but none of this enables a precise dating of Ariston's death (or Plato's birth).{{sfn|Nails|2002|p=54}} Aegina is regarded as Plato's place of birth by Suda as well.&lt;ref name="Suda" /&gt;

'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} Some Wikipedia editors use the term ''allegory'' instead of myth. This is in accordance with the practice in the specialized literature, in which it is common to find that the terms allegory and myth are used as synonyms. Nevertheless, there is a trend among modern scholars to use the term ''myth'' and avoid the term allegory, as it is considered more appropriate to modern interpretation of Plato's writings. One of the first to initiate this trend was the Oxford University professor [[John Alexander Stewart (philosopher)|John Alexander Stewart]], in his work ''The Myths of Plato''.

'''''Port Royale 3: Pirates &amp; Merchants''''' is the third installment to the [[business simulation game]] ''[[Port Royale: Gold, Power and Pirates]]'' and ''[[Port Royale 2]]''. It is set in the Caribbean during the 16th and 17th centuries. Created by [[Kalypso Media]] which founded [[Gaming Minds Studios]] in 2009 after [[Ascaron|Ascaron Entertainment]] went bankrupt, it combines a business simulator with real-time battles and towns that can be owned, built, developed or razed. This is the 1st installment of the Port Royale Series done by [[Gaming Minds Studios]].

The first preview of ''Port Royale 3'' took place during the [[Gamescom]] trade fair which was held from 17 to 21 August 2011 in Cologne, Germany.

==Story==

The protagonist is a young Spanish commoner who left Spain to explore the New World. An accident at sea casts him overboard, and he finds himself in the Caribbean city of Port Royale. His life changes forever when he meets Elena, the beautiful daughter of the Viceroy.  He has two options to win her heart: The merchant "Path of the Trader" or the pirate "Path of the Adventurer."

Path of The Trader details the economic part of the game. Elena and her father grew up from the humble town of Cayman.  Cayman had been overlooked by the major European powers and traders and struggled economically. The Trader decides to win her heart through developing the small colony into a bustling city, all while dealing with a superficial rival suitor who woos Elena with gaudy gifts instead of helping the town.

Path of the Adventurer details the combat aspect of the game.  Elena is captured by pirates hired by a young Frenchman who plans to marry her. The Adventurer ends up at war with the French in order to save Elena.

==Gameplay==
Port Royale 3 is an [[Open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended game]], so players can choose to pursue several careers. This could range from a business tycoon to a pirate. Initially, you must trade goods between Caribbean colonies to make money, but over the long term you can have substantial business interests in many Caribbean ports, and support large fighting fleets.
 
As a business tycoon, you trade with towns to gain their friendship, and can then buy building permits to establish businesses there. Ultimately, you can even come to have your own town, but this can take a very long time.  As a buccaneer (with a [[Letter of Marque]]), you can attack any of the four colonial nations in the Caribbean circa 1600; from largest to smallest: [[Spain]], [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. If you have not acquired a Letter of Marque, each nation will see you as a pirate.
 
Ships range from a small [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|Pinnace]] to a massive [[Ship of the Line]]. There are also missions you can complete for money, supplies, or improved relations. At higher levels you can also automate the game to some degree, by setting up trade routes that your trading fleets will follow from town to town.
 
Fickle politics impact the game. One year you might choose to be loyal to Spain and fight England - but a year later, might join the Dutch in their fight against the French.
 
Famous pirates of the age also make appearances. These sea wolves are likely to attack any ship or town that they please, including those that belong to the player. They usually operate from heavily fortified bases, but if you defeat them, you'll gain favor with any nation you choose.
 
Initially, you have operating constraints (how many fleets you may have and how many towns you can buy building permits in), but as you gain levels (based on net worth), you can have unlimited fleets and permits.

==Reception==
Midlife Gamer gave the game 6/10, stating "Action is not the order of the day here. Port Royale 3 is incredibly slow paced especially during the first few hours." and that "The visuals in Port Royale are a mixed bag. The in game cut scenes look really nice; sadly the same cannot be said for the trading over world map. It‚Äôs nowhere near as pleasing to the eye as other parts of the game so much so to the point that it looks like you are playing a much older game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Port Royale 3 Review|url=http://www.midlifegamer.net/reviews/2012/11/port-royale-3-review.html|publisher=Midlife Gamer|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamespot rated the title 5/10, noting that although it looked good and played smoothly, despite there being plenty to do in the game none of it was much fun.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/port-royale-3-pirates-and-merchants-review/1900-6376561/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2997">'''Problem books''' are [[textbooks]], usually at advanced undergraduate or post-graduate level, in which the material is organized as a series of problems, each with a complete solution given.  Problem books are distinct from [[workbook]]s in that the problems are designed as a primary means of teaching, not merely for practice on material learned elsewhere.  Problem books are found most often in the mathematical and physical sciences; they have a strong tradition within the Russian educational system.&lt;ref name=cahn&gt; Sidney B. Cahn and Boris E. Nadgorny (1994) ''A Guide to Physics Problems'', Plenum, vol. 2, p. vii (Preface).&lt;/ref&gt;

At some American universities, problem books are associated with departmental preliminary or candidacy examinations for the [[Doctor of philosophy|Ph.D. degree]].  Such books may exemplify decades of actual examinations and, when published, are studied by graduate students at other institutions.&lt;ref name=cahn/&gt;  Other problem books are specific to graduate fields of study. While certain problem books are collected, written, or edited by worthy but little-known toilers, others are done by renowned scholars and researchers.

The [[casebook]] for law and other non-technical fields can provide a similar function.

'''Quiz Bowl''' ('''quizbowl''',&lt;ref name="What is Quizbowl"/&gt; '''scholar bowl, scholastic bowl''', '''academic bowl''', '''academic team''', etc.) is a [[quiz]]-based competition that tests players on [[Outline of academic disciplines|a wide variety of academic subjects]]. Standardized quiz bowl formats are played by [[Primary school|lower school]], [[middle school]], [[Secondary school|high school]], and [[university]] students throughout the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[Asia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The game is typically played with a lockout buzzer system&lt;ref name="What is Quizbowl"/&gt; between at least two teams, usually consisting of four or five players each. Players are read questions and try to [[Score (game)|score points]] for their team by buzzing first and responding with the correct answer.

Quiz Bowl is most commonly played in a toss-up/bonus format, which consists of a series of two different types of questions. Other formats, particularly in local competitions, may deviate from the above rules.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pace-nsc.org/concise-rules-of-tossupbonus-quizbowl/|title=Concise Rules of Tossup/Bonus Quizbowl|website=Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence|last=Pinyan|first=Jon|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Most forms of modern quiz bowls are modeled after [[game show]]s.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2012/05/quiz_bowl_is_it_the_ultimate_test_of_smarts_or_an_overblown_game_of_trivial_pursuit_.single.html|title=The Super Bowl of the Mind|first=Alan|last=Siegel|date=May 3, 2012|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[College Bowl]]'', which was created by Don Reid as a [[USO]] activity for US service men during [[World War II]], was an influential early quiz bowl program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Your Starter for Ten: 50 Years of University Challenge |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01m49vh |series=Archive on 4 |first1=David |last1=Taylor |first2=Colin |last2=McNulty |network=BBC Radio 4 | date=August  2012 |time=4:40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Robert Earle Interview|last =Earl|first =Robert|interviewer=|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z06hVsIyJ1k#t=1221|work = TV Legends|date = September 21, 2010|accessdate = September 6, 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as "The College Quiz Bowl," it started on radio in 1953 and then aired on national television from 1959 to 1970.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/04/education/total-recall.html?pagewanted=all|title=Total Recall |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=April 4, 1999|accessdate=September 9, 2009|first=Bruce|last=Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, many other quiz bowl-like competitions were also created. [[Delco Hi-Q]] began in 1948 as a radio quiz competition sponsored by the [[Scott Paper Company]] for high school students in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]]. It claims to be the oldest continuously running student quiz contest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.delcohiq.org/|title=Delaware County Hi-Q|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[It's Academic]]'' televised [[student quiz show]] program has been run for high school teams in the [[Washington, D.C. metropolitan area]] since 1961 and is recognized by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the longest-running quiz program in television history.&lt;ref name="It's Academic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itsacademicquizshow.com/history/|title=History of It's Academic|website=It's Academic - The Official Website|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''It's Academic'' has been spun off in many other US media markets and has inspired many other televised high school competitions.&lt;ref name="It's Academic"/&gt;

In 1977, College Bowl was revived as an activity on college campuses by College Bowl Company Inc. (CBCI).&lt;ref name="gameshownewsnet1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gameshownewsnet.com/blockparty/062408.html|title=Hot Fun in the Summertime... on TV, That Is|publisher=''Game Show News Net''|date=June 24, 2008|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1990, the [[Academic Competition Federation]] (ACF) was founded as the first major alternative to The College Bowl Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jennings|first=Ken|title=Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs |publisher=Villard|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-6445-8}}, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; [[NAQT|National Academic Quiz Tournaments]] (NAQT) was founded in 1996 and currently organizes national competitions at all levels in the United States and supplies tournament questions for grade school and college teams across North America and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2009/02/17/keeping_their_eyes_on_the_bowl/?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed5|title=Keeping their eyes on the bowl|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|date=February 17, 2009|accessdate=September 9, 2009|first=Joseph P.|last=Kahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brainiac"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jennings|first=Ken|title=Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs |publisher=Villard|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-6445-8}}, p.29-48&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the College Bowl program abruptly ended, although the company itself continues to operate the [[Honda Campus All-Star Challenge]] (HCASC) for [[historically black colleges and universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hcasc.com/contactcbc.asp|title=HCASC - Contact Us|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Quiz bowl.jpg|thumb|400px|A quiz bowl game at the [[University of Delaware]]]]

During a quiz bowl game, two or more teams of usually up to four or five players are read questions by a moderator.&lt;ref name="What is Quizbowl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2009/02/17/college_quiz_bowl_basics/|title=College Quiz Bowl basics |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|date=February 17, 2009|accessdate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most forms of quiz bowl, there are two basic types of questions: toss-ups and bonuses.&lt;ref name="What is Quizbowl"/&gt; Toss-ups are questions that any individual player can attempt to answer, and players are generally not allowed to confer with each other.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt; Each player usually has a signaling device, also called a buzzer, to signal in at any time during the question to give an answer.&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt; If the answer given is incorrect, then no other member of that team may give an answer. If a toss-up is successfully answered, the correctly answering team is given an opportunity to answer a bonus.&lt;ref name="What is Quizbowl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/|title=What Is Quizbowl?

Match length is determined by either a game clock or the number of questions in a packet.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAQT rules"/&gt; In most formats, a game ends once the moderator has finished reading every question in a packet.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt; Tie-breaking procedures may include reading extra toss-ups until the tie is broken or sudden-death toss-ups.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAQT rules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naqt.com/rules.html|title=Official NAQT Rules|website=National Academic Quiz Tournaments|year=2010|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiz bowl tests players in a variety of [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic subjects]] including [[literature]], [[Natural science|science]], [[history]], and [[fine art]]s.&lt;ref name="college distro"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naqt.com/college/distribution.jsp|title=College Distribution|website=National Academic Quiz Tournaments|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some quiz bowl events may feature small amounts of [[popular culture]] content like [[sport]]s, [[popular music]], and other non-academic [[general knowledge]] subjects, although their inclusion is generally kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name="NAC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qunlimited.com/na296.htm|title=National Academic Championship|website=Questions Unlimited|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsapq.com/philosophy|title=Our Quizbowl Philosophy|website=High School Academic Pyramid Questions (HSAPQ)|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most quiz bowl competitions, players and coaches may protest the moderator's decision if they believe their answer was incorrectly rejected, or an opponent's answer was incorrectly accepted.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt;

Two common types of toss-ups include buzzer-beaters and pyramidal tossups. Buzzer-beaters (also known as speed check or quick-recall questions) are relatively short, rarely more than two sentences long, and contain few clues.&lt;ref name="0809IHSAp5"&gt;{{cite book| title=IHSA Scholastic Bowl Terms and Conditions|publisher=Illinois High School Association (IHSA)|year=2008|location=Bloomington, IL|page=5|url=http://www.ihsa.org/activity/scb/2008-09/t-and-cs.pdf|quote=Buzzer-beater questions that virtually any team can be expected to answer after hearing only a few words are discouraged.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley |first=David |title=Beta Tournaments Debut |journal=Scholastic Visions |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=11 |publisher=Illinois Scholastic Bowl Coaches Association (IHSSBCA) |location=Evanston, IL |date=September 2000 |url=http://www.ihssbca.org/schovisions/sv6_1.pdf |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |quote=... similar to the format used at the NAA‚Äôs National Academic Championship tournaments.

Pyramidal or pyramid-style tossups include multiple clues and are written so that each question starts with more difficult clues and moves toward easier clues.&lt;ref name="What is Quizbowl"/&gt; This way the player with the most knowledge of the subject being asked about has the most opportunity to answer first.&lt;ref name="0809IHSAp5II"&gt;{{cite book| title=IHSA Scholastic Bowl Terms and Conditions|publisher=Illinois High School Association (IHSA)|year=2013| location=Bloomington, IL|page=6|url=http://www.ihsa.org/documents/scb/2013-14/t-and-cs.pdf|quote=For non-computational toss-ups, the preferred style is multi-clue, starting with a more challenging clue and ending with a clue that most teams should reasonably be expected to answer correctly.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sept2009 SV Q Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vinokurov|first=Jerry|editor=Greenthal, Jonah|title=How to Write Questions|journal=Scholastic Visions|volume=15|issue=1|pages=16‚Äì19|publisher=Illinois High School Scholastic Bowl Coaches Association|location=Evanston, IL|date=September 2009|url=http://www.ihssbca.org/gotoschobowlfest.pdf|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sept2009 Good Q Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Greg|title=What's a Good Quizbowl Question?|journal=Scholastic Visions|volume=15|issue=1|pages=20‚Äì21|publisher=Illinois High School Scholastic Bowl Coaches Association|location=Evanston, IL|date=September 2009|url=http://www.ihssbca.org/gotoschobowlfest.pdf|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyramidal toss-ups are considered standard for college quiz bowl.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="0809IHSAp5II"/&gt;

In most formats, correctly answering a toss-up earns a team 10 points.&lt;ref name="smu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smudailycampus.com/media/storage/paper949/news/2005/02/04/News/Quiz-Competition.Decided-2275852.shtml |title=Quiz competition decided |publisher=''SMU Daily Campus'' |date=February 4, 2005 |accessdate=September 10, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extra points, usually for a total of 15 or 20 points, may be awarded if a question is answered prior to a certain clue-providing keyword in the question, an action known as "powering".&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt; Answering a tossup incorrectly is called "negging", and may incur a 5-point penalty for a team.&lt;ref name="NAQT rules"/&gt; After a neg occurs, the moderator continues reading the rest of the question for the other team.&lt;ref name="NAQT rules"/&gt; There are usually no further penalties after one team has already negged.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt;

=== Bonuses ===
{{Quote box|right|fontsize=75%|title=A bonus question on amino acids
|quote =

Bonuses usually have multiple parts that are related by some common thread and may or may not be related to corresponding tossup. A team is usually rewarded with 10 points upon correctly answering each bonus part. Usually, only the team that answered the tossup correctly can answer the bonus questions, though some formats allow the opposing team to answer certain parts of the bonus not correctly answered by the team in control of the bonus, a gameplay element known as a "bounceback" or "rebound".&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt; Less-used types of bonus questions include list bonuses, which require players to give their answers from a requested list, and "30-20-10" bonuses, which give a number of discrete clues for a single answer in order of decreasing difficulty, with more points being awarded for giving the correct answer on an earlier clue. The 30-20-10 bonus was officially banned from ACF in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACF Packet Submission Guidelines|url=http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packetsub.php|website=Academic Competition Federation|accessdate=June 30, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045731/http://www.acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packetsub.php|archivedate=September 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NAQT in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: 2009 NAQT HSNCT |url=http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=134573#p134573|first=Jeff|last=Hoppes|website=hsquizbowl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variations ===
Several variations on the game of quiz bowl exist that affect question structure and content, rules of play, and round format.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt; One standardized format is the pyramidal tossup/bonus format, which is used in ACF (or mACF) and NAQT competitions.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naqt.com/naqt-style.html|title=NAQT-Style Events|website=National Academic Quiz Tournaments|accessdate=July 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015040249/http://www.naqt.com/naqt-style.html|archive-date=October 15, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACF/mACF tossups are written in pyramidal style and are generally much longer than College Bowl and NAQT questions. It has a rigorous emphasis on academics, with very little popular culture.&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2014}} Games are usually untimed and last until a total of 20 tossups are read.&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt; NAQT is another common variation on the tossup/bonus format that balances academic rigor with a wider variety of subjects, including popular culture and an increased amount of [[current events]] and [[geography]] content.&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="college distro"/&gt; Unlike many mACF events, most questions used in this format are written and sold by NAQT themselves.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} NAQT also uses powers in their tossups, which reward players with 15 points instead of 10 for a tossup answered before a predetermined point.&lt;ref name="NAQT rules"/&gt;&lt;!-- mACF has powers sometimes --&gt; Games played on NAQT rules consist of two nine-minute halves and a total of 24 tossups.&lt;ref name="PACE rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UoC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/97/970128.quizbowl.shtml|title=University of Chicago Quiz Bowl Team Beats Harvard to Win the First Annual National Academic Quiz Tournament|publisher=''[[University of Chicago]] News Office''|date=January 28, 1997|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; NAQT tossups are typically shorter than most other pyramidal tossups because of a character limit enforced on the questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naqt.com/application-advice.html|title=Advice for Prospective Writers|website=NAQT|accessdate=March 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110414/https://www.naqt.com/application-advice.html|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format used for the now-defunct College Bowl tournament uses comparatively shorter questions.&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt; Gameplay is relatively quick as it is played in eight-minute halves, to a usual total of 22‚Äì24 tossups read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegebowl.com/pub/gamerules.pdf|title=Game Rules|website=College Bowl|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honda Campus All Star Challenge and ''University Challenge'' use similar formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collegebowl.com/format.asp|title=The Original College Bowl Format|website=College Bowl|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hcasc.com/pub/gamerules.pdf|title=Game Rules|website=HONDA CAMPUS ALL‚ÄêSTAR CHALLENGE|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/show_rules.html|title=The rules of University Challenge|website=Sean Blanchflower|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matches played at the National Academic Championship and its affiliated tournaments are split into four quarters, with differing styles of gameplay in each phase.&lt;ref name="Riley"/&gt; Individual tournaments may use worksheet quizzes, lightning rounds, or tossups without accompanying bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~asca/documents/Rules2015_001.doc|title=Rules|date=January 2015|website=Alabama Scholastic Competition Association|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation ===
Since questions are generally derived from an unofficial canon of topics, players commonly review question content from older competitions to prepare for upcoming tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moqba.org/tips.php|title=Tips for Improving|last=Dees|first=Charles|website=Missouri Quizbowl Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Improve as a Player"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naqt.com/HowTo/improve-as-a-player.html|title=How to Improve as a Player|website=National Academic Quiz Tournaments|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quizbowl lexicon"/&gt; Several websites exist in this vein, the most commonly used being Quinterest, a navigable database of past quiz bowl tournaments, and Protobowl, a multiplayer real-time quiz bowl simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quinterest.org/|title=Quinterest: A Searchable Quiz Bowl Database|website=www.quinterest.org|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://protobowl.com/|title=Protobowl Home|website=protobowl.com|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; NAQT also sells lists of topics that are frequently asked about in their questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naqt.com/frequency-lists.html|title=Frequency Lists|publisher=National Academic Quiz Tournaments|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players also research and write questions to prepare for quiz bowl.

== Competitions ==
Quiz bowl is primarily played at single-day tournaments.&lt;ref name="What is Quizbowl"/&gt; Some events have eligibility rules that dictate who may participate, such as allowing only freshman and sophomore players or excluding graduate students from playing.&lt;ref name="ACF rules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/official-acf-rules/|title=Official ACF Rules|website=Academic Competition Federation|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most tournaments allow multiple teams from a single school to compete.

Some schools hold [[intramural]] tournaments where any team formed from students can play.&lt;ref name="College Quiz Bowl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naqt.com/college/college-quiz-bowl.html|title=College Quiz Bowl|website=National Academic Quiz Tournaments|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; High school-level quiz bowl is occasionally played over an extended period of time schools within a league or preexisting [[athletic conference]] or even in single matches against other schools.&lt;ref name="High School Quiz Bowl"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Please comment on the talk page before adding more examples on the next two paragraphs --&gt;

There are several collegiate-level national championship tournaments for which teams usually qualify through regional competitions. These tournaments include:
*NAQT's [[NAQT#At the college level|Intercollegiate Championship Tournament]] (ICT)
*NAQT's [[NAQT#Community colleges|Community College Championship Tournament]] (CCCT)
*ACF Nationals
*[[Honda Campus All-Star Challenge]] (HCASC)

Several national competitions are conducted in the United States every year for high school students. Compared to at the college level, there are usually many more tournaments at which teams can qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naqt.com/hsnct/2014/details.html|title=2014 HSNCT details|website=National Academic Quiz Tournaments|accessdate=June 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718123942/http://www.naqt.com/hsnct/2014/details.html|archive-date=July 18, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pace-nsc.org/2014-nsc-affiliated-tournaments/|title=2014 NSC: Affiliated Tournaments|website=Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

The following high school tournaments are for single all-star teams from each US state or other political subdivision:
* [[National All-Star Academic Tournament]] (NASAT)
* [[National Tournament of Academic Excellence]] (NTAE) (formerly known as the Panasonic Academic Challenge)

=== Educational value ===
Some proponents of reform seek to increase the educational value and fairness of quiz bowl, primarily by using pyramidal questions.&lt;ref name="Quizbowl lexicon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pace-nsc.org/pace-quizbowl-lexicon/|title=Quizbowl lexicon|first=Stephen|last=Eltinge|website=Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norcalquizbowl.org/?page_id=18|title=What is quiz bowl|website=Northern California Quiz Bowl Alliance|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many competitions at grade school levels are criticized for their use of speed-check questions, which encourage participants to rely more on their ability to buzz in quickly than on knowledge of the subjects tested.&lt;ref name="Quizbowl lexicon"/&gt; Some tournaments such as College Bowl are criticized for being insufficiently academic, including superfluous clues in their questions, and for recycling questions from previous years.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt; The use of "hoses", misleading clues that discourage players from buzzing in too early, is also considered a mark of "bad" quiz bowl.&lt;ref name="brainiac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quizbowl lexicon"/&gt; The use of mathematical computation problems in tossups is criticized by some for rewarding fast problem solving skills over conceptual knowledge and being non-pyramidal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsapq.com/math|title=Math Calculation Tossups|website=High School Academic Pyramid Questions (HSAPQ)|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyramidal questions are sometimes criticized for containing obscure information and being unsuitable for television.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|title=2009 Interview with Chip Beall|last=Beall|first=Chip|interviewer=Matt Laird|url=http://www.aegisquestions.com/matt/chipinterview.mp3|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''College Bowl'' was broadcast on NBC radio from 1953 to 1955. The program moved to television as ''General Electric College Bowl'' and was broadcast from 1959 to 1970, first on [[CBS]] and later on [[NBC]]. ''College Bowl'' would return to [[CBS Radio|CBS radio]] from 1979 to 1982, and HCASC was broadcast on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] from 1990 to 1995. The ''Texaco Star National Academic Championship'' ran from 1989 to 1991 on [[Discovery Channel]] and was hosted by [[Chip Beall]] and [[Mark L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2527">A '''registrar''' is an official in an academic institution (consisting of a [[college]], [[university]], or [[secondary school]]) who handles student records.

==Duties and function==
Typically, a registrar processes registration requests, schedules classes and maintains class lists, enforces the rules for entering or leaving classes, and keeps a permanent record of grades and marks. In institutions with selective admission requirements, a student only begins to be in connection with the registrar's official actions after admission.&lt;ref&gt; [http://saas.byu.edu/registrar/index.php Description of BYU's registrar's offices duties]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the term registrar is usually used for the head of the university's administration. The role is usually combined with that of secretary of the university's governing bodies and in these cases, the full title will often be "registrar and secretary" (or "secretary and registrar") to reflect these dual roles. The [[University of Cambridge]] in [[England]] uses the archaic spelling of "[[Registrary]]" for this office.

In [[Canada]], the registrar is an administrative position, usually responsible for admissions, records and registration, academic scheduling, front line service and support, academic scheduling, strategic enrollment data management and analysis, academic policy, and graduation (sometimes known as convocation).&lt;ref&gt; [http://arucc.ca/uploads/documents/Canadian_Registrars_Reporting_Relationships_and_Responsibilities.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various grades of professional academic-related staff perform senior administrative and managerial roles in such universities on behalf of the registrar or head of department and head subsections of the administration.  Titles afforded to such staff include academic registrar, assistant registrar, senior assistant registrar and principal assistant registrar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">The '''Facultad de Ciencias Pol√≠ticas y Sociales''' ('''FCPyS''', ''Faculty of Political and Social Sciences'') is a faculty within [[Mexico]]'s [[Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico]] (UNAM), responsible for directing research and teaching programs in the fields of [[political science]] and [[social science]]. It was first established in 1951 as the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Pol√≠ticas y Sociales (ENCPyS, ''National School of Political and Social Sciences''), before its conversion to full [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] status from 26 January 1968. FCPyS offers five academic degrees at the ''[[Licenciatura#Mexico|Licenciatura]]'' (undergraduate) level, in [[public administration]], [[Communication studies]], political science, [[international relations]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. At a postgraduate level FCPyS offers ''Maestr√≠as'' ([[Master's degree]]s) in five areas of study, and a ''Doctorado'' ([[doctorate]]) in political and social science that is oriented to one of five specialities. FCPyS also operates and has responsibility for a number of specialised semi-autonomous [[research institution]]s, such as the [[Centro de Relaciones Internacionales]] (CRI).

[[File:Newton portrait with apple tree.svg|thumb|right|[[Isaac newton#Apple incident|Isaac Newton and an apple tree]] form the popular, mythical account of his formulation of the theory of universal gravitation.]] 
A '''scientific myth'''  is a [[myth]] about [[science]].  For example, scientific discoveries are often presented in a mythological way with a theory being presented as a dramatic flash of insight by a heroic individual rather than as the result of sustained experiment and reasoning.  For example, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] is commonly presented as the result of an apple falling upon his head.  Newton's observation of an apple falling did indeed play a part in starting him thinking about the problem but it took him about twenty years to fully develop the theory and so the story of the apple has been described as a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Scott Berkun |date=27 August 2010 |title=The Myths of Innovation |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |page=4 |isbn=978-1-4493-8962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which this occurs and is problematic is debatable.  [[History of science|Scientific historian]] Douglas Allchin suggests that mythical accounts are misleading because they present the results as handed down by [[authority figure]]s and understate the importance of error and its resolution by the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Scientific myth-conceptions |author=Douglas Allchin |date=20 March 2003 |doi=10.1002/sce.10055 |journal=Science Education |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=329‚Äì351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In responding to this, Westerlund and Fairbanks agreed that romantic accounts of science tend to distort its nature but, in the case of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]'s discovery of the rules of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]], they argue that Allchin's criticism of Mendel's role and reasoning is over-stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Gregor Mendel and "myth-conceptions" |doi=10.1002/sce.20007 |author=Julie Westerlund, Daniel Fairbanks |date=7 June 2004 |journal=Science Education |volume=88 |issue=5 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20007/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary education in Taiwan''' refers to the Taiwanese education system in ''junior high school'' (year 7-9) and ''senior high school'' (year 10-12). Junior high school education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] in Taiwan. Children and youths aged 6 to 15 are required to receive nine years of compulsory education.&lt;ref name="ÂúãÊ∞ëÊïôËÇ≤Ê≥ï"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edu.law.moe.gov.tw/LawContentDetails.aspx?id=FL008927&amp;KeyWordHL=&amp;StyleType=1|script-title=zh:„ÄäÂúãÊ∞ëÊïôËÇ≤Ê≥ï„Äã|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ®]]|language=zh|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; By law, every pupil who completed his or her primary education must attend a junior high school for at least three years, with exemptions to [[homeschooling]] and severe disorder or disabilities. Legal guardians of offenders may be subjected to [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] up to [[NT$]]300, where penalties may be repeatedly imposed until offenders return to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edu.law.moe.gov.tw/LawContentDetails.aspx?id=FL008928&amp;KeyWordHL=&amp;StyleType=1|script-title=zh:„ÄäÂº∑Ëø´ÂÖ•Â≠∏Ê¢ù‰æã„ÄãÁ¨¨‰πùÊ¢ù|publisher=‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ®|language=zh|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Article 2 of ''[[s:Translation:Regulation for the exchange rate between New Taiwan Dollars and the fiat currency in the laws of the Republic of China|Regulation for the exchange rate between New Taiwan Dollars and the fiat currency in the laws of the Republic of China]]'' reads, "Wherever the laws and regulations in force specifies the amount of monies in the currency unit of Yuan (Âúì), Silver Yuan, or Yuan (ÂÖÉ), that is three times the New Taiwan Dollar." Therefore the highest fine of, e.g. "100 yuan", stated in all laws of the [[Republic of China]], is equivalent to [[NT$]]300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Empire of Japan===
The history of secondary education in Taiwan dates back to the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. In 1896, Taiwan's colonial government implemented the policy of Direct Schools System, which was the first modern schooling system with reference to the Western system in the [[history of education in Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=E. Patricia Tsurumi|title=''Japanese Colonial Education in Taiwan, 1895-1945''|publisher=Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=1977|pages=13‚Äì78|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan later made three revisions to the educational policy in Taiwan and made use of education to promote [[militarism]] and loyalty to the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref name="ÊûóËåÇÁîü"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Lin Mosei|ÊûóËåÇÁîü]]|script-title=zh:Êó•Êú¨Áµ±Ê≤ª‰∏ãËá∫ÁÅ£ÁöÑÂ≠∏Ê†°ÊïôËÇ≤ÔºöÂÖ∂ÁôºÂ±ïÂèäÊúâÈóúÊñáÂåñ‰πãÊ≠∑Âè≤ÂàÜÊûêËàáÊé¢Ë®é|publisher=Êñ∞Ëá™ÁÑ∂‰∏ªÁæ©|location=[[New Taipei City|Êñ∞ÂåóÂ∏Ç]]|year=2000|isbn=9576964210|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of China===
In August 1945, the [[Pacific War]] ended and Taiwan was handed over to the [[Nationalist Government (China)|Nationalist Government]] of the [[Republic of China]]. The current secondary education system in Taiwan was formed in 1968, in which the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education of the Republic of China]] implemented nine years of compulsory education to enhance the level of knowledge of Taiwanese.&lt;ref name="ÂΩ≠ÁÖ•Âãù"&gt;{{Cite book|author=ÂΩ≠ÁÖ•Âãù|script-title=zh:Âè∞ÁÅ£ÊïôËÇ≤Âè≤|publisher=È∫óÊñáÊñáÂåñ|location=[[Kaohsiung|È´òÈõÑÂ∏Ç]]|year=2009|isbn=9789577483287|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of studies in a junior high school, students may opt to pursue further studies or enter workforce. For those pursuing further studies, 2014 graduates could take the [[Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students|Comprehensive Assessment Program]] (Âúã‰∏≠ÊïôËÇ≤ÊúÉËÄÉ) or the Special Entrance Examination (ÁâπËâ≤ÊãõÁîüËÄÉË©¶).

Several educational reforms were vastly promoted, which included the extension and normalization of education and independent learning. The calls for extension of years of education started in 1983, and came to a consensus in 2003. It was announced in 2011 that the Twelve Years of Basic Education (ÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥ÂúãÊ∞ëÂü∫Êú¨ÊïôËÇ≤) will be implemented three years later, where education in Taiwan will be extended from nine years to twelve years, while the current promotion system to a senior high school will be abolished. This causes a fundamental impact on Secondary education in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="ÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥ÂúãÊïô"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://140.111.34.179/about01_origin.php|script-title=zh:ÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥ÂúãÊ∞ëÂü∫Êú¨ÊïôËÇ≤Êé®ÂãïÁ∑£Ëµ∑|publisher=‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ®|language=zh|accessdate=2011-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129150641/http://140.111.34.179/about01_origin.php|archivedate=2012-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period==
Taiwan uses the [[Minguo calendar]] system. A school year consists of two semesters, with the fall semester begins in early September every year and runs through late January or early February. The spring semester begins in mid February and ends in early June. Semester breaks typically last for around two or three weeks surrounding the Spring Festival and Lunar New Year. Statistics on education are according to each [[academic year]], while expenditures according to each [[fiscal year]].&lt;ref name="wenr.wes.org"&gt;http://wenr.wes.org/2010/05/wenr-may-2010-feature/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects and medium of instruction==
In junior high schools, subjects covered including literature, mathematics, English, science, technology, social studies, home economics and craft, arts and physical education. The language used in both junior and senior high schools is Mandarin at all levels. However, English classes are mandatory throughout the whole secondary education period.&lt;ref name="wenr.wes.org"/&gt;

According to the ''Educational Statistics of the Republic of China'' (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à), Taiwan has 932 junior high schools in total, 844,884 students and 880 full-time teachers in those schools, as of the 101st academic year (August 2012 to July 2013). There has been a steep increase in those numbers since the implementation of nine years of compulsory education, which reflects the growth and changes in the junior high school education in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=ÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ®Áµ±Ë®àËôï|script-title=zh:2010Âπ¥ÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à|journal=‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à|publisher=‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ®|location=[[Ëá∫ÂåóÂ∏Ç]]|year=2010|issn=0578-1361|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For students, the proportion of the number of students dropped from 93.96% in the 39th academic year (August 1950 to July 1951) to 50.18% in the 98th academic year (August 2009 to July 2010), showing the change in the educational structure of Taiwan. Another fact worth mentioning is the change in proportion of genders. In the 39th academic year (August 1950 to July 1951), there were 40,670 boys, which nearly doubled that of the 20,412 girls. However, as of the 101st academic year (August 2012 to July 2013), the difference in the proportion of boys and girls significantly reduced, where there was 440,711 boys and 404,173 girls. This indicates that under the compulsory education policy and the rise in [[feminism]], the education conditions for girls have improved.&lt;ref name="‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à"/&gt; In addition to this, the promotion rates of students in junior high schools increased from 51.15% to 99.15% from the 39th to the 101st academic year. In other words, currently in Taiwan, almost every student can be promoted and pursue further studies.&lt;ref name="‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wes.org/ewenr/10may/feature.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
For schools, in the 39th academic year, there were only 66 junior high schools. After the implementation of compulsory education, junior high schools were set up to meet the goal of One Junior High School in Each Township (‰∏ÄÈÑâÈéÆ‰∏ÄÂúã‰∏≠). In the [[fiscal year]] of 2009, the total expenditure on education was [[NT$]]802.3 billion, which was 5.83% of the [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP).

==Aboriginal and non-Taiwanese education==
As for the [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] education, there were 72,652 aboriginal students studying in junior high schools in the 101st academic year. The first five groups in terms of student population are: [[Amis people|Amis]] (26,113), [[Atayal people|Atayal]] (13,410), [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] (12,946), [[Bunun people|Bunun]] (8,113) and [[Truku people|Truku]] (4,600). In that academic year, there were a total of 41,525 students who were new immigrants; sorted by the nationality (non-[[Nationality Law of the Republic of China|ROC national]]) of a parent, the first three countries are: [[People's Republic of China]] (16,221), [[Vietnam]] (10,690) and [[Indonesia]] (8,099), where they sum up to comprise 84.30% of the total number of new-immigrant student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=ÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ®Áµ±Ë®àËôï|script-title=zh:„ÄäÊñ∞ÁßªÊ∞ëÂ≠êÂ•≥Â∞±ËÆÄÂúã‰∏≠Â∞è‰∫∫Êï∏ÂàÜÂ∏ÉÊ¶ÇÊ≥ÅÁµ±Ë®àÔºà101Â≠∏Âπ¥Â∫¶Ôºâ„Äã|year=2013|pages=5|publisher=‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤ÈÉ®|location=Âè∞ÂåóÂ∏Ç|language=zh|accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for overseas Taiwanese, there were 206 students who returned to Taiwan to attend a junior high school in the 98th academic year (August 2009 to July 2010), mainly those residing in Indonesia (60), followed by the [[United States]] (29).&lt;ref name="‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÊïôËÇ≤Áµ±Ë®à"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11090">'''Semantic publishing''' on the [[World Wide Web|Web]], or '''[[semantic web]] publishing''', refers to publishing information on the web as documents accompanied by [[semantic markup]]. Semantic publication provides a way for computers to understand the structure and even the meaning of the published information, making information search and [[data integration]] more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attwood | first1 = T.

Although semantic publishing is not specific to the Web, it has been driven by the rising of the semantic web. In the semantic web, published information is accompanied by metadata describing the information, providing a "semantic" context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/12614/01/Semantic_Web_Revisted.pdf |title=The Semantic Web Revisited |first1=Nigel |last1=Shadbolt |first2=Tim |last2=Berners-Lee |first3=Wendy |last3=Hall |journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=96‚Äì101 |date=May‚ÄìJune 2006  |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Gradmann: [http://www.sconul.ac.uk/events/agm2011/presentations/gradmann.pdf From Catalogs to Graphs: Changing Terms for a Changing Profession]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = D.| last1 = Hull | first2 = S.| last2 = Pettifer | first3 = D.| last3 = Kell| authorlink3 = Douglas Kell| authorlink2 = Steve Pettifer| editor1-last = McEntyre| editor1-first = Johanna| title = Defrosting the digital library: bibliographic tools for the next generation web| journal = [[PLOS Computational Biology]]| volume = 4| issue = 10| pages = e1000204| date=Oct 2008 | issn = 1553-734X| pmid = 18974831| pmc = 2568856| doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000204}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although semantic publishing has the potential to change the face of [[web publishing]], acceptance depends on the emergence of compelling applications. Web sites can already be built with all contents in both [[HTML]] format and semantic format.&lt;ref&gt;
Examples are [http://www.mindswap.org/ mindswap], [http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/ UMBC ebiquity], and [http://web2express.org/openlab web2express.org open lab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106032727/http://web2express.org/openlab/ |date=2007-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RSS]]1.0, uses [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (a semantic web standard) format, although it has become less popular than RSS2.0 and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]].&lt;ref name=ufeed&gt;
Web2express.org applies RDF to various data feeds. Anyone can use their service
[http://web2express.org/ufeed/ free online service (ufeed)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011023130/http://web2express.org/ufeed/ |date=2007-10-11 }} to create and provide RDF data resources and datafeeds for products, news, events, jobs and studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semantic publishing has the potential to revolutionize [[Academic publishing|scientific publishing]]. [[Tim Berners-Lee]] predicted in 2001 that the semantic web "will likely profoundly change the very nature of how [[scientific knowledge]] is produced and shared, in ways that we can now barely imagine".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berners-Lee|Hendler|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revisiting the semantic web in 2006, he and his colleagues believed the semantic web "could bring about a revolution in how, for example, scientific content is managed throughout its life cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shadbolt|Berners-Lee|Hall|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers could directly self-publish their experiment data in "semantic" format on the web. Semantic search engines could then make these data widely available. The [[W3C]] interest group in healthcare and life sciences is exploring this idea.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLS/ScientificPublishingTaskForce self-publishing of experiment] A [http://web2express.org/demo demo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104225915/http://www.web2express.org/demo/ |date=2007-01-04 }} is available.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two approaches==
*Publish information as data objects using semantic web languages like [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]. [[Ontology (information science)|Ontology]] is usually developed for a specific information domain, which can formally represent the data in its domain. Semantic publishing of more general information like product information, news, and job openings uses so-called [[Ontology (information science)|shallow ontology]].&lt;ref name=ufeed/&gt; The SWEO Linking Open Data Project&lt;ref&gt;
[http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData W3C SWEO Linking Open Data Project]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains a list of data sources&lt;ref&gt;
[http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/DataSets list of data sources]&lt;/ref&gt; that follow this approach as well as a list of Semantic Publishing Tools.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/PublishingTools Semantic Publishing Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Express structured data in [[Markup_language|markup languages]] with [[RDFa]], embed or publish information using [[JSON-LD]], [[Turtle_(syntax)|Turtle]], [[TriG_(syntax)|TriG]] syntaxes.

The '''Senior High School Entrance Examination''', or commonly known as '''''Zhongkao''''' (‰∏≠ËÄÉ), is the academic examination held annually in the mainland of the [[People's Republic of China]] to distinguish [[junior high school]] graduates. This examination is a prerequisite for entrance into almost all education institutions at the senior high school level, such as common senior high schools, secondary skill schools, vocational high schools, technical high schools. It is usually taken by students in their last year of [[junior high school]].

Before the Senior High School Entrance Examination, every province will hold two simulation examination twice, few places even three times. The Senior High School Entrance Examination usually make out problems by province, but few provinces transmit the power of making out problems to cities. This exam is the second examination system recovered after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. It takes place in early June every year, however in few place it takes place in late June or even early July.

In 1980, the decades that just recover the exams, the [[Graduation Examination of Junior High School]] and the Senior High School Entrance Examination are the same exam. If the students failed the Senior High School Entrance Examination, then they cannot graduate from the junior high school, even if there are senior high school who want to admit them. These students will be refused by the senior high school for the reason "failure in graduation from junior high school" (Âàù‰∏≠ËÇÑ‰∏ö), that is what is commonly called ‚Äúsending back the document‚Äù (ÈÄÄÊ°£). However some places has the system of makeup exam of the Senior High School Entrance Examination. Since mid-1990s, the Graduation Examination of Junior High School becomes separated from the Senior High School Entrance Examination, but some provinces and cities such as Shanghai combined the two exams again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23306">'''Teacher leadership''' is a term used in K-12 schools for classroom educators who simultaneously take on administrative roles outside of their classrooms to assist in functions of the larger school system. Teacher leadership tasks may include but are not limited to: managing teaching, learning, and resource allocation. Teachers who engage in leadership roles are generally experienced and respected in their field which can both empower them and increase collaboration among peers.

In these types of school environments, teachers are able to make decisions based on the work they do directly with students. When a school system places the decision-making on the teachers, the action is happening one level closer to the people who are most closely impacted by the decisions (generally the students and the teachers), rather than two or more levels above at the principal, superintendent, or school board level.

The extent to which teacher leaders adopt additional roles varies in degree and description:

'''Administration leadership''' (traditional school leadership/[[educational leadership]]): &lt;br/&gt;
Administrative staff carries out the majority of the leadership duties.

'''Teacher networks''' ([[professional learning community]]/professional community/networked improvement communities/[[community of practice]]/[[distributed leadership]]): &lt;br/&gt;

All teachers collectively take on decision-making roles about curriculum and school climate. This practice is facilitated by and supported by an administrative leader.

'''Teacher leaders''' ([[instructional leadership]]/instructional coaches): &lt;br/&gt;
Some teachers take on individual leadership roles that directly impact educational practices under the leadership of a school administrator.

'''Teacher co-ops''' (teacher-powered schools/teacher-led schools/[[worker cooperative]]/professional partnerships/teacherpreneurs): &lt;br/&gt;
All teachers collectively take on leadership and administrative tasks that would traditionally be done by a principal or administrative team

[[File:Teacher leadership spectrum.png|frameless|right]]

== Research supportive of the philosophy ==

The [[National Education Association]] (NEA) (2011) describes teacher leaders as, "experienced professionals who have earned the respect of their students and colleagues and have gained a set of skills that enable them to work effectively and collaboratively with colleagues. They work closely with principals who have been trained to develop and implement effective mechanisms of support for teachers and teacher leaders."&lt;ref&gt;NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. &lt;&lt;http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/TeacherLeaderModelStandards2011.pdf&gt;&gt; p27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teacher leaders are teachers who, "want to remain closely connected to the classroom and students, but are willing to assume new responsibilities that afford them leadership opportunities in or outside the classroom while still teaching full or part-time."&lt;ref&gt;NEA. 2011.

In his book, Kolderie (2014) cites Hubbs in describing the benefits of decentralizing the authority in schools: "You just can‚Äôt beat a decentralized system. It gets closest to the level where the action really is. Education should have an advantage in moving into it, because your locations and your people are already physically dispersed."&lt;ref&gt;Kolderie, Ted. 2014. The Split Screen Strategy: Improvement + Innovation: How to Get Education Changing the Way Successful Systems Change. Beaver‚Äôs Pond Press, Edina, MN. &lt;&lt;http://www.educationevolving.org/pdf/Book-Innovation-Plus-Improvement.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential benefit of decentralizing authority is as Spillane et al. describe: "The interactions among two or more leaders in carrying out a particular task may amount to more than the sum of those leaders‚Äô practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spillane | first1 = James | last2 = Halverson | first2 = Rich | last3 = Diamond | first3 = John | year = 2004 | title = Towards a Theory of Leadership Practice: a distributed perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Curriculum Studies | volume = 36 | issue = 1| page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NEA (2011) reported that, "Research indicates that in order to increase the likelihood that Gen "Y" teachers remain in the profession, they need opportunities to participate in decision making at the school and district level; a positive and supportive school culture which fosters teamwork and effective lines of communication; professional opportunities that include collaboration and technology; in-depth feedback and support from administrators and colleagues; time set aside for regular collaboration; and fair pay and a differentiated pay structure which includes rewarding outstanding performance, acquiring new knowledge and skills, and assuming new roles and responsibilities (Behrstock &amp; Clifford, 2009)."&lt;ref&gt;NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. &lt;&lt;http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/TeacherLeaderModelStandards2011.pdf&gt;&gt; p13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolderie (2014) emphasizes, "If teachers can control what matters for student success teachers will accept accountability for student success."&lt;ref&gt;Kolderie, Ted. 2014. The Split Screen Strategy: Improvement + Innovation: How to Get Education Changing the Way Successful Systems Change. Beaver‚Äôs Pond Press, Edina, MN. &lt;&lt;http://www.educationevolving.org/pdf/Book-Innovation-Plus-Improvement.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Teacherpowered.org is a resource for this kind of work, and they note that teachers, "feel increased passion for the job and have greater ability to make the dramatic changes in schools that they determine are needed to truly improve student learning and the teaching profession."&lt;ref&gt;Teacher-Powered Schools. 2014. &lt;&lt;http://www.teacherpowered.org/about&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieberman (2000) cited Newmann and Wehlage (1995) in their search for, "an understanding of how schools developed the capacity to inspire student learning of high intellectual quality. They found that a self-conscious professional community was a salient characteristic of those schools most successful with students."&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Ann. Networks As Learning Communities Shaping The Future Of Teacher Development. Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectrum of authority==

To frame the types of work in which Teacher leaders participate, it is important to look at the roles taken on by [[Educational leadership]] more broadly. Halverson, Kelley, and Shaw (2013) identify the following domains of school leadership:

# "Focus on Learning
# Monitoring teaching and learning
# Building nested learning communities
# Acquiring and allocating resources
# Establishing a safe and effective learning environment."&lt;ref&gt;Halverson, Rich; Kelley, Carolyn. Shaw, Jim. 2013. Comprehensive Assessment of Leadership for Learning: Formative Assessment for School-Wide Improvement. Submitted as a conference paper for the 2013 Annual Conference of the University Council for Education Administration. p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles of school leadership can be placed on a spectrum in which on one end the leadership is completely owned by the administration to the opposite end in which leadership in completely owned by the teachers.

=== Administration-led (educational leadership/school administration) ===

{{for|a widespread framework overview|Educational leadership}}

=== Teacher networks ===

The structure of teacher networks, or as Kruse defines them, professional communities, includes "collective responsibility, professional control, and flexible boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, S. D., Louis, K. S., &amp; Bryk, A. S., An Emerging Framework for Analyzing School-based Professional Community. 1993. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association.
p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kruse continues to describe the day-to-day norms of a professional community, including: "reflective dialogue..., de-privatized, collective focus on student learning, collaboration, [and] shared norms and values."&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, S. D., Louis, K. S., &amp; Bryk, A. S., An Emerging Framework for Analyzing School-based Professional Community. 1993. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieberman (2000) explains that, "having a professional community differentiated those teachers who worked together to change the culture of their classrooms and their departments from those teachers who either tried new ideas in fragmented ways on their own or who blamed students for their inabilities to learn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Networks As Learning Communities Shaping The Future Of Teacher Development | url = | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 221‚Äì227 | doi=10.1177/0022487100051003010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryk/Gomez describe a type of teacher network, "a networked improvement community" as, "an intentionally formed social organization" whose "improvement goals impose specific demands on the rules and norms of participation."&lt;ref&gt;Bryk, Anthony S., Gomez, Louis M.. 2010. Getting Ideas into Action: Building Networked Improvement Communities in Education. Frontiers in Sociology of Education. Springer Publishing. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teacher leaders ===

Danielson (2006) explains, "Many schools have instituted structures in which teachers assume formal leadership roles in the school, such as master teacher, department chair, team leader, helping teacher, or mentor."&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, Charlotte. 2006. Teacher Leadership That Strengthens Professional Practice. ASCD Member Book. p18.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Teachers in leadership roles work in collaboration with principals and other school administrators by facilitating improvements in instruction and promoting practices among their peers that can lead to improved student learning outcomes. By doing so, they support school leaders in encouraging innovation and creating cultures of success in school. Teacher leadership can neither be effective nor successful without principal support, but neither can the principal maximize his or her effectiveness without harnessing the talents and expertise of teachers in leadership roles."&lt;ref&gt;NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. &lt;&lt;http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/TeacherLeaderModelStandards2011.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Teachers who serve in leadership roles may do so formally or informally. Rather than having positional authority, teachers become leaders in their schools by being respected by their peers, being continuous learners, being approachable, and using group skills and influence to improve the educational practice of their peers. They model effective practices, exercise their influence in formal and informal contexts, and support collaborative team structures within their schools."&lt;ref&gt;NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. &lt;&lt;http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/TeacherLeaderModelStandards2011.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Teacher Leader Model Standards consist of seven domains describing the many dimensions of teacher leadership:

* Domain I: Fostering a Collaborative Culture to Support Educator Development and Student Learning 
* Domain II: Accessing and Using Research to Improve Practice and Student Learning 
* Domain III: Promoting Professional Learning for Continuous Improvement 
* Domain IV: Facilitating Improvements in Instruction and Student Learning 
* Domain V: Promoting the Use of Assessments and Data for School and District Improvement 
* Domain VI: Improving Outreach and Collaboration with Families and Community Domain VII: Advocating for Student Learning and the Profession."&lt;ref&gt;NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. &lt;&lt;http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/TeacherLeaderModelStandards2011.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

One way in which teachers serve in these leadership or instructional coaching roles is to do instructional rounds in their school. Rounds consist of teachers spending time observing in one another‚Äôs classrooms and then meeting to discuss the findings. City et al. describe the goals of rounds to: "1. Build skills of network members by coming to a common understanding of effective practice and how to support it. 2. Support instructional improvement at the host site (school or district) by sharing what the network learns and by building skills at the local level."&lt;ref&gt;City, Elizabeth A., Elmore, Richard F., Fiarman, Sarah E., Teitel. Lee. 2009. Instructional Rounds in Education: A Network Approach To Improving Teaching And Learning. HARVARD EDUCATION PRESS CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some additional forms of teacher or instructional leadership may include: problem-solving teams, peer mentoring, and coaching, which support of the work of the administration without replacing it.

=== Teacher co-ops ===

The Teacher Powered Schools organization explains this teacher co-op or teacher-powered model as: "1. collaboratively designed and implemented by teachers. 2. teachers having collective autonomy to make the decisions influencing the success of a school, project, or professional endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;Teacher-Powered Schools. 2014. &lt;&lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teacherpowered.org/files/TPS-Research-Infographic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824054218/http://www.teacherpowered.org/files/TPS-Research-Infographic.pdf |archivedate=2015-08-24 |df= }}&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these teacher co-ops or professional partnerships, Kolderie explains, "The authority pyramid inverts, and school moves to the dual-leader model typical of partnerships in most areas. (Think of the managing partner and the administrator of a law firm, or the chief of the medical staff and the executive of a hospital.)."&lt;ref&gt;Kolderie, Ted. 2014. The Split Screen Strategy: Improvement + Innovation: How to Get Education Changing the Way Successful Systems Change. Beaver‚Äôs Pond Press, Edina, MN. &lt;&lt;http://www.educationevolving.org/pdf/Book-Innovation-Plus-Improvement.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of a teacher co-op could vary from, "...handling the whole school [which] involves the teachers in the administration and management of the school as well as in the learning. Alternatively, teachers in a large secondary school‚Äîwhile continuing to be district employees‚Äîcould form a partnership to handle the math department, the science department or the English department. They could then focus on learning; the principal would handle the school administration. A partnership of teachers might also organize to take responsibility for a program serving several schools across a district; Montessori, for example."&lt;ref&gt;Kolderie, Ted. 2014. The Split Screen Strategy: Improvement + Innovation: How to Get Education Changing the Way Successful Systems Change. Beaver‚Äôs Pond Press, Edina, MN. &lt;&lt;http://www.educationevolving.org/pdf/Book-Innovation-Plus-Improvement.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors of implementation ==

Lieberman (2000) found that, "Networks that last, that hold their members, and continue to attract new teachers understand that they must account for the daily pressures of teaching, even as they seek to advance larger ideals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Networks As Learning Communities Shaping The Future Of Teacher Development | url = | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 221‚Äì227 | doi=10.1177/0022487100051003010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be successful, teacher leadership should be implemented strategically. "Among the issues that will need to be considered are:

# resources (new or reallocated) necessary to provide professional development to teachers and administrators,  
# availability of time within schools to create a collaborative work environment,  
# re-structuring of current teacher compensation systems,  
# the development of cost-efficient, equitable, and streamlined systems to recognize and reward teachers serving in leadership roles,  
# assessing the effectiveness of various teacher leadership models, and  
# replicating and scaling-up effective teacher leadership practices."&lt;ref&gt;NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. &lt;&lt;http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/TeacherLeaderModelStandards2011.pdf&gt;&gt; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teacher leadership can be initiated from within the staff itself, however, it is important that the teachers have administrative support as well as peer-to-peer support to carry out their tasks. Halverson, Kelley, and Shaw (2013) reference: "Louis, Kruse and Bryk (1995) conclude that the most important task for school leaders is to create meaningful opportunities for teachers across the school to work together on pressing issues of common interest."&lt;ref&gt;Halverson, Rich; Kelley, Carolyn. Shaw, Jim. 2013. Comprehensive Assessment of Leadership for Learning: Formative Assessment for School-Wide Improvement. Submitted as a conference paper for the 2013 Annual Conference of the University Council for Education Administration. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kruse (1993) outlines the conditions that support teacher leadership in the specific case of a professional community:

"Structural conditions
* Time to meet 
* Physical proximity 
* Interdependent teaching roles 
* Communication structures 
* Teacher empowerment and school autonomy 
Social and human resources
* Openness to improvement
* Trust and respect
* Cognitive skills base
* Supportive leadership 
* Socialization of new members."&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, S. D., Louis, K. S., &amp; Bryk, A. S., An Emerging Framework for Analyzing School-based Professional Community. 1993. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association. p. 16-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools may implement a teacher leadership model as a strategy to down-size and cut costs for the school. In most cases, distributing administrative among the teachers could reduce overall personnel costs.

{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}
'''''Thoughts on the education of daughters: with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life''''' is the first published work of the British [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. Published in [[1787 in literature|1787]] by her friend [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], ''Thoughts'' is a [[conduct book]] that offers advice on [[female education]] to the emerging British [[middle class]]. Although dominated by considerations of morality and etiquette, the text also contains basic child-rearing instructions, such as how to care for an infant.

An early version of the modern [[self-help book]], the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was an explosion in the number of conduct books published during the second half of the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published ''Thoughts''. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of [[feminist literary criticism]] in the 1970s.

Like other conduct books of the time, ''Thoughts'' adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book encourages mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to [[John Locke]]; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for women&amp;mdash;a role that she viewed as meaningful&amp;mdash;was interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.

Although much of ''Thoughts'' is devoted to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few passages anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.

==Biographical background==
Like many impoverished women during the last quarter of the 18th century in Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted to support herself by establishing a school. She, her sister, and a close friend founded a [[boarding school]] in [[Newington Green]], a village already known for its [[Dissenting academies]], including that of political theorist and educational reformer [[James Burgh]], whose  widow acted as "[[fairy godmother]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordon | first = Lyndall | title = Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft | publisher = Virago Press | year =  2005 | pages = 562. Page 40.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in helping Wollstonecraft to find a house and pupils. However, in the late 1780s the school closed because of financial difficulties, and, desperate to escape from debt, Wollstonecraft wrote her first book, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters''. The title alludes to Burgh's ''Thoughts on Education'' (1747), which in turn alludes to [[John Locke]]'s 1693 work, ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. She sold the [[copyright]] for only ten [[guineas]] to [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], a publisher recommended to her by a friend; they became friends and he encouraged her writing throughout her life.
[[File:Governess.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a governess, wearing a black dress, seated on a red chair. She is teaching a child with blonde curls and a red velvet dress to read. The child is standing up, leaning into her lap to see the book she is pointing to.|Detail from [[Rebecca Solomon|Rebecca Solomon's]] ''The Governess'' (1851)]]

Wollstonecraft next tried her hand at being a [[governess]], but she chafed at her lowly position and refused to accommodate herself to her employers.  The modest success of ''Thoughts'' and Johnson's encouragement emboldened Wollstonecraft to embark on a career as a professional writer, a precarious and somewhat disreputable profession for women during the 18th century. She wrote to her sister that she was going to become the "first of a new genius" and published ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'', an autobiographical novel, in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 13; 239; Taylor, 6‚Äì7; Jones, "Literature of advice", 120; Richardson, 24-25; Todd, 75-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Addressed to mothers, young women, and teachers, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' explains how to educate a woman from infancy through marriage. Its twenty-one chapters are not arranged in any particular order and cover a wide variety of topics. The first two chapters, "The Nursery" and "Moral Discipline", offer advice on shaping the child's "constitution" and "temperament", arguing that the formation of the rational mind must begin early. These chapters also offer specific recommendations regarding the care of infants and endorse [[History of breastfeeding|breastfeeding]] (a hotly debated topic in the 18th century).&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 257&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the book criticizes what Wollstonecraft considers the damaging education usually offered to women: "artificial manners", card-playing, theatre-going, and an emphasis on fashion. She complains, for example, that women "squander" their money on clothing, "which if saved for charitable purposes, might alleviate the distress of many poor families, and soften the heart of the girl who entered into such scenes of woe".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; She contrasts this common but ineffectual education with one based on early childhood reading, benevolence, and love. Wollstonecraft also delved into a description of social issues, addressing the "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune" in addition to the "Treatment of Servants". Religious faith plays a prominent role in Wollstonecraft's educational plan; she advocates [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath observance]] and describes the "Benefits which arise from Disappointments", that is, the benefits which arise from suffering sent by God.

In her later works, such as ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790) and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), Wollstonecraft repeatedly returns to the topics addressed in ''Thoughts'', particularly the virtue of hard work and the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 32; Kelly, 29‚Äì30; Sapiro, 13; Richardson, 26; Jones, "Literature of advice", 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre: the conduct book==
Between 1760 and 1820, [[conduct book]]s reached the height of their popularity in Britain; one scholar refers to the period as "the age of courtesy books for women".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Armstrong, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Nancy Armstrong]] writes in her seminal work on this genre, ''Desire and Domestic Fiction'' (1987): "so popular did these books become that by the second half of the eighteenth century virtually everyone knew the ideal of womanhood they proposed".&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChaponeLettersTitle.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Page reads "LETTERS ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MIND, ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY. I consider an human soul without education, like marble in the quarry, which shews none of its inherent beauties till the skill of the polisher fetches out the colours, makes the surface shine, and discovers every ornamental cloud, spot, and vein that runs through the body of it. Education, after the same manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which without such helps are never able to make their appearance. ADDISON. IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. I. LONDON: Printed by H. Hughs, For J. Walter, Homer's Head, Charing-Cross, MDCCLXXIII."|Title page from the first edition of [[Hester Chapone]]'s ''[[Letters on the Improvement of the Mind|Letters]]'' (1773), one of the most popular [[conduct book]]s at the time Wollstonecraft was writing ''Thoughts'']]

Conduct books integrated the styles and rhetorics of earlier genres, such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books, and works on household economy. They offered their readers a description of (most often) the ideal woman while at the same time handing out practical advice. Thus, not only did they dictate morality, but they also guided readers' choice of dress and outlined "proper" etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples include [[Blue Stockings Society|Bluestocking]] [[Hester Chapone|Hester Chapone's]] ''[[Letters on the Improvement of the Mind]]'' (1773), which went through at least sixteen editions in the last quarter of the 18th century, and the classically educated historian [[Catharine Macaulay]]'s ''Letters on Education'' (1790).&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 28; 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapone's work, in particular, appealed to Wollstonecraft at this time and influenced her composition of ''Thoughts'' because it argued "for a sustained programme of study for women" and was based on the idea that Christianity should be "the chief instructor of our rational faculties".&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it emphasized that women should be considered rational beings and not left to wallow in sensualism.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; When Wollstonecraft wrote ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' in 1792, she drew on both Chapone and Macaulay's works.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, 42‚Äì43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conduct books have traditionally been viewed by scholars as an integral factor in the creation of a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 121; see Mary Poovey's ''The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer'' and Nancy Armstrong's ''Desire and Domestic Fiction'' for discussions of the conduct book.&lt;/ref&gt; The conduct book "helped to generate the belief that there was such a thing as a 'middle class' and that the modest, submissive but morally and domestically competent woman it described was the first 'modern individual'".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 121.&lt;/ref&gt; By developing a specifically bourgeois ethos through genres such as the conduct book, the emerging middle class challenged the primacy of the aristocratic code of manners.&lt;ref name=Kelly31&gt;Kelly, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, conduct books simultaneously constricted women's roles, propagating what has been called "the angel in the house" image (alluding to [[Coventry Patmore]]'s [[The Angel in the House|poem of that name]]). Women were encouraged to be chaste, pious, submissive, modest, selfless, graceful, pure, delicate, compliant, reticent, and polite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Gubar|Gubar, Susan]] and [[Sandra Gilbert]]. ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic|The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination]]''. New Haven: Yale University Press (1984), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, a few scholars have argued that conduct books should be differentiated more carefully and that some of them‚Äîsuch as Wollstonecraft's ''Thoughts''‚Äîtransformed traditional female advice manuals into "proto-feminist tracts".&lt;ref name=Jones122&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 122.&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars view ''Thoughts'' as part of a tradition that adapted older genres to a new message of female empowerment, genres such as advice manuals for women's education, moral satires, and moral and spiritual works by religious [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] (those not associated with the [[Church of England]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 122‚Äì23.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's text resembles conventional conduct books in promoting self-control and submission, traits that were supposed to attract a husband. Yet at the same time, the text challenges this portrait of the "proper lady" by introducing strains of religious Dissent that promote equality of the soul. Thus, ''Thoughts'' appears to be torn between several sets of binaries, such as compliance and rebellion; spiritual meekness and rational independence; and domestic duty and political participation. This view of the conduct book, and of ''Thoughts'' in particular, questions the earlier interpretation of the genre as a mere tool of ideological indoctrination, an interpretation that grew out of criticism influenced by theorists such as [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 128‚Äì29; see also Poovey, 55 and Jones, "Literature of advice", 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogical theory==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|right|alt=Three-quarter length portrait of a man with a shock of neck-length white hair wearing a loose brown robe and white shirt.|[[John Locke]], author of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693), painted by [[Godfrey Kneller]] in 1697]]
By the end of her life, Wollstonecraft had been involved in almost every arena of education: she had been a governess, a teacher, a children's writer, and a pedagogical theorist. Most of her works deal with education in some way. For example, her two novels are ''[[bildungsroman]]e'' (novels of education); she translated educational works such as [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann|Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's]] ''Elements of Morality''; she wrote a children's book, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788); and her ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is largely an argument for the value of female education. As is evidenced by this broad range of genres, "education" for Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries included much more than scholastic training; it encompassed everything that went into forming a person's character, from infant [[swaddling]] to childhood curricular choices to adolescent leisure activities.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 13; 239; Richardson, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft and other [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|political radicals]] during the last quarter of the 18th century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that if people were educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]], especially, embraced this view; Wollstonecraft's philosophy in ''Thoughts'' and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in Newington Green, such as the theologian, educator, and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]] and the minister [[Richard Price]]. Dissenters "were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits".&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to [[John Locke|Lockean]] and [[David Hartley (philosopher)|Hartleian]] [[association of ideas|associationist psychology]]: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built up through a set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 24‚Äì25; Sapiro, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke famously advised parents to keep their children away from servants, as they would only tell children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft was significantly influenced by Locke's ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693) (her title alludes to it) and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), the two most important pedagogical treatises of the 18th century. ''Thoughts'' follows in the Lockean tradition with its emphasis on a parent-directed domestic education, a distrust of servants, a banning of superstitious and irrational stories (e.g. [[fairy tale]]s), and an advocacy of clear rules. Wollstonecraft breaks from Locke, however, in her emphasis on piety and her insistence that the child has "innate" feelings that guide her towards virtue, ideas likely drawn from Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 13; 239‚Äì40; Richardson 24‚Äì27; Jones, "Literature of advice", 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Thoughts'' advocates several educational goals for women: independent thought, rationality, self-discipline, truthfulness, acceptance of one's social position, marketable skills, and faith in God.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 104; 240; Taylor, 32; Richardson, 26; Kelly, 29‚Äì31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education of women===
Wollstonecraft assumes that the "daughters" in her book will one day become mothers and teachers. She does not propose that women abandon these traditional roles, because she believes that women can most effectively improve society as pedagogues.&lt;ref name=EduWomen&gt;Richardson, 25‚Äì27; Jones, "Literature of advice", 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft and other writers as diverse as the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] moralist [[Hannah More]], the historian [[Catharine Macaulay]], and the feminist novelist [[Mary Hays]], argue that since women are the primary caregivers of the family and educators of children, they should be given a sound education.&lt;ref name=EduWomen/&gt; ''Thoughts'' is insistent, following Locke and associationist psychology, that a poor education and an early marriage will ruin a woman.&lt;ref name=EduWomen/&gt; Wollstonecraft argues that if no attention is paid to girls as they are growing, they will turn out poorly and marry while still intellectual and emotional children. Such wives, she contends, perform no useful role in society and, indeed, contribute to its immorality.&lt;ref name=EduWomen/&gt; She expanded upon this argument five years later in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=EduWomen/&gt;
[[File:Joseph Highmore 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=Domestic scene of a mother teaching four children, surrounded by four servants. The mother and children are at the center of the painting while the servants are in a circle around them. The mother looks away from the audience towards her children, and the children look towards her and out towards the audience. One of the children is elegantly dressed in a red coat and appears to be a teenager; the other three appear to be under the age of 10, one an infant, and all wearing white.|[[Joseph Highmore]]'s illustration of Pamela teaching her children (1743‚Äì45); in volume four of [[Samuel Richardson|Samuel Richardson's]] novel, ''[[Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', Pamela endorses much of Locke's educational program, while at the same time claiming a valuable new role for mothers: educator.]]

Wollstonecraft and others criticized the traditional "accomplishment"-based education traditionally offered women; they argued that this kind of education, which emphasized the acquisition of skills such as drawing and dancing, was useless and decadent.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 34; Richardson, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal woman in ''Thoughts'' is, as Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, "rational, provident, realistic, self-disciplined, self-conscious and critical", an image that resembles that of the professional man. Wollstonecraft argues that women should have all of the intellectual and moral training given to men, though she does not provide women with a place to use these new skills beyond the home.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's feminist critics charged that the masculine role for women that she envisioned‚Äîone designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere‚Äîleft women without a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting‚Äîas offering women more in the way of education without a real way to use it.&lt;ref name=Kelly31/&gt;

Wollstonecraft's most passionate writing in ''Thoughts'' focuses on the lack of career opportunities for women, a theme that would dominate her later novel ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'' (1798).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the chapter entitled "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune" she writes, perhaps describing her own experiences:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]o be an humble companion to some rich old cousin... It is impossible to enumerate the many hours of anguish such a person must spend. Above the servants, yet considered by them as a spy, and ever reminded of her inferiority when in conversation with the superiors.&amp;nbsp;‚Ä¶ A teacher at a school is only a kind of upper servant, who has more work than the menial ones. A governess to young ladies is equally disagreeable.&amp;nbsp;‚Ä¶ life glides away, and the spirits with it; 'and when youth and genial years are flown,' they have nothing to subsist on; or, perhaps, on some extraordinary occasion, some small allowance may be made for them, which is thought a great charity.&amp;nbsp;‚Ä¶ It is hard for a person who has a relish for polished society, to herd with the vulgar, or to condescend to mix with her formal equals when she is considered in a different light... How cutting is the contempt she meets with!‚ÄîA young mind looks round for love and friendship; but love and friendship fly from poverty: expect them not if you are poor!&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787), 69‚Äì74.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religion===

Although Wollstonecraft's comments on female education hint at some of her more radical arguments in ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', the religious tone of the text‚Äîalso found in her first novel, ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]''‚Äîis generally viewed by scholars as conservative.&lt;ref name=Jones1245&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 124-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion presented in ''Thoughts'' is one that celebrates the "pleasures of resignation", the belief that the afterlife is awaiting and that the world is ordered by God for the best.&lt;ref name=Jones1245/&gt; Wollstonecraft writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He who is training us up for immortal bliss, knows best what trials will contribute to make us [virtuous]; and our resignation and improvement will render us respectable to ourselves, and to that Being, whose approbation is of more value than life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787), 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although she drifted away from these beliefs and later adopted a more permissive theology, ''Thoughts'' is "steeped in orthodox attitudes, advocating 'fixed principles of religion' and warning of the dangers of rationalist speculation and deism".&lt;ref name="Taylor95"&gt;Taylor, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft even agrees with [[Rousseau]] that women should be taught religious dogma rather than theology; clear rules, she maintains, will restrain their passions.&lt;ref name="Taylor95" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:MaryWollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Half-length portrait of a woman leaning on a desk with a book and an inkstand. She is wearing a blue-striped dress and a gray, curly wig crossed by a white band of cloth.|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] by [[John Opie]] (c. 1791)]]
''Thoughts''  was only moderately successful: it was reprinted in [[Dublin]] a year after its initial publication in London, extracts were published in ''The Lady's Magazine'', and Wollstonecraft included excerpts from it in her own ''Female Reader'' (1789), an anthology of writings designed "for the Improvement of Young Women". ''[[English Review (18th century)|The English Review]]'' noticed ''Thoughts'' favourably:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These thoughts are employed on various important situations and incidents in the ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject;&amp;nbsp;‚Ä¶ while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention of those who are more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jones, "Literature of advice", 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, no other journal reviewed the book and ''Thoughts'' was not reprinted until the late 20th century, when there was a resurgence of interest in Wollstonecraft among [[feminist literary criticism|feminist literary critics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 13; 20; Jones, "Literature of advice", 129; Wardle, 52‚Äì53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Richardson, a scholar of 18th-century education, points out that if Wollstonecraft had not written ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790) and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'', it is unlikely that ''Thoughts'' would have been considered progressive or even worthy of notice.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; One critic has even said that the text reads as if it were simply trying to please the public.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 34; Richardson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some scholars have argued that there are glimmers of Wollstonecraft's radicalism in this text, they admit that the "potential for critique remains largely latent".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 124.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thoughts'' is therefore usually interpreted either [[teleology|teleologically]], as a first step towards the more radical ''Rights of Woman'', or dismissed as a "politically na√Øve potboiler" written prior to Wollstonecraft's conversion to radicalism while she was writing the ''Rights of Men''.&lt;ref name=Jones122/&gt;

== Technical aspects ==
Most TMSs are web-based. TMSs were originally designed to be locally hosted on-premise, where the organization purchases a license to a version of the software, and installs it on their own servers and network. Many TMSs are also offered as&amp;nbsp;[[Software as a service|SaaS]] (software as a service), with hosting provided by the vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/efrontpro-private-cloud-solution|title=5 Benefits of Going the Private Cloud Route|website=elearningindustry.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20007">The '''University of the Third Age''' is an international movement whose aims are the education and stimulation of mainly [[retired]] members of the community‚Äîthose in their third 'age' of life. It is commonly referred to as '''U3A'''.

There is no universally accepted model for the U3A. Its original conception in [[France]] as an [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/extramural extramural] university activity was significantly modified in the [[United Kingdom]] where it was recognized that most people of [[Retirement_age|retirement age]] have something to contribute and the emphasis has been on sharing, without formal links to traditional universities. 

Many English-speaking countries have followed this [[Geragogy|geragogic]] model, whereas [[continental European]] countries have mostly followed the French model.

A British U3A website reports this about "The Third Age" membership eligibility: "U3A membership is not related to a specific age but to a period in one‚Äôs life (the third age) after the second age of full-time employment and parental responsibility. Anybody in their third age can join U3A and this includes people who are working part-time.  There is no lower age for membership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our story|url=https://www.u3a.org.uk/about/history |website=The Third Age Trust|accessdate=28 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== France ===
'''U3A''' started in France at the Faculty of Social Sciences in [[Toulouse, France|Toulouse]] back in 1973. It was started by Prof. Pierre  Vellas. In France, each Third Age University group is mostly associated with a local [[university]]. This [[academic]] model is used in many other countries, in particular in [[continental Europe]]. The university affiliation generates various opportunities such as highly qualified teaching personnel, a variety of subject choices, opportunity for students and faculty to conduct research based on the professional, cultural or historical experiences of the elderly, etc. U3As do not issue diplomas but rather certificates and teach in many  fields according to the interests of the groups of elderly students (usually 55+) such as computer skills, languages, entrepreneurship, hereditary law, religion, politics, etc. Sometimes U3As provide groups with vocational training and formal continuous education opportunities.

In the 1990s the concept was broadened in France to the notion of the University of All Ages (UTA - universit√© tous √¢ges) or University of Free Time (UTL - universit√© du temps libre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamahian|first=Aline|year=2006|title=De l‚ÄôUniversit√© du Troisi√®me √Çge de Toulouse aux Universit√©s Tous √Çges : retour sur le mouvement de constitution des UTA en France|journal=Communication au 2eme Congr√®s de l'Association Fran√ßaise de Sociologie|url=http://perso.numericable.fr/~sitedurtf7/downloads/CG/cgtxtreschamahian.pdf|accessdate=Jan 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222040831/http://perso.numericable.fr/~sitedurtf7/downloads/CG/cgtxtreschamahian.pdf|archive-date=February 22, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFUTA changed its name to ''Union Fran√ßaise des Universit√©s de Tous Ages''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Union Fran√ßaise des Universit√©s de Tous Ages |url=http://www.ufuta.fr/|accessdate=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (retaining the acronym). Some French university departments have adopted the title of ''Universit√© du Temps Libre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Universit√© du Temps Libre|url=http://temps-libre.unistra.fr/|accessdate=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

AIUTA (''Association Internationale des Universit√©s du Troisi√®me √Çge'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Association of Universities of the Third Age|url=http://www.aiu3a.com/indexen.html|accessdate=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (https://aiu3a.org/) is the global international organization and network of universities of the third age, including such institutions from most continental European countries, Central and East Europe, China, Russia, Latin America, etc., including [[Mauritius]] and other destinations. The President of AIUTA is prof. Fran√ßois Vellas from the University of Toulouse, son of the founder of the first U3A Pierre.

=== UK and Commonwealth ===
[[File:Logo of the University of the Third Age.png|thumb|alt=Logo of the University of the Third Age |Logo of the Third Age Trust, a representative body for U3As in the UK]]By the early 1980s, the concept reached the [[United Kingdom]], where its nature was radically changed to be more a [[self-help]] organization under the influence of its founders, [[Peter Laslett]], [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]] and [[Eric Midwinter]].&lt;ref name="U3AStory"&gt;{{cite web|title=The U3A Story|url=http://www.u3a.org.uk/the-u3a-story/file.html|website=U3A UK|publisher=The Third Age Trust|date = 2014|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is also used in Australia, Cyprus, Dominica, New Zealand and South Africa.
In the British model of [[peer learning]], it is acknowledged that [[retired]] people have a lifetime of experience and, collectively, a vast amount of knowledge. This is used to arrange a [[syllabus]] for each subject where each meeting is normally led by a member of the group with a strong interest or specialist knowledge.&lt;ref name="MatureTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=U3A takes on extreme sports challenge|url=http://www.maturetimes.co.uk/u3a-extreme-events-challenge/|accessdate=10 September 2015|publisher=The Mature Times|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Minor road at Lower Tremenheere - geograph.org.uk - 1561517.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Carrick, Cornwall U3A walking group on a scenic walk.]]Each U3A group pays a membership fee to the national coordinating body, The Third Age Trust, and has access to a vast range of resources including a [[multi-media]] lending library, special-interest newsletters and contacts with other groups with similar interests. Summer schools are held by special interest groups. Most importantly, each group ha an absolutely autonomous entity, self-financing and self-managing.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Andrew|title=In praise of ‚Ä¶ U3A|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/10/in-praise-of-u3a-university-of-the-third-age-britain|accessdate=10  September 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the British U3A reported its 1000th member, at [[Churchdown, Gloucestershire]] which has 26 groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Churchdown takes our movement into thousands|url=http://www.u3a.urg.uk|work=Third Age Matters|agency=U3A|page=5|accessdate=Nov 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after reporting 950 in 2015,&lt;ref name=TheTimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Rosemary|title=College that truly stretches the grey matter |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article4403597.ece| accessdate=28 September 2015|publisher=The Times|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of UK U3As|url=http://www.u3a.org.uk/find-a-u3a/79-public-area/83-find-a-u3a-group.html|website=The University of the Third Age|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; running 36,000 courses&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sturgis|first1=India|title=Britain‚Äôs most inspiring university: You can study everything from Arabic to Scrabble and even learn to canoe and it‚Äôs changing the lives of countless over-50s...|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3075956/Britains-inspiring-university-study-Arabic-Scrabble-learn-canoe-changing-lives-countless-50s.html|accessdate=10 September 2015|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 350,000 people.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;[[File:U3A membership UK.svg|thumb|right|300px|Growth in membership of U3A in UK]]Most groups are regional in nature which has led to the creation, in some countries, of variations on the U3A. For example, in Cyprus there is a U3A, an organization called C3A (Cyprus Third Age), which is affiliated to the UK U3A, and P3A ([[Paphos]] Third Age).

=== Central and Eastern Europe===
Some Central (and Eastern) European countries were introduced to the U3A quite early: [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]] (formerly part of [[Czechoslovakia]]) and [[Slovenia]]. The Slovenian Third Age University was started by two university professors in 1984 and has developed into a network of 40 universities over the entire country.

There is an online Third Age University in Russia at http://u3a.niuitmo.ru/.

=== Australia ===
Australia's first U3A began in Melbourne in 1984 and as of 2013, has grown to 250 U3As with approximately 85,000 members. These are based in metropolitan, regional and rural areas, and follow the British self-help model of teaching and learning over a wide range of subject areas, dependent upon the membership's own expertise, knowledge and skills.

U3As in New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital territory, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia have formed state networks to support the U3As in their state or territory with a range of resources.  Each Network has its own website from which local U3As can be located. For example, see http://www.nsw.u3anet.org.au which also has links to other state networks.

In 1998, [http://www.u3aonline.org.au U3A Online] was started to provide cognitively challenging virtual courses for isolated older people from any country. Since then the initiative has been widened to include any person who regards themselves as being in their third age. More than 35 courses, all written and taught by volunteer experts from various countries, are available. In 2009, U3A Online published a paper entitled "[http://www.u3aonline.org.au/content/educational-initiatives-elderly Educational initiatives for the elderly]". The paper contains contributions from a number of U3A leaders from around the world outlining the status of U3A and U3A-like organizations in different countries. That paper, and other peer-reviewed research studies based on the [[Successful Aging]] model, are freely available from http://www.u3aonline.org.au.

=== Canada ===

[https://thirdagenetwork.ca/ The Third Age Network (TAN)] is very active in [[Canada]], however currently only within the province of [[Ontario]].  With head office at the [[G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education]] at [[Ryerson University]] in [[Toronto]], the network started in 2007 and has grown to 21 groups in 2018. 

The Third Age Mission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thirdagenetwork.ca/ |website=The Third Age Network |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;: ‚ÄúTo foster Third Age Learning and share issues and solutions to common organizational challenges. We do this by promoting the establishment of organizations that provide opportunities for older adults to learn in a friendly, social setting and by supporting adult learning organizations in this process by sharing strategies and techniques to accomplish this goal.‚Äù

TAN runs a newsletter and hosts organization-wide symposiums and forums.  It also provides support to local groups with things like information on speakers, networking with colleagues, data on member operations, including honoraria paid to speakers, board make up, rental costs, affordable group insurance, a regular newsletter, conferences and workshop, guidance for creating a website, internal and external communication.

'''Simon Fraser University (SFU) Seniors Program'''

[[SFU]] was the first university in North America to create a series of [http://etec.ctlt.ubc.ca/510wiki/Education_for_the_3rd_Age specially designed courses for seniors] at the post-secondary level. Its mandate was to provide educational programs for older adults that were responsive to their unique psychological and physiological characteristics.

== Virtual University of the Third Age ==
On January 1, 2009, after four years of experiments and testing, the '''[http://vu3a.org Virtual University of the Third Age]''' (vU3A) was launched with the intention of offering the same friendship, support and learning enjoyed by off-line groups. vU3A is open to anyone, in particular those who, by circumstances of isolation, health problems or other restrictions, cannot get to a U3A group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarolimek|first1=Jan|title=Conditions and Limitations of Multimedia Senior Education in the Regions|journal=Journal on Efficiency and Responsibility in Education and Science|date=31 December 2010|volume=3|issue=2|pages=66‚Äì78|url=http://www.eriesjournal.com/_papers/article_124.pdf|issn=1803-1617|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small fee.

Volunteers run the entire operation, including teaching, in cyberspace. There is general agreement that not only physical but intellectual activity enrich and prolong life in the later years. Although primarily for the retired, many U3As open their membership to any people not in full-time employment, thus becoming more inclusive and widening the age range of the membership.

== Courses ==
[[File:Nunawading U3A Belly Dancers 028.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Nunawading U3A Belly Dancing Group at the 2012 Carnival of Learning at [[Federation Square]], [[Melbourne]].]]
Typical courses include Art, Classical Studies, Conversation, Computers, Crafts, Debate, Drama, History, Languages, Literature, Music, Sciences, Social Sciences, and Philosophy.&lt;ref name=RetireSavvy&gt;{{cite news|title=Always Learning: Staying mentally active in retirement with U3A|url=https://retiresavvy.skipton.co.uk/always-learning-staying-mentally-active-retirement-u3a|accessdate=28 September 2015|publisher=Retire Savvy UK|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some study groups do not have a prepared syllabus, but draw on reports of current affairs in their topic subject to prompt conversation and research. Some groups are designed to cross disciplinary boundaries, for example, combining Society, Technology and Science in a fashion not practical in more formal academic environments.

U3A groups are well positioned to conduct serious research into local history and [[genealogy]]. For example, a group in [[Eyemouth]] collected and exhibited many photographs of life and work in the district over the years. Some groups aim to bridge the generation gap in the field of [[information technology]], opening up an exciting new world to many who might have been oblivious of it otherwise. [[Internet marketing]] is especially important for members in more remote locations.

There are also many less educationally focused activities, including Games, including [[Contract bridge|bridge]] tuition and duplicate bridge playing groups; Health, Fitness &amp; Leisure, including countryside walks, Theatre/Concert Clubs, Travel Clubs, and Dance in all its forms.

== Newsletter ==
Many U3As publish local newsletters as do some of their special interest networks. In the UK the [http://u3a.org.uk Third Age Trust], the coordinating body in the UK, publishes a national magazine. [https://u3a.org.uk/newsletter Third Age Matters] publishes five times per year plus an educational bulletin called Sources, for subscribing U3A members three times annually.

The U3A can also provide a valuable resource in considering many local and national issues. Membership includes many with experience and expertise in almost all walks of life and letters. Although strictly non-political, U3A members have time to reflect in a mature fashion on such topics as the operation of public services, crime and punishment, the future of energy supplies, public funding of the arts and so on, and can reply to invitations to engage in public consultations with carefully considered and argued responses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10442">The '''Wordos''' is a [[writing circle|writing workshop]] based in [[Eugene, Oregon]], [[United States]]. Its members meet once a week to [[critic|critique]] stories and discuss the art, craft, and business of [[writing]]. It is a long-running [[speculative fiction]] critique group, and has a high concentration of [[publishing|published]] authors. However, having prior publishing credits is not a prerequisite to joining. The group has produced winners of the [[Galaxy Press]] international [[Writers of the Future]] contest six years in a row.&lt;ref name=RGMarch07&gt;{{cite news |last=McCowan |first=Karen |title=Eugene's bunch of Wordos continues to find success |url=http://www.registerguard.com/news/2007/03/21/a1.scificentral.0321.p1.php?section=cityregion |publisher=''[[The Register-Guard]]'' |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group promotes itself as a means to help writers produce [[fiction]] of salable quality, and to continually improve their writing abilities. The workshop's primary focus is on [[Short story|short]] speculative fiction, but members have had fiction of other lengths and genres critiqued.

==History==
Founded in 1987, "The Wordos" was originally called "The Eugene Professional Writers Workshops, Inc." The name was changed in 1995, to make it "shorter and friendlier." They kept the original name for business purposes, however.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wordos.com/faq/ |title = The Wordos FAQ |accessdate = 2007-09-20 |publisher = The Wordos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group meets weekly in a local bookstore.&lt;ref name=RGMarch07/&gt;

==Notable members==
The membership over time has included, [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] and fantasy novelist [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Surrealism|surrealist]] short story writer and novelist [[Ray Vukcevich]], science fiction writers [[Kathy Oltion]] and [[Jerry Oltion]], [[Bruce Holland Rogers]], [[Patricia Briggs]], fiction and non-fiction writer [[Leslie What]], [[Jay Lake]], [[Eric M. Witchey]], [[Devon Monk]] and many others. Deborah Layne, a long-time member, is also the founder of [[Wheatland Press]], the award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/2006.html |title = 2006 World Fantasy Awards Ballot |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |publisher = World Fantasy |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070722104054/http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/2006.html |archivedate = 2007-07-22 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; publisher of the ''Polyphony'' anthology.

==Method==
The Wordos follow the [[Clarion Workshop]] model of critiquing. A member reads a submitted story, writes comments on it, and then, on the evening of the workshop, speaks for one to three minutes offering those and other comments aloud. At the end of the evening the critiqued story is given back to the author.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

Members also report on news over the previous week, including accepted stories, rejections, and re-write requests from publishers.

==Awards==
A member of the Wordos has won or placed in the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] [[Writers of the Future]] contest consistently since 2001. There have also been several [[Nebula Award]]-winning workshop members and members who have been nominated for or won the [[Endeavour Award]], [[World Fantasy Award]], and [[Philip K. Dick Award]]. One member, Marshall Moseley, was a finalist in the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] television series "[[Project Greenlight]]".

'''Work Colleges''' are distinctive liberal arts colleges that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. Work Colleges are federally designated institutions that have "comprehensive work-learning-service" programs as an essential and core component of their educational programs. All resident students are required to work including one-half of all students who are enrolled on a full-time basis regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution with a commitment to community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title: 34 Education Subpart C-Work Colleges Program|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=19510d2314b346907b450a1ad4c7244f&amp;mc=true&amp;n=sp34.3.675.c&amp;r=SUBPART&amp;ty=HTML|website=eCFR Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=US Government Publishing Office|ref=U.S. Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Work Colleges program is to recognize, encourage and promote work-learning-service programs as a valuable education approach when it is an integral part of the institution's education program and a part of the financial plan that decreases reliance on (grants and) loans. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to "buy" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Students are paid for their work which helps offset the cost of tuition. At some work colleges students receive a full tuition credit for their work, while other receive reduced tuition. Student work can help contribute to lower operational costs and more affordable tuition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div6&amp;view=text&amp;node=34:3.1.3.1.38.3&amp;idno=34 The United States federal government definition of Work College, Title 34 ¬ß 675.41, from GPO Electronic Code of Federal Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students typically work 6 to 15 hours per week, jobs run the gamut of campus need from teaching assistant-ships, to accounts payable, to IT, to food services, to grounds keeping, to plumbing, public relations, campus safety etc. Work colleges share the belief that the integration of work-learning-service provides a strong, successful, and relevant model for educating students.

Currently, there are nine federally recognized work colleges in the nation that meet the federal requirements for operation as overseen by the U.S. Department of Education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">A '''Zirkel''' is a symbol used in Central European student societies ([[Studentenverbindung]]en).

__TOC__

== Look and meaning ==
A ''Zirkel'' consists of intertwined lines, mostly followed by an exclamation mark. The lines mostly show the first letters of the name of the 
''Studentenverbindung'' and / or the letters v,c,f or e,f,v.

&lt;big&gt;'''Examples:'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Meaning of v-c-f:
* ''Vivant fratres coniuncti'' ("the conjunct brothers should live")&lt;ref name="Ref2"&gt;Peter Krause: ''O alte Burschenherrlichkeit - Die Studenten und ihr Brauchtum'', Graz, Wien, K√∂ln 1979, page 78, 79&lt;/ref&gt;  or
* ''Vivat circulus fratrum'' ("the circle of brothers should live")&lt;ref name="Ref2"/&gt; or
* ''Vivat, crescat, floreat'' ("live, grow, flourish").&lt;ref name="Ref4"&gt;Paulgerhard Gladen: ''Gaudeamus igitur - Die studentischen Verbindungen einst und jetzt'', K√∂ln 2001, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Meaning of e-f-v:
* ''Ehre, Freiheit, Vaterland'' ("Honour, Liberty, Fatherland").&lt;ref name="Ref4"/&gt;

The exclamation mark means that the society is still active and alive.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Argonaut (studentenvereniging)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The members of the ''Studentenverbindung'' use the ''Zirkel'' as sign on [[Couleur]] or other things e.g. beer glasses etc. If a member signs 
in affairs of its ''Studentenverbindung'' it places the ''Zirkel'' after its signature. This use is similar to the use of [[Post-nominal letters|postnominals]] in 
Anglo-Saxon countries.
