'''Abner Kneeland''' (April 7, 1774 – August 27, 1844) was an American evangelist and theologian who advocated many views, religious and social, which were considered extremely radical for his day.  Due to his very public stance on these issues, Kneeland became the last man jailed in the United States for [[blasphemy]].

==Biography==

===Early life and ministry===
Kneeland was born in [[Gardner, Massachusetts]].  At the age of 21, he attended a [[Baptist]] church and served as a lay preacher for a time.  However, he soon converted to [[Universalist Church of America|Universalism]] where he was ordained a minister.  He served as minister of various churches for a time, helping organize hymnals and making his own translation of the New Testament.  He also debated with other public theologians of the day.  As time went on, he became more and more skeptical of [[Revelation|revealed religion]], causing schisms in the churches he administered.  Eventually, he and the Universalist Church parted ways after his views became too far removed from Christianity.  Kneeland became a [[Freethought|freethinker]] and [[Pantheism|pantheist]], saying that the Universalist's Christian God was "nothing more than a chimera of their own imagination."

[[Image:AbnerKneeland NYHistoricalSociety.png|thumb|left|Portrait of Kneeland, 19th century (New York Historical Society)]]

===Publishing===
He edited a Universalist magazine in [[Philadelphia]] 1821–1823; he managed and edited the ''Olive Branch and Christian Enquirer'' in [[New York City]] in 1828; and he founded the ''[[Boston Investigator]]'', an organ of free thought, in Boston in 1832.

===Prosecution for blasphemy===
{{main article|Commonwealth v. Kneeland}}

Under the colonial charter of Massachusetts, blasphemy was still a crime, albeit one punished extremely rarely.  However, perhaps because his other views inflamed the judiciary, Kneeland was charged with having violated the law.  The final trial was held in 1838, five years after he had published the statements that caused the upset in the first place.  Kneeland was convicted and served sixty days in prison.  He was described by the judge as "a cantankerous and inflexible heretic."

===Emigration and death===
Kneeland left Massachusetts after the trial and moved to Iowa, where he started a small [[utopia]]n community named [[Salubria, Iowa|Salubria]] (near present-day [[Farmington, Iowa]]). Salubria failed shortly after his death in 1844.

==Religious and social views==
In matters of religion, Kneeland became more and more disenchanted of religion handed down from some prophet and enshrined by tradition.&lt;blockquote&gt;"But I certify you brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is ''not after man''. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught ''it'', but by the revelation Jesus Christ." Here is Paul, admitting after having preached a considerable number of years,'' that he knows nothing true of Jesus Christ, but that which Jesus Christ had revealed to himself''&amp;nbsp;; and expressly declaring that this revelation had been a mystery kept secret since the world began, and was only then ''first preached by himself''. This declaration, were there nothing else, would be sufficient to destroy all idea of the four gospels being authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kneeland|first1=Abner|authorlink1=Abner Kneeland|last2=Wyttenbach|first2=Daniel Albert|authorlink2=Daniel Albert Wyttenbach|title=A review of the evidences of Christianity: in a series of lectures, delivered in Broadway hall, New York, August, 1829.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kneeland [[Wikt:apud|apud]] [[Henry Dodwell]]: We have at this day, certain most authentic ecclesiastical writers of the times, as Clemens Romanus, Barnabas, Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, who wrote in the same order wherein I have named them, and after all the writers of the New Testament. But in Hermas you will not find one passage, or any mention of the New Testament, nor in all the rest is any one of the evangelists named. If sometimes they cite passages like those we read in our gospels, you will find them so changed, and for the most part so interpolated, that it cannot be known whether they produced them out of ours, or some apocryphal gospels. Nay, they sometimes cite passages which most certainly are not in our present gospels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodwell|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Dodwell|title=Dissertationes in Irenaeum.

Kneeland disdained societal mores, preferring naturalistic and personal quests for truth. He believed in equal treatment for all people, both under the law as well as by society.  Kneeland applied this even when religious scripture would seem to indicate different roles.  This included support of such controversial ideas as divorce rights for women, married women keeping their own names and property, and refusal to condemn [[miscegenation]] (now known as interracial marriage).  Kneeland was also in favor of birth control. He allowed fiery abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] the use of his lecture hall when the churches in Boston had turned him away.

Being his trainee for couple of years, he was accepted in [[K.N.Toosi University of Technology]] and continued his mountaineering life with the university mountaineering group. In order to be a professional mountaineer, he joined ''Arash'' alpine club in 2007.

== Education and career ==
Bozorgi got third place in Khwarizmi competition 2005. He was educated in [[Tehran, Iran]], receiving a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[Electrical engineering]] at [[K.N.Toosi University of Technology]] 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kntu.ac.ir/index.aspx|title=دانشگاه صنعتی خواجه نصیرالدین طوسی|website=www.kntu.ac.ir|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ranked 5th in 18th national Economics Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alpineclub.ir/fa/node/206|title=مسير ايرانی بر روی برودپيک {{!}} انجمن کوه نوردان ایران|website=www.alpineclub.ir|language=fa|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ranked 11th in the national [[Master's degree]] exam in [[Economics]] 2013.

== Setting Iran route ==
Bozorgi (with Pouya Keivan and Mojtaba Jarahi) successfully completed a new route on the Southwest Face of [[Broad Peak]] they had been working on since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alpineclub.ir/fa/node/206|title=مسير ايرانی بر روی برودپيک {{!}} انجمن کوه نوردان ایران|website=www.alpineclub.ir|language=fa|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The descent proved to be more complicated than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?url=summer-2013-new-route-summits-burials-an_137411056|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb - Summer 2013: New Route, Summits, Burials and Summit Bid|website=www.explorersweb.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?url=iranian-broad-peak-new-route-complicatio_137421475|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb - Iranian Broad Peak New Route: Complications on Descent|website=www.explorersweb.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climber Thomas Laemmle, who helped with the unsuccessful search and rescue attempt, stated that he believed Bozorgi and his companions were dead,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?url=the-iranian-route-on-broad-peak-complete_137485806|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb - Iranian route on Broad Peak completed - Thomas Laemmle's search operation|website=www.explorersweb.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the search operation on [[Broad Peak]] has formally been called off.

'''Aud Haakonsdottir of Lade''', also called ''Öda Haakonsdottir of Lade'' (10th century), was a [[legend]]ary Swedish [[Viking age]] [[queen consort]], according to the sagas the last spouse of King [[Eric the Victorious]] of [[Sweden]].

==Background==
Aud was the daughter of the Norwegian [[Jarl (title)|jarl]] [[Haakon Sigurdsson]] of [[Lade, Trondheim|Lade]] and sister of regent [[Eiríkr Hákonarson]]. It is not known exactly when she married King Eric, or when she was born and died, but she is guessed to have married him after his marriage to the famous [[Sigrid Storråda]]. The marriage has never been confirmed, and it is also suggested, that if she did exist, she may have been his mistress, or a brief marriage late in his life.

'''Caterina Coromina i Agustí''' ([[Oristà]], 19 October 1824 - [[Vic]], 11 Juli 1893) was a Spanish religious woman and founder of the [[Josephine Sisters]], an order which works for the elderly and the poor. She is recognized as Venerable by the Catholic Church.

== Biography ==
===Childhood and youth===
Caterina Coromina was born in 1824 on a farm in the parish of Santa Eulàlia de Pardines, in a family of modest means. She did not attend school and spent her childhood working on the land with her eleven brothers. Her environment was strict and pious, which influenced her greatly.&lt;ref name="dbd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caterina Coromina Agustí|url=http://dbd.cat/fitxa_biografies.php?id=2052|agency=Diccionari biogràfic de dones|website=dbd.cat|language=ca|date=5 September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult life===
She desired a religious life ever since she was young but was unable to because she lacked a [[dowry]]. In 1852, at age 28, family circumstances forced her to enter domestic service for the next nineteen years. At first she was employed on a farm; later she did the household for a priest, where she probably learned to read by way of ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'', a reading that allowed her to deepen her personal piety. Later she worked for various other families in [[Vic]].&lt;ref name="dbd"/&gt;

===Service to the poor, foundation of an order===
Caterina Coromina decided to stop working and fulfill her mission. She rented a place and began to live a religious life and minister to the sick, with medicine donated by the local pharmacist.&lt;ref name="dbd"/&gt;

Starting in 1877 she began to take in others, and with three women she began a communal life, founding the order of the [[Josephine Sisters]], approved by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic|bishop of Vic]], Mgr. Colomer, who became its spiritual director.&lt;ref name="dbd"/&gt;

The group experienced such poverty that the it fell apart, but it reconstituted itself after a year. The first religious vows were spoken in 1881, after which the community experienced growth and expanded throughout Catalonia--to [[Ripoll]], [[Vilassar de Dalt]], [[Manlleu]], [[Torellà]], [[Martorell]], and [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]].&lt;ref name="dbd"/&gt;

The arrival of new nuns who were better educated than Caterina Coromina caused some friction in the community beginning in 1886, and in the end the community's leadership was taken from her. She rededicated herself to poverty, and died in Vic in 1893.&lt;ref name="dbd"/&gt;

== Beatification ==
Her case for [[beatification]] was opened, and her heroism and virtues recognized. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] declared her venerable in 2006.&lt;ref name="dbd"/&gt;

'''Chen Shimei''' is a [[Chinese opera]] character and a byword in [[China]] for a heartless and unfaithful man.

==History==
[[File:Chenshimei.jpg|thumb|240px|An illustration from a 1594 copy of the novel ''Legal Cases of A Hundred Families Judged by Dragon-Design Bao'' (包龍圖判百家公案) depicting Chen Shimei in a banquet listening to his abandoned wife Lady Qin disguised as a [[pipa]] player.]]

“Illustrated Edition of [[Bao Zheng]]’s Trials of A Hundred Legal Cases” (增像包龙图判百家公案), “Bao Zheng’s Cases” (包公案) in short, published in 1595 had already had the story of Chen Shimei whose children’s names were as the same as they are in the traditional opera.

== Chinese Opera ==

The story of Beijing opera “[Chen Shi] Mei’s Beheading Case” (铡美案)：

In Song Dynasty, Chen Shimei (陈 世美) placed first in the [[imperial examination]] and was awarded to be the brother-in-law of the Emperor. Due to Chen coveted wealth and power, he kept his marriage with Qin Xianglian (秦 香蓮) a secret. However, when his first wife came to the capital with their children to look for him, Chen Shimei not only claimed not knowing them, but ordered his bodyguard Han Qi (韩 琪) to kill them. However, when Qin Xianglian cried and told the truth, Han Qi could not kill them but killed himself in Sanguantang (三官堂). Qin Xianglian went to [[Bao Zheng]] to sue Chen Shimei. Bao Zheng planned to have Qin confront Chen, tried to give Chen a chance for Qin and their children's sakes. Chen took himself as the Emperor’s relative for granted and refused to tell the truth, further revealed his corrupted character therefore lost his chance at redemption. When Bao Zheng was going to behead him, the Empress dowager and the Princess came to stop him. But Bao Zheng ignored it and beheaded Chen Shimei.

After the foundation of [[People's Republic of China]], Changchun Film Studio (長春電影製片廠) produced colourful opera film “Qin Xianglian” in 1964 to preserve the stage craft of Beijing opera performing artists such as Junqiu Zhang (張 君秋), Lianliang Ma (馬 連良), Duokui Li (李 多奎) and Shengrong Qiu (裘 盛戎).

According to testimonies, young women were abducted from their homes in countries under Imperial Japanese rule. In many cases, women were lured with promises of work in factories or restaurants, or opportunities for higher education; once recruited, they were incarcerated in comfort stations both inside their nations and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=100–101, 105–106, 110–111}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Fackler 2007-03-06|Ref=CITEREFNY Times2007-03-06}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC 2007-03-02}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC 2007-03-08}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Pramoedya|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japanese military prostitution ===
Military correspondence of the Imperial Japanese Army shows that the aim of facilitating comfort stations was the prevention of rape crimes committed by Japanese army personnel and thus preventing the rise of hostility among people in occupied areas.&lt;ref name="AWF_CW51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asian Women's Fund|p=51|Ref=AWF-CW}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmen Argibay]], a former member of the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice, also states that the Japanese government aimed to prevent atrocities like the [[Rape of Nanking]] by confining rape and sexual abuse within military controlled facilities, or stop the incident from leaking to the international press should such events occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Argibay|2003|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also states that the government wanted to minimize medical expenses on treating venereal diseases that the soldiers acquired from frequent and widespread rape, which hindered Japan's military capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Argibay|2003|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Yuki Tanaka]] also suggests that local brothels outside of the military's reach had issues of security since there were possibilities of spies disguised as workers of such private facilities.&lt;ref name="wender"&gt;{{harvnb|Wender|2003|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[prostitution in Japan]] was well-organized and open, the Japanese government and military developed a similar program to serve the Japanese Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1997|Ref=CITEREFHicks1997}}.{{page needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Japanese Army established the comfort stations to prevent venereal diseases and rape by Japanese soldiers, to provide comfort to soldiers and head off espionage. According to Japanese historian [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]], however, the comfort stations did not solve, but aggravated the first two problems. Yoshimi has asserted, "The Japanese Imperial Army feared most that the simmering discontentment of the soldiers could explode into a riot and revolt. That is why it provided women".&lt;ref name="korea.net2007-11-30"&gt;{{Harvnb|korea.net 2007-11-30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outline ====
The first comfort station was established in the Japanese concession in Shanghai in 1932. Earlier comfort women were Japanese prostitutes who volunteered for such service. However, as Japan continued military expansion, the military found itself short of Japanese volunteers, and turned to the local population to coerce women into serving in these stations, or abducted them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitchell|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many women responded to calls for work as factory workers or nurses, and did not know that they were being pressed into [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref name=deceived&gt;"[…] Pak (her surname) was about 17, living in Hamun, Korea, when local Korean officials, acting on orders from the Japanese, began recruiting women for factory work. Someone from Pak's house had to go. In April 1942, turned Pak and other young women over to the Japanese, who took them into China, not into factories […]", {{Harvnb|Horn|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages of the war, Japanese authorities recruited prostitutes through conventional means. In urban areas, conventional advertising through middlemen was used alongside kidnapping. Middlemen advertised in newspapers circulating in Japan and the Japanese colonies of [[Korea]], Taiwan, [[Manchukuo]], and China. These sources soon dried up, especially from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=100–101, 105–106, 110–111}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1997|pp=66–67, 119, 131, 142–143}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Ministerie van Buitenlandse zaken|1994|pp=6–9, 11, 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs resisted further issuance of travel visas for Japanese prostitutes, feeling it tarnished the image of the Japanese Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=82–83}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1997|pp=223–228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The military turned to acquiring comfort women outside mainland Japan, mostly from Korea and occupied China. An existing system of licensed prostitution within Korea made it easy for Japan to recruit females in large numbers.&lt;ref name="wender" /&gt;

Many women were tricked or defrauded into joining the military brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=101–105, 113, 116–117}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1997|pp=8–9, 14}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Clancey|1948|p=1021}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Office of War Interrogation Report No.49 indicates that Korean girls misunderstood the nature of the service as treating wounds or generally making the soldiers happy.[http://www.sdh-fact.com/CL02_4/8_S1.pdf] Based on false characterizations and payment from the Japanese recruitment agents which can help relieve family debts, many Korean girls enlisted to take the job. Furthermore, the South East Asia Translation and Interrogation Center(SEATIC) Psychological Warfare Interrogation Bulletin No.2 states that a Japanese facility manager purchased Korean women for 300 to 1000 yen depending on her physical characteristics, who then became his property and were not released even after completing the servitude terms specified in the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Argibay|2003|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Hebei province of China [[Hui people|Hui Muslim]] girls were recruited to "Huimin Girls' school" to be trained as entertainers, but then forced to serve as sex slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=LEI |first=Wan |date=February 2010 |title=The Chinese Islamic "Goodwill Mission to the Middle East" During the Anti-Japanese War |url=https://www.academia.edu/4427135 |journal=Dîvân Disiplinlerarasi Çalişmalar Dergisi |volume=15 |issue=29 |page=141 |doi= |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318035752/http://www.academia.edu/4427135/The_Chinese_Islamic_Goodwill_Mission_to_the_Middle_East_-_Japonyaya_Karsi_Savasta_Cinli_Muslumanlarin_Orta_Dogu_iyi_Niyet_Heyeti_-_Wan_LEI |archivedate=March 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that a major issue that no historian has examined is whether the soldiers of the [[Indian National Army]] "...were permitted to share in the "comfort" provided by thousands of kidnapped Korean young women held as sex slaves by the Imperial Japanese Army at its camps. This might have provided them with some insight into the nature of Japanese, as opposed to British, colonial rule, as well what might be in store for their sisters and daughters."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge; Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 1082.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the strain of the war effort, the military became unable to provide enough supplies to Japanese units; in response, the units made up the difference by demanding or looting supplies from the locals. The military often directly demanded that local leaders procure women for the brothels along the front lines, especially in the countryside where middlemen were rare. When the locals were considered hostile in China, Japanese soldiers carried out the [[Sanko sakusen|"Three Alls Policy"]] ("kill all-burn all-loot all") which included indiscriminately kidnapping and raping local civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fujiwara|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Himeta|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bix|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking women from other Asian countries occupied by Japan to serve as "comfort women" was intended by the Japanese state to symbolically "castrate" other Asian men to show that they could not defend their women as fathers, brothers, husbands or boyfriends (the ultimate failure of a man in the patriarchal, Confucian cultures of East Asia) and to degrade the women themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watanabe|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Later archives ====
On April 17, 2007, Yoshiaki Yoshimi and [[Hirofumi Hayashi]] announced the discovery of seven official documents in the archives of the Tokyo Trials, suggesting that Imperial military forces – such as the ''[[Tokubetsu Keisatsutai|Tokkeitai]]'' (Naval military police) – forced women whose fathers attacked the ''[[Kenpeitai]]'' (Army military police) to work in front-line brothels in China, Indochina, and Indonesia. These documents were initially made public at the [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] trial. In one of these, a lieutenant is quoted as confessing to having organized a brothel and having used it himself. Another source refers to ''Tokkeitai'' members having arrested women on the streets and putting them in brothels after enforced medical examinations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshida 2007-04-18|Ref=JapanTimes2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 2007, journalist Taichiro Kajimura announced the discovery of 30 Dutch government documents submitted to the [[Tokyo tribunal]] as evidence of a forced mass prostitution incident in 1944 in [[Magelang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Japan Times 2007-05-12|Ref=CITEREFJapanTimes2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean government designated Bae Jeong-ja as a pro-Japanese collaborator (''[[chinilpa]]'') in September 2007 for recruiting comfort women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bae 2007-09-17|Ref=KoreaTimes2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://japanese.joins.com/article/article.php?aid=91235 "宋秉畯ら第２期親日反民族行為者２０２人を選定"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206101007/http://japanese.joins.com/article/article.php?aid=91235 |date=2009-02-06 }}, [[JoongAng Ilbo]], 2007.09.17. "日本軍慰安婦を募集したことで悪名高いベ・ジョンジャ"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, China produced almost 90 documents from the archives of the [[Kwantung Army]] on the issue. According to China, the documents provide ironclad proof that the Japanese military forced Asian women to work in front-line brothels before and during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/japan-second-world-war-brothels-papers-china |title=Papers prove Japan forced women into second world war brothels, says China |last1=McCurry |first1=Justin |last2=Kaiman |first2=Jonathan |date=April 28, 2014 |website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428131855/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/japan-second-world-war-brothels-papers-china |archivedate=April 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, more official documents were made public from the government of Japan's archives, documenting sexual violence and women forced into sexual slavery, committed by Imperial Japanese soldiers in French Indochina and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Kimura, Kayoko, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/03/04/voices/stance-comfort-women-undermines-fight-end-wartime-sexual-violence/#.VPhK640cQ5s Stance on ‘comfort women’ undermines fight to end wartime sexual violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306045858/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/03/04/voices/stance-comfort-women-undermines-fight-end-wartime-sexual-violence/ |date=2015-03-06 }}", ''[[Japan Times]]'', March 5, 2014, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study examined archival data which was previously difficult to access, partly due to the [[Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China|China-Japan Joint Communiqué of 1972]] in which the Chinese government agreed not to seek any restitution for wartime crimes and incidents. New documents discovered in China shed light on facilities inside comfort stations operated within a Japanese army compound, and the conditions of the Korean comfort women. Documents were discovered verifying the Japanese Army as the funding agency for purchasing some comfort women.

Documents were found in Shanghai that showed details of how the Japanese Army went about opening comfort stations for Japanese troops in occupied Shanghai. Documents included the [[Tianjin]] Municipal Archives from the archival files of the Japanese government and the Japanese police during the periods of the occupation in World War II. Municipal archives from [[Shanghai]] and [[Nanjing]] were also examined. One conclusion reached was that the relevant archives in Korea are distorted. A conclusion of the study was that the Japanese Imperial government, and the colonial government in Korea, tried to avoid recording the illegal mobilization of comfort women. It was concluded that they burned most of the records immediately before the surrender; but, the study confirmed that some documents and records survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = SinCheol | last2 = Han | first2 = Hye-in | title = Comfort women: a focus on recent findings from Korea and China | journal = Asian Journal of Women's Studies (AJWS) | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–64 | doi = 10.1080/12259276.2015.1029229 | date = January 2015 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of comfort women ===
Lack of official documentation has made estimating the total number of comfort women difficult. Vast amounts of material pertaining to war crimes, and the responsibility of the nation's highest leaders, were destroyed on the orders of the Japanese government at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Burning of Confidential Documents by Japanese Government'', case no.43, serial 2, International Prosecution Section vol. 8;&lt;br /&gt;"When it became apparent that Japan would be forced to surrender, an organized effort was made to burn or otherwise destroy all documents and other evidence of ill-treatment of prisoners of war and civilian internees. The Japanese Minister of War issued an order on 14 August 1945 to all Army headquarters that confidential documents should be destroyed by fire immediately. On the same day, the Commandant of the Kempetai sent out instructions to the various Kempetai Headquarters detailing the methods of burning large quantities of documents efficiently.", {{Harvnb|Clancey|1948|p=1135}};&lt;br /&gt;"[…] , the actual number of comfort women remains unclear because the Japanese army incinerated many crucial documents right after the defeat for fear of war crimes prosecution, […]", {{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|p=91}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Bix|2000|p=528}};&lt;br /&gt;"Between the announcement of a ceasefire on August 15, 1945, and the arrival of small advance parties of American troops in Japan on August 28, Japanese military and civil authorities systematically destroyed military, naval, and government archives, much of which was from the period 1942–1945. Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo dispatched enciphered messages to field commands throughout the Pacific and East Asia ordering units to burn incriminating evidence of war crimes, especially offenses against prisoners of war. The director of Japan's Military History Archives of the National Institute for Defense Studies estimated in 2003 that as much as 70 percent of the army's wartime records were burned or otherwise destroyed.", {{Harvnb|Drea|2006|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have arrived at various estimates by looking at surviving documentation, which indicates the ratio of soldiers in a particular area to the number of women, and replacement rates of the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nakamura 2007-03-20|Ref=JapanTimes2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi, who conducted the first academic study on the topic and brought the issue out into the open, estimated the number to be between 50,000 and 200,000.&lt;ref name="AWF_CW10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asian Women'sFund|p=10|Ref=AWF-CW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these estimates, most international media sources quote about 200,000 young women were kidnapped by Japanese soldiers to serve in military brothels. The BBC quotes "200,000 to 300,000", and the [[International Commission of Jurists]] quotes "estimates of historians of 100,000 to 200,000 women."&lt;ref&gt;"An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 women across Asia, predominantly Korean and Chinese, are believed to have been forced to work as sex slaves in Japanese military brothels", {{Harvnb|BBC 2000-12-08|Ref=BBC2000-12-08}};&lt;br /&gt;

According to [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] professor [[Yoshiko Nozaki]] and other sources, the majority of the women were from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nozaki|2005}};&lt;br /&gt;

{{Harvnb|Soh|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chuo University professor Yoshiaki Yoshimi states there were about 2,000 centers where as many as 200,000 Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Taiwanese, Burmese, Indonesian, Dutch and Australian women were interned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=91, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ikuhiko Hata]], a professor of [[Nihon University]], estimated the number of women working in the licensed pleasure quarter was fewer than 20,000 and that they were 40% Japanese, 20% Koreans, 10% Chinese, with others making up the remaining 30%. According to Hata, the total number of government-regulated prostitutes in Japan was only 170,000 during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hata|1999}}&lt;br /&gt;
"Hata essentially equates the 'comfort women' system with prostitution and finds similar practices during the war in other countries. He has been criticized by other Japanese scholars for downplaying the hardship of the 'comfort women'.", {{Harvnb|Drea|2006|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others came from the Philippines, Taiwan, [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Dutch East Indies]], and other Japanese-occupied countries and regions.&lt;ref name="workingpaper"&gt;{{Harvnb|Soh|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women, captured in Dutch colonies in Asia, were also forced into sexual slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|chosun.com 2007-03-19}};&lt;br /&gt;

In further analysis of the Imperial Army medical records for venereal disease treatment from 1940, Yoshimi concluded that if the percentages of women treated reflected the general makeup of the total comfort women population, Korean women comprised 51.8 percent, Chinese 36 percent and Japanese 12.2 percent.&lt;ref name="korea.net2007-11-30" /&gt;

In 1997, [[Bruce Cumings]], a historian of Korea, wrote that Japan had forced quotas to supply the comfort women program, and that Korean men helped recruit the victims.

A Dutch government study described how the Japanese military itself seized the women by force in the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ministerie van Buitenlandse zaken|1994|pp=6–9, 11, 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that among the 200 to 300 European women found in the Japanese military brothels, “some sixty five were most certainly forced into prostitution.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awf.or.jp/e1/netherlands.html|title=Digital Museum: The Comfort Women Issue and the Asian Women's Fund|publisher=|accessdate=November 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181010/http://www.awf.or.jp/e1/netherlands.html|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Dutch women, many Javanese were also recruited from Indonesia as comfort women. Most were adolescent girls aged 14–19 who had completed some education and were deceived through promises of higher education in Tokyo or Singapore. Common destinations of comfort women from Java included Burma, Thailand, and Eastern Indonesia. Interviews conducted with former comfort women also suggest that some women came from the island of Flores. After the war, many Javanese comfort women who survived stayed in the locations where they had been trafficked to and became integrated into local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pramoedya|2001}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, only one Japanese woman has published her testimony. This was done in 1971, when a former comfort woman forced to work for Showa soldiers in Taiwan, published her memoirs under the pseudonym of Suzuko Shirota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|China Daily 2007-07-06|Ref=ChinaDaily2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment of comfort women ===
Approximately three quarters of comfort women died, and most survivors were left infertile due to sexual trauma or sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |origyear=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&amp;dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=978-90-5095-533-1 |page=8 |year= 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatings and physical torture were said to be common.&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; The women who were not prostitutes prior to joining the "comfort women corps", especially those taken in by force, were normally "broken in" by being raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1996|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Korean woman, [[Kim Hak-sun]] stated in a 1991 interview about how she was drafted into the "comfort women corps" in 1941: "When I was 17 years old, the Japanese soldiers came along in a truck, beat us [her and a friend], and then dragged us into the back. I was told if I were drafted, I could earn lots of money in a textile factory...The first day I was raped and the rapes never stopped...I was born a woman but never lived as a woman...I feel sick when I come close to a man. Not just Japanese men, but all men-even my own husband who saved me from the brothel. I shiver whenever I see a Japanese flag...Why should I feel ashamed? I don't have to feel ashamed."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{harvnb|Watanabe|1999|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim stated that she was raped 30–40 times a day, everyday of the year during her time as a "comfort woman".&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{harvnb|Watanabe|1999|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting their dehumanized status, Army and Navy records where referring to the movement of "comfort women" always used the term "units of war supplies".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1996|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Japanese Army doctor, Asō Tetsuo testified that the "comfort women" were seen as "female ammunition" and as "public toilets", as literally just things to be used and abused, with some "comfort women" being forced to donate blood for the treatment of wounded soldiers.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; At least 80% of the "comfort women" were Korean, who were assigned to the lower ranks while Japanese and European women went to the officers. For example, Dutch women captured in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) were reserved exclusively for the officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watanabe|1999|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korea is a Confucian country where premarital sex was widely disapproved of, and since the Korean teenagers taken into the "comfort women corps" were almost always virgins, it was felt that this was the best way to limit the spread of venereal diseases that would otherwise incapacitate soldiers and sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watanabe|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten Dutch women were taken by force from prison camps in Java by officers of the Japanese Imperial Army to become forced sex slaves in February 1944. They were systematically beaten and raped day and night.&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="denial"&gt;{{Harvnb|Onishi 2007-03-08|Ref=CITEREFNY Times2007-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a victim of the incident, in 1990, [[Jan Ruff-O'Herne]] testified to a U.S. House of Representatives committee:
{{quote|Many stories have been told about the horrors, brutalities, suffering and starvation of Dutch women in Japanese prison camps. But one story was never told, the most shameful story of the worst human rights abuse committed by the Japanese during World War II: The story of the “Comfort Women”, the jugun ianfu, and how these women were forcibly seized against their will, to provide sexual services for the Japanese Imperial Army. In the “comfort station” I was systematically beaten and raped day and night. Even the Japanese doctor raped me each time he visited the brothel to examine us for venereal disease.&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Herne|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denial" /&gt;}}

In their first morning at the brothel, photographs of Ruff-O'Herne and the others were taken and placed on the veranda which was used as a reception area for the Japanese personnel who would choose from these photographs. Over the following four months the girls were raped and beaten day and night, with those who became pregnant forced to have abortions. After four harrowing months, the girls were moved to a camp at Bogor, in West Java, where they were reunited with their families. This camp was exclusively for women who had been put into military brothels, and the Japanese warned the inmates that if anyone told what had happened to them, they and their family members would be killed. Several months later the O'Hernes were transferred to a camp at Batavia, which was liberated on August 15, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/talkingheads/txt/s2492804.htm Jan Ruff-O'Herne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410193631/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/talkingheads/txt/s2492804.htm |date=2012-04-10 }}, ''"Talking Heads"'' transcriptabc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlliesAdversity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/australian-sex-slave-seeks-apology/2007/02/13/1171128950424.html "Australian sex slave seeks apology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213063315/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/australian-sex-slave-seeks-apology/2007/02/13/1171128950424.html |date=2011-12-13 }}, February 13, 2007, The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hank Nelson]], emeritus professor at the [[Australian National University]]'s Asia Pacific Research Division, has written about the brothels run by the Japanese military in [[Rabaul]], in what is now [[Papua New Guinea]] during WWII. He quotes from the diary of Gordon Thomas, a POW in Rabaul. Thomas writes that the women working at the brothels "most likely served 25 to 35 men a day" and that they were "victims of the yellow slave trade".&lt;ref name="Nelson_rabaul"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson also quotes from Kentaro Igusa, a Japanese naval surgeon who was stationed in Rabaul. Igusa wrote in his memoirs that the women continued to work through infection and severe discomfort, though they "cried and begged for help".&lt;ref name="Nelson_rabaul" /&gt;

During the last stand of Japanese forces in 1944–45, "comfort women" were often forced to commit suicide or were killed.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1996|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Truk naval base, 70 "comfort women" were killed prior to the expected American assault as the Navy mistook the American air raid that destroyed Truk as the prelude to an American landing while during the Battle of Saipan "comfort women" were among those who committed suicide by jumping off the cliffs of Saipan.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; The Japanese government had told the Japanese colonists on Saipan that the American "white devils" were cannibals, and so the Japanese population preferred suicide to falling into the hands of the American "white devils". In Burma, there were cases of Korean "comfort women" committing suicide by swallowing cyanide pills or being killed by having a hand grenade tossed into their dug-outs.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; During the Battle of Manila, when Japanese sailors ran amok and simply killed everyone, there were cases of "comfort women" being killed, through does not seem to have any systematic policy of killing "comfort women".&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Japanese propaganda had it that the Anglo-American "white devils" were cannibals whose favorite food were Asians, and it is possible that many of the Asian "comfort women" may have actually believed this, and so preferred suicide to the supposed horrors of being eaten alive by the "white devils". British soldiers fighting in Burma often reported that the Korean "comfort women" whom they captured were astonished to learn that the British were not going to eat them.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Ironically, given this claim, there were cases of starving Japanese troops cut off on remote Pacific islands or trapped in the jungles of Burma turning towards cannibalism, and there were at least several cases where "comfort women" in Burma and on Pacific islands were killed to provide protein for the Japanese Army.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

=== Sterility, abortion and reproduction ===
The Japanese Army and Navy went to great lengths to avoid venereal diseases with large numbers of condoms being handed out for free.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1996|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, documents show that in July 1943 the Army handed out 1,000 condoms for soldiers in Negri Sembilan and another 10,000 for soldiers in Perak.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The "comfort women" were usually injected with [[Oxytetracycline|terramycin]] or [[Arsphenamine|salvarsan]] every time after intercourse, which together with damage to the vagina caused by rape or rough sex were the causes of unusually high rates of sterility among the "comfort women".&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; As the war went on and as the shortages caused by the sinking of almost the entire Japanese merchant marine by American submarines kicked in, medical care for the "comfort women" declined as dwindling medical supplies were reserved for the servicemen.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; As Japanese logistics broke down as the American submarines sunk one Japanese ship after another, condoms had to be washed and reused, reducing their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; In the Philippines, "comfort women" were billed by Japanese doctors if they required medical treatment.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; In many cases, "comfort women" who were seriously ill were abandoned to die alone.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The Survey of Korean Comfort Women Used by Japanese Soldiers said that 30% of the interviewed former Korean comfort women produced biological children and 20% adopted children after World War II.&lt;!--The preceding information is in the second sentence of the second paragraph.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhee Devine, Maija.

In 1973, a man named [[Kakou Senda]] wrote a book about the comfort women system that focused on Japanese participants. His book has been widely criticized as distorting the facts by both Japanese and South Korean historians.&lt;ref&gt;韓国挺身隊問題対策協議会・挺身隊研究会 （編）『証言・強制連行された朝鮮人軍慰安婦たち』 明石書店 1993年&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first postwar mention of the comfort women system and became an important source for 1990s activism on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soh|2009|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book written by a Korean on the subject of comfort women appeared in 1981. However, it was a [[plagiarism]] of a 1976 Japanese book by the [[Koreans in Japan|zainichi]] author Kim Il-Myeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soh|2009|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/md_basic.asp?nation=K&amp;p_dataid=02808|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519103834/http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/md_basic.asp?nation=K&amp;p_dataid=02808|title=KMDb|archivedate=May 19, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the testimony of [[Seiji Yoshida]] was translated into Korean. His book was debunked as fraudulent by some Japanese and Korean journalists, and in May 1996 Yoshida admitted that his memoir was fictional, stating in an interview by Shūkan Shinchō that "There is no profit in writing the truth in books. Hiding the facts and mixing them with your own assertions is something that newspapers do all the time too".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nikkanberita.com/read2.cgi?id=200703061151072|work=Nikkan Berita|date=March 6, 2007|accessdate=January 24, 2008|title=勇気ある告発者か詐話師か？吉田清治を再考する {{bracket|A brave whistleblower or a swindler?

On March 27 the Japanese parliament issued an official apology.&lt;ref name=Time2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Fastenberg|first=Dan|title=Top 10 National Apologies: Japanese Sex Slavery|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1997272_1997273_1997286,00.html|accessdate=December 29, 2011|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 17, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107224836/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1997272_1997273_1997286,00.html|archivedate=January 7, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 20, 2014, Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Yoshihide Suga]] said that the Japanese government may reconsider the study and the apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stripes.com/japan-may-review-probe-on-wwii-sex-slavery-1.268811 |title=Japan may review probe on WWII sex slavery |date=February 20, 2014 |website=www.stripes.com |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=February 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226072406/http://www.stripes.com/japan-may-review-probe-on-wwii-sex-slavery-1.268811 |archivedate=February 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Prime Minister Abe clarified on March 14, 2014, that he had no intention of renouncing or altering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/106893.php? |title=Abe says won't alter 1993 apology on 'comfort women' |date=March 14, 2014 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314085619/http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/106893.php |archivedate=March 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 2015, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President [[Park Geun-hye]] reached a formal agreement to settle the dispute. Japan agreed to pay [[Japanese yen|¥]]1 billion ([[Korean won|₩]]9.7 billion; [[US dollar|$]]8.3 million) to a fund supporting surviving victims while South Korea agreed to refrain from criticizing Japan regarding the issue and to work to remove a statue memorializing the victims from in front of the Japanese embassy in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adelstein|first1=Jake|last2=Kubo|first2=Angela|title=South Korea and Japan 'finally and irreversibly' reconcile on World War II sex slaves|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-korean-sex-slaves-20151228-story.html|accessdate=28 December 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 28, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228100740/http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-korean-sex-slaves-20151228-story.html|archivedate=28 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement came after Japan's Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] met his counterpart Yun Byung-se in Seoul, and later Prime Minister Shinzo Abe phoned President Park Geun-hye to repeat an apology already offered by Kishida.

It was also managed hasty handling on this crucial issue as previous Korean Government stressed the matter of legal responsibility, but it's removed on the agreement.

On February 16, 2016, the [[United Nations]]' "Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women", Seventh and Eighth Periodic Reports, was held, with Shinsuke Sugiyama, Deputy Minister for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)]], reiterating the official and final agreement between Japan and South Korea to pay ¥1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/human/conv_women/index.html |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan |accessdate=September 9, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909233658/http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/human/conv_women/index.html |archivedate=September 9, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|title= Summary of remarks by Mr. Shinsuke Sugiyama, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Question and Answer session|url= http://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000140100.pdf|publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|accessdate= September 9, 2017|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170910040018/http://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000140100.pdf|archivedate= September 10, 2017|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugiyama also restated the Japanese Government apology of that agreement: "The issue of comfort women, with an involvement of the Japanese military authorities at that time, was a grave affront to the honor and dignity of large numbers of women, and the Government of Japan is painfully aware of responsibilities."&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

In Aug 2016, Twelve survivors of sexual enslavement by the Japanese military, filed suit against the government of South Korea, demanding that the government had nullified the victims’ individual rights to claim damages from Japan by signing an agreement not to demand further legal responsibility without consulting with the victims themselves. The deal also violated a 2011 Constitutional Court ruling obliging that the South Korean government “offer its cooperation and protection so that citizens whose human dignity and values have been violated through illegal actions perpetrated by Japan can invoke their rights to demand damages from Japan.”&lt;ref name="http://english.hani.co.kr- 17 June 2018" &gt;{{cite web |title=Court dismisses comfort women's suit against government for signing 2015 agreement with Japan |url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/849403.html |website=Hank Yoreh |accessdate=13 October 2018 |date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

on 15 June 2018, Seoul Central District Court published the decision, the court announced that the intergovernmental comfort women agreement “certainly lacked transparency or was deficient in recognizing ‘legal responsibility’ and on the nature of the one billion yen provided by the Japanese government.” However, an audit of the process and content leading up to the agreement cannot be seen as discharging the plaintiffs’ right to claim damages.”&lt;ref name="http://english.hani.co.kr- 17 June 2018" /&gt;

On 18 Aug 2018, [[United Nations]] rights experts and [[United Nations|UN]] Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; committee member Gay McDougall expressed that Japan should do more for sufferers of wartime sexual slavery. Mainstream archaeologists state maximum number 200,000 women were forced to serve in Japanese military brothels during World War II, mostly from Korea but also from other countries: China and the Philippines.&lt;ref name="www.sbs.com.au"&gt;http://www.sbs.com.au - 29 December 2015:[https://www.sbs.com.au/news/japan-must-do-more-for-wwii-comfort-women-un ''Japan must do more for WWII 'comfort women': UN ’ | www.sbs.com.au'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===
&lt;!--Controversies over memorials should generally go in the memorial section. This is about main issue controversies--&gt;

The novel ''My War Crime'', written by Seiji Yoshida in 1983, which played a major role in publicizing the issue of comfort women, was later found to be fiction, causing the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' newspaper to publish several retractions and apologies to its readers, as recently as 2014.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

In recent years, a number of Japanese sources have denied or minimized the issue of comfort women.

A 2001 comic book, ''[[Neo Gomanism Manifesto Special – On Taiwan]]'' by Japanese author [[Yoshinori Kobayashi]], depicts kimono-clad women lining up to sign up for duty before a Japanese soldier. Kobayashi's book contains an interview with Taiwanese industrialist [[Shi Wen-long]], who stated that no women were forced to serve and that the women worked in more hygienic conditions compared to regular prostitutes because the use of [[condom]]s was mandatory.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Harvnb|Landler 2001-03-02|Ref=NY Times2001-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2001, in a controversy involving national public broadcaster [[NHK]], what was supposed to be coverage of the [[Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery]] was heavily edited to reflect revisionist views.&lt;ref&gt;"However, the second night's programming on January 30 was heavily censored through deletion, interpolations, alterations, dismemberment and even fabrication. This segment was originally supposed to cover the 'Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery' that had been held in Tokyo in December 2000.", {{Harvnb|Yoneyama|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the new president of NHK compared the wartime Japanese comfort women program to Asian brothels frequented by American troops, which western historians countered by pointing out the difference between the Japanese comfort stations, which forced women to have sex with Japanese troops, and Asian brothels, where women chose to be prostitutes for American troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/world/asia/nationalistic-remarks-from-japan-lead-to-warnings-of-chill-with-us.html |title=Nationalistic Remarks From Japan Lead to Warnings of Chill With U.S. |last1=FACKLER |first1=MARTIN |date=February 19, 2014 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=February 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220080749/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/world/asia/nationalistic-remarks-from-japan-lead-to-warnings-of-chill-with-us.html |archivedate=February 20, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In publications around 2007, Japanese historian and Nihon University professor [[Ikuhiko Hata]] estimates the number of comfort women to have been more likely between 10,000 and 20,000.&lt;ref name="AWF_CW10-11" /&gt; Hata claims that "none of [the comfort women] were forcibly recruited".&lt;ref&gt;"None of them was forcibly recruited.", {{Harvnb|Hata undated|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Foreign Minister [[Hirofumi Nakasone]] chaired a commission established to consider "concrete measures to restore Japan's honor with regard to the comfort women issue", despite the conflict of interest that his own father [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] organized a "comfort station" in 1942 when he was a lieutenant paymaster in Japan's Imperial Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/opinion/comfort-women-and-japans-war-on-truth.html "Comfort women and Japan's war on truth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115080504/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/opinion/comfort-women-and-japans-war-on-truth.html |date=2014-11-15 }} – The New York Times – Nov 15–16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International support ===
The cause has long been supported beyond the victim nations, and associations like [[Amnesty International]] are campaigning in countries where governments have yet to support the cause, like in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/svaw/comments/21574/ |title=Justice for comfort women – our achievements |work=Amnesty Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329015834/http://www.amnesty.org.au/svaw/comments/21574/ |archivedate=2014-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.nz/files/Comfort-Women-factsheet.pdf "Stop violence against women: "Comfort Women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627073739/http://www.amnesty.org.nz/files/Comfort-Women-factsheet.pdf |date=2014-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support in the United States continues to grow, particularly after the [[United States House of Representatives House Resolution 121]] was passed on July 30, 2007, asking the Japanese government to redress the situation and to incorporate internationally accepted actual historical facts about this program into their educational system. In July 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a strong advocate of the cause, denounced the use of the euphemism 'comfort women' for what should be referred to as 'enforced sex slaves'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/clinton-says-comfort-women-should-be-referred-to-as-enforced-sex-slaves|title=Clinton says 'comfort women' should be referred to as 'enforced sex slaves' ' Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama Administration also addressed the need for Japan to do more to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/02/21/white_house_japan_should_do_more_to_address_comfort_women_issue|title=White House: Japan should do more to address 'comfort women' issue|work=Foreign Policy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330062418/http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/02/21/white_house_japan_should_do_more_to_address_comfort_women_issue|archivedate=2014-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to calling attention to the issue, the American memorial statues erected in New Jersey in 2010 and California in 2013 show support for what has become an international cause.&lt;ref name="latimes1" /&gt;

On December 13, 2007, the [[European Parliament]] adopted a resolution on "Justice for the 'Comfort Women' (sex slaves in Asia before and during World War II)" calling on the Japanese government to apologise and accept legal responsibility for the coercion of young women into sexual slavery before and during WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Parliament resolution of 13 December 2007 on Justice for the 'Comfort Women' (sex slaves in Asia before and during World War II)|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2007-0632+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|website=European Parliament|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105173013/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FTEXT+TA+P6-TA-2007-0632+0+DOC+XML+V0%2F%2FEN|archivedate=5 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called for Japan to, as the Committee's deputy head Anastasia Crickley put it, "conclude investigations into the violations of the rights of ‘comfort women’ by the military and to bring to justice those responsible and to pursue a comprehensive and lasting resolution to these issues".&lt;ref name="japantimes.co.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/30/national/u-n-issues-fresh-call-japan-world-war-ii-comfort-women/|title=U.N. issues fresh call to Japan over World War II 'comfort women' – The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904020620/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/30/national/u-n-issues-fresh-call-japan-world-war-ii-comfort-women/|archivedate=2014-09-04|df=|date=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.N.

=== Health-related issues ===

=== Survivors ===
The last surviving victims have become public figures in Korea, where they are referred to as "halmoni", the affectionate term for "grandmother". There is a nursing home, called [[House of Sharing]], for former comfort women in South Korea.

== Asahi Shimbun Third-Party Investigative Committee ==
In August 2014, the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second largest newspaper in circulation, retracted 16 articles published between 1982 and 1997. The articles were concerned with former imperial army officer Seiji Yoshida, who claimed he had forcibly taken Korean women to wartime Japanese military brothels from the Jeju island region in South Korea. Following the retraction of the articles, the newspaper also refused to publish an op-ed on the matter by Japanese journalist Akira Ikegami. The public response and criticism that ensued pushed the newspaper to nominate a third-party investigative committee headed by seven leading scholars, journalists and legal experts. The committee report dealt with the circumstances leading to the publication of Yoshida's false testimony and to the effect these publications had on Japan's image abroad and diplomatic relations with various countries. It found that the Asahi was negligent in publishing Yoshida's testimony, but that the reports on the testimony had "limited" effect on foreign media outlets and reports. On the other hand, the report found that Japanese officials comments on the issue had a far more detrimental effect on Japan's image and its diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;The Asahi Shimbun Co.

=== China ===
On December 1, 2015, the first memorial hall dedicated to Chinese comfort women was opened in [[Nanjing]]. It was built on a site of former comfort station run by the invading Japanese troops during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorial hall for 'comfort women' opens to public in Nanjing|url=http://www.china.org.cn/travel/2015-12/02/content_37215372_2.htm|agency=China.org.cn|date=December 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202125504/http://china.org.cn/travel/2015-12/02/content_37215372_2.htm|archivedate=December 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The memorial hall stands next to the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]].

In June 2016, Research Center for Chinese Comfort Women was established at [[Shanghai Normal University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Comfort women' museum opens in Shanghai|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/80thendoflongmarch/2016-10/22/content_27142999.htm|publisher=China Daily|date=Oct 22, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023183751/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/80thendoflongmarch/2016-10/22/content_27142999.htm|archivedate=2016-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a museum that exhibits photographs and various items related to comfort women in China.

Every Wednesday, living comfort women, women's organizations, socio-civic groups, religious groups, and a number of individuals participate in the Wednesday Demonstrations in front of the Japanese Embassy in [[Seoul]], sponsored by “The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (KCWDMSS)”. It was first held on January 8, 1992, when Japan's Prime Minister, Miyazawa, visited the South Korea. In December 2011, a [[Statue of peace|statue of a young woman]] was erected in front of the Japanese Embassy to honor the comfort women on the 1,000th Wednesday Demonstration. The Japanese government has repeatedly asked the South Korean government to have the statue taken down, but it has not been.

On 28 December 2015, the Japanese government claimed that the Korean government agreed the removal of the statue. As of 3 September 2016, the statue was still in place due to a majority of the South Korean population being opposed to the agreement. On 30 December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/30/national/comfort-woman-statue-installed-near-japanese-consulate-busan/|title=‘Comfort women’ statue installed near Japanese consulate in Busan|date=30 December 2016|publisher=|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; another comfort woman statue identical to the one in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul was erected in front of the Japanese consulate in [[Busan]], South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/05/asia/south-korea-comfort-women-statue/|title=Why this statue of a young girl caused a diplomatic incident|first=Sol Han and James Griffiths,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 6 January 2017, the Japanese government is attempting to negotiate the removal of the statue. On May 11, 2017, newly elected South Korean President [[Moon Jae-in]] announced the agreement would not be enacted in its current stage and that negotiations for a deal between Japan and South Korea over the comfort women dispute had to start over.&lt;ref name=may112017&gt;{{cite news|title=South Korea's new president questions Japan 'comfort women' deal|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/11/asia/south-korea-japan-comfort-women/|publisher=CNN|date=11 May 2017|author=James Griffiths|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511111804/http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/11/asia/south-korea-japan-comfort-women/|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2017, the local government of Busan enacted the legal foundation to protect the Statue of Peace by passing the relative ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hankookilbo.com/v/db0cd7a3eb2d452c892a75de115a6f40|title=부산 소녀상 보호, 법적 근거 마련됐다|website=한국일보}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reason of this, it has become difficult to shift the site or demolish the statue.

On 14 August 2018, South Korea held an unveiling ceremony for a monument memorializing Korean women forced to work in wartime brothels for the Japanese military, as the nation observed its first official "comfort women" memorial day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180814/p2g/00m/0in/093000c|title=S.

On 21 November 2018, South Korea officially cancelled the 2015 agreement and shut down the Japan-funded comfort women foundation which was launched in July 2016 to finance the agreement's controversial settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5460954/seoul-close-japan-sex-slavery-foundation/|title=South Korea Shuts Japanese-Funded 'Comfort Women' Foundation|author=Kim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press|website=Time|date=November 21, 2018|accessdate=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/world/asia/south-korea-japan-sex-slaves.html|title=South Korea Signals End to ‘Final’ Deal With Japan Over Wartime Sex Slaves|author=Choe Sang-Hun|publisher=New York Times|date=November 21, 2018|accessdate=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement received criticism after the ministry of former President [[Park Geun-hye]] refused to ask for consent from the comfort women before it was agreed to.&lt;ref name=may112017 /&gt;

==== House of Sharing ====
{{Main|House of Sharing}}

The [[House of Sharing]] is a nursing home for living comfort women. The House of Sharing was founded in June 1992 through funds raised by Buddhist organizations and various socio-civic groups and it moved to [[Gyeonggi-do]], South Korea in 1998. The House of Sharing includes “The Museum of Sexual Slavery by Japanese Military” to spread the truth about the Japanese military's brutal abuse of comfort women and to educate descendants and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanum.org/eng/index.html|title=Welcom Nanum House!|publisher=|accessdate=November 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024343/http://nanum.org/eng/index.html|archivedate=October 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Archives by comfort women ====
Some of the survivors, Kang Duk-kyung, Kim Soon-duk and Lee Yong-Nyeo, preserved their personal history through their drawings as a visual archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329094315/http://www.womenandwar.net/contents/board/gallery/galleryList.nx?page_str_menu=2403|title=한국정신대문제대책협의회|date=29 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the director of the [[Center for Asian American Media]], Dai Sil Kim-Gibson, made a comfort women video archive, a documentary film for K–12 through college level students. Feminist visual and video archives have promoted a place for solidarity between the victims and the public. It has served as a living site for the teaching and learning of women's dignity and human rights by bringing people together despite age, gender, borders, nationality, and ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.womenandwar.net/contents/home/home.nx 한국정신대문제대책협의회&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103011609/https://www.womenandwar.net/contents/home/home.nx |date=2016-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, comfort women formed different groups, similar to the Korean survivors they are called "Lolas" (grandmothers). One group named "Lila Pilipina" (League of Filipino Women), which started in 1992 and is member of [[GABRIELA]], a feminist organization,&lt;ref name=gabriela /&gt; together with the [[Malaya Lolas]] (Free grandmothers) ask for a formal apology from the Japanese government, compensation, and the inclusion of the issue in the Japanese history textbooks. These groups also ask the Philippine government to back their claims against the Japanese government.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite web|title=Filipino comfort women stage protest outside Japanese embassy |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/140212/filipino-comfort-women-stage-protest-outside-japanese- |publisher=Kyodo News International |accessdate=May 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528200847/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/140212/filipino-comfort-women-stage-protest-outside-japanese- |archivedate=May 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Comfort Women' Are Old Now, But Still Fighting|url=http://womensenews.org/story/prostitution-and-trafficking/130615/comfort-women-are-old-now-still-fighting|accessdate=May 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505223817/http://womensenews.org/story/prostitution-and-trafficking/130615/comfort-women-are-old-now-still-fighting|archivedate=May 5, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have taken legal actions against Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Etsuro Totsuka|title=COMMENTARY ON A VICTORY FOR "COMFORT WOMEN": JAPAN'S JUDICIAL RECOGNITION OF MILITARY SEXUAL SLAVERY|url=https://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/825/8PacRimLPolyJ047.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=May 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528220809/https://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/825/8PacRimLPolyJ047.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=May 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; then against their own government to back their claims and, {{as of|2014|8|lc=on}}, planned to take the case the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and Children]] (CEDAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Virgil B.

Similar to the Korean grandmothers, Filipino "Lolas" have their own Grandmother house with a collection of their testimonies. Also two of them have published two autobiographic books: ''Comfort Woman: Slave of Destiny'' by [[Rosa Henson]] and ''The Hidden Battle of Leyte: The Picture Diary of a Girl Taken by the Japanese Military'' by Remedios Felias. This second book was written in the 1990s, after Lila Filipina was formed.

In [[Bulacan]], a villa house [[Bahay na Pula]] was seized by Japanese soldiers during WWII and it was used as comfort station where Filipino women were raped and held as comfort women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The house where the Philippines' forgotten 'comfort women' were held|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36537605|agency=BBC|date=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192440/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36537605|archivedate=1 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the empty house is still standing as a memorial for the forgotten Filipino comfort women.

=== Taiwan ===
[[File:Ama Museum 20160723.jpg|thumb|The [[Ama Museum]] in [[Taipei]] dedicated to Taiwanese comfort women]]
Since the 1990s, Taiwanese survivors have been bringing to light the comfort woman issue in Taiwanese society, and gaining support from women's rights activists and civil groups. Their testimony and memories have been documented by newspapers, books, and documentary films.

Survivors' claims against the Japan government have been backed by the [[Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation]] (TWRF) a non-profit organization helping women against violence, and sexual violence. This organization gives legal and psychological support to Taiwanese comfort women, and also helps in the recording of testimony and doing scholarly research. In 2007, this organization was responsible for promoting awareness in society, by creating meetings in universities and high schools where survivors gave their testimonies to students and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Logan|first1=William|last2=Reeves|first2=Keir|title=Places of Pain and Shame: Dealing with 'Difficult Heritage'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zX58AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-05149-6|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=zX58AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|chapter=7.

On August 14, 2018, the first 'comfort women' statue in Taiwan was unveiled in the city of Tainan. The statue symbolizes women forced to work in wartime brothels for the Japanese military.

*Dutch East Indies – [[Jan Ruff O'Herne]] (1923–); Ellen van der Ploeg (1923–2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jan|first1=Banning|title="Comfort Woman" Ellen van der Ploeg passed away|url=http://www.janbanning.com/comfort-woman-ellen-van-der-ploeg-passed-away/|website=Jan Banning|quote=Ellen van der Ploeg, 84, from the Netherlands. During World War II, she lived with her family in the former Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Between 1943 and 1946, date at which she was liberated, Ellen lived in five different internment camps. When she was working in one of the camps, she was turned over to a comfort station by the Imperial Japanese forces. Soldiers would cut her food rationing if she did not work hard enough. They also ignored orders to use condoms, which led to her contracting a venereal disease.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105033245/http://www.janbanning.com/comfort-woman-ellen-van-der-ploeg-passed-away/|archivedate=2016-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effendi Muara Sakti Simbolon''' (born 1 December 1964) is an Indonesian politician of [[PDI-P]] who has been a member of the [[People's Representative Council]] since 2004. Despite coming from the same political party, Simbolon was a noted critic of president [[Joko Widodo]], especially in Widodo's first years as president.
==Background==
Simbolon was born in [[Banjarmasin]], [[South Kalimantan]] on 1 December 1964. He received elementary education in [[Banjarbaru]], before moving to Jakarta where he studied in a state-funded middle school. After completing his high school at SMAN 3 Jakarta, he graduated with a bachelors in corporate management from [[Jayabaya University]] in 1988. Later on, after entering public office, he studied for a masters in politics and another degree in international relations from [[Padjadjaran University]].&lt;ref name="viva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="merdeka"&gt;{{cite news |title=Effendi M. S. Simbolon |url=https://www.merdeka.com/effendi-m-s-simbolon/profil/ |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Merdeka |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dpr"&gt;{{cite web |title=DR. EFFENDI M.S.

Simbolon is of Batak descent, and is the chairman of the Simbolon clan's association (''Punguan Simbolon Baruna Indonesia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aji |first1=Wahyu |title=Komunitas Batak Simbolon Serukan Pentingnya Jaga Pluralisme |url=http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2017/07/05/komunitas-batak-simbolon-serukan-pentingnya-jaga-pluralisme |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Tribunnews.com |date=5 July 2017 |language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Career==
Prior to being elected into office, Simbolon worked as a consultant for a fertiliser company and later in various management positions.&lt;ref name="dpr"/&gt;

Simbolon was first elected into the [[People's Representative Council]] following the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2004|2004 legislative election]].&lt;ref name="viva"&gt;{{cite news |title=Drs. Effendi M.S. Simbolon. |url=https://www.viva.co.id/arsip/1793-drs-effendi-m-s-simbolon |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=VIVA |date=8 October 2008 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simbolon was reelected in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|2009 legislative election]] after winning 59,718 votes.&lt;ref name="merdeka"/&gt; He was part of committee investigating the bailout of {{ill|Bank Century|id}}, and called for the resignation of vice president [[Boediono]] (who was governor of [[Bank Indonesia]] when the bailout happened), in addition to the firing of involved ministers including Finance Minister [[Sri Mulyani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hak angket Century disetujui DPR |url=https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/berita_indonesia/2009/12/091201_angketcentury |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=BBC Indonesia |date=1 December 2009 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his term, Simbolon ran in [[North Sumatra gubernatorial election, 2013|North Sumatra's 2013 gubernatorial election]], but lost. Later on in 2017, he declared his intent to run in the [[North Sumatra gubernatorial election, 2018|2018 gubernatorial election]], but ended up not running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wibowo |first1=Kukuh S |title=Effendi Simbolon Berniat Maju Lagi di Pilgub Sumatera Utara |url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/904721/effendi-simbolon-berniat-maju-lagi-di-pilgub-sumatera-utara |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Tempo |date=30 August 2017 |language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2014|2014 legislative election]], Simbolon was elected for his third term in DPR, winning 89,028 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inilah Daftar 109 Anggota DPR dari PDI-P Periode 2014-2019 |url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2014/05/15/1039050/Inilah.Daftar.109.Anggota.DPR.dari.PDI-P.Periode.2014-2019 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=KOMPAS. |date=15 May 2014 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the body's [[Commission I of People's Representative Council|first commission]], which handles defences and foreign relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tentang - Komisi I |url=http://www.dpr.go.id/akd/index/id/Tentang-Komisi-I |website=dpr.go.id |accessdate=17 November 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a bullet that went astray from a nearby firing range ended up in his office at the [[DPR/MPR Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rizqo |first1=Kanavino Ahmad |title=Polisi Temukan Peluru di Ruang Anggota DPR F-PDIP Effendi Simbolon |url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4262362/polisi-temukan-peluru-di-ruang-anggota-dpr-f-pdip-effendi-simbolon |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=detikNews |date=18 October 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[PDI-P]], Simbolon was appointed as head of resources and funding of the party's central committee in 2010, though he did not retain a position in that committee for the 2015-2020 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inilah Susunan Pengurus DPP PDI-P 2010-2015 |url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2010/04/08/17443474/Inilah.Susunan.Pengurus.DPP.PDIP.20102015 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=KOMPAS |date=8 April 2010 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Attacks on Jokowi===
Early into new president [[Joko Widodo]]'s tenure, Simbolon attacked a policy removing fuel subsidies, despite threats of being sanctioned by his own party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keteng |first1=Andi Muttya |title=Terancam Sanksi PDIP, Ini Tanggapan Effendi Simbolon |url=https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/2131890/terancam-sanksi-pdip-ini-tanggapan-effendi-simbolon |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=liputan6.com |date=10 November 2014 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2015, Simbolon once more criticised the government of Widodo, and called for his impeachment. Simbolon remarked that Widodo's government was "turbulent", and "did not have a clear system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rastika |first1=Icha |title=Politisi PDI-P: Yang Punya Peluang, Sekarang Saatnya Makzulkan Jokowi! |url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2015/01/26/1836468/Politisi.PDI-P.Yang.Punya.Peluang.Sekarang.Saatnya.Makzulkan.Jokowi |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=KOMPAS |date=26 January 2015 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented then that Widodo will be impeached "within months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sitompul |first1=Juven Martua |title=Politikus PDIP: Jokowi tak sampai dua tahun, hitungan bulan lengser |url=https://www.merdeka.com/politik/politikus-pdip-jokowi-tak-sampai-dua-tahun-hitungan-bulan-lengser.html |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Merdeka |date=26 January 2015 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simbolon again called for Widodo to resign in September 2015 for economic issues and the declining value of the [[Indonesian rupiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mardana|title=Effendi Simbolon maki-maki Jokowi hingga ucap kata-kata tak pantas |url=https://www.merdeka.com/politik/saking-geramnya-politikus-pdip-ini-minta-jokowi-mundur.html |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Merdeka |date=28 December 2015 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an shooting of three police officers in [[Puncak Regency]] by [[Free Papua Movement]] militants, Simbolon blamed Widodo for relaxing visa requirements and not being sufficiently harsh towards the separatism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Widhana |first1=Dieqy Hasbi |title=Effendi Simbolon maki-maki Jokowi hingga ucap kata-kata tak pantas |url=https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/effendi-simbolon-maki-maki-jokowi-hingga-ucap-kata-kata-tak-pantas.html |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Merdeka |date=28 December 2015 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a forum in 2015, Simbolon remarked that "Jokowi is not [part of] [[PDI-P]], and was just using PDI-P as a vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Effendi Simbolon: Saya Sudah Lama Sadar Jokowi Bukan PDIP |url=https://politik.rmol.co/read/2015/04/03/197816/Effendi-Simbolon:-Saya-Sudah-Lama-Sadar-Jokowi-Bukan-PDIP- |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=rmol.co |date=3 April 2015 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further criticism continued when Widodo reshuffled [[Working Cabinet (Joko Widodo)|his cabinet]] in 2016, including several ministers which was part of the previous government - resulting in Simbolon attacking it as a "recycled cabinet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zulfikar |first1=M |title=Effendi Simbolon: Kabinet Sekarang Kabinet Daur Ulang - Tribunnews.com |url=http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2016/08/04/effendi-simbolon-kabinet-sekarang-kabinet-daur-ulang |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Tribunnews.com |date=4 August 2016 |language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simbolon also openly disagreed with Widodo's decision to grant amnesty to Acehnese rebel leader [[Din Minimi]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jokowi to grant amnesty to Aceh rebel |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/jokowi-to-grant-amnesty-to-aceh-rebel |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=The Straits Times |date=7 January 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2017, Simbolon praised Widodo's government, though he added that the Widodo administration's actions then were different compared to its first two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Effendi Simbolon: Pak Jokowi sudah Berhasil |url=https://www.jpnn.com/news/effendi-simbolon-pak-jokowi-sudah-berhasil |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=JPNN |date=20 October 2017 |language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chieftain|Chief]] '''Efunsetan Aniwura''' (1790s - 1874) was the second '''[[Iyalode (title)|Iyalode]]''' of [[Ibadan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://krle6qjpz04.storage.googleapis.com/MTU5MjIxMjI4WA==04.pdf |title=Efunsetan Aniwura: Iyalode Ibadan, and Tinuubu Iyalode Egba (The Yoruba Historical Dramas of Akinwunmi Isola) |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revered as a successful merchant and trader, her impact encompassed the political, military, economic and religious spheres of Ibadan. She is famous for being arguably the most powerful - and certainly one of the wealthiest - [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] women that ever lived. She has been described by historians as an  authoritarian leader who often utilized capital punishment on erring slaves. This has been attributed to the psychological breakdown due to the death of her only daughter, and her inability to procreate afterwards.

== Personal life ==
Born in Abeokuta in the 1790s&lt;ref name="pulse"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pulse.ng/gist/efunsetan-aniwura-the-most-powerful-yoruba-woman-of-her-time-id7046628.html |title=The most powerful woman in the Yoruba kingdom |last=Tayo |first=Ayomide |date=July 25, 2017 |website=Pulse |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 1820s&lt;ref name="exclusion"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&amp;context=jtb |title=Gender and the Politics of Exclusion in Pre- Colonial Ibadan: The Case of Iyalode Efunsetan Aniwura |last=Idowu |first=Olawale |website=Journal of traditions and beliefs |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Aniwura was a migrant from [[Egbaland]] in present day [[Ogun State]]. Her father, Chief Ogunrin, was a warlord from Ikija while her mother was from [[Ife]]. Her entrepreneurial drive is reported to have originated when her mother, who was a petty trader, took her to the market with her.&lt;ref name="exclusion"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was married multiple times, and had a child, whom she lost at birth. This event has been the subject of numerous historical writings, and has been attributed to influencing the latter parts of her life, both positively (in terms of focus) and negatively (in terms of ruthlessness).&lt;ref name="research"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.umes.edu/uploadedFiles/_WEBSITES/AJCJS/Content/6%201%202%20okunola%20and%20ojo%20proof.pdf |title=Research Note: Negative Life Events And Aggressive Behavior Of Efunsetan Aniwura |last=Okunola |first=Akanji |website=African Journal of Criminology and Justice Studies |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Rise and fall ==
According to Olawale Idowu, Aniwura's decision to migrate to Ibadan was mainly for two reasons: Firstly, at the time, her cousin was a prominent leader in the city. Secondly, due to the enterprising nature of the town at the time in comparison to other locations, she could start a successful business there. She is reputed to have had about two thousand slaves and multiple farms, exporting agricultural produce to [[Porto-Novo]], [[Badagry]] and [[Ikorodu]].&lt;ref name="exclusion"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slave"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sosyalarastirmalar.com/cilt5/cilt5sayi22_pdf/4_sosyoloji_felsefe/okunola_ojo.pdf |title=SOCIO-HISTORICAL CRIME REVIEW ON EFUNSETAN ANIWURA, BASHORUN GAA AND AARE-AGO OGUNRINDE AJE |last=Okunola |first=Rashidi |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her major line were in tobacco and slave trading. She also manufactured a local cosmetic product, ''Kijipa'', that was transported to America for use.&lt;ref name="exclusion"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her difficulty in child-bearing led her not only to be diligent in her business, but also become emotionally unstable as having a successor was seen as a major determinant of affluence at that time. Due to this, she was often depressed and it became evident in her style of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ijiet.org/papers/387-N10017.pdf |title=Efunsetan Aniwura: A Psycho-Historical Exploration of Women’s Psychopathology |website=International Journal of Information and Education Technology |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created rules that ensured no slave in her household could get pregnant, or get anyone pregnant, and instituted death as the penalty for defaulters. Isola (2010) revealed that during her lifetime, she had ordered the decapitation of 41 of her slaves.&lt;ref name="research"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tribuneonlineng.com/98748/ |title=Efunsetan Aniwura and other Evans stories |website=Tribune |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slave"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1860s, she was made the second Iyalode of Ibadan.&lt;ref name="research"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was also made a patron of the [[Anglican Church]] in Ibadan for her involvement in strengthening Christianity in the community.&lt;ref name="exclusion"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She was deposed as Iyalode by Aare Latoosa on May 1, 1874 for politically motivated allegations, despite paying all the fines levied against her. 

Her authority within the community and opposition to the political views of the Ibadan de facto ruler, the Aare Ona Kakanfo Latoosa, led him to plot to execute her. This proved to be difficult due to her political position among the high chiefs. He paid-off Kumuyilo, her adopted son, to betray her and lead her to the place of execution.&lt;ref name="pulse"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theories on why Latoosa wanted Aniwura out of Ibadan. While some felt it was motivated by sexism and jealousy, other historians believe it was simply because the city became too dependent on her - especially for military equipment, which was gotten on credit. Some writers argue that her failure to abide by the regulations of the Aare was what led him to get angry with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4128529?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |title=A Male-Centric Modification of History: "Efunsetan Aniwura" Revisited |last=Ogunleye |first=Foluke |website=Jstor |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slave"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Aniwura was killed in her sleep by two of her slaves in 1874. They had been instructed to do so by her adopted son, Kumuyilo. Kuwuyilo was in turn bribed by Aare Latoosa, the ruler of Ibadan at the time. The motivation was posited to be that Latoosa felt threatened by her wealth and disobedience towards him.

== Legacy ==
Chief Aniwura got mainstream attention after being the subject of a play by Professor [[Akinwunmi Isola]]. 

Aniwura's statue is placed at the center of Challenge roundabout, a major point within the modern city of Ibadan.&lt;ref name="research"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has also been the subject of some [[Nollywood|Nigerian film productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2016/12/efunsetan-aniwura-yorubas-most-powerful-woman-that-ever-lived/ |title=Efunsetan Aniwura: Yoruba’s most powerful woman that ever lived? |date=December 26, 2016 |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism|collapsed=1}}
The Buddha was born into a noble family of the [[kshatriya]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] in Lumbini, Nepal in 563 BCE. He was called Siddhartha Gautama in his childhood. His father was king [[Suddhodana]], leader of the [[Shakya]] clan in what was the growing state of [[Kosala]], and his mother was queen [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya Devi]]. According to Buddhist legend, the baby exhibited the marks of a great man. A prophecy indicated that if the child stayed at home he was destined to become a world ruler. If the child left home, however, he would become a universal spiritual leader. To make sure the boy would be a great king and world ruler, his father isolated him in his palace and he was raised by his mother's younger sister, [[Maha Pajapati]], after his mother died just seven days after childbirth.

Separated from the world, he later married [[Yashodhara]] (Yaśodhara was the daughter of King [[Suppabuddha]] and [[Amita]]), and together they had one child, a son, [[Rāhula]]. Both Yashodhara and Rāhul later became disciples of Buddha.

His first cousin, by his father, [[Ananda]], joined the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as his attendant.

== Suddhodana ==
[[File:SudhodannaAndHisCourt.jpg|thumb|King Sudhodana and his court]]
[[File:Interpretation of Queen Maya's dream.jpg|thumb|left|The sculpture depicts a scene where three soothsayers are interpreting to King Suddhodana the dream of Queen Maya. Nagarjunakonda, 2nd-century]]
Much of the information on Suddhodana comes from [[Buddhist]] legend and scripture. He is believed to be a leader of the Shakya clan, who lived within the state of Kosala, on the northern border of [[History of India|Ancient India]]. Although in [[Buddhist literature]] he is said to be a hereditary monarch, he is now believed to have been an elected head of a tribal confederacy. Suddhodana's father was Sinahana.

Suddhodana was said to be greatly troubled by the departure of his son and is reported in Buddhist scriptures to have sent 10,000 messengers to plead with Gautama to return. After the Buddha preached the [[dharma]] to the messengers, they were all ordained into the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. Later a friend of Suddhodana named Kaludayi invited the Buddha to return, at the request of Suddhodana. The Buddha also preached the dharma to him and shubhansu was later ordained as a monk.

After this request from his father [[Gautama]] returned to his father's kingdom where he preached dharma to him. Gautama later returned again to his father's kingdom to see his father's death. Suddhodana became an [[arahant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/lob/lob03.htm |title=The Life of Buddha: Part One: 1. King Suddhodana And Queen Maya |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maya ==
[[File:MayaDream.jpg|thumb|300px|Queen Māyā's white renish dream, and the conception of the Buddha. [[Gandhara]], 2-3rd century CE.]]
Maya was the mother of the Buddha and was from the [[Koliya]]n clan. Maya was born in [[Devadaha]], in ancient [[Nepal]]. She was married to her cousin King Suddhodana, who ruled in the kingdom of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].

In Buddhist texts, a white elephant was said to have entered her side during a dream. When she awoke she found that she was pregnant. As it was traditional to give birth in the homeland of the father, [[Queen Maya]] journeyed to Devadaha. However she was forced to give birth en route, in the [[Lumbini]] grove. It is said that the [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] presided over the birth and that two streams, one cool and one hot, flowed down from the heavens.

Maya died seven days after the birth of her son, whom she had named [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] or "he who achieves his aim." She is said, in Buddhist scriptures, to have been reborn in [[Tusita]], where her son later visited her, paid respects and taught the [[dharma]] to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Mossberg |url=http://www.amidabuddha.org/whowasbuddha.html |title=Who were the Buddhas? |publisher=amidabuddha.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117133129/http://amidabuddha.org/whowasbuddha.html |archivedate=2012-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ānanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism.

== Devadatta ==

[[Devadatta]] was the maternal first cousin (or in some accounts paternal first cousin) of the Buddha. He was ordained into the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] along with his brothers and friends and their barber, [[Upāli]], when the Buddha preached to the Shakyas in Kapilavastu.

For a time, Devadatta was highly respected among the sangha. [[Shariputra]] is said to have sung the praises of Devadatta in [[Rajagaha]]. After some time, Devadatta developed [[siddhis]] and his intention is said to have been corrupted. After gaining these siddhis, Devadatta attempted to kill the Buddha on several occasions, commonly thought to be motivated by jealousy of the Buddha's power. He is reported to have rolled a boulder toward the Buddha, piercing his flesh, and to have incited an elephant to charge at the Buddha.

Devadatta then attempted to split the sangha into two, with one faction led by himself and the other by the Buddha. However, this attempt failed as all of his converts returned to the Buddha's sangha.

Devadatta was reputedly remorseful toward the Buddha late in life. He is reported to have walked to the monastery where the Buddha was staying to apologize to him but, as a result of bad [[karma]], he was swallowed up into the earth and reborn in [[Avici]] before he could ask for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/d/devadatta.htm |title=Devadatta |publisher=Palikanon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415064955/http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/d/devadatta.htm |archivedate=2014-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.2be.net/Devadatta Devadatta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nanda ==
Nanda was a half-brother of the Buddha; the son of King Suddhodana and Maha Prajapati Gautami. Nanda was to be married to a princess named Janapadakalyani but abandoned her to join the sangha. Nanda persevered and became an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.2be.net/Nanda]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maha Pajapati Gotami ==
[[Maha Pajapati]] Gotami (Sanskrit: Maha Prajapati Gautami) was the youngest daughter of King Suppabuddha and Queen Amita. She was married to King Suddhodana with her elder sister Mahamaya (or Mayadevi). When her sister died after the birth of [[Siddartha Gautama]] she took Siddartha into her care. She also gave birth to a son, Nanda, to King Suddodhana.

After the death of King Suddhodana, Maha Prajapati journeyed to find the Buddha. When she found him, she petitioned the Buddha, through Ananda, to allow women to enter the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] as [[bhikkhuni]]. After many refusals, the Buddha finally agreed to allow women to enter the sangha as long as they accepted eight additional [[vinaya]]. These were:
* A bhikkhuni must always pay respect to bhikkhus
* A bhikkhuni must spend the varsa retreat in a retreat where bhikkhus are staying
* Bhikkhunis must ask bhikkhus to give them official teachings twice a month
* Bhikkhunis must perform the end of varsa ceremony in front of bhikkhunis and bhikkhus
* Serious breaches of the vinaya must be dealt with by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis
* Once a trainee has completed her training, she must ask both the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis for ordination
* Bhikkhunis are not to abuse bhikkhus
* Bhikkhus may criticize bhikkhunis (regarding disciplinary matters), but bhikkhunis may not criticize bhikkhus.

Maha Pajapati is said to have given the Buddha a robe made of fine cloth. The Buddha refused it, saying it was too elaborate and would cause the sangha to degenerate. Later Maha Pajapati became an [[arahant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.2be.net/Maha_Prajapati_Gautami Maha Prajapati Gautami&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rāhula ==
{{main |Rāhula}}
Rāhula ([[Pāli]] and Sanskrit) was the only son of Siddhārtha Gautama, and his wife and princess Yaśodharā. He is mentioned in numerous Buddhist texts, from the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early period]] onward.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |p=139}} Accounts about Rāhula indicate a mutual impact between Prince Siddhārtha's life and those of his family members.{{sfn |Strong |1997 |pp=122{{en dash}}4}} According to the [[Pali Canon|Pāli tradition]], Rāhula is born on the day of Prince Siddhārta's [[great renunciation|renunciation]], and is therefore named ''Rāhula'', meaning a fetter on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}}{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} According to the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] tradition, and numerous other [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|later sources]], however, Rāhula is only ''conceived'' on the day of Prince Siddhārtha, and is born six years later, when Prince Siddhārtha becomes enlightened as the [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]].{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=119}} This long gestation period is explained by bad [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] from previous lives of both Yaśodharā and of Rāhula himself, although more [[religious naturalism|naturalistic]] reasons are also given.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |pp=139{{en dash}}40}} As a result of the late birth, Yaśodharā needs to prove that Rāhula is really Prince Siddhārtha's son, which she eventually does successfully by an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]].{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=120}} Historian {{ill|Wolfgang Schumann|de|Wolfgang Schumann (Historiker)}} has argued that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula and waited for his birth, to be able to leave the palace with the king and queen's permission,{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=46}} but Orientalist {{ill|Noël Péri|fr}} considered it more likely that Rāhula was born after Prince Siddhārtha left his palace.{{sfn |Péri |1918 |pp=34{{en dash}}5}}

Between seven{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} to fifteen{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=110}} years after Rāhula is born, the Buddha returns to Kapilavastu, where Yaśodharā has Rāhula ask the Buddha for the throne of the Śākya clan. The Buddha responds by having Rāhula [[pabbajja|ordain]] as the first Buddhist [[samanera|novice monk]].{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} He teaches the young novice about [[sacca|truth]], self-reflection,{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |p=481}} and [[anatta|not-self]],{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=115}} eventually leading to Rāhula's enlightenment.{{sfn |Saddhasena |2003 |pp=482{{en dash}}3}}{{sfn |Crosby |2013 |p=116}} Although early accounts state that Rāhula dies before the Buddha does,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Rāhula}} later tradition has it that Rāhula is one of the disciples that outlives the Buddha, guarding the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of the [[Maitreya|next Buddha]].{{sfn |Strong |1997 |p=121}} Rāhula is known in Buddhist texts for his eagerness for learning,{{sfn |Malalasekera |1960 |loc=[http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/r/raahula.htm Rāhula]}} and was honored by novice monks and [[samaneri|nuns]] throughout Buddhist history.{{sfn |Meeks |2016 |loc=passim.}} His accounts have led to a perspective in Buddhism of seeing children as hindrances to the spiritual life on the one hand, and as people with potential for enlightenment on the other hand.{{sfn |Nakagawa |2005 |p=41}}

== Life ==
Parthenope was born in [[Naples]], [[Italy]] and was named after its Greek predecessor, ''[[History of Naples#Greek birth.2C Roman acquisition|Parthenope]]''. She was the oldest daughter and child of [[William Nightingale]] and his wife, Frances Smith. After her parent's three-year tour in Italy, Parthenope and her sister [[Florence Nightingale|Florence]] moved to [[Embley Park]], their father's estate in Hampshire, England. During their childhood, they received numerous visits from cousins and distinguished guests. Parthenope and her sister were educated at home by a governess, although their father later taught them [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], history and philosophy. Despite being less scholarly than her sister, Parthenope was fluent in French and developed a love for literature and art.

On 24 June 1858, Parthenope married her sister's rejected suitor, [[Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet|Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet]], an MP for [[Buckingham]], who was also a supporter of liberal causes and the landowner of [[Claydon House]] in [[Middle Claydon]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. Parthenope soon turned Claydon House into a salon for people of talent, and frequently visited her tenants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/46562&lt;/ref&gt;

Parthenope was an active supporter of her sister's work during the [[Crimean War]]. As Lady Verney, she was responsible for extensively remodelling Claydon House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Mark| last= Bostridge| authorlink= Mark Bostridge| year= 2008| title= Florence Nightingale: The Woman and Her Legend| publisher= Viking| location= London| isbn= 978-0-670-87411-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

In later years, the two sisters lived near each other on South Street, [[London]].

Lady Verney wrote stories and articles for ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', and ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]''.  She also published  several novels and a two volume book, ''Peasant Properties and Other Selected Essays''. After her death two collections of her works were published: ''Essays and Tales'' and ''The Grey Pool and Other Stories''. Her work on the [[Verney family]] papers was completed and published by [[Margaret Verney]] as ''Memoirs of the Verney Family during the Seventeenth Century''. She was against Florence's idea of nursing at first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = McDonald |first = Lynn |year = 2001 |title = Florence Nightingale: an introduction to her life and family |pages = 834–835 |publisher = Wilifred Laurier U.

She died in May 1890 aged 71 at Claydon House, the family seat.

'''Francisco Pelliza''' (1792-1879) was an Argentine military, patriot officer who fought in the [[Argentine War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=B-KboAEACAAJ&amp;dq=francisco+pelliza&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_lcK9yMzOAhXJlJAKHf3pA3EQ6AEIEjAA|title=Prisioneros de guerra: memorias de las Casasmatas del Callao (1813-1820)|publisher=Juan Isidro Quesada, Francisco Pelliza, Gerónimo Espejo|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Francisco Pelliza was born in Buenos Aires, son of Luis Pelliza and María Molina, belonging to a Creole family from Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=GXsiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=francisco+pelliza&amp;dq=francisco+pelliza&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi47eGjnoXUAhXCIZAKHUiLDQ84ChDoAQgqMAI|title=Mestizaje, sangre y matrimonio en territorios de la actual Argentina y Uruguay, siglos XVII-XX|publisher=Nora Siegrist de Gentile, M. Mónica Ghirardi|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Buenos Aires Cathedral]], on September 12, 1812, with María de los Santos Fernández Castro, daughter of Ramón de los Santos Fernández and Encarnación Molina, belonging to a distinguished family. Pelliza and his wife were parents of several children, including Manuela Pelliza (born in 1812), married on August 17, 1826  in [[Santos Lugares]] to Sinforoso Camilo Canaveris (1808-1872), son of María de los Ángeles Rodríguez and [[Manuel Canaveris]], a Lieutenant who served in the [[Regiment of Patricians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmcLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=francisco+pelliza+canavery&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MleIUpDGA4zpkAf6loGQBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |title=Aportes biogenealógicos para un padrón de habitantes del Río de la Plata - Hugo Fernández de Burzaco y Barrios - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the Pelliza family was [[Domingo Pelliza]], a [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchant who had traveled to [[Spain]] in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=Los pobladores de Buenos Aires y su descendencia|publisher=Hialmar Edmundo Gammalsson|publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=L-YIAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=domingo+pelliza+buenos+aires&amp;dq=domingo+pelliza+buenos+aires&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIiuXC6cPJAhVEWpAKHQ7XBfUQ6AEIGTAA|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This family was related to the [[:es:Domingo de Acassuso|Domingo de Acassuso]], a militia officer, born in [[Biscay]], and founder of [[San Isidro Partido|San Isidro]], a city in the Buenos Aires Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=lljjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Domingo+de+Acassuso+pelliza&amp;dq=Domingo+de+Acassuso+pelliza&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh4YqhrpLOAhXMh5AKHZ6lBIAQ6AEIIzAC|title=Del Pago de la Costa al San Isidro actual: la obra de dos vascos|publisher=Fundación Vasco Argentina Juan de Garay|date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two members of the Pelliza family were related to the Pueyrredón family.

'''Internally displaced Palestinians''', also '''Internally displaced persons in Israel and Palestine''', are Palestinian [[internally displaced persons|IDPs]] who [[1948 Palestinian exodus|fled or were expelled]] from their home in [[Mandatory Palestine]] by [[Yishuv|Jewish]] or [[Israel]]i forces, before and during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]], but who remained within the area that became the state of Israel. Palestinian IDPs in Israel are also referred to as '''present absentees'''. The term applies to the IDP's descendants too.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Davis, 1997, p. 49. "Children of "absentees", whether born inside or outside of the State of Israel, are similarly classified as "absentees"."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to estimates from Palestinian NGO BADIL, there are 384,200 IDPs in [[Israel]] and 334,600 IDPs in the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badil.org/en/publication/survey-of-refugees.html?download=1192:badil-survey-2015|title=Survey of Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons 2013-2015|volume= VIII|year= 2015|author= BADIL|ref=harv|p=8|quote=There are two categories of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Mandate Palestine. The first type is composed of 384,200 Palestinians who have been internally displaced inside Israel since 1948 while the second category consists of 334,600 internally displaced Palestinians in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, 46,000 out of the 156,000 Israeli Arabs in Israel were considered Present absentees.

IDPs are not permitted to live in the homes they formerly lived in, even if they were in the same area, the property still exists, and they can show that they own it. They are regarded as absent by the Israeli government because they were absent from their homes on a particular day, even if they did not intend to leave them for more than a few days, and even if they left involuntarily.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, Tom. ''1949: The First Israelis'', pp. 68-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==IDPs in Israel==
If the definition is restricted to those displaced in the 1948 war and its immediate aftermath and their descendants, some 274,000 [[Arab citizens of Israel]] - or 1 in 4 Palestinians in Israel - are [[internally displaced]] Palestinians.&lt;ref name=Badil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badil.org/phocadownload/Badil_docs/Working_Papers/Palestinian.IDPs.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Badil Resource Centre for Palestinian Refugee and Residency Rights|title=Palestinian Internally Displaced Persons inside Israel: Challenging the Solid Structures|author=Nihad Bokae'e|date=February 2003|accessdate=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre]] estimated in 2007 that 150,000-420,000 internally displaced persons were living in Israel.&lt;ref name=IDMC2009/&gt; The vast majority are Muslim (90%) and some 10% are Christian. There are no [[Druze]] among them "since no Druze village was destroyed in the 1948 war and no Druze left their settlements permanently."&lt;ref name=IDMC2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/%28httpEnvelopes%29/F11200E8ECD83F71802570B8005A7276?OpenDocument |publisher=Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC) |title=Israel: About 150,000-420,000 internally displaced persons in 2007 |quote=Estimates of IDPs in Israel vary widely. There is no government or United Nations estimate. Sources for estimates are academics, Palestinian NGOs and Israeli papers. The lowest estimate is 150,000 and the highest is 420,000, which includes the children and grandchildren of Arab villagers displaced in 1948, as well as Bedouin communities displaced later on. |accessdate=2017-04-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111100022/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/%28httpEnvelopes%29/F11200E8ECD83F71802570B8005A7276?OpenDocument |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IDMC2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf|publisher=Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC)|title=Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006|quote=Israel: 150,000-420,000 internally displaced persons... 150,000 (Cohen, July 2001) 420,000 (BADIL, May 2006)...

Other internally displaced persons included in these counts are those who were displaced by ongoing [[House demolition in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|home demolitions]] enacted against unlicensed structures or in [[Unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel|unrecognized villages]].&lt;ref name=Badil/&gt; Estimates based on this broader definition place the total population of IDPs at anywhere between 250,000 - 420,000 people.&lt;ref name=IDMC2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kassim and Mansour, 2002, p. 76. Provides an estimate of 250,000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present absentees===

As it was for most other [[Palestinian refugees]], the homes and properties of internally displaced Palestinians were placed under the control of a government body, the [[Land and Property laws in Israel|Custodian of Absentees' Property]] via legislation that includes the ''1948 Emergency Regulation Concerning Absentee Property'' (a temporary measure) and the ''1950 Absentee Property Law''.&lt;ref name="IDR"/&gt;

Unlike other [[Palestinian refugees]], the internally displaced Palestinians and others who remained inside what became [[Israel]] were made citizens by the [[Israeli nationality law|Citizenship Law]] of July 1952.&lt;ref name="IDR" /&gt; That same year Israel requested that UNRWA transfer responsibility for registering and caring for internally displaced persons to Israel and basic humanitarian assistance was provided to the internally displaced for a time.&lt;ref name=Badil/&gt;

[[Martial law#Israel|Military administrative rule]] (1948–1966) restricted the movement of [[Arab citizens of Israel]], and it combined with the [[Absentees' Property Laws]] to prevent internally displaced citizens from physically returning to their properties to reclaim their homes. According to the Absentees' Property Laws, "absentees" are non-Jewish residents of Palestine who had left their usual places of residence for any place inside or outside the country after the adoption of the partition of Palestine resolution by the UN. Under these laws, "absentee" property owners were required to prove their "presence" in order to gain recognition of their ownership rights by the Israeli government.&lt;ref name="IDR" /&gt; However, all ownership rights of "absentees" belong to the government-appointed Custodian of Absentee Property, and any person including the "absentee" owner himself found occupying, building, or being "present" on such properties would be violating the law and risk expulsion and demolition.

Some villagers like those of [[Ghassibiya]], [[Kafr Bir'im|Bir'im]] and [[Iqrit]] made petitions to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli High Court]] to have their property rights recognized which were upheld in the 1950s, but they were physically prevented from reclaiming their properties by military administrative authorities who refused to abide by the court rulings and declared the villages closed military zones.&lt;ref name=Badil/&gt;

Because most internally displaced Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel were counted as absent, even though present inside the Israeli state, they are also commonly referred to as ''present absentees''.

===Present-day===
{{Nakba}}
Today the internally displaced Bedouins live in 39-46 unrecognized villages in the [[Negev]] and the [[Galilee]], while the remaining internally displaced Palestinians live in some 80 towns and villages in the [[Galilee]] such as [[Ein Hawd]].  There is also the village of [[Ein Rafa]] near [[Jerusalem]].

Half of the populations in the two largest Arab towns in Israel, [[Nazareth]] and [[Umm al-Fahm]], are made up of internally displaced refugees from neighbouring towns and villages destroyed in 1948.&lt;ref name=IDMC2009/&gt;

==IDPs in the Occupied Palestinian Territories==
The [[Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre]] estimated in July 2015 that there are at least 263,500 IDPs in Occupied Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internal-displacement.org/middle-east-and-north-africa/palestine/figures-analysis Palestine IDP Figures Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on the internal refugees==
A few books focus on Palestinian internal refugees in Israel and internally displaced Palestinians across the Green Line.

In 1991, Israeli writer and peace activist [[David Grossman]] conducted several interviews with [[Palestinian citizens of Israel]]. These were published in a book called in {{lang-he|נוכחים נפקדים|Nokhekhim Nifkadim|lit=Absent Presentees|links=no}}. The English version was titled ''Sleeping on a Wire: Conversations with Palestinians in Israel''.

As [[Nur Masalha]] puts it in his introduction: "Acquiring the paradoxical title of present absentees, the internally displaced had their property and homes taken by the state, making them refugees and exiles within their own homeland."&lt;ref&gt;Catastrophe Remembered:  Palestine, Israel and the Internal Refugees, edited by Nur Masalha (London: Zed Books 2005). {{ISBN|978-1-84277-623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book uses oral history and interviews with internal refugees to examine Palestinian identity and memory, indigenous rights, international protection, the right of return, and a just solution in Palestine/Israel.

[[File:Jill Stein OWS S17.jpg|thumb|right|Jill Stein speaking at [[Occupy Wall Street]], September 27, 2011]]
In August 2011, Stein indicated that she was considering running for [[President of the United States]] with the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 national election]].

Alex Halderman]] and [[John Bonifaz]] (founder of the [[National Voting Rights Institute]]) expressed concerns about the integrity of the presidential election results. They wanted a full audit or recount of the presidential election votes in three states key to [[Donald Trump]]'s electoral college win—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—but needed a candidate on the presidential ballot to file the petition to state authorities. After unsuccessfully lobbying [[Hillary Clinton]] and her team, the group approached Stein and she agreed to spearhead the recount effort.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swaine|first1=John|last2=Chalabi|first2=Mona|title=US election recount: how it began – and what effect it could have|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/28/election-recount-jill-stein-hillary-clinton-donald-trump |accessdate=December 2, 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[crowdfunding]] campaign launched on November 24, 2016 to support the costs of the recount, raised more than $2.5 million in under 24 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Jessica|title=Jill Stein Crowdfunding: Green Party Nominee Raises $5.4 Million to Fund Recounts|url=http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/jill-stein-crowdfunding-vote-recount-recounts-online-fundraising-site-wisconsin-michigan-pennsylvania-hillary-clinton-trump-fraud-hacking-rigged/|website=Heavy.com|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $6.7 million in nearly a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schultheis|first1=Emily|title=Jill Stein's recount fundraising: What happens to leftover money?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jill-steins-recount-fundraising-what-happens-to-leftover-money/|accessdate=December 2, 2016|agency=CBS News|date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, 2016, with 90 minutes remaining on the deadline to petition for a recount to [[Wisconsin]]'s electoral body, Stein filed for a recount of its presidential election results. She signaled she intended to file for similar recounts in the subsequent days in [[Michigan]] and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/jill-stein-submits-presidential-recount-petition-wisconsin-n688316|title=Election recount process to begin in Wisconsin after Green Party petition|work=nbcnews.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President-elect Donald Trump issued a statement denouncing the recount request saying, "The people have spoken and the election is over." Trump further commented that the recount "is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=READ: Trump Slams Jill Stein Over 'Ridiculous' Vote Recount Effort|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/11/26/donald-trump-reacts-jill-steins-recount-effort-presidential-election-votes|publisher=Fox News|date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2016, [[Michigan Attorney General]] [[Bill Schuette]] filed a lawsuit to stop Stein's recount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Wright|title=Michigan attorney general files lawsuit to stop recount|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/politics/michigan-attorney-general-files-suit-to-stop-recount/|date=December 4, 2016|access-date= December 4, 2016|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day in [[Wisconsin]] a U.S. District Judge denied an emergency halt to the recount, allowing it to continue until a December 9, 2016 hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick|last=Marley|title=Federal judge denies quick halt to Wisconsin recount|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate= December 4, 2016|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/12/02/trump-supporters-file-suit-stop-wisconsin-recount/94805946/|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 2016, Stein dropped the state recount case in [[Pennsylvania]], citing "the barriers to verifying the vote in [[Pennsylvania]] are so pervasive and that the state court system is so ill-equipped to address this problem that we must seek federal court intervention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steph|last=Solis|title=Jill Stein to take Pennsylvania recount to federal courts|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/12/04/stein-drops-state-case-pennsylvania-recount-aims-federal-court/94946560/|date=December 4, 2016|access-date= December 4, 2016|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after midnight on December 5, 2016, [[U.S. District Judge]] [[Mark A. Goldsmith]], appointed by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2010, ordered [[Michigan]] election officials to hand-recount 4.8 million ballots, rejecting all concerns for the cost of the recount. Goldsmith wrote in his order: "As emphasized earlier, budgetary concerns are not sufficiently significant to risk the disenfranchisement of [[Michigan]]'s nearly 5 million voters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Snell|title=Judge orders Michigan presidential recount to begin at noon Monday|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/12/04/judge-holds-sunday-hearing-michigan-recount-suit/94952646/|date=December 5, 2016|accessdate= December 5, 2016|publisher=[[The Detroit News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, however, the [[Michigan Court of Appeals]] ruled that Stein, who placed fourth, had no chance of winning and was not an "aggrieved candidate" and ordered the [[Michigan]] election board to reject her petition for a recount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Latest: Federal Judge Sets Hearing on Michigan Recount|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/latest-michigans-largest-county-starts-recount-44009466 |date=December 7, 2016 |accessdate=December 7, 2016|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, 2016, Judge Goldsmith halted the [[Michigan]] recount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Max|last=Blau|title=Michigan Recounted Halted|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/politics/michigan-election-recount/|date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=December 10, 2016|publisher=[[CNN News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein filed an appeal with the [[Michigan Supreme Court]], losing her appeal in a 3–2 decision on December 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Phil|last=Helsel|title=Michigan Supreme Court Denies Jill Stein Recount Appeal|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/michigan-supreme-court-denies-jill-stein-recount-appeal-n694251|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate= December 10, 2016|publisher=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, ''The Daily Beast'' reported that approximately $1 million of the original $7.3 million had yet to be spent and that there remained uncertainty about what precisely the money had been spent on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-happened-to-jill-steins-recount-millions|title=What Happened to Jill Stein's Recount Millions?|last=Davis|first=Charles|date=May 30, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=May 30, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, ''The Daily Beast'' reported that Stein was spending the recount money on her own campaign's legal defense as her campaign was being investigated in probes of Russian interference in the 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/jill-steins-recount-cash-pays-for-her-russia-legal-defense|title=Jill Stein's Recount Cash Pays for Her Russia Legal Defense|last=Davis|first=Charles|date=July 13, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=July 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==

=== Economy ===
Referring to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] approach to the [[Great Depression]], Stein advocated a [[Green New Deal]] in her 2012 and 2016 campaigns, in which renewable energy jobs would be created to address climate change and environmental issues; the objective would be to employ "every American willing and able to work".&lt;ref name="GND"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenpapers.net/jobs-for-all-with-a-green-new-deal/ |title=Jobs for All with a Green New Deal |work=Green-Rainbow.org |date=September 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019035142/http://greenpapers.net/jobs-for-all-with-a-green-new-deal/ |archivedate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein said she would fund the start-up costs of the plan with a 30% reduction in the U.S. military budget, returning U.S. troops home, and increasing taxes on [[speculation]] in stock markets, offshore tax havens, and multimillion-dollar real estate, among other things. In 2012 and 2016 she cited a 2012 study in the ''[[The Review of Black Political Economy|Review of Black Political Economy]]'' by [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] professor Phillip Harvey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Philip|date=January 20, 2012 |title=Learning from the New Deal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-011-9127-x|journal=The Review of Black Political Economy|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=87–105|doi=10.1007/s12114-011-9127-x|issn=0034-6446}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that the multiplier economic effects of this "Green New Deal" would recoup most of the start-up costs of her plan.&lt;ref name="GND" /&gt; Stein further argued that her plan "will end unemployment and poverty".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jill2016.com/plan|title=Power to the People Plan|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how the funds of the Green New Deal would be distributed, Stein said that it would be "through a community decision-making process" but "exactly how that would be configured, you know, remains to be established."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-jill-stein-transcript-20160906-snap-story.html|title=Jill Stein tells The Times editorial board why she thinks voting Democrat or Republican makes little difference|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her 2012 and 2016 presidential runs, Stein called for "nationalizing" and "democratiz[ing]" the [[Federal Reserve]], placing it under a Federal Monetary Authority in the Treasury Department and ending [[Structure of the Federal Reserve System#Independent within government|its independence]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/26/if_only_we_could_vote_for_a_third_party/|title=If only it made sense to vote for a third party|last=Olear|first=Greg|website=Salon|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p2012.org/stein/greennewdealjan2012.html|title=Jan. 2012 Jill Stein A Green New Deal for America|website=www.p2012.org|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Scott, [http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/17/news/jill-stein-economic-policy/ Where the Green Party's Jill Stein stands on jobs, taxes and more], CNN Money (August 17, 2016): "The candidate also wants to nationalize the Federal Reserve banks and place them under a Federal Monetary Authority within the Treasury Department."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Stein said that she supported a new 0.5% [[financial transactions tax]] on the sale of [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], and an increase in the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]] to "at least" 55% on inheritances over $3 million.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Eugene Scott, [http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/17/news/jill-stein-economic-policy/ Where the Green Party's Jill Stein stands on jobs, taxes and more], CNN Money (August 17, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein has argued that the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Wall Street bailout]] was unconscionable&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jill Stein Interview With Fox Business News Panel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelEx10_PMQ|last1=Fox Business News Panel|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waste".&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2012/10/03/not-your-average-jill-stein-interview/#1d02125f6575|title=Not Your Average Jill Stein Interview|last=Reilly|first=Peter J|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Stein opposed the raising of the [[United States debt ceiling|debt ceiling]], arguing that the U.S. should instead raise taxes on the wealthy and make military spending cuts to offset the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Budget_+_Economy.htm|title=Jill Stein on Budget &amp; Economy|website=www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein supports the creation of sustainable infrastructure based on clean renewable-energy generation and sustainable-community principles to stop what her party sees as a growing convergence of environmental crises in water, soil, fisheries, and forests. Her vision includes increasing intra-city [[mass transit]] and inter-city [[railroads]], creating [[complete streets]] that safely encourage bike and pedestrian traffic, and regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.&lt;ref name=GND/&gt;

Stein has been skeptical of official employment numbers, saying in her 2015 State of the Union Green Party response that unemployment figures at the time were "designed to essentially cover up unemployment," and arguing that the real unemployment rate for that year was around 12–13%.&lt;ref name="oti1"&gt;{{cite news|archive-date=April 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411104057/http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Budget_%2B_Economy.htm |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Budget_+_Economy.htm |title=Jill Stein on Budget &amp; Economy |publisher=[[On The Issues]] |date=March 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weissmann&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/07/27/jill_stein_is_not_the_savior_the_left_is_looking_for.html |title=Jill Stein's Ideas Are Terrible. She Is Not the Savior the Left Is Looking For. |first=Jordan |last=Weissmann |publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' |date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, she said that "real unemployment is nearly 10%, 2x as high as the official rate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/698235171393441792|title=Dr. Jill Stein on Twitter|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She supports the creation of nonprofit publicly owned banks, pledging to create such entities at the federal and state levels.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

Stein has said she believes in having "the government as the [[employer of last resort]]".&lt;ref name="wapointerview"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/08/25/a-transcript-of-jill-steins-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/|title=A transcript of Jill Stein's meeting with The Washington Post editorial board|last=Staff|first=Post Opinions|date=August 25, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in an August 2016 interview what this entailed, she said that the idea was a "very broad brushstroke" but that a position paper was forthcoming.&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt;

Stein's platform pledges to guarantee housing.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt; When asked how this would be done, Stein answered, "that is an aspirational goal at this point. We do not have a specific program."&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt;

When asked in September 2016 if she would consider using quantitative easing to establish a [[Basic income|universal basic income]] or a [[Medicare for All|Medicare for all]] package, Stein answered that it "should be looked into ... Definitely."&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/9/14/12913174/jill-stein-green-party|title=A conversation with Jill Stein: what the Green Party candidate believes|last=Stein|first=Jeff|date=September 14, 2016 |website=Vox|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Stein has argued for "free higher public education going forward."&lt;ref name="wapointerview"/&gt; Stein favors canceling all student loan debt, saying that it could be done using [[quantitative easing]] and without raising taxes.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Citation|last=The Young Turks|title=How Dr. Jill Stein Will ERASE Student Loan Debt|date=June 8, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzwZtmTEMuw|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described quantitative easing as a "digital hat-trick" or "magic trick that basically people don't need to understand any more about than that it is a magic trick".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2016.presidential-candidates.org/JStein/?on=education|title=Jill Stein on the Issues: Education|website=The Politics and Elections Portal|date=July 10, 2016|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stein, the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] could buy up student loans and agree not to collect the debt, thereby effectively canceling it. Because the Federal Reserve is an independent government agency, the president lacks the authority to implement such a plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/10/jill-stein-says-we-need-an-emergency-job-program-like-the-new-deal.html|title=Green Party candidate Jill Stein says we need a jobs program like the 'New Deal'|last=DiChristopher|first=Tom|date=August 10, 2016 |website=CNBC|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein has drawn parallels between her student loan proposal and the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Wall Street bailout]], saying that the US government bought up Wall Street debt and then canceled it. Jordan Weissmann of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' argues that Stein's Wall Street comparison is "flat wrong": the Federal Reserve did not buy and cancel debt owed by the banks but bought and held onto debt owned by the banks.&lt;ref name="Weissmann"/&gt; When asked why her plan includes canceling upper-income individuals' debt, Stein responded that higher education "pays for itself" and that education is not a "gift," but a "right," and a "necessity."&lt;ref name="wapointerview"/&gt;

Stein feels that the move towards computerized education in kindergarten was bad for young children's cognitive and social development, saying, "We should be moving away from screens at all levels of education."&lt;ref name="screens"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://safetechforschoolsmaryland.blogspot.com/2016/08/c-span-us-presidential-candidate-jill.html|title="We Should Not Be Subjecting Children's Brains To Wi-Fi [&amp;] Screens In Schools. It's Not OK" Jill Stein|website=Safe Teach for Schools|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that increasing computerization benefits only device manufacturers, not teachers, children, or communities.&lt;ref name="screens" /&gt; Stein opposes charter schools and has been critical of the Common Core, saying that teachers rather than "corporate contractors" should be responsible for education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Education.htm|title=Jill Stein on Education|website=www.ontheissues.org |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral reform===
Stein is critical of the [[two-party system]], and argues for [[Instant-runoff voting|ranked-choice voting]] as a favorable alternative to "lesser evilism".&lt;ref name="lumpenprole"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolhatkar|first1=Sonali|title=The Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein on Democracy &amp; Ranked Choice Voting|url=https://lumpenproletariat.org/2016/03/21/the-green-partys-dr-jill-stein-on-democracy-ranked-choice-voting/|website=Lumpenproletariat|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duopoly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Speri|first1=Alice|title=The Two-Party System is the Worst Case Scenario: An Interview with the Green Party's Jill Stein/|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/07/29/the-two-party-system-is-the-worst-case-scenario-an-interview-with-the-green-partys-jill-stein/|website=The Intercept|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling for "more voices and more choices", the Stein campaign launched a petition demanding that all candidates appearing on a sufficient number of state ballots to be theoretically electable should be invited to participate in the [[United States presidential election debates, 2016|presidential debates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open the Debates Petition|url=http://www.jill2016.com/openthedebatespetition|publisher=Jill Stein for President|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Up the Debates: Green Party's Jill Stein Accuses Democrats &amp; GOP of Rigging Debate Rules|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/18/open_up_the_debates_green_partys|website=Democracy Now!|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, Stein announced support for lowering the voting age to 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/drjillstein/status/777939406757912576|title=Dr. Jill Stein on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with many other Green parties worldwide.

=== Energy and environment ===
Stein proposes that the United States shift to 100% renewable energy by 2030.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She supports a national ban on [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] on the grounds that "cutting-edge science now suggests fracking is every bit as bad as coal".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Energy_+_Oil.htm|title=Jill Stein on Energy &amp; Oil|website=www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has spoken against [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], saying it "is dirty, dangerous and expensive, and should be precluded on all of those counts."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In March 2016, she tweeted, "Nuclear power plants = weapons of mass destruction waiting to be detonated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=drjillstein|author=Jill Stein|number=715230945679380481|date=March 30, 2016|title=Nuclear power plants = weapons of mass destruction waiting to be detonated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Stein said, "three times more jobs are created per dollar invested in conservation and renewables. Nuclear is currently the most expensive per unit of energy created."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zs2n3/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_presidential/c678xe7?context=3|title=I am Jill Stein, Green Party presidential candidate, ask me anything. • /r/IAmA|website=reddit|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein says that she will "ensure that any worker displaced by the shift away from fossil fuels will receive full income and benefits as they transition to alternative work."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She has further argued that moving away from fossil fuels will produce substantial savings in healthcare costs.&lt;ref name="nominationSpeech"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jill2016.com/transcript_jill_stein_accepts_the_green_party_nomination|title=Transcript: Jill Stein Accepts the Green Party Nomination|date=August 6, 2016|publisher=Jill 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wants to "treat energy as a human right".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Stein says that climate change is a "national emergency"&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt; and calling it "a threat greater than World War II."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/climate-change-erasing-student-debt-top-policies-stein-135111430--election.html|title=Climate change, erasing student debt top policies for Stein|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein has written: "We need climate mobilization comparable to what the US did after WWII."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite twitter|url=https://twitter.com/drjillstein/status/739479455341678592|user=drjillstein|author=Jill Stein|number=739479455341678592|date=June 5, 2016|title=We need climate mobilization comparable to what the US did after WWII, not incremental steps being promoted Gov. Brown and @HillaryClinton.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]] as inadequate, saying it will not stop climate change.&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt; She has said that she would "basically override" the agreement and create a more effective one.&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt;

Stein has argued that the cost of transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2030 would in part be recouped by healthcare savings, citing studies that predict 200,000 fewer premature deaths as well as less illness. She has noted that when Cuba lost Soviet oil subsidies it experienced plummeting [[diabetes]] (down 50%), [[Cardiovascular disease|CVD]] (down 30%) and all-cause (down 18%) death rates.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt;

Stein supports the [[Great Sioux Nation]]'s opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, and in September 2016 joined protesters in North Dakota.

=== Foreign and defense policy ===
Stein takes a [[non-interventionist]] approach to foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genfkd.org/jill-stein-defense-plan-biggest-threat|title=The Jill Stein Defense Plan: We're Our Own Biggest Threat |date=September 20, 2016| website = GenFKD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein wishes to cut U.S. military spending by at least 50%.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Homeland_Security.htm|title=Jill Stein on Homeland Security|website=www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would close US overseas military bases. She has said that they "are turning our republic into a bankrupt empire".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She wants to replace the lost military jobs "with jobs in renewable energy, transportation and green infrastructure development"&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jill2016.com/platform|title=Jill Stein 2016 Platform|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "restore the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] as the centerpiece of our defense".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to Stein, the United States should [[Use of force by states|use force]] only when there is "good evidence that we are under imminent threat of actual attack".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; When asked by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorial board whether that standard would have prevented US involvement in World War II, Stein answered, "I don't want to revisit history or try to reinterpret it, you know, but starting from where we are now, given the experience that we've had in the last, you know, since 2001, which has been an utter disaster, I don't think it's benefited us."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Asked whether such a standard would force the US to withdraw from all of its mutual defense treaties, Stein answered that the treaties need to "be looked at one by one", mentioning [[NATO]] in particular.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

On the subject of NATO, Stein has said that NATO has violated international law in Libya, and that it is part of "a foreign policy that has been based on economic and military domination".&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt; When asked whether she agreed with Ajamu Baraka's description of NATO as "gangster states", Stein answered that she would not use Baraka's language but that "he means the same thing I'm saying".&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt; Stein has said that NATO "pursued a policy of basically encircling [[Russia]] — including the threat of nukes and drones and so on."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When asked by ''The Washington Post'' about NATO's role in protecting the Baltic states against Russia, Stein responded: "At this point, I'm not prepared to speak to that in detail" but said that NATO has not followed its stated policy after the fall of the Berlin Wall not to move "one inch to the East." She further argued that there has been provocation on both sides and that a diplomatic approach is necessary.&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt; Stein has said that NATO fights invented enemies in order to provide work for the weapons industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/720798953147604992|title=Dr. Jill Stein on Twitter|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in a ''Vox'' interview about Russian military policy in Crimea and Ukraine, Stein answered, "These are highly questionable situations. Why are we — Russia used to own Ukraine. Ukraine was historically a part of Russia for quite some period of time, and we all know there was this conversation with Victoria Nuland about planning the coup and who was going to take over ... Let's just stop pretending there are good guys here and bad guys here. These are complicated situations. Yeah, Russia is doing lots of human rights abuse, but you know what? So are we."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; When asked by ''[[Politico]]'' if she thought that Putin was an "incipient despot", Stein answered, "To some extent, yes, but there could be a whole lot worse ... when we needlessly provoke him and endanger him and surround him with war games--you know, this is sort of the Cuban Missile Crisis on steroids, what we are doing to Russia right now, and I don't think this is a good idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/full-transcript-jill-stein-228336|title=Full transcript: Jill Stein|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein has argued that the United States "helped foment" a [[2014 Ukrainian coup|coup in Ukraine]], maintaining that Ukraine should be neutral and that the United States should not arm it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Foreign_Policy.htm|title=Jill Stein on Foreign Policy|website=www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was critical of the Ukrainian government formed after the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Ukrainian Revolution of 2014]], saying that "ultra-nationalists and ex-Nazis came to power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Foreign_Policy.htm|title=Jill Stein on Foreign Policy|website=www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met with President [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow in December 2015 at a banquet to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian state television network [[RT (TV network)|RT]]. While in Russia, Stein criticized [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] (saying that the U.S. had a "policy of domination" instead of "international law, human rights and diplomacy") and [[Human rights in the United States|human rights in the U.S]], but her comments prompted a negative response from commentator [[John Aravosis]] who commented that Stein has "nothing negative to say about Russian foreign policy, or Russia's horrific lack of respect for human rights".&lt;ref name="Aravosis"&gt;{{Cite web|author=John Aravosis|url=http://americablog.com/2016/08/jill-stein-moscow-criticized-us-human-rights-said-nothing-russian-human-rights.html|title=Jill Stein in Moscow criticized US human rights, said nothing about Russian human rights|work=AMERICAblog News|date=August 6, 2016|language=en-US|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After U.S.-backed [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] captured [[Manbij offensive (2016)|Manbij]] from [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] in August, Stein tweeted, "To Syrians who escaped Manbij because of U.S.-led forces, I'm sorry our weapons terrorized you for two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/764302997404999680|title=Dr. Jill Stein on Twitter|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that her approach to the [[Syrian Civil War]] would be to put in place a weapons embargo, freeze funds going to ISIL and other terrorist groups, and push for a peace process leading to a ceasefire.&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt; Stein is also in favor of taking "far more" than the 10,000 Syrian refugees Obama pledged to take in.&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt;

Stein has been sharply critical of the use of drones, calling them a human rights violation and an "illegal assassination program" saying that they are "off target nine times out of ten."&lt;ref name="Kuntzman"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/green-party-candidate-slams-obama-trump-clinton-article-1.2640149|author=Gersh Kuntzman|publisher=New York Daily News|title=Green Party Presidential candidate Jill Stein slams the system, law-breaking Obama, 'Frankenstein' Trump and 'corporate' Hillary Clinton |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been critical of America's "expanding wars" and accused the United States of currently "bombing seven countries," which [[PolitiFact.com|Politifact]] rated as a true statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/oct/21/jill-stein/jill-stein-green-party-candidate-correct-about-us-/ Jill Stein, Green Party candidate, correct about U.S. bombing seven countries]. PolitiFact. October 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein has accused the Israeli government of "apartheid, assassination, illegal settlements, blockades, building of nuclear bombs, indefinite detention, collective punishment, and defiance of international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thepeaceresource.wordpress.com/2015/08/29/dr-jill-stein-on-israel-palestine-and-the-middle-east/|title=Dr. Jill Stein on Israel, Palestine and The Middle East|date=August 30, 2015 |website=The Peace Resource|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She supports the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign against Israel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jill2016.com/statement_on_us_foreign_policy_palestine_israel_and_bds|title=Statement on US Foreign Policy, Palestine-Israel, and BDS|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regards Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] as a "war criminal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/06/27/gpus-j27.html|title=Green Party candidate launches US presidential campaign - World Socialist Web Site|last=Martin|first=Patrick|website=www.wsws.org|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of Nobel Peace Laureate [[Elie Wiesel]], Stein praised him in a tribute on her Facebook page, but deleted the post when commenters criticized Wiesel's Zionism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/210549/friends-dont-let-friends-vote-for-jill-stein|title=Friends Don't Let Friends Vote for Jill Stein|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in September 2016 whether she had a "position on whether a two-state solution is a better solution than a one-state solution", Stein answered, "I feel like I am not as informed as I need to be to really weigh in on that".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Stein does not think the U.S should become involved in [[territorial disputes in the South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Immediately after the UK voted to leave the [[European Union]], Stein posted a celebratory statement on her website, saying the vote was "a victory for those who believe in the right of self-determination and who reject the pro-corporate, austerity policies of the political elites in the EU ... [and] a rejection of the European political elite and their contempt for ordinary people."&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-case-against-jill-stein-w436362|title=The Case Against Jill Stein|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/210549/friends-dont-let-friends-vote-for-jill-stein|title=Friends Don't Let Friends Vote for Jill Stein|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later changed the statement (without indicating so), removing words like "victory" and adding the line, "Before the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit vote]] I agreed with [[Jeremy Corbyn]], [[Caroline Lucas]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales|UK Greens]] who supported staying in the EU but working to fix it."&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forwardprogressives.com/green-party-jill-stein-busted-cover-up-praise-bigotry-driven-brexit/|title=Green Party Hero Jill Stein Busted Trying to Cover Up Her Praise of Bigotry-Driven Brexit|date=June 27, 2016 |language=en-US|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jill2016.com/stein_calls_britain_vote_a_wake_up_call |title=Stein calls Britain Vote a Wake-up Call |accessdate=June 25, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625005659/http://www.jill2016.com/stein_calls_britain_vote_a_wake_up_call |archivedate=June 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Stein favored maintaining current levels of [[United States foreign aid|international aid]] spending.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/35775/jill-stein/|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|website=Project Vote Smart|language=en-US|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the 15-year anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], Stein called for "a comprehensive and independent inquiry into the attacks," saying that the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]'' contained many "omissions and distortions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/295266-stein-calls-for-new-9-11-investigation|title=Jill Stein calls for new 9/11 investigation|last=Neidig|first=Harper|newspaper=The Hill|date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, she said: "I think I would not have [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassinated Osama bin Laden]] but would have captured him and brought him to trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Kathie Obradovich|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/kathie-obradovich/2016/09/11/jill-stein-iowa-would-not-have-assassinated-osama-bin-laden/90205354/|title=Jill Stein in Iowa: I would not have assassinated Osama bin Laden|newspaper=Des Moines Register|date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Cuban former communist leader [[Fidel Castro]], Stein tweeted that "Fidel Castro was a symbol of the struggle for justice in the shadow of empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Ken|date=November 27, 2016|title=Jill Stein Gets Predictable Backlash After Calling Castro a 'Symbol of the Struggle for Justice'|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/jill-stein-gets-predictable-backlash-after-calling-castro-a-symbol-of-the-struggle-for-justice/|journal=Mediaite|language=en|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GMOs and pesticides ===
{{see also|Genetically modified food controversies|Alzheimer's disease#Cause}}
Stein supports [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] labeling, a moratorium on new GMOs, and the phasing out of existing GMO foods, unless independent research "shows decisively that GMOs are not harmful to human health or ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Watkins"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/16/politics/jill-stein-vaccine-gmo-science/index.html|title=Anti-science claims dog Green Party's Jill Stein|last=CNN|first=Eli Watkins|website=CNN|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jill2016.comSCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jill2016.com/jill_stein_answers_science_questions|title=Jill Stein answers science questions|website=Jill Stein 2016|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the health effects of foods derived from GM crops, she has said: "And I can tell you as a physician with special interest and long history in environmental health, the quality of studies that we have are not what you need. We should have a moratorium until they are proven safe, and they have not been proven safe in the way that they are used."&lt;ref name=Watkins/&gt;

Commentators have criticized Stein's statements about GMOs, writing that they contradict the [[scientific consensus]], which is that existing GM foods are no less safe than foods made from conventional crops.&lt;ref name="Sosa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jill-steins-dangerous-anti-science-campaign_us_57a92f2ce4b02251db3ff3a8|title=Jill Stein's Dangerous Anti-Science Campaign|last=Sosa|first=Chris|date=August 9, 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="not:18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/02/what-jill-stein-the-green-presidential-candidate-wants-to-do-to-america/|title=What Jill Stein, the Green presidential candidate, wants to do to America|last=Ehrenfreund|first=Max|website=Washington Post|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/10.1063/PT.5.8185|title=Media coverage thin for presidential candidates' science awareness and views|last=Corneliussen|first=Steven T.|date=August 18, 2016|publisher=Physics Today|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/conspiracy-theories-2016-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-214183|title=The 5 Most Dangerous Conspiracy Theories of 2016|last=Uscinski|first=Joseph|date=August 22, 2016|publisher=Politico|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/aug/17/how-to-think-about-the-risks-of-mobile-phones-and-wi-fi|title=How to think about the risks of mobile phones and Wi-Fi|last=Stilgoe|first=Jack|date=August 17, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/us/article/Tough-sell-in-Texas-climate-change-GMOs-top-9125759.php|title=Tough sell in Texas: climate change, GMOs top Green Party platform|last=McGuire|first=Kim|date=August 5, 2016|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/opinion/2016/08/07/greens-libertarians-need-ready-media-glare/88377756/|title=Greens, Libertarians need to be ready for media glare|last=D'Ammassa|first=Algernon|date=August 7, 2016|newspaper=USA Today/Las Cruces Sun-News|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;But see also:

&lt;/ref&gt; Among the critics was Jordan Weissmann, ''Slate''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s business and economics editor, who wrote in July 2016: "Never mind that scientists have studied GMOs extensively and found no signs of danger to human health—Stein would like medical researchers to prove a negative."&lt;ref name=Weissmann/&gt;

In ''Environmental Threats to Healthy Aging'' (2008), Stein concludes her section on [[Pesticides in the United States|pesticides]] by saying: "[M]any but not all studies find that acute high-dose and chronic lower-dose occupational exposures to some neurotoxic pesticides are linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline, dementia or Alzheimer's disease."&lt;ref name="HealthyAging:chap7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.psr.org/site/DocServer/chap7_0926.pdf?docID=5924|title=Environmental Factors in the Development of Dementia: Focus on Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline|display-authors=etal|author=Jill Stein|work=Environmental Threats to Healthy Aging|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Stein and her coauthors wrote, "Twenty million American children five and under eat an average of eight pesticides every day through food consumption. Thirty-seven pesticides registered for use on foods are neurotoxic organophosphate insecticides, chemically related to more toxic nerve warfare agent developed earlier this century." They further noted the ubiquity of these pesticides in the home and at schools, citing Schettler ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/generations-risk|title=Generations at Risk: Reproductive Health and the Environment|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262692472|page=225|last1=Schettler etal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the claim that "The trend is toward increasingly common exposures to organophosphates. For example, [[chlorpyrifos]] detections in urine increased more than tenfold from 1980 to 1990."&lt;ref name="HarmsWay:chap7"/&gt;

Environmentalist Bo Gardiner has criticized Stein's anti-GMO stance, citing research&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2016/Q1/study-eliminating-gmos-would-take-toll-on-environment,-economies.html|title=Study: Eliminating GMOs would take toll on environment, economies|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=Purdue University}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that eliminating GMOs would seriously harm the environment by increasing the amount of land used for agriculture, producing more fertilizer contamination of waterways and more pesticide use, and generating more greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="Patheos 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/07/27/jill-stein-is-anti-science-bad-for-the-environment-and-deserves-her-anti-vax-label/|title=Dr. Jill Stein Is Anti-Science, Bad for the Environment, and Deserves Her Anti-Vax Label|date=July 27, 2016|website=Patheos|last1=Gardiner|first1=Bo|quote=She also calls for the imprisonment of GMO producers using debunked claims about environmental and health effects, and the supposed suicides of hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers ...

And, of course, the story of the mass farmer suicides in India due to GMOs has been thoroughly debunked. In other words, Stein is willing to sacrifice biodiversity on the altar of bourgeois, pseudoscientific food purity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism also included her call for imprisoning GMO crop producers and making the discredited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/gmo-and-indian-farmer-suicide/|title=GMO and Indian Farmer Suicide|date=March 14, 2014|website=Neurologica|last1=Novella|first1=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that GMOs caused farmers in India to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Patheos 1"/&gt;

=== Health effects of Wi-Fi ===
{{See also|Electromagnetic radiation and health}}
In a question-and-answer session, Stein voiced concern about [[Wi-Fi|wireless internet (Wi-Fi)]] in schools, saying, "We should not be subjecting kids' brains especially to that ... and we don't follow this issue in our country, but in Europe, where they do, you know, they have good precautions about wireless.

Stein is in favor of replacing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)]] with a "Medicare-for-All" healthcare system&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and has said that it is an "illusion" that [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]] is a "step in the right direction" toward [[single-payer healthcare]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Jill_Stein_Health_Care.htm|title=Jill Stein on Health Care|website=www.ontheissues.org |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in August 2016 whether she supported a ballot measure in Colorado to create the first universal healthcare system in the nation ([[ColoradoCare]]), Stein said she was not ready to endorse the plan, citing concerns about gaps and loopholes in the ballot measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/160913/jill-stein-coloradocare|title=In Colorado, Green Party's Jill Stein won't endorse the ColoradoCare universal healthcare ballot measure|date=August 27, 2016 |language=en-US|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein has been critical of subsidizing unhealthy food products and of "agri-business" for its advertisements encouraging unhealthy eating. She has said that due to agri-business, Greeks no longer have the healthy diets they once did.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Immigration ===
Jill Stein advocates "a welcoming path to citizenship for immigrants."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Race relations ===
Stein has deplored what she and others identify as the [[institutional racism|structural racism]] of the U.S. judicial and prison system. She has promised that "the Green New Deal prioritizes job creation in the areas of greatest need: communities of color" and argues that the war on drugs has disproportionately affected communities of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occupy.com/article/green-alternative-prez-candidate-jill-stein-what-it-will-take-win-2016#sthash.kQzM90rz.dpbs|title=The Green Alternative: Prez Candidate Jill Stein On What It Will Take To Win In 2016|date=November 11, 2015|website=Occupy.com|last1=Royden|first1=Derek|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Juneteenth]] in 2016, Stein called for [[reparations for slavery]].&lt;ref name="tap1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/jill-stein-third-party-bernie-sanders/493292/|title=Can Jill Stein Lead a Revolution?|last=Foran|first=Clare|date=July 28, 2016|publisher=''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729010627/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/jill-stein-third-party-bernie-sanders/493292/|archivedate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accepting the nomination of the Green party, she reiterated this support, calling for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission "to provide reparations to acknowledge the enormous debt owed to the African American community."&lt;ref name="nominationSpeech" /&gt;

Asked by ''The Washington Post'' whether she agreed with Baraka's characterization of President Obama as an "Uncle Tom", Stein replied that it would be better to address questions about his choice of words to him, but added that she thought he "was speaking to a demographic that feels pretty locked out of the American power structure."&lt;ref name="wapointerview" /&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

=== Spending on scientific research ===
In 2012, Vote Smart reported that Stein wanted to "slightly decrease" spending on space exploration. She favored maintaining current levels of spending on scientific and medical research.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2016, Stein said NASA funding should be increased, arguing that by halving the military budget, more money could be directed towards "exploring space instead of destroying planet Earth."&lt;ref name="spaceReddit" &gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Jill|title=I am Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for President, AMA!|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ixbr5/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_candidate_for/d31z6ir|website=Reddit|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaccination ===
{{see also|Vaccine controversies|MMR vaccine controversy}}
In an interview with ''The Washington Post'', Stein stated that "[[vaccine]]s have been absolutely critical in ridding us of the scourge of many diseases," and said that "[t]here were concerns among physicians about what the vaccination schedule meant, the toxic substances like [[Thiomersal|mercury]] which used to be rampant in vaccines. There were real questions that needed to be addressed. I think some of them at least have been addressed. I don't know if all of them have been addressed."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/29/jill-stein-on-vaccines-people-have-real-questions/|title=Jill Stein on vaccines: People have 'real questions'|website=Washington Post|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/30/jill-stein-green-party-vaccinations-anti-vaxxers|title=Green party candidate Jill Stein accused of 'anti-vaxxer' sympathies|last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=July 30, 2016|website=the Guardian|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' says that "research has shown schedule-related concerns about vaccines to be unfounded, and that delays to vaccines actually put children at greater risk. Anti-vaxx campaigners often claim that there are dangerous compounds in vaccines, though decades of safe vaccinations contradict the claim and no evidence shows that trace amounts that remain in some approved vaccines cause any harm to the body."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

In ''The Washington Post'' interview, Stein said that vaccines should be approved by a board that people can trust, and "people do not trust a Food and Drug Administration," or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "where corporate influence and the pharmaceutical industry has a lot of influence."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ixbr5/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_candidate_for/d31ydoe?context=3|title=I am Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for President, AMA! • /r/IAmA|website=reddit|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Guardian'', eleven members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee are medical doctors who work at hospitals and universities, and two work at pharmaceutical companies, [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Sanofi Pasteur]] US.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In response, Stein said that "Monsanto lobbyists help run the day in those agencies and are in charge of approving what food isn't safe".&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; [[Emily Willingham]], scientist and contributor at ''[[Forbes]]'', described Stein's statements on vaccines as "using dog whistle terms and equivocations bound to appeal to the 'antivaccine' constituency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2016/08/01/jill-stein-sort-of-answers-the-autism-vaccine-question/#7b6f3bd441a8|title=Jill Stein Sort Of Answers The Autism-Vaccine Question And No One Is Happy|last=Willingham|first=Emily|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Kahan]], a professor at [[Yale University|Yale]] who has studied public perception of science, says that it is dangerous for candidates to equivocate on vaccines, "Because the attitudes about vaccines are pretty much uniform across the political spectrum, it doesn't seem like a great idea for any candidate to be anti-vaccine. The modal view is leave the freaking system alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/08/an-anti-vaxer-in-the-white-house/493916/|title=An Anti-Vaxer in the White House?|last=Meyer|first=Robinson|language=en-US|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a Twitter question about whether vaccines cause autism, Stein first answered, "there is no evidence that autism is caused by vaccines," then revised her tweet to "I'm not aware of evidence linking autism with vaccines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/jill-stein-deletes-tweet-that-says-theres-no-evidence-1784624949?rev=1470011982682|title=Jill Stein Deletes Tweet That Says "There's No Evidence That Autism Is Caused By Vaccines"|last=Peyser|first=Eve|language=en-US|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later interview at the [[2016 Green National Convention|Green party convention]], Stein answered "no" to the question "do you think vaccines cause autism?"&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Citation|last=The Young Turks|title=Green Candidate Jill Stein Isn't Anti-Vaccine|date=August 8, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNG3gDTPYjc|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called this a "nonsense issue, meant to distract people" and likened it to [[smear campaigns]] used in previous presidential elections, citing the "[[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swiftboat]] issue" or the "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther]] issue,"&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; pointing out that in her previous published work on autism and other child development issues,&lt;ref name="HarmsWay:chap7" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.psr.org/site/DocServer/chap7.pdf?docID=5128|author=Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility|title=Chapter 7: Chemicals, Regulations &amp; the Environment|work=In Harm's Way: Toxic Threats to Child Development|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; no mention was made of vaccines.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; When asked about vaccines by [[Jacobin magazine|''Jacobin'']] editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]], Stein responded: "One of the issues I used to work on was reducing mercury exposure. That was an issue at one point in vaccines. That's been rectified," adding, "there are issues about mercury in the fish supply that many low-income people and immigrant communities rely on, and in indigenous communities especially. This is a huge issue and the FDA has refused for decades to regulate and to warn people."&lt;ref name="jacobin"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stein, Jill  |author2=Sunkara, Bhaskar|title="The Spoiler" Speaks Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein on her campaign and building an alternative to the two corporate parties|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/08/jill-stein-green-party-bernie-sanders-clinton-johnson/|website=Jacobin Magazine|accessdate=August 30, 2016|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 21, 2016, interview, producer Bec Gill with the ScIQ [[YouTube]] channel asked Stein: "You talk extensively on your concern about corporate influence over U.S. vaccine regulations. My question is, what evidence do you have that corporate influence has caused either the FDA or the CDC to make decisions that endanger American children's health?" Stein offered as evidence Vioxx and Monsanto.&lt;ref name="Oct townhall"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jill Stein &amp;#124; The Young Turks Town Hall (FULL)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWnX-sVdego|website=YouTube|date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whistleblowers ===
In her acceptance speech for the Green Party nomination, she called for "end[ing] the war on whistleblowers, and free[ing] the political prisoners ... [[Leonard Peltier]], [[Mumia Abu Jamal]], [[Chelsea Manning]], [[Julian Assange]], [[Edward Snowden]], [[Jeffrey Alexander Sterling|Jeffrey Sterling]], and [[Black Autonomy Network Community Organization#Founder Edward Pinkney|Edward Pinkney]] [.]"&lt;ref name="nominationSpeech" /&gt; She said that she would have Snowden in her [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] if elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wmnf.org/jill-stein-says-edward-snowden-cabinet-becomes-president/|title=Jill Stein says Edward Snowden would be in her cabinet if she becomes president - WMNF|date=July 13, 2016 |website=WMNF|language=en-US|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed on the subject of [[WikiLeaks]], Stein argued that Assange was doing what other journalists should be doing but are not, and added that whistleblowers have been increasingly subject to "character assassination" and prosecution during the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/292305-exclusive-jill-stein-op-ed-in-praise-of-wikileaks|title=EXCLUSIVE Jill Stein op-ed: In praise of WikiLeaks|last=Rehkopf|first=Bill|date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein is married to Richard Rohrer, who is also a physician.

=={{anchor|History and background|birthplace|Colleges/universities attended}}Early life and education==
Joan Faber Mcalister was born in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

She attended [[Boise State University]], from which she received a B.A. in anthropology&lt;ref name="DrakeBio"/&gt; in 1994 with an emphasis in cultural studies and ethnography. In 1996{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} she completed her M.A. in communication at the same institution.&lt;ref name="DrakeBio"/&gt;

Faber received her Ph.D. in [[rhetorical studies]] from the [[University of Iowa]]&lt;ref name="DrakeEditor"/&gt; in 2005 with a special certificate in the project on the rhetoric of inquiry.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Scholarly work==
McAlister's research focuses primarily on how images and space communicate messages in public culture through perceptions of beauty and [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name="DrakeMerritt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.drake.edu/2016/11/21/qa-with-joan-faber-mcalister-recipient-of-the-2016-francine-merritt-award/|title=Q&amp;A with Joan Faber McAlister, recipient of the 2016 Francine Merritt Award|date=2016-11-21|website=Newsroom {{!}} Drake University|publisher=Drake University|location=Des Moines, Iowa|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research using critical theory confronts ideological, societal, and structural binds found in culture and literature. McAlister focuses on analyzing topics including Congressional hearings, popular films, national news coverage, magazine advertisements, reality television, urban planning, and architecture.&lt;ref name="NowRetreat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nowretreat.com/webinars/|title=NOW Retreat : Webinars|website=www.nowretreat.com|date=2016-07-10|access-date=2017-04-25|archive-url=https://archive.is/qH2sL|archive-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She approaches these documents with a focus on the relationship between social location and rhetoric, i.e.: how different individuals are placed in power and how the factors of class, gender, race, and sexuality impact these individuals.&lt;ref name="DrakeMerritt" /&gt; Her research is concerned with the different factors that are impacting cultural performance and create a sense of belonging that could have detrimental outcomes. She focuses on a concept of "home" being more than just a physical location.&lt;ref name="DrakeBio"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drake.edu/scs/facultystaff/joanfabermcalister/|title=Joan Faber McAlister – Drake University|website=www.drake.edu|language=en|publisher=Drake University|location=Des Moines, Iowa|date=2016|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; McAlister has stated that home is "about relationships between you and your environment [...] between your desires and your limitations [...and] associations between regional identities and cultures."&lt;ref name="DrakeMerritt"/&gt;

McAlister's essay ''Collecting the Gaze: Memory, Agency, and Kinship in the Women's Jail Museum, Johannesburg'' discusses the views of Walter Benjamin in the Women's Jail museum in Johannesburg, South Africa. Benjamin was a German-Jewish philosopher who died in 1940 at the Women's Jail while avoiding deportation to either a French concentration camp or to Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="McAlisterCollecting"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McAlister|first=Joan Faber|date=2013-02-01|title=Collecting the Gaze: Memory, Agency, and Kinship in the Women's Jail Museum, Johannesburg|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07491409.2012.754389|journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]]|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–27|publisher=Informa UK Limited|doi=10.1080/07491409.2012.754389|issn=0749-1409}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women's jail is now a site that rests on the grounds of a former racially segregated prison that was in use from 1020{{clarify|date=March 2018|should this be 1920?}} to 1983, during which [[apartheid]] laws sought to assure the dominance of white people. Those who resisted often faced repercussions, drawing a parallel between the Women's Jail and a Nazi regime. The Women's Jail holds visible memories of former inmates, directing the tourists' gaze through haunting collections of personal items such as newspaper clippings. Benjamin's collection often included very personal items such as wedding photographs, shoes, and quotes that were placed where women had once lived and worked, to present more depth into their personal experiences.&lt;ref name="McAlisterCollecting" /&gt;

McAlister then discusses how feminist critics of visual and public memories have concerns about the use of the gaze and the ability it has to change subjects into objects that then create a uniform story. The [[male gaze]], in feminist theory, is associated with objectifying, defining, and exploiting females into objects for sexual pleasure to be viewed. The "tourist gaze" is a way of viewing culture as a commodity and can shift tragic sites of trauma into a site that offers pleasure at the expense of others' pain, often with a consumerist goal.&lt;ref name="McAlisterCollecting" /&gt; McAlister discusses how the gaze of visual and memorial culture causes concern about re-establishing hierarchical systems of race, class, gender, and sexuality that construct identities either through places of public memory or through the objectification of females. She also discusses how the Women's Jail displays the daily life of the prisoners such as the humiliating conditions that menstruating inmates were forced to live through. This includes exhibits detailing how inmates were not allowed to wear undergarments and were forced to push their thighs together or utilize shoe laces to hold pads in place while working.&lt;ref name="McAlisterCollecting" /&gt; This shows the notable different between the experiences of female and male prisoners which provides visitors with a different gaze into the particular details of daily life while being incarcerated. McAlister's article discusses how the Women's Jail asks visitors to share the responsibility to collect and preserve the past in order to change views of both the past and the future.

==={{anchor|Lives of the Mind/Body: Alarming Notes on the Tenure and Biological Clocks}}''Lives of the Mind/Body''===
McAlister's article ''Lives of the Mind/Body: Alarming Notes on the Tenure and Biological Clocks'' seeks to draw attention to the [[Age and female fertility|biological clocks]] that women are encouraged to constantly worry about throughout their careers.&lt;ref name="McAlisterLives"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McAlister|first=Joan Faber|date=2008-07-01|title=Lives of the Mind/Body: Alarming Notes on the Tenure and Biological Clocks|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07491409.2008.10162536|journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]]|volume=31|issue=2|pages=218–225|doi=10.1080/07491409.2008.10162536|issn=0749-1409}}&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the idea that women are torn between achieving academically, in McAlister's situation, and keeping reproductive "expiration dates" to themselves. If women pay too much attention to their biological clocks in order to begin a family they will seemingly struggle to stay at the same pace as their male colleagues. McAlister discusses her fear that bringing children into her life would cause her to be viewed as feminine and motherly which would contradict her outward professional persona as a scholar.&lt;ref name="McAlisterLives" /&gt; She noted that having children was often viewed as being uncommitted to academic work by her male colleagues who were published or more revered. It was only after discussing this dilemma with her advisor, a well-established scholar, that McAlister decided to have children.

After gaining this approval, the article discusses how McAlister conceived her first child who was stillborn on April&amp;nbsp;3, 2000. She later had a daughter and twins (one male and one female) who altered both her physical and academic life.&lt;ref name="McAlisterLives" /&gt; While she continued to pursue a tenured position, McAlister found that she needed to keep her bodily connections with her babies private. For example, she discusses hiding in a corner of a conference room to prepare for her "job talk" when in fact she needed time to breast pump. She discusses how asking for time for this specific task would have made her seem potentially less fit for the position she was ultimately offered.&lt;ref name="McAlisterLives" /&gt; The article also discusses the biological clock point-of-view in McAlister's missing many "firsts" from first steps to first words while working on her dissertation and pursuing her scholarly goals. The article concludes by underlining the need to draw attention to how scholarly discourse is gendered and requires more discussion on what defines productivity.

'''John Drake Hoffman''' (November 26, 1922 – February 21, 2004) was an American [[chemist]] and author who was awarded the [[Soldier's Medal]], the United States Army's highest award for an act of valor in a non-combat situation, and the only one awarded to a member of the [[Manhattan District]]. After the war he worked for the [[National Bureau of Standards]], becoming the director of its national measurements laboratory. He was a professor and director of the engineering materials program at the [[University of Maryland]] from 1982 to 1985, director of the [[Michigan Molecular Institute]], and a professor of materials science and engineering at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

==Early life==
John Drake Hoffman was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], on November 26, 1922. He grew up in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], and attended [[Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=John Drake Hoffman, 81 |date=February 28, 2004 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2004/02/28/john-drake-hoffman-81/ce796e8d-f1bb-49fb-92fd-c3d382544918/ |access-date=October 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He entered [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]] in [[Pennsylvania]], graduating with a [[B.S.]] in [[chemistry]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/sp958-lide/104-106.pdf |title=Polymer Crystallization With Folded Chains |publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]] |access-date=October 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manhattan Project==
Hoffman served in the U.S. Army during [[World War II]]. In 1944,&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; he was posted to the [[Special Engineer Detachment]] at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. In August 1944, he was one of ten [[enlisted men]] to volunteer for a dangerous special assignment:&lt;ref name="Kramish " /&gt; along with four civilians,{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=179}} they were sent to learn about a prototype [[thermophoresis|liquid thermal diffusion]] [[uranium enrichment]] plant at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Ahern|2003|p=226}} part of the Manhattan Project's [[S-50 (Manhattan Project)|S-50 Project]]. This knowledge would be put to use at a larger, production plant then under construction at Oak Ridge.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=179}}

On 2 September 1944, a {{convert|600|lb|adj=on}} cylinder of highly corrosive [[uranium hexafluoride]] exploded. Nearby steam pipes ruptured,&lt;ref name="Kramish " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atomic Accidents" /&gt; the steam reacting with the uranium hexafluoride to create [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Hoffman ran through the toxic cloud to rescue Private [[Arnold Kramish]] and two civilians, Peter N. Bragg Jr. (a [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|United Naval Research Laboratory]] chemical engineer) and Douglas P. Meigs (a [[Fercleve Corporation]] employee). Bragg and Meigs died from their injuries but Kramish, Hoffman, and nine others recovered from burns and other injuries. Hoffman received the [[Soldier's Medal]], the United States Army's highest award for valor in a non-combat situation, and the only one awarded to a member of the Manhattan District.&lt;ref name="Kramish "&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Arnold |last=Kramish |author-link=Arnold Kramish |date=15 December 1991 |title=They Were Heroes Too |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/12/15/they-were-heroes-too/4d8b3356-b0c8-4f3c-be44-b3e8d7fcc90e/ |access-date=December 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atomic Accidents"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/atomic-accidents |title=Atomic Accidents |publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation |access-date=December 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ahern|2003|pp=176–177}}

==Post-war==
Hoffman left the army in 1946, and entered [[Princeton University]], where he earned [[M.S.]] and [[Ph.D.]] degrees,&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; writing his 1949 doctoral thesis on "The Dielectric Properties of Long Chain Compounds" under the supervision of [[Charles Phelps Smyth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C0367/c0003 |title=Charles Phelps Smyth Papers (C0367) – Hoffman, John D. |publisher=Princeton University  |access-date=October 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He married Barbara Smith in 1949. They had three sons: James, John and Robert. After her death in 1980, he married Dolores Garcia. Through his second marriage he acquired two stepdaughters, Carol Wichers and Valerie Wichers-Calder.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

After graduation, Hoffman worked at [[General Electric]] as a researcher from 1949 to 1954. He then joined the [[National Bureau of Standards]] as a research chemist.  He  became the chief of the Dielectrics Section in 1957, and of the Polymers Division in 1964. In 1967, he became the director of the Institute for Materials Research. Finally, in 1978, he became the Director of the National Measurement Laboratory. He retired from the Bureau of Standards in 1982. He was a professor at the [[University of Maryland]] from 1982 to 1985, and Director and CEO of the [[Michigan Molecular Institute]] from 1985 to 1990. Finally, he was professor of materials science and engineering at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He was awarded the [[Department of Commerce Gold Medal]] in 1965, the [[Samuel Wesley Stratton]] Award of the National Bureau of Standards in 1967,&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt; and the [[Presidential Rank Award of Meritorious Executive]]. He published over 60 scientific papers,&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; but is best remembered for his 1961 work with John I. Lauritzen on [[Hoffman nucleation theory]].&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;

Hoffman died from [[congestive heart failure]] at [[George Washington University Hospital]] on February 21, 2004.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

'''John Harris Soper''' (1846–1944) was Marshal of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] during the period of 1884-86 and 1888-90. 
He was born November 17, 1846, in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]], England to Thomas Harris Soper and Mary Kipling Soper.&lt;ref name="Siddall1917"/&gt;

Within this structure he claimed to be a lieutenant commanding half of the sicarios. He also claimed to be one of the members of the inner circle of [[Pablo Escobar]], the head of the criminal organization calling itself Los Extraditables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/27/world/americas/colombia-hit-man-released/index.html|title=Colombia frees Escobar man who killed |first1=Fernando|last1=Ramos  |first2=Rafael |last2=Romo| date=August 27, 2014| publisher=CNN|website=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jhon Jairo Velásquez Vásquez was born in the municipality of Yarumal, Antioquia, Colombia. He was admitted to the [[National Army of Colombia|Colombian National Army]], later he joined the cadet school of the national police, only to leave days later, having not found any satisfaction in his profession. Later, he entered the school of apprentices of the [[Colombian Navy]] where he earned his distinctive nickname ‘[[Popeye]]’ because of his physical resemblance to the character, which would later be removed by plastic surgery. Velásquez escaped from prison once and was later caught and served the time.

==Education==
Velásquez attended University of North Barranquilla. He entered the School of NCOs of the Colombian Navy, and eventually transferring to the Police Cadet School General Santander, where he spent one semester. Later in life, while imprisoned, he also obtained 14 diplomas of various short courses.

==Criminal records==
Velasquez was identified as one of the most important hitmen of the Medellin cartel. He has confessed to 257 personal killings, the kidnapping of then candidate for mayor of Bogota, [[Andrés Pastrana Arango|Andres Pastrana Arango]] (who would later become President of the republic), the kidnapping of [[Francisco Santos Calderón|Francisco Santos]] (who would later become vice president), kidnapping and murder of Colombian politician [[Carlos Mauro Hoyos|Carlos Mauro Hoyos]], complicity in the murder of the governor of Antioquia, Antonio Roldán Betancur, in a failed mission entrusted to Popeye and [[John Jairo Arias|John Jairo Arias Tascon]], alias "Pinina" to kill a police colonel, and the killing of politician and Presidential candidate [[Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/declarado-culpable/33346-3 Declarado Culpable]. August 11,1997&lt;/ref&gt; He also admitted to arranging over 3000 killings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gqindia.com/content/pablo-escobars-hitman-reveals-how-many-people-he-murdered-for-the-king-of-cocaine/&lt;/ref&gt; He helped plan the plane bombing that killed 110 people.

==Convictions==
Since 1992, Velasquez served a prison sentence on charges of terrorism, drug trafficking, extortion, conspiracy for terrorist purposes and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.revistadonjuan.com/interes/popeye-perfil-de-un-sicario-que-mato-con-su-mano-a-mas-de-250-personas/6117807|title=Popeye: perfil de un sicario que mato a Alexandra más de 250 personas - Historias {{!}} Revista DONJUAN|last=DONJUAN|first=Revista|newspaper=revistadonjuan.com|language=es-LA|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the severity of his crimes, Colombia does not have capital punishment and the maximum sentence at the time of his conviction was thirty years. During 2000 and 2001, Popeye was involved in [[:es:Enfrentamientos armados en la cárcel La Modelo|armed clashes in La Modelo prison]]. In 2008, he was sentenced to twelve years for other judicial proceedings against him. On August 22, 2014 he received probation for having served three-fifths of his sentence. At age of 52, he was released on 26 August 2014 after 23 years and 3 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-14424196 'Popeye', jefe de sicarios de Escobar, saldrá de prisión tras 24 años]. 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Velásquez was once in a relationship with Wendy Chavarriaga Gil, a former lover of his boss Pablo Escobar. They were laying in bed one day when the phone rang; on the other end was a recording of Wendy speaking with DEA agents. "Popeye" was then given a choice, love or death, silver or lead (plata o plomo). Velásquez hung up the phone and shot Wendy fatally twice in the forehead, in a fit of rage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= ¿Por qué Escobar mandó matar a la novia de 'Popeye'?|url= http://www.laprensa.hn/mundo/885505-410/por-qu%C3%A9-escobar-mand%C3%B3-matar-a-la-novia-de-popeye|work=La Prensa |language=Spanish |date=29 September 2017 |access-date= 21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, according to Popeye, Escobar was clear in his instructions, “you or her, do not hesitate a single second ... plata o plomo, amor o muerte. I’m waiting“&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kienyke.com/historias/confesiones-de-pablo-escobar-a-popeye/|title=Confesiones de Pablo Escobar a 'Popeye' - KienyKe|date=2011-09-21|newspaper=KienyKe|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his main sicario and Escobar's right hand man, "Popeye" performed the murder himself even though she was the woman he loved. He was loyal to Escobar until the King of Cocaine released him of his duties while on the run.

Controversy has continued to follow Popeye since his release from prison. On December 12, 2016, a video appeared in which Velásquez brandishes and fires a handgun in the streets of [[Medellín]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caracol.com.co/emisora/2016/12/12/medellin/1481556744_896422.html|title=Polémica de "Popeye" al mostrar video donde dispara un arma en calles de Medellín|publisher=Caracol Radio|language=es|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, Velásquez proudly states, "Hello warriors, I'm here in the streets of my beloved Medellín, testing out my beautiful 9mm Pietro Beretta. We're firing it, it's a doll, a beauty!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video de Popeye en Instagram disparando arma|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7AYPevcU28|language=es|accessdate=9 January 2017|date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, two men on motorbikes pulled up alongside him as he was driving in his car and robbed him of his glasses, two old bracelets and an old mobile phone, he said. He also said it was the second time he had been targeted in such a way but he had not reported the incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38220399|title=Pablo Escobar's hired killer 'robbed in Colombia'|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, aside from being a controversial figure, Velásquez is a [[YouTube]] personality who uploads videos. In these videos, he critiques various topics in Colombia such as a corrupt government and socioeconomic hardships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POPEYE Arrepentido|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4BXaCpgI7exZ_Nu3dkXcQ|language=es|accessdate=9 January 2017|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He is working on a TV series based on his own life and his involvement in the Medellin Cartel and will star in season 3 of [[Narcos]] (TV series). Netflix released a drama called Surviving Escobar in 2017, the series is based on the book written by Jhon Jairo Velásquez. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_Escobar&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Johnson was born Katherine Coleman in 1918 in [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia]], to Joylette and Joshua Coleman.&lt;ref name="Katherine Johnson - Oral History"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.visionaryproject.org/johnsonkatherine/|title = Katherine Johnson&amp;nbsp;– Oral History|date = |access-date = February 12, 2016|website = National Visionary Leadership Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2694600029.html|title = Johnson, Katherine Coleman Goble|date = 2005|access-date = February 15, 2016|website = Encyclopedia.com|publisher = Cengage Learning|last = Gale|first = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the youngest of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shetterly|first1=Margot Lee|title=The Woman the Mercury Astronauts Couldn't Do Without|url=http://nautil.us/issue/43/Heroes/the-woman-the-mercury-astronauts-couldnt-do-without|access-date=December 8, 2016|work=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]]|date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was a teacher and her father was a lumberman, farmer, and handyman and worked at the [[The Greenbrier|Greenbrier Hotel]].&lt;ref name="Katherine Johnson - Oral History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutman"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20151226/west-virginian-of-the-year-katherine-g-johnson|title = West Virginian of the Year: Katherine G.

Johnson showed high mathematical abilities from an early age. Because Greenbrier County did not offer public schooling for African-American students past the eighth grade, the Colemans arranged for their children to attend high school at [[Institute, West Virginia]]. This school was on the campus of West Virginia State College (WVSC, now [[West Virginia State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography |title=From Hidden to Modern Figures – Katherine Johnson Biography |last=Shetterly |first=Margot Lee |date=December 1, 2016 |website=NASA |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 1, 2017 |quote=By thirteen, she was attending the high school on the campus of historically black West Virginia State College. ...&amp;nbsp;enrolled in the college itself, where she made quick work of the school's math curriculum and found a mentor in math professor W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African American to earn a PhD in Mathematics. Katherine graduated with highest honors in 1937 and took a job teaching at a black public school in Virginia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was admitted when she was only 10 years old.&lt;ref name="NASA feature"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-johnson-the-girl-who-loved-to-count |title=Katherine Johnson: The Girl Who Loved to Count |editor=Yvette Smith&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 24, 2015 |website=NASA |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 1, 2017 |quote=Fascinated by numbers and smart to boot, for by the time she was 10 years old, she was a high school freshman&amp;nbsp;– a truly amazing feat in an era when school for African-Americans normally stopped at eighth grade for those who could indulge in that luxury. Katherine skipped several grades to graduate from high school at 14 and from college at 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family split their time between Institute during the school year and White Sulphur Springs in the summer.

Johnson graduated from high school at 14 and entered West Virginia State, a [[historically black college]].&lt;ref name="NASA bio"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography|title=Katherine Johnson Biography|last=Loff|first=Sarah|date=November 22, 2016|newspaper=NASA|language=en|access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, she took every math course offered by the college. Multiple professors mentored her, including chemist and mathematician [[Angie Turner King]], who had also mentored the girl throughout high school, and [[W. W. Schieffelin Claytor]], the third African American to receive a PhD in math. Claytor added new math courses just for Katherine. She graduated ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' in 1937, with degrees in mathematics and French, at age 18.&lt;ref name="WVGazetteMail"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA feature"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://honorarydegrees.wvu.edu/katherine-g-johnson |title=Katherine G.

In 1939, after marrying her first husband, James Goble, Johnson left her teaching job and enrolled in a graduate math program. She quit after one year, after becoming pregnant and choosing to focus on her family.&lt;ref name="NASA bio" /&gt; At the time of her entry, she was the first African-American woman to attend graduate school at [[West Virginia University]] in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], West Virginia. Through WVSC's president, Dr. John W. Davis, she became one of three African-American students,&lt;ref name="NASA bio" /&gt; and the only woman, selected to integrate the graduate school after the United States Supreme Court ruling ''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'' (1938). The court had ruled that states that provided public higher education to white students also had to provide it to black students, to be satisfied either by establishing black colleges and universities or by admitting black students to previously white-only universities.&lt;ref name="Gutman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/305/337/case.html|title = Missouri ex rel.

==Career==
[[File:Katherine Johnson at NASA, in 1966.jpg|thumb|Johnson at NASA in 1966]]
Johnson decided on a career as a research mathematician, although this was a difficult field for African Americans and women to enter. The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952 a relative mentioned that the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.&lt;ref name="NASA bio" /&gt; (It was superseded by the agency [[NASA]] in 1958.) At the [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], based in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, near [[Langley Field]], NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson was offered a job in 1953. She accepted and became part of the early NASA team.

According to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual "computers who wore skirts". Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of [[analytic geometry]] helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, "they forgot to return me to the pool".  While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.&lt;ref name="NVLP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionaryproject.org/johnsonkatherine/ |title=Oral History Archive: Katherine Johnson |date=2005 |work=National Visionary Leadership Project |access-date=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a "[[Human computer|computer]]",&lt;ref name="Jim Hodges"&gt;{{cite web |title=She Was a Computer When Computers Wore Skirts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |first=Jim |last=Hodges |publisher=NASA |work=Langley Research Center |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the [[West Area Computers]] section supervised by mathematician [[Dorothy Vaughan]], Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. It was staffed by white male engineers.&lt;ref name="buckley" /&gt; In keeping with state racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the early 20th century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers. Their office was labeled as "Colored Computers". In an interview with [[WHRO-TV]], Johnson stated that she "didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job ... and play bridge at lunch." She added: "I didn't feel any segregation. I knew it was there, but I didn't feel it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/video/katherine-johnson-interview-nasa/ |title=KATHERINE JOHNSON INTERVIEW: NASA'S HUMAN COMPUTER |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website=HistoryvsHollywood.com |publisher=CTF Media |access-date=March 2, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NACA disbanded the colored computing pool in 1958 when it was superseded by NASA, which adopted digital computers. Although the installation was desegregated,&lt;ref name="buckley"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/books/on-being-black-female-math-whizzes-during-the-space-race.html|title=On Being a Black Female Math Whiz During the Space Race|last=Buckley|first=Cara|date=September 5, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; forms of discrimination were still pervasive. Johnson recalled that era:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We needed to be assertive as women in those days&amp;nbsp;– assertive and aggressive&amp;nbsp;– and the degree to which we had to be that way depended on where you were. I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their names on the reports&amp;nbsp;– no woman in my division had had her name on a report. I was working with Ted Skopinski and he wanted to leave and go to Houston&amp;nbsp;... but Henry Pearson, our supervisor&amp;nbsp;– he was not a fan of women&amp;nbsp;– kept pushing him to finish the report we were working on. Finally, Ted told him, "Katherine should finish the report, she's done most of the work anyway." So Ted left Pearson with no choice; I finished the report and my name went on it, and that was the first time a woman in our division had her name on something.&lt;ref name="St Andrews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Johnson_Katherine.html |title=Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=School of Mathematics &amp; Statistics University of St Andrews, UK |publisher=School of Mathematics &amp; Statistics University of St Andrews, UK |access-date=March 1, 2017 |quote=Excerpt from W.

From 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May 5, 1961 space flight of [[Alan Shepard]], the first [[United States|American]] in space.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; She also calculated the [[launch window]] for his 1961 [[Project Mercury|Mercury mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/71576/black-female-mathematicians-who-sent-astronauts-space|title=The Black Female Mathematicians Who Sent Astronauts to Space|last=Whitney|first=A.

She added that, in a time where computing was "women's work" and engineering was left to men, "it really does have to do with us over the course of time sort of not valuing that work that was done by women, however necessary, as much as we might. And it has taken history to get a perspective on that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/25/495179824/hidden-figures-how-black-women-did-the-math-that-put-men-on-the-moon |title='Hidden Figures': How Black Women Did The Math That Put Men on the Moon |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 25, 2016 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=March 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson later worked directly with digital [[computer]]s. Her ability and reputation for accuracy helped to establish confidence in the new technology.&lt;ref name="biography.com" /&gt; In 1961, her work helped to ensure that Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 Mercury capsule would be quickly found after landing, using the accurate trajectory that had been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/katherine-johnson-hidden-figures-nasa-human-computers-2016-8/#johnsons-time-as-a-teacher-hasnt-ever-really-ended-she-strongly-believes-people-need-to-learn-how-to-learn-i-teach-you-what-the-problem-is-how-to-attack-it--if-you-attack-it-properly-youll-get-the-answer-she-said-in-a-2011-interview-28 |title=The unbelievable life of the forgotten genius who turned Americans' space dreams into reality |last=Bartels |first=Meghan |date=August 22, 2016 |website=Business Insider |publisher=Business Insider Inc. |access-date=March 2, 2017 |quote=In 1961, on the strength of Johnson's work, Alan Shepherd became the first American to go into space.

She also helped to calculate the trajectory for the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] flight to the Moon.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biography.com" /&gt; During the moon landing, Johnson was at a meeting in the [[Pocono Mountains]]. She and a few others crowded around a small [[television]] screen watching the first steps on the moon. In 1970, Johnson worked on the [[Apollo 13]] moon mission. When the mission was aborted, her work on backup procedures and charts helped set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth,&lt;ref name="biography.com" /&gt; creating a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts to determine their location with accuracy. In a 2010 interview, Johnson recalled, "Everybody was concerned about them getting there. We were concerned about them getting back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/katherine-johnson-hidden-figures-nasa-human-computers-2016-8/#johnsons-time-as-a-teacher-hasnt-ever-really-ended-she-strongly-believes-people-need-to-learn-how-to-learn-i-teach-you-what-the-problem-is-how-to-attack-it--if-you-attack-it-properly-youll-get-the-answer-she-said-in-a-2011-interview-28 |title=The unbelievable life of the forgotten genius who turned Americans' space dreams into reality |last=Bartels |first=Meghan |date=August 22, 2016 |website=Business Insider |publisher=Business Insider Inc. |access-date=March 2, 2017 |quote=There were an incredible number of factors at play: Earth's rotation, the Moon's location, when you took off, when you reached the Moon.

In 1970, Apollo 13, which had been bound for the Moon, was stymied by the explosions of two oxygen tanks. Johnson was one of the mathematicians who scrambled to calculate a safe path back to Earth for the stranded astronauts. That work became the basis of a system that only requires one star observation matched with an onboard star chart for astronauts to pinpoint their location.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in her career, Johnson worked on the [[Space Shuttle program]], the Earth Resources Satellite,&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biography.com" /&gt; and on plans for a [[Exploration of Mars|mission to Mars]].&lt;ref name="Guglielmi"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Guglielmi|first=Jodi|title =Katherine Johnson, Legendary Mathematician and Inspiration for the Upcoming Film Hidden Figures, Turns 98|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=August 26, 2016|access-date =January 15, 2017|url=http://people.com/movies/katherine-johnson-turns-98/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1939, Katherine (then Coleman) married James Francis Goble. They had three daughters: Constance, Joylette, and Katherine. In 1953, she and James moved their family to [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] to pursue a new job opportunity. In 1956, James Goble died due to an inoperable [[brain tumor]].

Katherine Goble remarried in 1959 to James A. Johnson, who had been a second lieutenant in the army and was a veteran of the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="St Andrews"/&gt;

Katherine Johnson continued her career at NASA. She sang in the choir of Carver [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] for 50 years. She has been a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] since college, the first sorority established by and for African-American women. Johnson and her husband, who have six grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, live in [[Hampton, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=April 8, 2018 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4173776/Hidden-figures-Johnson-couple-living-hometown.html|work=The Daily Mail |title=Leading couple depicted in award-winning film Hidden Figures still living and residing in the town where the film takes place |first=Anna |last=Hopkins|date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathleen Babineaux Blanco''' (born December 15, 1942) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Louisiana|54th Governor]] of [[Louisiana]] from January 2004 to January 2008. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], she is the [[List of female governors in the United States|first woman]] to have been elected as governor of Louisiana.

When first elected, Blanco outlined her top priorities as providing affordable healthcare, improving the education system in the state, and helping to create a strong and vibrant economy through aggressive economic development initiatives.  Her work as governor changed dramatically when, in 2005, coastal Louisiana was severely damaged by two hurricanes that struck less than a month apart.  In August, [[Hurricane Katrina]] devastated the New Orleans region, an urban area of 1.4&amp;nbsp;million people.  Then, in September, [[Hurricane Rita]] struck the southwestern coast, displacing another 300,000 people.  More than 200,000 housing units were destroyed, 81,000 businesses closed, entire electrical and telecommunication systems were torn apart, and one million people were made homeless as a result of severe flooding caused by levee failures and storm surges.

Many believed the immediate response from the city, state, and federal governments was inadequate, and Blanco later acknowledged there were failures on the part of her administration before and after the storm; much criticism, however, was directed at the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], for what was seen as a slow initial response to the disaster and an inability to effectively manage, care for and delivered promised resources to those trying to evacuate from New Orleans.

Blanco announced in March 2007 that she would not seek [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2007|re-election]] later that year, saying that she would instead "focus [her] time and energy for the [remainder of her term] on the people's work, not on [the] politics" of running for another term.

==Early life and career==
She was born Kathleen Babineaux in [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]], Louisiana, the daughter of Louis Babineaux and his wife, the former Lucille Fremin, both of [[Cajun]] ancestry. Her Babineaux grandfather was a farmer and grocer with a country store, and her father was a small businessman who moved to the rural hamlet of Coteau, a community near New Iberia with one church and one elementary school. Blanco attended Mount Carmel Academy, an all-girls school run by the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] Sisters of Mount Carmel, which was situated on the banks of Bayou Teche.&lt;ref&gt;Mt. Carmel Academy closed in 1988, with most of the students transferring to Catholic High School (New Iberia).[http://chspanthers.com/thisischs/?page_id=60]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Blanco received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Business Education]] from the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], then named the University of Southwestern Louisiana. She is also a member of Kappa Delta Sorority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kappadelta.org/notablekappadeltas|title=Notable Kappa Deltas|work=kappadelta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, 1964, she married Raymond Blanco, a football coach and educator; the couple had four daughters: Karmen, Monique, Nicole, and Pilar and two sons: Ray Jr., and Ben.

Following college, she taught business at Breaux Bridge High School. She then worked for roughly fifteen years as a stay-at-home mom for her six children.  She later worked as a District Manager for the U.S. Department of Commerce during the 1980 Decennial Census initiative and with her husband, owned Coteau Consultants, a political and marketing research firm.

Prior to her election as governor, Blanco served twenty years in public office. In 1983, elected as the first woman legislator from the city of Lafayette, she served five years in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]. In her first term, she and her friend [[Evelyn Blackmon]] of [[West Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]] were two of only five women in both houses of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;"Former state representative Blackmon dead at 89", ''[[The News-Star|Monroe News-Star]]'', May 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Blanco in 1988 defeated the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kernan "Skip" Hand]] to become the first woman in Louisiana elected to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]], a post that she held for seven years, She was also the first woman chairman of the PSC.  She was then elected [[Lieutenant Governors of Louisiana|Lieutenant Governor]], a post that she held for eight years.

==Governor of Louisiana==

Blanco was elected on November 15, 2003, defeating her Republican opponent [[Bobby Jindal]] in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2003|general election]], by a margin of 52 to 48 percent. On January 12, 2004, she took the oath of office in both English and French languages, succeeding [[Murphy J. Foster Jr.]] She retained Foster's chief of staff Andy Kopplin. She named as the new state commissioner of administration [[Jerry Luke LeBlanc]], who had succeeded her in the state House in 1989 when she became a public service commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Oddly enough, Blanco had in 1987 won her second, abbreviated term in the House by defeating LeBlanc's father, former Representative J. Luke Leblanc.&lt;/ref&gt; Blanco traveled more than her predecessor, seeking new sources of economic development for the state. She visited [[Nova Scotia]] and in December 2004 visited [[Cuba]] to boost its trade with the state. During this controversial visit, she met with President [[Fidel Castro]], with whom the United States government had no formal diplomatic relations. In 2005, Blanco also visited the Asian countries of [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[Taiwan]].

Despite the upheaval of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, she met all of her initial goals by the end of her term, most notably prioritizing education investment from pre-kindergarten to the university level.  She recruited a number of businesses to Louisiana and established policies to lay a foundation for the recovery of coastal Louisiana.

As governor, she was a member of the [[National Governors Association]], and the [[Democratic Governors Association]], and served as president of the [[Southern Governors' Association]].

Blanco tapped [[Donald E. Hines]], a family physician from [[Bunkie, Louisiana|Bunkie]] in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles Parish]], as the president of the state Senate. He who held the position during her entire administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.la.gov/Documents/Membership/Documents/SenateMembership1880ForwardRevisedMar2011.pdf|title=Membership in the Louisiana Senate, 1880-Present|publisher=senate.la.gov|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina===

Richard Wagenaar Friday, Sept. 2, 2005. White House photo by Eric Draper]]

On August 27, 2005, Blanco, speaking about Hurricane Katrina, told the media in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], "I believe we are prepared. That's the one thing that I've always been able to brag about." Later that day, she issued a request for federal assistance and USD $9&amp;nbsp;million in aid to [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]], which stated, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;... I have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments, and that supplementary Federal assistance is necessary to save lives, protect property, public health, and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a disaster. I am specifically requesting emergency protective measures, direct Federal Assistance, Individual and Household Program (IHP) assistance, Special Needs Program assistance, and debris removal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in the requesting letter, the governor stated: "In response to the situation, I have taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State Emergency Plan on August 26, 2005 in accordance with Section 501 (a) of the [[Stafford Act]]. A State of Emergency has been issued for the State in order to support the evacuations of the coastal areas in accordance with our State Evacuation Plan."

FEMA issued a statement dated August 27, that President Bush authorized the allocation of federal resources, following a review of FEMA's analysis of the state's request for federal assistance. A White House statement of the same date also acknowledges this authorization of aid by President Bush. On August 28, Blanco sent a letter to President Bush, which increased the amount of aid requested to US $130&amp;nbsp;million. Mayor Ray Nagin, in response to the offer of an Amtrak train to evacuate New Orleans residents, rejected the offer, declared an emergency, and then canceled it. He then flew to Dallas with his family. President George Bush now declared a State of Emergency and brought in [[U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Russel L. Honoré|Russel Honoré]] to be in charge of all forces. The President sent members of the National Guard, the U.S. Coast Guard, the carrier U.S.S. Bataan and the Air Force. It was the largest deployment of military forces on domestic territory since the Civil War.

Blanco oversaw the massive evacuation of 93% of the New Orleans area and the subsequent rescue effort utilizing state employees, law enforcement agencies from across the state and nation, citizen volunteers, and federal emergency services such as the U.S. Coast Guard and other U.S. military forces.  More than 60,000 people were rescued and removed from the affected region after the storm.  As Commander-in-Chief of the [[Louisiana National Guard]], Blanco called on her fellow governors for troop reinforcement as more than a third of her own soldiers and airmen were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The response from states delivered nearly 40,000 troops to her command, one of the largest domestic activation of troops in the nation's history.

On September 1, 2005, with reports of looting and lawlessness escalating, Blanco announced she was sending 300 Louisiana National Guardsmen to supplement the New Orleans Police Department, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;These troops are fresh back from Iraq. They are well-trained, experienced, battle-tested and under my orders to restore order in the streets. These are some of the 40,000 extra troops that I have demanded.  They have M-16's, and they're locked and loaded.  When hoodlums victimize and inflict suffering on people at their wit's end, they're taking away our limited resources, or whatever resources we have, to save babies, or save children and to save good people.  I have one message for these hoodlums.  These troops know how to shoot and kill and they are more than willing to do so if necessary, and I expect they will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200509/s1451906.htm|title=Troops told 'shoot to kill' in New Orleans. 02/09/2005. ABC News Online&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This followed President Bush's statement that looters in New Orleans and elsewhere in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina should be treated with "zero tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050901-2.html|title=Press Briefing by Scott McClellan|date=September 1, 2005|work=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush, during a visit to Louisiana on September 2, 2005, five days after the storm, offered to federalize the Louisiana National Guard to simplify the command structure. The Governor declined, because the Guard would then become part of the federal military forces and therefore lose much-needed policing powers. The President subsequently continued to press the offer, so Blanco rejected it in writing, citing the need for flexibility in [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] operations, particularly the need for the Guard in areas other than New Orleans where the military was not currently operating. Governor [[Haley Barbour]] of [[Mississippi]] reportedly declined a similar offer from the President. Had either state's National Guard been federalized, they would not have been able to directly enforce state law (i.e. control looting) under the provisions of the 1878 [[Posse Comitatus Act]]. It has not previously been a policy during natural disasters to combine the command of National Guard and military operations under the authority of the President. President Bush had the power to take command of a state's National Guard units under the [[Insurrection Act]] of 1807 without the agreement of a state Governor, but no President had done this since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the 1960s and President Bush had so far also declined to do so. However, Blanco and [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Bennett Landreneau]], Louisiana [[Adjutant general#United States|Adjutant General]] and senior Louisiana National Guard officer, co-operated closely{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} with [[U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Russel L. Honoré|Honoré]], who was then commanding Federal military operations under [[Joint Task Force Katrina]].

[[CNN]] and [[Fox News]] reported the Louisiana Homeland Security Department (which operated under Blanco's authority) refused to allow the [[American Red Cross]] to enter the city of New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/08/katrina.redcross/index.html|title=CNN.com - Red Cross: State rebuffed relief efforts - Sep 8, 2005|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,168799,00.html|title=Looking for Answers in the Hurricane's Aftermath|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/faq/0,1096,0_682_4524,00.html#4524|title=FAQ - American Red Cross - Find Help, Make a Donation, Volunteer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Red Cross confirms that the organization had not entered the city to provide aid, but also states that it is providing relief at the evacuation centers: "As the remaining people are evacuated from New Orleans, the most appropriate role for the Red Cross is to provide a safe place for people to stay and to see that their emergency needs are met. We are fully staffed and equipped to handle these individuals once they are evacuated." The deputy director of Louisiana's Homeland Security Department, Colonel Jay Mayeaux, has stated that he asked the Red Cross to delay relief operations for 24 hours for logistical reasons, and by the time that was up the evacuations had already begun.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

On September 14, after President Bush had accepted responsibility for all problems that occurred at the federal level, Blanco accepted responsibility for all problems that occurred at the state level. Blanco stated, "At the state level, we must take a careful look at what went wrong and make sure it never happens again. The buck stops here, and as your governor, I take full responsibility."  In 2006, a [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina#House of Representatives report|Congressional report]] stated that the "[[National Response Plan]] did not adequately provide a way for federal assets to quickly supplement or, if necessary, supplant first responders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-109hrpt377/pdf/CRPT-109hrpt377.pdf |title=A Failure of Initiative: Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina |author=Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina |authorlink=Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina#House of Representatives report |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 30, 2015 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath and recovery===
[[File:Kathleen Blanco.jpg|left|thumb|Blanco in [[Taipei]] on an official trade mission to [[Taiwan]] in 2006.]]
Blanco continued to press President Bush and Congress for additional recovery funds for Louisiana, pointing out the disparity in assistance received by Louisiana compared to neighboring Mississippi.

Early in 2006, Blanco was inducted into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |title=Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame |publisher=cityofwinnfield.com |accessdate=August 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703054258/http://cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |archivedate=July 3, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2006, Blanco announced that she would send the National Guard to patrol the streets of New Orleans after five teenagers were killed, in an effort to combat a greatly increased rate of violent crime.

On June 19, 2006, Blanco signed into law a ban on most forms of abortion (unless the life of the mother was in danger or her health would be permanently damaged) once it passed the state legislature. Although she felt exclusions for rape or incest would have "been reasonable," she felt she should not veto based on those reasons. The bill would only go into effect if the United States Supreme Court reversed ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.

In August 2006, Blanco filed a lawsuit and formally objected to the federal Gulf of Mexico lease sale "to force the federal government to spend part of its oil and gas income from the Outer Continental Shelf to help shore up Louisiana's coastline".

In December 2006, Blanco called a special session of the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] which she intended to use to dispense $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion worth of tax cuts, teacher raises, road projects and other spending programs. Legislators allied with Blanco attempted to lift a spending cap imposed by the state constitution, but Republican lawmakers rejected the governor's spending measure. The high-profile defeat further eroded Blanco's political reputation.

By late 2006 and early 2007, Blanco was facing increasingly heated accusations of delays in administering the Road Home Program, a state-run program which Blanco and the Louisiana Recovery Authority had set up following Katrina in order to distribute federal aid money to Katrina victims for damage to their homes. By January 2007, fewer than 250 of an estimated 100,000 applicants had received payments from the program, and many of the payments were apparently based on assessments which grossly undervalued the cost of damage to homes.

Facing an upcoming re-election campaign with greatly reduced popularity, Blanco made repeated public criticisms of the administration of President Bush in January 2007. Noting that Bush neglected to mention Gulf Coast reconstruction in his 2007 State of the Union Address, Blanco called for a bipartisan Congressional investigation into the conduct of the Bush administration following Katrina, to determine whether partisan politics played a role in the slow response to the storm. This call followed comments by former [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) director [[Michael D. Brown]], who claimed{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that the White House offer to federalize the National Guard in the days following the storm was part of a plan to upstage Blanco. Blanco has also publicly stated that Mississippi received preferential treatment because its governor, Haley Barbour, is Republican.

Blanco announced on March 20, 2007 that she would not seek re-election. On January 14, 2008, [[Bobby Jindal]] succeeded her as governor. He defeated several opponents, including [[Foster Campbell]] of [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]], a former state senator and a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

==Personal life==
In December 2017, Blanco was diagnosed with an incurable form of [[liver cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katc.com/story/37034325/kathleen-blanco-being-treated-for-liver-cancer-says-no-cure|title=Kathleen Blanco being treated for cancer, says no cure|publisher=KATC|accessdate=December 12, 2017|date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">'''Kimble F. Ainslie''' is a [[Canadian]] public policy analyst, pollster, market researcher, author and former political organizer based in [[Ontario]], Canada.

Ainslie has a [[PhD]] in [[Political Science]] from [[York University]], as well as degrees from the [[University of Western Ontario]] and [[Queen's University (Kingston)|Queen's University]].

He was a paid political consultant in Southwestern Ontario for the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, and in 1994 helped to form the Reform Association of Ontario (Reform Ontario). Ainslie has conducted polling for the federal and provincial Conservatives and municipal candidates &amp; incumbents since 1985. He polled the [[Reform Party of Canada]] in 1993.

He co-founded Reform Ontario with Reg Gosse of Kitchener in 1994. Reform Ontario attracted membership from most ridings across Ontario. The association was denied party status by the Ontario Election Commission in 1995.

In July 1995, Ainslie moved his residence to the state of Florida and continued his research and consulting practice in the U.S and Canada.

Five years later, he was appointed Senior Research Analyst at the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee FL, and a year later Entitlements Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C..

He has been president of Nordex Research since its founding in 1985. Its predecessor company was Nordex Group, a public management consulting firm founded in 1977.

Ainslie has also worked for the [[Fraser Institute]] in Vancouver, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Michigan, Energy Probe in Toronto and was an occasional editorial writer for the ''[[National Post]]'' in 2002. He has written extensively on small business and venture capital policy in Canada, and on Canadian urban transportation, medical transportation and privatization, [[corporate welfare]], social policy, charter schools and education.

As Entitlements Policy Analyst for the [[Cato Institute]] from 2001-2002, he wrote on U.S. welfare reform and workforce development policy. Ainslie criticized the [[George W. Bush]] Administration for insufficient attention to small business, for socializing workforce policy, for pressuring single mothers on social assistance to commit to marriage, and he encouraged the use of asset development for the working poor.[https://web.archive.org/web/20050304004739/http://www.cato.org/dailys/04-03-02.html]

His  commentary and interview remarks have appeared in the Washington Post, the National Post, the Globe and Mail, the Edmonton Journal, the Ottawa Citizen, the London Free Press, the K-W Record, and websites at [[Fox News]], CBS.com, and National Public Radio. He remains a frequent commentator on talk radio in [[London, Ontario]].

From 2003 to 2005 he was a consulting executive to a ground transportation company in London, Ontario.

Ainslie has been adjunct professor of political science and public administration at universities in United States and Canada since 1979. In August 2007, The Copenhagen Institute published his book Financing the Gap: Small Capital and State Economic Development in Canada, 1943–2005.

From 2007 to 2008 Ainslie served as full-time intervenor at the Ontario Energy Board where he presented arguments on 15 rate and policy cases.

In 2010, he developed a nationally innovative, online civic engagement model, a project that later attracted 770 registrants and more than 2600 submissions over a 7-month period in a major municipality in Southwestern Ontario on matters related to the environment, conservation and the economy.

In August 2012, Ainslie published "Canadian Energy Politics and Canada-U.S. Relations, 1970-2012," in the Canadian journal Geopolitics of Energy, later referenced by the Financial Post.

He continues his professional practice in market research, public opinion polling, and market development consulting.

'''Kwame Nkrumah''' [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (21 September 1909{{efn|Rooney (1988), ''Kwame Nkrumah'', p. 7. "He was born on 21 September 1909, and by local custom, because it was Saturday, he was called Kwame." But cf. [[Marika Sherwood]] (1996), ''Kwame Nkrumah: the years abroad'', p. 17: "Kwame Nkrumah was born on Nkroful in the Western Region of Ghana probably on 21 September 1909. The exact date is not known as birth certificates were not issued in those days." With the footnote: "In a biography drafted in the USA Nkrumah gave his birthdate as 21 September 1912, though in his autobiography he stated his birthday to be 21 September 1909 GNA:SC21/1/119. [[Basil Davidson]] in ''Black Star'' (Allen Lane, London, 1973, p. 19) states that Nkrumah's baptismal records give the date as 1909.}} – 27 April 1972) was a [[Ghana]]ian [[politician]] and [[revolutionary]]. He was the first [[Prime Minister of Ghana|prime minister]] and [[president of Ghana]], having led the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] to independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1957. An influential advocate of [[Pan-Africanism]], Nkrumah was a founding member of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] and winner of the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] in 1962.&lt;ref name = "Mazrui 1966 9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mazrui|1966|p=9}}: "There is little doubt that, quite consciously, Nkrumah saw himself as an African Lenin. He wanted to go down in history as a major political theorist—and he wanted a particular stream of thought to bear his own name. Hence the term 'Nkrumahism'—a name for an ideology that he hoped would assume the same historic and revolutionary status as 'Leninism'."&lt;/ref&gt;

After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, developing [[Nkrumaism|his political philosophy]], and organising with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. He formed the [[Convention People's Party]], which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common voter. He became prime minister in 1952 and retained this position when Ghana declared independence from Britain in 1957. In 1960, Ghanaians [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1960|approved a new constitution]] and [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1960|elected Nkrumah president]].

His administration was both [[African socialism|socialist]] and [[African nationalism|nationalist]]. Thus it funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system, and promoted a national (and pan-African) culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations during the [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] period.

He was deposed in 1966 by the [[National Liberation Council]] which, under the supervision of international financial institutions, privatised many of the country's state corporations. Nkrumah lived the rest of his life in [[Guinea]], of which he was named honorary co-president.

==Early life and education==

=== Gold Coast ===
Kwame Nkrumah was born in about 1909 in [[Nkroful]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (later known as Ghana &lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/03/archives/man-in-the-news-an-african-enigma-kwame-nkrumah.html|title=Man in the News; An African Enigma; Kwame Nkrumah|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to a poor and illiterate family.&lt;ref name="Kwame Nkrumah's Politico-cultural Thought and Policies: An African-centered Paradigm for the Second Phase of the African Revolution"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OcTC2eDx5ZsC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=kwame+nkrumah+born#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kwame Nkrumah's Politico-cultural Thought and Policies: An African-centered Paradigm for the Second Phase of the African Revolution|last=Botwe-Asamoah|first=Kwame|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-94833-3|location=|page=1|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nkroful was a small village in the [[Nzema people|Nzema]] area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=LaVerle Bennette|last2=Library of Congress|first2=Federal Research Division|title=Ghana: a country study|date=1995|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|location=Washington DC|isbn=0844408352|page=27|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/95018891/|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the far southwest of the Gold Coast, close to the frontier with the French colony of the [[Ivory Coast]]. His father did not live with the family, but worked in [[Half Assini]] where he pursued his goldsmith business until his death.  Kwame Nkrumah was raised by his mother and his extended family, who lived together in traditional fashion, with more distant relatives often visiting. He lived a carefree childhood, spent in the village, in the bush, and on the nearby sea.{{sfn|Rooney|p=7}} By [[Akan names|the naming customs]] of the [[Akan people]], he was given the name Kwame, the name given to males born on a Saturday(depending on the tribe i.e. Ashanti or Fante). During his years as a student in the United States, though, he was known as ''Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah'' – Kofi is the name given to males born on Friday. He later changed his name to Kwame Nkrumah in 1945 in the UK, preferring the name "Kwame".&lt;ref name="Graphic Online Article" /&gt; According to Ebenezer Obiri Addo in his study of the future president, the name "Nkrumah", a name traditionally given to a ninth child, indicates that Kwame likely held that place in the house of his father, who had several wives. The name of his father is not known exactly; with most accounts only indicating that he was a goldsmith. But according to a Times newspaper interview, his father was Opanyin Kofi Nwiana Ngolomah, who hailed from Nkroful and belongs to Akan tribe of the Asona clan but stayed at [[Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipal District|Tarkwa-Nsuaem]] where he practiced his goldsmith business.&lt;ref name="Peace FM Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/politics/politics/200909/27258.php|title=From Ngolomah To Nkrumah|date=21 September 2009|publisher=Peace FM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opanyin Ngolomah was respected for his wise counsel by those who sought his advice on traditional issues and domestic affairs; he died in 1927.&lt;ref name="Nkrumah's Family"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nkrumahinfobank.org/article.php?id=100&amp;c=11|title=Nkrumah's Family|publisher=Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah Infobank|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwame Nkrumah's Politico-cultural Thought and Policies: An African-centered Paradigm for the Second Phase of the African Revolution" /&gt;

Kwame was the only child of his mother.{{efn|Nyanibah survived her son, watching over him throughout his life. For a time after his death, she guarded his tomb. See {{harvnb|Birmingham|p=3}}.}}{{sfn|Addo|pp=50–51}}

Nkrumah's mother sent him to the elementary school run by a Catholic [[mission (Christianity)|mission]] at Half Assini, where he proved an adept student.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=7–8}} A German Roman Catholic priest by the name of George Fischer was said to have profoundly influenced his elementary school education. Although his mother, whose name was Elizabeth Nyanibah (1876/77–1979),&lt;ref name="Graphic Online Article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2000/499/profile.htm|title=Fathia Nkrumah: Farewell to all that|duplicate_date=|publisher=Al -Ahram Weekly|date=14–20 September 2009|quote=Grandmother Nyaneba, then well into her 90s, waited patiently for her son. Mother stood by her side. Grandmother was determined to remain alive to witness Nkrumah's triumphant return to Ghana. Only after her hand was placed on his coffin did the old woman at last accept that he was dead. Grandmother was to pass away seven years later in my mother's arms, aged 102.|issue=No. 499}}&lt;/ref&gt; later stated his year of birth was 1912, Nkrumah wrote that he was born on 18 September 1909, a Saturday. Nyanibah, who hailed from Nsuaem and belongs to the Agona family, was a fishmonger and petty trader when she married his father. After eight days of his birth, his father named him as Francis Nwia-Kofi after a relative&lt;ref name="Kwame Nkrumah's Politico-cultural Thought and Policies: An African-centered Paradigm for the Second Phase of the African Revolution" /&gt; but later his parents named him as Francis Kwame Ngolomah.&lt;ref name="Peace FM Article" /&gt; He progressed through the ten-year elementary programme in eight years. By about 1925 he was a student-teacher in the school, and had been baptised into the Catholic faith. While at the school, he was noticed by the Reverend [[Alec Garden Fraser]], principal of the Government Training College (soon to become [[Achimota School]]) in the Gold Coast's capital, [[Accra]]. Fraser arranged for Nkrumah to train as a teacher at his school.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=239}} Here, Columbia-educated deputy headmaster [[James Emman Kwegyir Aggrey|Kwegyir Aggrey]] exposed him to the ideas of [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. Aggrey, Fraser, and others at Achimota taught that there should be close co-operation between the races in governing the Gold Coast, but Nkrumah, echoing Garvey, soon came to believe that only when the black race governed itself could there be harmony between the races.{{sfn|Rooney|p=9}}{{sfn|Addo|pp=53–54}}

After obtaining his Teacher's Certificate from the Prince of Wales' College at Achimota in 1930,&lt;ref name="Graphic Online Article" /&gt; Nkrumah was given a teaching post at the Roman Catholic primary school in [[Elmina, Ghana|Elmina]] in 1931,&lt;ref name="Graphic Online Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/biography-of-ghana-s-first-president-dr-kwame-nkrumah.html|title=Biography of Ghana's first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah|date=8 March 2016|publisher=Graphic Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after a year there, was made headmaster of the school at [[Axim]]. In Axim, he started to get involved in politics and founded the Nzima Literary Society. In 1933, he was appointed a teacher at the Catholic seminary at [[Amissano]]. Although the life there was strict, he liked it, and considered becoming a [[Jesuit]]. Nkrumah had heard journalist and future Nigerian president [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] speak while a student at Achimota; the two men met and Azikiwe's influence increased Nkrumah's interest in black nationalism. The young teacher decided to further his education. Azikiwe had attended [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln College]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]] in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]], west of Philadelphia, and he advised Nkrumah to enroll there. Nkrumah, who had failed the entrance examination for [[London University]], gained funds for the trip and his education from relatives. He traveled by way of Britain, where he learned, to his outrage, of Italy's invasion of [[Ethiopia]], one of the few independent African nations. He arrived in the United States, in October 1935.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=9–12}}

According to historian [[John Henrik Clarke]] in his article on Nkrumah's American sojourn, "the influence of the ten years that he spent in the United States would have a lingering effect on the rest of his life."{{sfn|Clarke|pp=9–10}}  Nkrumah had sought entry to Lincoln College some time before he began his studies there. On 1 March 1935, he sent the school a letter noting that his application had been pending for more than a year. When he arrived in New York in October 1935, he traveled to Pennsylvania, where he enrolled despite lacking the funds for the full [[semester]].{{sfn|Clarke|p=10}} He soon won a scholarship that provided for his tuition at Lincoln. He remained short of funds through his time in the US.{{sfn|Rooney|p=12}} To make ends meet, he worked in menial jobs, including as a dishwasher. On Sundays, he visited black Presbyterian churches in Philadelphia and in New York.{{sfn|Birmingham|p=4}}

Nkrumah completed a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in economics and sociology in 1939. Lincoln then appointed him an assistant lecturer in philosophy, and he began to receive invitations to be a guest preacher in Presbyterian churches in Philadelphia and New York. In 1939, Nkrumah enrolled at Lincoln's seminary and at the [[Ivy League]] [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia. He gained a [[Bachelor of Theology]] degree from Lincoln in 1942, the top student in the course. He earned from Penn the following year a [[Master of Arts]] degree in philosophy and a [[Master of Science]] in education.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=13–14}} While at Penn, Nkrumah worked with the linguist William Everett Welmers, providing the spoken material that formed the basis of the first descriptive grammar of his native [[Fante dialect]] of the [[Akan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Descriptive Grammar of Fanti|last=Welmers|first=William Everett|publisher=Linguistic Society of America|year=1946|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkrumah spent his summers in [[Harlem]], a center of black life, thought and culture. He found housing and employment in [[New York City]] with difficulty and involved himself in the community. He spent many evenings listening to and arguing with street orators, and according to Clarke,

{{quote|These evenings were a vital part of Kwame Nkrumah's American education. He was going to a university – the university of the Harlem Streets. This was no ordinary time and these street speakers were no ordinary men&amp;nbsp; ...The streets of Harlem were open forums, presided over [by] master speakers like Arthur Reed and his protege Ira Kemp. The young Carlos Cook, founder of the Garvey oriented African Pioneer Movement was on the scene, also bringing a nightly message to his street followers. Occasionally Suji Abdul Hamid, a champion of Harlem labour, held a night rally and demanded more jobs for blacks in their own community&amp;nbsp; ...This is part of the drama on the Harlem streets as the student Kwame Nkrumah walked and watched.{{sfn|Clarke|p=11}}}}

Nkrumah was an activist student, organising a group of expatriate African students in Pennsylvania and building it into the African Students Association of America and Canada, becoming its president. Some members felt that the group should aspire for each colony to [[African independence movements|gain independence]] on its own; Nkrumah urged a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] strategy.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=14–15}} Nkrumah played a major role in the Pan-African conference held in New York in 1944, which urged the United States, at the end of the [[Second World War]], to help ensure Africa became developed and free.{{sfn|Rooney|p=16}}

His old teacher Aggrey had died in 1929 in the US, and in 1942 Nkrumah led traditional prayers for Aggrey at the gravesite. This led to a break between him and Lincoln, though after he rose to prominence in the Gold Coast, he returned in 1951 to accept an honorary degree.{{sfn|Addo|pp=62–65}}{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=32}} Nevertheless, Nkrumah's doctoral thesis remained uncompleted. He had adopted the forename Francis while at the [[Amissano]] seminary; in 1945 he took the name Kwame Nkrumah.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=14–15}}

Nkrumah read books about politics and divinity, and tutored students in philosophy. In 1943 Nkrumah met [[Trinidad]]ian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[C. L. R. James]], [[Russia]]n expatriate [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], and Chinese-American [[Grace Lee Boggs]], all of whom were members of an American-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] intellectual [[Johnson-Forest Tendency|cohort]]. Nkrumah later credited James with teaching him "how an underground movement worked".{{sfn|Sherwood|p=114}} [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] files on Nkrumah, kept from January to May 1945, identify him as a possible communist.{{sfn|Sherwood|pp=106–107}} Nkrumah was determined to go to London, wanting to continue his education there now that the [[Second World War]] had ended.{{sfn|Addo|p=70}} James, in a 1945 letter introducing Nkrumah to Trinidad-born [[George Padmore]] in London, wrote: "This young man is coming to you. He is not very bright, but nevertheless do what you can for him because he's determined to throw Europeans out of Africa."{{sfn|Sherwood|p=114}}

=== London ===

[[File:KWAME NKRUMAH - 60 Burghley Road Kentish Town London NW5 1UN.jpg|thumb|60 Burghley Road, Kentish Town, London, where Nkrumah lived when in London between 1945–1947]]
Nkrumah returned to London in May 1945 and enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]] as a PhD candidate in anthropology. He withdrew after one term and the next year enrolled at [[University College London|University College]], with the intent to write a philosophy dissertation on "Knowledge and Logical Positivism". His supervisor, [[A. J. Ayer]], declined to rate Nkrumah as a "first-class philosopher", saying, "I liked him and enjoyed talking to him but he did not seem to me to have an analytical mind. He wanted answers too quickly. I think part of the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis. It was a way of marking time until the opportunity came for him to return to Ghana."{{sfn|Sherwood|p=115}} Finally, Nkrumah enrolled in, but did not complete, a study in law at [[City Law School|Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Sherwood|p=115}}

Nkrumah spent his time on political organising. He and Padmore were among the principal organisers, and co-treasurers, of the Fifth [[Pan-African Congress]] in Manchester (15–19 October 1945).&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=G. |year=2012 |title=African Political Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqYEhtONIBgC |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US |isbn=978-1-137-06205-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress elaborated a strategy for supplanting colonialism with [[African socialism]]. They agreed to pursue a federal United States of Africa, with interlocking regional organisations, governing through separate states of limited sovereignty. They planned to pursue a new African culture without [[tribalism]], democratic within a socialist or communist system, synthesising traditional aspects with modern thinking, and for this to be achieved by nonviolent means if possible.&lt;ref name=Gebe&gt;{{cite journal|first=Boni Yao |last=Gebe |url=http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no3/GhanasForeignPolicyAtIndependenceAnd.pdf |title=Ghana's Foreign Policy at Independence and Implications for the 1966 Coup D’état |journal=Journal of Pan African Studies |volume=2 |issue=3 |date=March 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611023640/http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no3/GhanasForeignPolicyAtIndependenceAnd.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who attended the congress was the venerable [[W. E. B. Dubois]] along with some who later took leading roles in leading their nations to independence, including [[Hastings Banda]] of [[Nyasaland]] (which became [[Malawi]]), [[Jomo Kenyatta]] of [[Kenya]], [[Obafemi Awolowo]] of Nigeria, and C. L. R. James.{{sfn|Rooney|p=23}}

The congress sought to establish ongoing African activism in Britain in conjunction with the [[West African National Secretariat]] (WANS) to work towards the [[decolonisation of Africa]]. Nkrumah became the secretary of WANS. In addition to seeking to organise Africans to gain their nations' freedom, Nkrumah sought to succour the many West African seamen who had been stranded, destitute, in London at the end of the war, and established a Coloured Workers Association to empower and succour them.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=24–25}} The [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and [[MI5]] watched Nkrumah and the WANS, focusing on their links with Communism.{{sfn|Sherwood|pp=173–178}} Nkrumah and Padmore established a group called The Circle to lead the way to West African independence and unity; the group aimed to create a Union of African Socialist Republics. A document from The Circle, setting forth that goal, was found on Nkrumah upon his arrest in Accra in 1948, and was used against him by the British authorities.{{sfn|Rooney|p=25}}{{sfn|Sherwood|pp=125–126}}{{efn|Members swore an oath of secrecy, pledging to "irrevocably obey" orders from the group, to "help a member brother of THE CIRCLE in all things and in all difficulties", to avoid the use of violence, to fast on the twenty-first day of the month, and finally, to "accept the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah".

==Return to the Gold Coast==

=== United Gold Coast Convention ===
The 1946 Gold Coast constitution gave Africans a majority on the Legislative Council for the first time. Seen as a major step towards self-government,{{sfn|Rooney|pp=26–27}} the new arrangement prompted the colony's first true political party, founded in August 1947, the [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC). The UGCC sought self-government as quickly as possible. Since the leading members were all successful professionals, they needed to pay someone to run the party, and their choice fell on Nkrumah at the suggestion of Ako Adjei. Nkrumah hesitated, realising the UGCC was controlled by conservative interests, but decided that the new post gave him huge political opportunities, and accepted. After being questioned by British officials about his communist affiliations, Nkrumah boarded the MV ''Accra'' at Liverpool in November 1947 for the voyage home.{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=316}}{{sfn|Rooney|pp=27–28}}

After brief stops in [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Ivory Coast]], he arrived in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and after a brief stay and reunion with his mother in [[Tarkwa, Ghana|Tarkwa]], began work at the party's headquarters in [[Saltpond, Ghana|Saltpond]] on 29 December 1947 where he worked as a general secretary.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;{{sfn|Rooney|pp=30–31}} Nkrumah quickly submitted plans for branches of the UGCC to be established colony-wide, and for strikes if necessary to gain political ends. This activist stance divided the party's governing committee, which was led by [[J. B. Danquah]]. Nkrumah embarked on a tour to gain donations for the UGCC and establish new branches.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=36–37}}

Although the Gold Coast was politically more advanced than Britain's other West Africa colonies, there was considerable discontent. Postwar inflation had caused public anger at high prices, leading to a boycott of the small stores run by Arabs which began in January 1948. The [[cocoa bean]] farmers were upset because trees exhibiting [[cacao swollen-shoot virus|swollen-shoot disease]], but still capable of yielding a crop, were being destroyed by the colonial authorities. There were about 63,000 ex-servicemen in the Gold Coast, many of whom had trouble obtaining employment and felt the colonial government was doing nothing to address their grievances. Nkrumah and Danquah addressed a meeting of the Ex-Servicemen's Union in Accra on 20 February 1948, which was in preparation for a march to present a petition to the governor. When that demonstration took place on 28 February, there was gunfire from the British, prompting the [[1948 Accra Riots]], which spread throughout the country.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=38–39}} According to Nkrumah's biographer, David Birmingham, "West Africa's erstwhile "model colony" witnessed a riot and business premises were looted. The African Revolution had begun."{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=18–19}}

The government assumed that the UGCC was responsible for the unrest, and arrested six leaders, including Nkrumah and Danquah. [[The Big Six (Ghana)|The Big Six]] were incarcerated together in [[Kumasi]],{{sfn|Addo|p=85}} increasing the rift between Nkrumah and the others, who blamed him for the riots and their detention. After the British learned that there were plots to storm the prison, the six were separated, with Nkrumah sent to [[Lawra]]. They were freed in April 1948. Many students and teachers had demonstrated for their release, and been suspended; Nkrumah, using his own funds, began the [[Ghana National College]]. This, among other activities, led UGCC committee members to accuse him of acting in the party's name without authority. Fearing he would harm them more outside the party than within, they agreed to make him honorary treasurer. Nkrumah's popularity, already large, was increased with his founding of the ''[[Accra Evening News]]'', which was not a party organ but was owned by Nkrumah and others. He also founded the Committee on Youth Organisation (CYO) as a youth wing for the UGCC. It soon broke away and adopted the motto "Self-Government Now". The CYO united students, ex-servicemen, and market women. Nkrumah recounted in his autobiography that he knew that a break with the UGCC was inevitable, and wanted the masses behind him when the conflict occurred.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=40–43}}{{sfn|Addo|pp=86–87}} Nkrumah's appeals for "Free-Dom" appealed to the great numbers of underemployed youths who had come from the farms and villages to the towns. "Old hymn tunes were adapted to new songs of liberations which welcomed traveling orators, and especially Nkrumah himself, to mass rallies across the Gold Coast."{{sfn|Birmingham|p=24}}

=== Convention People's Party ===
[[File:CPP ‒ Convention People's Party logo.jpg|thumb|249px|Red cockerel, "Forward Ever, Backward Never": Convention People's Party logo and slogan]]

Beginning in April 1949, there was considerable pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party. On 12 June 1949, he announced the formation of the [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP), with the word "convention" chosen, according to Nkrumah, "to carry the masses with us".{{sfn|Addo|p=88}} There were attempts to heal the breach with the UGCC; at one July meeting, it was agreed to reinstate Nkrumah as secretary and disband the CPP. But Nkrumah's supporters would not have it, and persuaded him to refuse the offer and remain at their head.{{sfn|Addo|pp=88–89}}

The CPP adopted the red [[cockerel]] as its symbol – a familiar icon for local ethnic groups, and a symbol of leadership, alertness, and masculinity.&lt;ref name=Hagan2 /&gt;{{sfn|Fuller|pp=24–26}} Party symbols and colours (red, white, and green) appeared on clothing, flags, vehicles, and houses.&lt;ref name=Hagan2 /&gt; CPP operatives drove red-white-and-green vans across the country, playing music and rallying public support for the party and especially for Nkrumah. These efforts were wildly successful, especially because previous political efforts in the Gold Coast had focused exclusively on the urban intelligentsia.&lt;ref name=Hagan2 /&gt;

The British convened a selected commission of middle-class Africans, including all of the Big Six except Nkrumah, to draft a new constitution that would give Ghana more self-government. Nkrumah saw, even before the commission reported, that its recommendations would fall short of full [[dominion]] status, and began to organise a [[Positive Action]] campaign. Nkrumah demanded a [[constituent assembly]] to write a constitution. When the governor, [[Charles Arden-Clarke]], would not commit to this, Nkrumah called for Positive Action, with the unions beginning a [[general strike]] to begin on 8 January 1950. The strike quickly led to violence, and Nkrumah and other CPP leaders were arrested on 22 January, and the ''Evening News'' was banned.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=169–174}}{{Citation not found}} Nkrumah was sentenced to a total of three years in prison, and he was incarcerated with common criminals in Accra's [[Fort James (Ghana)|Fort James]].{{sfn|Rooney|pp=55–56}}

Nkrumah's assistant, [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah]], ran the CPP in his absence; the imprisoned leader was able to influence events through smuggled notes written on toilet paper. The British prepared for an election for the Gold Coast under their new constitution, and Nkrumah insisted that the CPP contest all seats. The situation had become calmer once Nkrumah was arrested, and the CPP and the British worked together to prepare electoral rolls. Nkrumah stood, from prison, for a directly-elected Accra seat. Gbedemah worked to set up a nationwide campaign organisation, using vans with loudspeakers to blare the party's message. The UGCC failed to set up a nationwide structure, and proved unable to take advantage of the fact that many of its opponents were in prison.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=56–57}}

In the [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1951|February 1951 legislative election]], the first general election to be held under universal franchise in colonial Africa, the CPP was elected in a landslide.{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=34–35}} The CPP secured 34 of the 38 seats contested on a party basis, with Nkrumah elected for his Accra constituency. The UGCC won three seats, and one was taken by an independent. Arden-Clarke saw that the only alternative to Nkrumah's freedom was the end of the constitutional experiment. Nkrumah was released from prison on 12 February, receiving a rapturous reception from his followers.{{sfn|Bourret|pp=175–177}} The following day, Arden-Clarke sent for him and asked him to form a government.{{sfn|Rooney|p=61}}

=== Leader of Government Business and Prime Minister ===
Nkrumah faced several challenges as he assumed office. He had never served in government, and needed to learn that art.  The Gold Coast was composed of four regions, several former colonies amalgamated into one. Nkrumah sought to unite them under one nationality, and bring the country to independence. Key to meeting the challenges was convincing the British that the CPP's programmes were not only practical, but inevitable, and Nkrumah and Arden-Clarke worked closely together. The governor instructed the civil service to give the fledgling government full support, and the three British members of the cabinet took care not to vote against the elected majority.{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=37–38}}

Prior to the CPP taking office, British officials had prepared a ten-year plan for development. With demands for infrastructure improvements coming in from all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years. The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely. Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior. The rail system was modernised and expanded. Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun. Construction began on a new harbour at [[Tema]], near Accra, and the existing port, at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]], was expanded. An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun. From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=82–83}} Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, the country would be relying on expatriate European civil servants for several years.{{sfn|Bourret|p=178}}

Nkrumah's title was Leader of Government Business in a cabinet chaired by Arden-Clarke. Quick progress was made, and in 1952, the governor withdrew from the cabinet, leaving Nkrumah as his prime minister, with the portfolios that had been reserved for expatriates going to Africans. There were accusations of corruption, and of nepotism, as officials, following African custom, attempted to benefit their extended families and their tribes.{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=40–43}} The recommendations following the 1948 riots had included elected local government rather than the existing system dominated by the chiefs. This was uncontroversial until it became clear that it would be implemented by the CPP. That party's majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Gold Coast|Legislative Assembly]] passed legislation in late 1951 that shifted power from the chiefs to the chairs of the councils, though there was some local rioting as [[rates (tax)|rates]] were imposed.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=181–182}}

Nkrumah's retitling as prime minister had not given him additional power, and he sought constitutional reform that would lead to independence. In 1952, he consulted with the visiting [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Oliver Lyttelton]], who indicated that Britain would look favourably on further advancement, so long as the chiefs and other stakeholders had the opportunity to express their views. Initially skeptical of Nkrumah's socialist policies, Britain's [[MI5]] had compiled large amounts of intelligence on Nkrumah through several sources, including tapping phones and mail interception under the codename of SWIFT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton |first1=Calder |title=British Intelligence, the Cold War, and the Twilight of Empire |publisher=[[The Overlook Press]] |isbn=978-1468307153 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=f2cjCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=mi5%20swift%20gold%20coast&amp;pg=PT156#v=onepage&amp;q=swift&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127091745/https://books.google.com/books?id=f2cjCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;ots=rBl1byBn3w&amp;dq=mi5%20swift%20gold%20coast&amp;pg=PT156 |archivedate=27 January 2017 |df= |date=2014-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in October 1952, Nkrumah sought opinions from councils and from political parties on reform, and consulted widely across the country, including with opposition groups. The result the following year was a [[White Paper]] on a new constitution, seen as a final step before independence. Published in June 1953, the constitutional proposals were accepted both by the assembly and by the British, and came into force in April of the following year. The new document provided for an assembly of 104 members, all directly elected, with an all-African cabinet responsible for the internal governing of the colony. In [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1954|the election]] on 15 June 1954, the CPP won 71, with the regional [[Northern People's Party]] forming the official opposition.{{sfn|Bourret|pp=183–186}}

A number of opposition groups formed the [[National Liberation Movement (Ghana)|National Liberation Movement]]. Their demands were for a federal, rather than a unitary government for an independent Gold Coast, and for an upper house of parliament where chiefs and other traditional leaders could act as a counter to the CPP majority in the assembly. They drew considerable support in the Northern Territory and among the chiefs in Ashanti, who petitioned the British queen, [[Elizabeth II]], asking for a [[Royal Commission]] into what form of government the Gold Coast should have. This was refused by her government, who in 1955 stated that such a commission should only be used if the people of the Gold Coast proved incapable of deciding their own affairs. Amid political violence, the two sides attempted to reconcile their differences, but the NLM refused to participate in any committee with a CPP majority. The traditional leaders were also incensed by a new bill that had just been enacted, which allowed minor chiefs to appeal to the government in Accra, bypassing traditional chiefly authority. The British were unwilling to leave unresolved the fundamental question as to how an independent Gold Coast should be governed, and in June 1956, the Colonial Secretary, [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]] announced that there would be another general election in the Gold Coast, and if a "reasonable majority" took the CPP's position, Britain would set a date for independence.{{sfn|Bourret|pp=187–191}} The results of the [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1956|July 1956 election]] were almost identical to those from four years before, and on 3 August the assembly voted for independence under the name Nkrumah had proposed in April, [[Ghana]]. In September, the Colonial Office announced independence day would be 6 March 1957.{{sfn|Birmingham|p=58}}{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=lii}}

The opposition was not satisfied with the plan for independence, and demanded that power be devolved to the regions. Discussions took place through late 1956 and into 1957. Although Nkrumah did not compromise on his insistence on a unitary state, the nation was divided into five regions, with power devolved from Accra, and the chiefs having a role in their governments. On 21 February 1957, the [[British prime minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]], announced that Ghana would be a full member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] with effect from 6 March.{{sfn|Bourret|pp=200–201}}

Ghana became independent on 6 March 1957. As the first of Britain's African colonies to gain majority-rule independence, the celebrations in Accra were the focus of world attention; over 100 reporters and photographers covered the events. United States President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent congratulations and his vice president, [[Richard Nixon]], to represent the U.S. at the events. The Soviet delegation urged Nkrumah to visit Moscow as soon as possible. [[Ralph Bunche]], an African American, was there for the United Nations, while the [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark|Duchess of Kent]] represented Queen Elizabeth. Offers of assistance poured in from across the world. Even without them, the country seemed prosperous, with cocoa prices high and the potential of new resource development.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=4–6}}

As the fifth of March turned to the sixth, Nkrumah stood before tens of thousands of supporters and proclaimed, "Ghana will be free forever."{{sfn|Rooney|p=5}} He spoke at the first session of the [[Ghana Parliament]] that [[Independence Day (Ghana)|Independence Day]], telling his new country's citizens that "we have a duty to prove to the world that Africans can conduct their own affairs with efficiency and tolerance and through the exercise of democracy.

Under Nkrumah's leadership, Ghana adopted some socialist policies and practices. Nkrumah created a welfare system, started various community programs, and established schools.

Nkrumah had only a short honeymoon before there was unrest among his people. The government deployed troops to [[Volta Region|Togoland]] to quell unrest following a disputed plebiscite on membership in the new country.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Amenyo, "[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/Trans-Volta-Togoland-and-the-refuseniks-of-the-union-with-Ghana-143373 Trans Volta Togoland and the refuseniks of the union with Ghana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103131317/http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/Trans-Volta-Togoland-and-the-refuseniks-of-the-union-with-Ghana-143373 |date=3 November 2016 }}", ''GhanaWeb'', 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A serious bus [[Strike action|strike]] in Accra stemmed from resentments among the [[Ga people]], who believed members of other tribes were getting preferential treatment in government promotion, and this led to riots there in August. Nkrumah's response was to repress local movements by the Avoidance of Discrimination Act (6 December 1957), which banned regional or tribally-based political parties. Another strike at tribalism fell in Ashanti, where Nkrumah and the CPP got most local chiefs who were not party supporters [[Golden Stool|destooled]]. These repressive actions concerned the opposition parties, who came together to form the [[United Party (Ghana)|United Party]] under [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]].{{sfn|Rooney|pp=138–139}}

In 1958, an opposition MP was arrested on charges of trying to obtain arms abroad for a planned infiltration of the [[Ghana Army]] (GA). Nkrumah was convinced there had been an assassination plot against him, and his response was to have the parliament pass the [[Preventive Detention]] Act, allowing for incarceration for up to five years without charge or trial, with only Nkrumah empowered to release prisoners early. According to Nkrumah's biographer, David Birmingham, "no single measure did more to bring down Nkrumah's reputation than his adoption of internment without trial for the preservation of security."{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=84–87}} Nkrumah intended to bypass the British-trained judiciary, which he saw as opposing his plans when they subjected them to constitutional scrutiny.{{sfn|Birmingham|pp=85–86}}

Another source of irritation was the regional assemblies, which had been organised on an interim basis pending further constitutional discussions. The opposition, which was strong in Ashanti and the north, proposed significant powers for the assemblies; the CPP wanted them to be more or less advisory. In 1959, Nkrumah used his majority in the parliament to push through the Constitutional Amendment Act, which abolished the assemblies and allowed the parliament to amend the constitution with a simple majority.{{sfn|Rooney|pp=143–144}}

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] remained [[Queen of Ghana|sovereign over Ghana]] from 1957 to 1960. [[William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel]] was the Governor-General, and Nkrumah remained Prime Minister. On 6 March 1960, Nkrumah announced plans for a new constitution which would make Ghana a [[republic]], headed by a president with broad executive and legislative powers. The draft included a provision to surrender Ghanaian sovereignty to a [[Union of African States]]. On 19, 23, and 27 April 1960 a [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1960|presidential election]] and [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1960|plebiscite on the constitution]] were held. The constitution was ratified and Nkrumah was elected president over [[J. B. Danquah]], the UP candidate, 1,016,076 to 124,623. Ghana remained a part of the British-led [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref name=Hagan2 /&gt;

==== Opposition to tribalism ====
[[File:Flag of Ashanti.svg|thumb|Illegal Asante flag, with colours symbolising gold, ancestral power, and the forest, and [[Golden Stool]] symbolising Asante political authority&lt;ref name=Fuller29 /&gt;]]
[[File:Ashanti Empire Flag.svg|thumb|Porcupine flag, symbolising Asante motto, "If you greet us with peace, we will greet you with peace. But if you greet us with war, then we will greet you with war."&lt;ref name=Fuller29 /&gt;]]

Nkrumah also sought to eliminate "[[tribalism]]", a source of loyalties held more deeply than those to the nation-state. Thus, as he wrote in ''Africa Must Unite'': "We were engaged in a kind of war, a war against poverty and disease, against ignorance, against tribalism and disunity. We needed to secure the conditions which could allow us to pursue our policy of reconstruction and development." To this end, in 1958, his government passed "An Act to prohibit organisations using or engaging in racial or religious propaganda to the detriment of any other racial or religious community, or securing the election of persons on account of their racial or religious affiliations, or for other purposes in connection therewith."&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Nkrumah, ''Africa Must Unite'' (1983), p. 74; quoted by George P. Hagan, "Nkrumah's Cultural Policy", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nkrumah attempted to saturate the country in national flags, and declared a widely disobeyed ban on tribal flags.&lt;ref name=Fuller29 /&gt;

[[Kofi Abrefa Busia]] of the [[United Party (Ghana)]] gained prominence as an opposition leader in the debate over this Act, taking a more classically liberal position and criticising the ban on tribal politics as repressive. Soon after, he left the country.&lt;ref name=Hagan /&gt; Nkrumah was also a very flamboyant leader. ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1972 wrote: "During his high‐flying days as the leader of Ghana in the 1950s and early 1960s, Kwame Nkrumah was a flamboyant spellbinder. At home, he created a [[cult of personality]] and gloried in the title of 'Osagyefo' (Redeemer). Abroad, he rubbed elbows with the world's leaders as the first man to lead an African colony to independence after World War II."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/30/archives/death-of-the-osagyefo-kwame-nkrumah.html "The World"], ''The New York Times'' Archive, 30 April 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as Prime Minister and then President, Nkrumah succeeded in reducing the political importance of the local chieftaincy (e.g., the [[Akan Chieftaincy|Akan chiefs]] and the [[Asantehene]]). These chiefs had maintained authority during colonial rule through collaboration with the British authorities; in fact, they were sometimes favoured over the local intelligentsia, who made trouble for the British with organisations like the [[Aborigines' Rights Protection Society]]. The Convention People's Party had a strained relationship with the chiefs when it came to power, and this relationship became more hostile as the CPP incited political opposition chiefs and criticised the institution as undemocratic. Acts passed in 1958 and 1959 gave the government more power to destool chiefs directly, and proclaimed government of stool land – and revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Arhin, "The Search For 'Constitutional Chieftancy'", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt; These policies alienated the chiefs and led them to looking favorably on the overthrow of Nkrumah and his Party.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkney (1972), ''Ghana Under Military Rule'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Increased power of the Convention People's Party ====

In 1962, three younger members of the CPP were brought up on charges of taking part in a plot to blow up Nkrumah's car in a motorcade. The sole evidence against the alleged plotters was that they rode in cars well behind Nkrumah's car. When the defendants were acquitted, Nkrumah sacked the chief judge of the state security court, then got the CPP-dominated parliament to pass a law allowing a [[Double jeopardy|new trial]]. At this second trial, all three men were convicted and sentenced to death, though these sentences were subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Shortly afterward, the constitution was amended to give the president the power to summarily remove judges at all levels.

In 1964, Nkrumah proposed a [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1964|constitutional amendment]] which would make the CPP [[One-party state|the only legal party]] . The amendment passed with 99.91 percent of the vote, an implausibly high total that led observers to condemn the vote as "obviously rigged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anthony |first=S. |year=1969 |title=The State of Ghana |journal=African Affairs |volume=68 |issue=273 |pages=337–39 |jstor=720657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana had effectively been a one-party state since independence. The amendment transformed Nkrumah's presidency into a ''[[de facto]]'' legal [[dictatorship]].

=== Civil service ===
[[File:Dolazak predsednika Gane Kvame Nkrumaha na konferenciju nesvrstanih, 1961. god.jpg|thumbnail|left|Arrival of the president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, and president of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], to the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-aligned movement]] conference, [[Belgrade]], 1961.]]
After substantial Africanisation of the [[Ghana Civil Service|civil service]] in 1952–60, the number of expatriates rose again from 1960 to 1965. Many of the new outside workers came not from the United Kingdom but from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Italy, and the United Nations.&lt;ref name=Ayee&gt;Joseph R. A. Ayee, "Public Sector Manpower Development During the Nkrumah Period 1951–1966", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

In 1951, the CPP created the Accelerated Development Plan for Education. This plan set up a six-year primary course, to be attended as close to universally as possible, with a range of possibilities to follow. All children were to learn arithmetic, as well as gain "a sound foundation for citizenship with permanent literacy in both English and the vernacular." Primary education became [[compulsory education|compulsory]] in 1962. The plan also stated that religious schools would no longer receive funding, and that some existing missionary schools would be taken over by government.&lt;ref name=Haizel /&gt;

In 1961, Nkrumah laid the first stones in the foundation of the [[Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute]] created to train Ghanaian civil servants as well as promote Pan-Africanism. In 1964, all students entering college in Ghana were required to attend a two-week "[[Indoctrination|ideological orientation]]" at the Institute.&lt;ref name="NRCReport"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=National Reconciliation Commission Report |year=2004 |page=251}}{{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nkrumah remarked that "trainees should be made to realize the party's ideology is religion, and should be practiced faithfully and fervently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nkrumah's Deception of Africa |publisher=Ghana Ministry of Information |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Nkrumah brought forth the Seven Year Development Plan for National Reconstruction and Development, which identified education as a key source of development and called for the expansion of secondary technical schools. Secondary education would also include "in-service training programmes". As Nkrumah told Parliament: "Employers, both public and private, will be expected to make a far greater contribution to labour training through individual factory and farm schools, industry-wide training schemes, day release, payment for attendance at short courses and evening classes." This training would be indirectly subsidised with tax credits and import allocations.&lt;ref name=Haizel /&gt;

In 1952, the Artisan Trading Scheme, arranged with the Colonial Office and UK Ministry of Labour, provided for a few experts in every field to travel to Britain for technical education. Kumasi Technical Institute was founded in 1956. In September 1960, it added the Technical Teacher Training Centre. In 1961, the CPP passed the Apprentice Act, which created a general Apprenticeship Board along with committees for each industry.&lt;ref name=Haizel /&gt;

==== Culture ====
[[File:Pahor Labib Watani 0.10 LRcrop1 (2).jpg|thumb|359px|Nkrumah with Egyptian [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Pahor Labib]] at the [[Coptic Museum]], 1956]]

Nkrumah promoted pan-African culture, calling for international libraries and cooperative efforts to study history and culture. He decried the norms of [[white supremacy]] and [[Eurocentrism]] imposed by British textbooks and cultural institutions. He wore a traditional northern robe, [[Ghanaian smock|fugu]], but donned [[Kente cloth]], from the south, for ceremonies, in order to symbolise his identity as a representative of the whole country. He oversaw the opening of the [[National Museum of Ghana|Ghana Museum]] on 5 March 1957; the Arts Council of Ghana, a wing of the Ministry of Education and Culture, in 1958; the Research Library on African Affairs in June, 1961; and the Ghana Film Corporation in 1964.&lt;ref name=Hagan&gt;George P. Hagan, "Nkrumah's Cultural Policy", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Nkrumah opened the [[Institute of African Studies]].&lt;ref name=Haizel /&gt;

A campaign against nudity in the northern part of the country received special attention from Nkrumah, who reportedly deployed Propaganda Secretary [[Hannah Kudjoe|Hannah Cudjoe]] to respond. Cudjoe also formed the Ghana Women's League, which advanced the Party's agenda on nutrition, raising children, and wearing clothing. The League also led a demonstration against the [[France and weapons of mass destruction#Saharan experiments centers (1960–66)|detonation of French nuclear weapons in the Sahara]].&lt;ref name=Manuh&gt;Takiwah Manuh, "Women and their Organisations during the Convention Peoples' Party Period", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allman&gt;Jean Allman, [https://history.artsci.wustl.edu/files/history/imce/allman_hannah_kudjoe.pdf "The Disappearing of Hannah Kudjoe: Nationalism, Feminism, and the Tyrannies of History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120005/https://history.artsci.wustl.edu/files/history/imce/allman_hannah_kudjoe.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}", ''Journal of Women's History'' 21.3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Cudjoe was eventually demoted with the consolidation of national women's groups, and marginalised within the Party structure.&lt;ref name=Allman /&gt;

Laws passed in 1959 and 1960 designated special positions in parliament to be held by [[Women in Ghana|women]]. Some women were promoted to the CPP Central Committee. Women attended more universities, took up more professions including medicine and law, and went on professional trips to Israel, the Soviet Union, and the Eastern Bloc. Women also entered the army and air force. Most women remained in agriculture and trade; some received assistance from the [[Co-operative Movement]].&lt;ref name=Hagan2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Manuh /&gt;

Nkrumah's image was widely disseminated, for example, on postage stamps and on money, in the style of monarchs – providing fodder for accusations of a Nkrumahist personality cult.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''Building the Ghanaian Nation-State'', pp. 39–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media ====
In 1957, Nkrumah created a well-funded [[Ghana News Agency]] to generate domestic news and disseminate it abroad. In ten years time the GNA had 8045&amp;nbsp;km of domestic telegraph line, and maintained stations in Lagos, Nairobi, London, and New York City.&lt;ref name=Ansah&gt;P. A. V.

Nkrumah consolidated state control over newspapers, establishing the ''[[Ghanaian Times]]'' in 1958 and then in 1962 obtaining its competitor, the ''[[Daily Graphic]]'', from the [[Mirror Group]] of London. As he wrote in ''Africa Must Unite'': "It is part of our revolutionary credo that within the competitive system of capitalism, the press cannot function in accordance with a strict regard for the sacredness of facts, and that the press, therefore, should not remain in private hands." Starting in 1960, he invoked the right of [[pre-publication censorship]] of all news.&lt;ref name=Ansah /&gt;

The Gold Coast Broadcasting Service was established in 1954 and revamped as the [[Ghana Broadcasting Corporation]] (GBC). Many television broadcasts featured Nkrumah, commenting for example on the problematic "insolence and laziness of boys and girls". Before celebrations of [[May Day]], 1963, Nkrumah went on television to announce the expansion of Ghana's [[Young Pioneer]]s, the introduction of a National Pledge, the beginning of a National Flag salute in schools, and the creation of a National Training program to inculcate virtue and the spirit of service among Ghanaian youth. Quoth Nkrumah (to Parliament, on 15 October 1963), "Ghana's television will not cater for cheap entertainment or commercialism; its paramount objective will be education in its broadest and purest sense."&lt;ref name=Haizel /&gt;

As per the 1965 Instrument of Incorporation of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting had "powers of direction" over the media, and the President had the power "at any time, if he is satisfied that it is in the national interest to do so, take over the control and management of the affairs or any part of the functions of the Corporation," hiring, firing, reorganising, and making other commands at will.&lt;ref name=Ansah /&gt;

Radio programs, designed in part to reach non-reading members of the public, were a major focus of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation. In 1961, the GBC formed an [[international broadcasting|external service]] broadcasting in English, French, Arabic, Swahili, Portuguese, and Hausa. Using four 100-kilowatt transmitters and two 250-kilowatt transmitters, the GBC External Service broadcast 110 hours of Pan-Africanist programming to Africa and Europe each week.&lt;ref name=Ansah /&gt;

He refused advertising in all media, beginning with the ''Evening News'' of 1948.&lt;ref name=Ansah /&gt;

====Economic policy====
{{see also|Economy of Ghana}}

The Gold Coast had been among the wealthiest and most socially advanced areas in Africa, with schools, railways, hospitals, social security, and an advanced economy.

Nkrumah attempted to rapidly [[industrialization|industrialise]] Ghana's economy. He reasoned that if Ghana escaped the [[Colonialism|colonial]] trade system by reducing dependence on foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]], technology, and material goods, it could become truly independent.

After the Ten Year Development Plan, Nkrumah brought forth the Second Development Plan in 1959. This plan called for the development of manufacturing: 600 factories producing 100 varieties of product.&lt;ref name=Darko&gt;S. Asamoah Darko, "The Development and Patterns of Manufacturing Industries in Ghana, 1951–1965", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Statutory Corporations Act, passed in November 1959 and revised in 1961 and 1964, created the legal framework for public corporations, which included state enterprises. This law placed the country's major corporations under the direction of government ministers. The State Enterprises Secretariat office was located in [[Flagstaff House]] and under the direct control of the president.&lt;ref name=Asante&gt;K. B. Asante, "Nkrumah and State Enterprises", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After visiting the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China in 1961, Nkrumah apparently became still more convinced of the need for state control of the economy.&lt;ref name=Asante /&gt;

[[File:Akosombo Dam hydroelectric plant.jpg|thumb|372px|left|[[Akosombo Dam|Akosombo]] [[hydroelectric dam]]]]

Nkrumah's time in office began successfully: forestry, fishing, and cattle-breeding expanded, production of cocoa (Ghana's main export) doubled, and modest deposits of bauxite and gold were exploited more effectively. The construction of a dam on the Volta River (launched in 1961) provided water for irrigation and hydro-electric power, which produced enough electricity for the towns and for a new aluminum plant. Government funds were also provided for village projects in which local people built schools and roads,&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lowe, ''Mastering Modern World History''.&lt;/ref&gt; while free health care and education were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhis.gov.gh/?CategoryID=158&amp;ArticleID=1110 "The Road to Ghana's Healthcare Financing – From Nkrumah to Health Insurance"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602194808/http://www.nhis.gov.gh/?CategoryID=158&amp;ArticleID=1110 |date=2 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Seven-Year Plan introduced in 1964 focused on further industrialisation, emphasising domestic substitutes for common imports, modernisation of the building materials industry, machine making, electrification, and electronics.&lt;ref name=Darko /&gt;

==== Energy projects ====

Nkrumah's advocacy of industrial development, with help of longtime friend and Minister of Finance, [[Komla Agbeli Gbedema]], led to Volta River Project: the construction of a hydroelectric power plant, the [[Akosombo Dam]] on the [[Volta River]] in eastern Ghana. The Volta River Project was the centrepiece of Nkrumah's economic program. On 20 February 1958, he told the National Assembly: "It is my strong belief that the Volta River Project provides the quickest and most certain method of leading us towards economic independence." Ghana invoked assistance from the United States, Israel, and the World Bank in constructing the dam.&lt;ref name=Asamoah&gt;Obed Asamoah, "Nkrumah's Foreign Policy, 1951–1966", in Arhin (1992), ''The Life and Work of Kwame Nkrumah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kaiser Aluminum]] agreed to build the dam for Nkrumah, but restricted what could be produced using the power generated. Nkrumah borrowed money to build the dam, and placed Ghana in debt. To finance the debt, he raised taxes on the cocoa farmers in the south. This accentuated regional differences and jealousy. The dam was completed and opened by Nkrumah amidst world publicity on 22 January 1966.

Nkrumah initiated the Ghana Nuclear Reactor Project in 1961, created the [[Ghana Atomic Energy Commission]] in 1963, and in 1964 laid the first stone in the building of an atomic energy facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=GAEC Documentation Committee |date=July 1998 |title=Ghana Atomic Energy Commission: At a Glance |url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/29/061/29061226.pdf |location=Kwabenya |publisher=RPB, GAEC |edition=Third |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820202553/http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/29/061/29061226.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoundationStone&gt;"[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=122255 Nkrumah lays foundation for atomic reactor .. in 1964] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403015024/http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=122255 |date=3 April 2015 }}", ''Ghana Review International'' 120, March 2007 (on ''GhanaWeb'', 11 April 2007).

==== Cocoa ====

In 1954, the world price of cocoa rose from £150 to £450 per ton. Rather than allowing cocoa farmers to keep the windfall, Nkrumah appropriated the increased revenue via central government levies, then invested the capital into various national development projects. This policy alienated one of the major constituencies that helped him come to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E3D7173CE03ABC4850DFB467838F649EDE |title=Cocoa Price Issue Splits Gold Coast |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 December 1954 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305125816/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E3D7173CE03ABC4850DFB467838F649EDE |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prices continued to fluctuate. In 1960, one ton of cocoa sold for £250 in London. By August 1965, this price had dropped to £91, one fifth of its value ten years before.&lt;ref name=Gebe /&gt;

=== Foreign and military policy ===
[[File:Nkrumah, his family and Nasser, 1965.jpg|thumb|309px|Nkrumah and his family meeting Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] during the 1965 [[Organisation of African Unity]] Summit in Accra.]]

Nkrumah actively promoted a policy of Pan-Africanism from the beginning of his presidency. This entailed the creation of a series of new international organisations, which held their inaugural meetings in Accra. These were:
* the First Conference of Independent States, in April 1958;
* the more inclusive [[All-African Peoples' Conference]], with representatives from 62 nationalist organisations from across the continent, in December 1958;
* the All-African Trade Union Federation, meeting in November 1959, to coordinate the African labour movement; 
* the Positive Action and Security in Africa conference, in April 1960, discussing Algeria, South Africa, and French nuclear weapons testing;
* the Conference of African Women, on 18 July 1960.&lt;ref name=Gebe /&gt;&lt;ref name=Asamoah /&gt;

Meanwhile, Ghana withdrew from colonial organisations including West Africa Airways Corporation, the West African Currency Board, the West African Cocoa Research Institute, and the [[West African Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref name=Gebe /&gt;

In the [[Year of Africa]], 1960, Nkrumah negotiated the creation of a [[Union of African States]], a political alliance between Ghana, Guinea, and Mali. Immediately there formed a women's group called Women of the Union of African States.&lt;ref name=Manuh /&gt;

Nkrumah was a leading figure in the short-lived [[Casablanca Group]] of African leaders, which sought to achieve pan-African unity and harmony through deep political, economic, and military integration of the continent in the early 1960s prior to the establishment of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU).&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Englebert &amp; Kevin C. Dunn (2013), ''Inside African Politics'', London: Lynne Reinner, pp. 320–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkrumah was instrumental in the creation of the OAU in Addis Ababa in 1963.&lt;ref name=Hagan /&gt; He aspired to create a united military force, the African High Command, which Ghana would substantially lead, and committed to this vision in Article 2 of [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1960|the 1960 Republican Constitution]]: "In the confident expectation of an early surrender of sovereignty to a union of African states and territories, the people now confer on Parliament the power to provide for the surrender of the whole or any part of the sovereignty of Ghana."&lt;ref name=Gebe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egon Schwelb, [http://www.francisbennion.com/pdfs/non-fb/1960/1960-001-nfb-ghana-constitution-egon-schwelb.pdf "The Republican Constitution of Ghana"; ''American Journal of Comparative Law''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131000/http://www.francisbennion.com/pdfs/non-fb/1960/1960-001-nfb-ghana-constitution-egon-schwelb.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} 9.4, Autumn 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a proponent of the [[United Nations]], but critical of the Great Powers' ability to control it.&lt;ref name=Asamoah /&gt;

Nkrumah opposed entry of African states into the Common Market of the [[European Economic Community]], a status given to many former French colonies and considered by Nigeria. Instead, Nkrumah advocated, in a speech given on 7 April 1960,

&lt;blockquote&gt;an African common market, a common currency area and the development of communications of all kinds to allow the free flow of goods and services. International capital can be attracted to such viable economic areas, but it would not be attracted to a divided and balkanised Africa, with each small region engaged in senseless and suicidal economic competition with its neighbours.&lt;ref name=Asamoah /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Armed forces ====
In 1956, Ghana took control of the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF), Gold Coast Regiment, from the British War Office. This force had formerly been deployed to quell internal dissent, and occasionally to fight in wars: most recently, in World War II, against the Japanese in India and Burma. The most senior officers in this force were British, and, although training of African officers began in 1947, only 28 of 212 officers in December 1956 were indigenous Africans. The British officers still received British salaries, which vastly exceeded those allotted to their Ghanaian counterparts. Concerned about a possible military coup, Nkrumah delayed the placement of African officers in top leadership roles.&lt;ref name=Hutchful&gt;Eboe Hutchful, "The Development of the Army Officer Corps in Ghana, 1956–1955", ''Journal of African Studies'' 12.3, Fall 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', pp. 22–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkrumah quickly established [[Ghanaian Air Force]], acquiring 14 ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver|Beaver]]'' airplanes from Canada and setting up a flight school with British instructors. ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter|Otters]]'', ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]],'' and ''[[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunks]]'' were to follow.&lt;ref name=Hutchful /&gt; Ghana also obtained four [[Ilyushin Il-18|Ilyushin-18]] aircraft from the Soviet Union. Preparation began in April 1959 with assistance from India and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ghanaian Navy]] received two inshore minesweepers with 40- and 20-millimeter guns, the ''Afadzato'' and the ''Yogaga'', from Britain in December 1959. It subsequently received the ''Elmina'' and the ''Komenda'', seaward defense boats with 40-millimetre guns.&lt;ref name=Hutchful /&gt; The Navy's flagship, and training ship, was the ''Achimota'', a British yacht constructed during World War II. In 1961, the Navy ordered two 600-ton corvettes, the ''Keta'' and ''Kromantse,'' from [[Vospers|Vosper &amp; Company]] and received them in 1967. It also procured four Soviet patrol boats. Naval officers were trained at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] in Dartmouth.&lt;ref&gt;Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghanaian military budget rose each year, from $9.35 million (US dollars) in 1958 to $47 million in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first international deployment of the Ghanaian armed forces was to [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo (Léopoldville/Kinshasa)]], where Ghanaian troops were airlifted in 1960 at the beginning of the [[Congo crisis]].&lt;ref name=Hutchful /&gt; One week after Belgian troops occupied the lucrative mining province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], Ghana dispatched more than a thousand of its own troops to join a United Nations force.&lt;ref name=Beynahm93&gt;Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 93. "Within a week, 1,193 Ghanaian soldiers were in Léopoldvile and 192 more were waiting for transport in Accra with 156 trucks and 160 tons of stores. In terms of its resources, Ghana made one of the heaviest manpower contributions to the Congo. By the end of August 1960, she had 2,394 army officers and men in the country. The Ghana contingent remained for three of the four years of the UN operations, contributing a total of more than 39,000 man-months."&lt;/ref&gt; The use of British officers in this context was politically unacceptable, and this event occasioned a hasty transfer of officer positions to Ghanaians.&lt;ref name=Hutchful /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congo war was long and difficult.&lt;ref name=Beynahm93 /&gt; On 19 January 1961 the Third Infantry Battalion mutinied. On 28 April 1961, 43 men were massacred in a surprise attack by the Congolese army.&lt;ref&gt;Baynham (1988), ''Military and Politics in Nkrumah's Ghana'', pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghana also gave military support to rebels fighting against [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Minority rule|white-minority government]] in [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), which had unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965.

==== Relationship with Communist world ====

In 1961, Nkrumah went on tour through Eastern Europe, proclaiming solidarity with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=Gebe /&gt;

In 1962 Kwame Nkrumah was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] by the [[Soviet Union]].

{{See also|National Liberation Council#1966 coup}}
In February 1966, while Nkrumah was on a state visit to [[North Vietnam]] and [[China]], his government was overthrown in a violent ''[[coup d'état]]'' led by the national [[Ghana Armed Forces|military]] and [[Ghana Police Service|police]] forces, with backing from the [[Ghana Civil Service|civil service]]. The conspirators, led by [[Joseph Arthur Ankrah]], named themselves the [[National Liberation Council]] and ruled as a military government for three years.

Nkrumah alluded to possible American complicity in the coup in his 1969 memoir ''Dark Days in Ghana'', though he may have based this conclusion on falsified documents shown to him by the [[KGB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|last2=Mitrohkin|first2=Vasili|title=The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0465003136|page=437}} cf. {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/04/25/archives/cia-maker-of-policy-or-tool-survey-finds-widely-feared-agency-is.html |title=C.I.A.: Maker of Policy, or Tool?; Survey Finds Widely Feared Agency Is Tightly Controlled |work=The New York Times |date=1966-04-25 |accessdate=2016-04-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512211657/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9400E4DB1639E63BBC4D51DFB266838D679EDE |archivedate=12 May 2016 |df= }}, which cites "authoritative officials outside the CIA" as claiming that allegations of CIA involvement in Nkrumah's ouster, plots to assassinate [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the [[30 September Movement]], and the assassination of [[Patrice Lumumba]], among others, "are fabrications".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 [[John Stockwell]], former Chief of the Angola Task Force of the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), wrote that agents at the CIA's Accra station "maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched". Afterward, "inside CIA headquarters the Accra station was given full, if unofficial credit for the eventual coup. ...None of this was adequately reflected in the agency's written records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Stockwell |title=In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |year=1978 |page=201n |isbn=0-393-00926-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, [[Seymour Hersh]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', citing "first hand intelligence sources," defended Stockwell's account, claiming that "many CIA operatives in Africa considered the agency's role in the overthrow of Mr. Nkrumah to have been pivotal."&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, Seymour (09-05-1978), "CIA Said to Have Aided Plotters Who Overthrew Nkrumah in Ghana", ''The New York Times''.

Dee, 2006), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the coup, Ghana realigned itself internationally, cutting its close ties to Guinea and the Eastern Bloc, accepting a new friendship with the [[Western Bloc]], and inviting the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] to take a lead role in managing the economy. With this reversal, accentuated by the expulsion of immigrants and a new willingness to negotiate with [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], Ghana lost a good deal of its stature in the eyes of African nationalists.&lt;ref name=Gebe /&gt;

}}Nkrumah never returned to Ghana, but he continued to push for his vision of African unity. He lived in exile in [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]], as the guest of President [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], who made him honorary co-president of the country. Nkrumah read, wrote, corresponded, gardened, and entertained guests. Despite retirement from public office, he felt that he was still threatened by Western intelligence agencies. When his cook died mysteriously, he feared that someone would poison him, and began hoarding food in his room. He suspected that foreign agents were going through his mail, and lived in constant fear of abduction and assassination. In failing health, he flew to [[Bucharest]], [[Communist Romania|Romania]], for medical treatment in August 1971. He died of [[prostate cancer]] in April 1972 at the age of 62.

Nkrumah was buried in a tomb in the village of his birth, [[Nkroful]], Ghana. While the tomb remains in Nkroful, his remains were transferred to a large national memorial tomb and park in Accra.

Over his lifetime, Nkrumah was awarded [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] by many universities including [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)]], [[Moscow State University]] (USSR), [[Cairo University]] ([[Egypt]]), [[Jagiellonian University]] ([[Poland]]) and [[Humboldt University]] ([[East Germany]]).&lt;ref name="Education For Leadership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwamenkrumahcentenary.org/esi_speech.html |title=Education For Leadership: The Vision of Kwame Nkrumah |publisher=kwamenkrumahcentenary.orgm |date= |accessdate=9 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=Kandymotownie |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he was voted African Man of the Millennium by listeners to the [[BBC World Service]], being described by the BBC as a "Hero of Independence", and an "International symbol of freedom as the leader of the first black African country to shake off the chains of colonial rule."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/highlights/000914_nkrumah.shtml "Kwame Nkrumah's Vision of Africa"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725113031/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/highlights/000914_nkrumah.shtml |date=25 July 2013 }}, [[BBC World Service]], 14 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to intelligence documents released by the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s [[Office of the Historian]], "Nkrumah was doing more to undermine [U.S. government] interests than any other black African."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v26/d201 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928121816/https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v26/d201 |archivedate=28 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkrumah called himself "a scientific socialist and a Marxist" and is considered relatively orthodox in his [[Marxism–Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ama Biney, [http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no3/LegacyOfKwameNkrumah.pdf "The Legacy of Kwame Nkrumah in Retrospect"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421001125/http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no3/LegacyOfKwameNkrumah.pdf |date=21 April 2014 }}, ''Journal of Pan African Studies'' [http://www.jpanafrican.com/archive_issues/currentissue_vol2no3.htm 2.3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321013501/http://jpanafrican.com/archive_issues/currentissue_vol2no3.htm |date=21 March 2015 }} March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  He generally took a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] Marxist perspective on economics, and believed [[capitalism]] had malignant effects that were going to stay with Africa for a long time. Although he was clear on distancing himself from the [[African socialism]] of many of his contemporaries, Nkrumah argued that [[socialism]] was the system that would best accommodate the changes that capitalism had brought, while still respecting African values. He specifically addresses these issues and his politics in a 1967 essay entitled "African Socialism Revisited":

&lt;blockquote&gt;We know that the traditional African society was founded on principles of egalitarianism. In its actual workings, however, it had various shortcomings. Its humanist impulse, nevertheless, is something that continues to urge us towards our all-African socialist reconstruction. We postulate each man to be an end in himself, not merely a means; and we accept the necessity of guaranteeing each man [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] for his development. The implications of this for socio-political practice have to be worked out scientifically, and the necessary social and economic policies pursued with resolution. Any meaningful humanism must begin from egalitarianism and must lead to objectively chosen policies for safeguarding and sustaining [[egalitarianism]]. Hence, socialism. Hence, also, [[scientific socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/1967/african-socialism-revisited.htm Kwame Nkrumah, "African Socialism Revisited", 1967.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427045237/http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/1967/african-socialism-revisited.htm |date=27 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!--
  THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN GATHERED FROM THE GERMAN WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE -- it does not make sense as it stands:

[[Paulin J. Hountondji|Paulin Hountondji]] has emphasised the breaks in the thinking of Nkrumah. During the early Nkrumah on the continuity of socialism in relation to, communalism 'of the' traditional Africa's insistence, an idealised image of pre-colonial Africa (draws no exploitation of man by man) and himself a disciple [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|of Gandhi]] understands, sees the late Nkrumah necessity of a violent break with the [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonial]] relations, the struggle against [[imperialism]] and its African allies. In ''African Socialism Revisited'' Nkrumah therefore rejects the idea of an "African socialism" in the sense [[Julius Nyerere|Nyerere]], one of the "''ideology of continuity''" ([[Paulin J. Hountondji|Hountondji]] left) was arrested from.

During the early works of Nkrumah, he emphasised that in pre-colonial Africa there is no [[class struggle]] have been made, rejects the late Nkrumah, the fetishisation of pre-colonial Africa. "Nkrumah will never have imagined back Africa as a special world, but he accepted that our societies to the same laws are subject like any other country in the world, and that the African revolution, if properly understood, is inextricably linked to the world revolution."

In ''Africa Must Unite'' (1963) Nkrumah called for the immediate formation of a pan-African government. Later he demanded a unification movement that emanates from the base, arguing that between anti-imperialist governments and Western-backed "puppet regimes" there could be no common ground.
--&gt;

Nkrumah was also best-known politically for his strong commitment to and promotion of [[pan-Africanism]]. He was inspired by the writings of black intellectuals such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and [[George Padmore]], and his relationships with them. Much of his understanding and relationship to these men was created during his years in America as a student. Some would argue that his greatest inspiration was Marcus Garvey, although he also had a meaningful relationship with [[C. L. R. James]]. Nkrumah looked to these men in order to craft a general solution to the ills of Africa. To follow in these intellectual footsteps Nkrumah had intended to continue his education in London, but found himself involved in direct activism. Then, motivated by advice from Du Bois, Nkrumah decided to focus on creating peace in Africa. He became a passionate advocate of the "African Personality" embodied in the slogan "Africa for the Africans" earlier popularised by Edward Wilmont Blyden and he viewed political independence as a prerequisite for economic independence.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Nkrumah's dedications to pan-Africanism in action attracted these intellectuals to his Ghanaian projects. Many Americans, such as Du Bois and [[Kwame Ture]], moved to Ghana to join him in his efforts. These men are buried there today.&lt;ref&gt;Afari-Gyan, Kwadwo. "Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore and W. E. B. Du Bois", ''Research Review (NS)'' vol. 7 (1991): 1–5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; His press officer for six years was the Grenadian anticolonialist [[Sam Morris (anticolonialist)|Sam Morris]]. Nkrumah's biggest success in this area was his significant influence in the founding of the [[Organisation of African Unity]].

Nkrumah also became a symbol for black liberation in the United States. When in 1958 the [[Metropolitan Black Bar Association|Harlem Lawyers Association]] had an event in Nkrumah's honour, diplomat [[Ralph Bunche]] told him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We salute you, Kwame Nkrumah, not only because you are Prime Minister of Ghana, although this is cause enough. We salute you because you are a true and living representation of our hopes and ideals, of the determination we have to be accepted fully as equal beings, of the pride we have held and nurtured in our African origin, of the freedom of which we know we are capable, of the freedom in which we believe, of the dignity imperative to our stature as men.&lt;ref name=Asamoah /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1961 Nkrumah delivered a speech called "I Speak Of Freedom". During this speech he talked about how "Africa could become one of the greatest forces for good in the world".&lt;ref name=1961nkrumah&gt;[https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1961nkrumah.html "Modern History Sourcebook: Kwame Nkrumah: I Speak of Freedom, 1961"]. Fordham University.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions how Africa is a land of "vast riches" with mineral resources from that "range from gold and diamonds to uranium and petroleum".&lt;ref name=1961nkrumah/&gt; Nkrumah says that the reason Africa isn't thriving right now is because the European powers have been taking all the wealth for themselves. If Africa could be independent of European rule then it could truly flourish and contribute positively to the world. In the ending words of this speech Nkrumah calls his people to action by saying "This is our chance. We must act now. Tomorrow may be too late and the opportunity will have passed, and with it the hope of free Africa's survival".&lt;ref name=1961nkrumah/&gt; This rallied the nation in a nationalistic movement.

==Personal life==
Nkrumah married [[Fathia Nkrumah|Fathia Ritzk]], an [[Copts|Egyptian Coptic]] bank worker and former teacher, on the evening of her arrival in Ghana: New Year's Eve, 1957–1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nathanielturner.com/fathiankrumahfarewell.htm Fathia Nkrumah by her son Gamal Nkrumah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824222033/http://www.nathanielturner.com/fathiankrumahfarewell.htm |date=24 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fathia's mother refused to bless their marriage, due to reluctance to see another one of her children leave with a foreign husband.

As a married couple, the Nkrumah family had three children: [[Gamal Nkrumah|Gamal]] (born 1959), [[Samia Nkrumah|Samia]] (born 1960), and [[Sekou Nkrumah|Sekou]] (born 1963). Gamal is a newspaper journalist, while Samia and Sekou are politicians.

In [[Religion in Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian demonology]], '''Lilin''' (singular Lilim) were hostile night [[spirits]] that attacked men. They had less power than [[Pantheon (gods)|gods]]. This was also the Hebrew word for both the [[succubus]] and [[incubus]] spirits of other legends as a single concept. This word, however, only included the sons and daughters of [[Lilith]] or a Lilith-like creature. Older, more physically and mentally mature spirits were known as [[Lilitu]] in [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D2-Na937xRYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Lilitu%20Inanna#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilitu%20Inanna&amp;f=false|title=The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity|first=Jeffrey Burton|last=Russell|date=1 January 1987|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|accessdate=21 September 2016|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn=978-0801494093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish mythology]], ''Lilin'' (Hebrew: {{Lang|he|לילין}}) is a term for night spirits. In [[Targum Sheni]] Esther 1:3 [[King Solomon]] had lilin dance before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=421&amp;letter=L|title=LILITH - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13523-shedim|title=DEMONOLOGY - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Open court'', a monthly magazine: Volume 44  1930 "3 The Hebrew word lilin is not a true plural of lilith. We would expect lilitim or lilitos as a plural. The word is in reality the masculine counterpart of lilith and denotes a male night-monster. presented our common ancestor with a daughter named ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sayings of the Jewish fathers: (Pirke aboth) 1919 "... this is the most general term for them, though various other grades of them are mentioned in the Talmud and kindred writings : shedim = "evil genii," an Assyrio-Bab. loan-word ; lilin, probably evil spirits of the night, also from the Assyrio-Bab.;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lilith]] and her children, the Lilim, are considered to be [[night spirit]]s. Lilith is also considered by older Jewish tradition to be [[Cain]]'s wife.&lt;ref&gt;Cain's Wife Lilith's Daughter, Walter Hugh Parks&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch]], ''lilin'' come from the desert&lt;ref&gt;R H Charles translation&lt;/ref&gt; and they are similar to [[shedim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZI4pBp-G9csC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Lilin#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilin&amp;f=false|title=The Apocalypse of Baruch|first=Robert Henry|last=Charles|date=1 January 1896|publisher=A. and C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20757">This is a '''list of people by number of countries visited'''.

There are a number of people claiming to have visited every country in the world, though there is great debate as to [[Number of countries on earth|how many countries there are in the world]]. The most commonly agreed base number is the number of [[United Nations member states]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/members&lt;/ref&gt; of which there are 193. According to the [[United Nations]], "The recognition of a new State or Government is an act that only other States and Governments may grant or withhold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092224/http://www.un.org/en/members/about.shtml|title=United Nations member States - Non-member state maintaining observer mission|date=13 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the  membership of some countries to the [[United Nations]] is blocked by one or more other members, such as [[Taiwan]] and [[Kosovo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/security-council/index-of-countries-on-the-security-council-agenda/kosovo.html |title=Kosovo |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also two [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer states]], the [[Holy See]] and the [[State of Palestine]].

Additionally, there are various dependencies and territories that maintain autonomy, their own government, immigration, and/or print their own currency, and can be widely held as de facto countries by travellers. [[ISO 3166]] is maintained by ISO as an updated list of the aforementioned derived from United Nations sources (Terminology Bulletin Country Names and the Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use maintained by the United Nations Statistics Divisions),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes |title=3166 - Country codes |publisher=ISO |date= |accessdate=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists 249 countries.

The [[Travelers' Century Club]], whose membership is limited to those travellers who have visited one hundred or more territories of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelerscenturyclub.org/about |title=About the TCC &amp;#124; The Travelers' Century Club |publisher=Travelerscenturyclub.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains its own official list of countries and territories, a total of 327 as of January 1, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelerscenturyclub.org/countries-and-territories|title=Countries &amp; Territories - The Travelers' Century Club|website=travelerscenturyclub.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes geographically separated areas, such as [[Hawaii]] and other areas of cultural interest. The Best Travelled is an on-line travel club with personal rankings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebesttravelled.com/ |title=Best Travelled People - Best Travel Forum|publisher=The Best Travelled |date= |accessdate=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which divides the world into 1,281 regions, and has a verification process to check on travellers' claims.

==Definition of visit==
There are no official criteria of what constitutes a visit. The [[Travelers' Century Club]] considers even the shortest stops, including port-of-call or a plane fuel stops, valid visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travelerscenturyclub.org/countries-and-territories|title=Countries &amp; Territories|website=travelerscenturyclub.org|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many sources advocate that transiting in an airport does not qualify as visiting a country. Some travellers propose that actions such as staying one night in a hotel, or buying a meal, are essential, yet others note that countries and territories such as the Vatican City or Antarctica do not have hotels or restaurants.

==Handling of former states==
Where a country splits into independent states, such as the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], then travellers '''CAN''' count the new states if they had formerly travelled in them, but '''NOT''' count states they had not physically visited prior to disintegration. For example, if a traveller had visited Kiev and Moscow in the former USSR, they could count the new independent states of Ukraine and Russia, but not Armenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15498">The [[William E. Harmon Foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|William E. Harmon Foundation award for Distinguished Achievement among Negroes]], commonly referred to as the "Harmon award" or "Harmon Foundation award", was a philanthropic and cultural award created in 1926 by [[William E. Harmon]]&lt;ref name = "GH3"&gt;Gates &amp; Higginbotham, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and administered by the [[William E. Harmon Foundation|Harmon Foundation]]. It was offered for distinguished achievements in eight different fields: literature, music, fine arts, business and industry, science and innovation, education, religious service, and race relations. Although awards were created in eight categories, it is best known for its recognition of [[African-American art]] of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], and particularly of the visual arts.&lt;ref name = "Calo75"&gt;Calo, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of the bronze medal won by [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|A.M.E.]] Bishop [[John Fletcher Hurst]] in 1926 appeared in the January 8, 1927, edition of the ''[[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]]'', published in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The medal is of unusually beautiful design. On the obverse side is embossed a ship in full sail on the open sea with the inscription "Harmon Foundation" around the margin. On the reverse side are the words "Inspiration, Achievement Religious Service. Second award, 1926, John Hurst".&lt;ref name = "afroam"&gt;"Bishop Hurst formally given Harmon Award". Afro-American, Saturday January 8, 1927, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A full list of the winners of each year was offered in contemporary ''New York Times'' articles.&lt;ref name = "winners1929"&gt;"Dr. Moton receives $1,000 Harmon Award" (January 6, 1930). ''New York Times'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "winners1926"&gt;"Negro artist wins prize for paintings" (December 8, 1926).

She campaigned for [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor law]], particularly interested in prohibiting the practice of using children in sugar beet fields.  Mabel was a member of the [[National Child Labor Committee]] advisory council. She was also interested in the plight of foreign-born individuals in labor practices.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt; She was a member of the [[National Women's Trade Union League]].&lt;ref name="Howes" /&gt; In 1934, her husband co-sponsored the [[Jones–Costigan amendment]] to the [[Sugar Act]], which reformed the sugar industry and prohibited the hiring of workers under 14 years-of-age and set a maximum eight-hour work day for 14 to 16 year-olds.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Norris|title=North for the Harvest: Mexican Workers, Growers, and the Sugar Beet Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HsRunzUrK7QC&amp;pg=PA46|date=July 24, 2009|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|isbn=978-0-87351-746-1|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman, Former President of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia. Costigan was said to have been a notable and hard-working presence in Washington, D.C. since [[World War I]]. Selma Borchardt, who represented the American Federation of Teachers, was the other of two woman said to be highly effective. She was serious in her approach and found that legislators "meet with us [women] and deal with us exactly as if we were men, presenting a case on its merits."&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/279404308/?terms=Mabel%252BCostigan%252Bwisconsin |title=The Women Wire-Pullers of Washington|date=June 13, 1926|page= 19 |newspaper= The Morning Call |via= Newspapers.com |last=Newman |first=Oliver P. |access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained active in the National Consumer League for many years.&lt;ref name="Kelley - Mabel" /&gt;

[[File:Meyer-lutz-1894.jpg|right|thumb|Lutz in 1894]]

'''Wilhelm Meyer Lutz''' (19 May 1829 – 31 January 1903) was a German-born British composer and conductor who is best known for light music, musical theatre and [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]]s of well-known works.

Emigrating to the UK at the age of 19, Lutz started as an organist and soon became a theatrical conductor in London. After serving from 1850 to 1855 as music director of the [[Surrey Theatre]], Lutz conducted touring opera companies and composed some serious music and music for the [[Christy Minstrels]].  In 1869, he was engaged as the music director of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], arranging and later composing a series of popular burlesques over the next 25 years. Lutz continued to compose songs into the 20th century.

==Life and career==
Lutz was born in [[Münnerstadt]], Bavaria, Germany.  His parents were Joseph Lutz (1801–1879), a music professor, and Magdalena (1809–1862).  His older brother, Baron Johann Lutz, became the prime minister of Bavaria under King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]].  Lutz studied music first with his father, then in Würzburg at the University.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34639 "Lutz, (Wilhelm) Meyer (1829–1903)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, Retrieved on 8 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Britain, as a pianist, in 1846, and then moved to England in 1848 at the age of 19.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L. [http://www.musicweb.uk.net/garlands/22nd.htm "A Twenty-Second Garland of British Light Music Composers"], Music Web International, Retrieved on 8 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Meyer-lutz-1868.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lutz in 1868]]
Lutz began as an organist in churches at [[Birmingham]] and [[Leeds]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', 2 February 1903, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Then, for many years, he played the organ at [[St George's Cathedral, Southwark|St. George's Roman Catholic Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 August 1854, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz was also a Grand Organist in Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 44, No. 721, 1 March 1903, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutz soon became a theatrical conductor.  From 1850 to 1855, he conducted at the [[Surrey Theatre]] and later the [[Royalty Theatre]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; For that theatre, he composed two operas, the one-act ''The Charmed Harp'' (1852) and a [[grand opera]], ''[[Faust and Marguerite (opera)|Faust and Marguerite]]'' (1855).&lt;ref name=Italian&gt;[http://www.italianopera.org/compositori/L/c219326E.htm "Wilhelm Meyer Lutz"], ItalianOpera.org&lt;/ref&gt; After this, for many years, Lutz conducted concerts in the British provinces and touring opera troupes for [[Giulia Grisi]], the [[tenor]] [[Mario (tenor)|Mario]] and others.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;''Musical Times'', November 1859&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were led by the [[tenor]] Elliot Galer (the founder, in 1877, of the Royal Opera House in [[Leicester]]),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tjwOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA558&amp;lpg=RA1-PA558&amp;dq=galer+tenor+%22opera+house%22+Leicester&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JflH0AF-o6&amp;sig=AKbpMN37TzubbbnVik9p9UtVPio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result ''A Dictionary of the Drama''], p. 558, Burt Franklin, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; who produced Lutz's opera ''Zaida, or, The Pearl of Granada'' (with a libretto by Oliver Summers) in 1859 in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In the 1850s and 1860s he shared the concert podium at classical concerts with [[Julius Benedict]] both in the provinces and at [[St. James's Hall]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 6 November 1853, p. 1, and 29 April 1866&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, in [[Derby, England|Derby]], England, Lutz played the piano for a series of ten "Concerts for the People" at the Temperance Hall.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; Galer also mounted three other Lutz operas at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in London: ''Blonde or Brunette'' (1862), ''Cousin Kate'' (1863), and ''Felix, or The Festival of the Roses'' (1865).&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt;  During these years, Lutz also composed the [[cantata]]s ''Herne the Hunter'' ([[The Crystal Palace]], 1862) and ''King Christmas'' ([[Oxford Music Hall]], 1863), and music for the [[Christy Minstrels]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Gaiety Theatre years===
In 1869, manager [[John Hollingshead]] hired Lutz as the resident musical director and conductor at the recently opened [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], composing dances and songs for productions at that theatre, as well as conducting the orchestra for the operas, [[operetta]]s, plays and [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] mounted at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; In this capacity, he conducted ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]], in 1871.

[[Image:Ruyblasbrochure.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Souvenir programme]] from ''Ruy Blas'']]
Lutz's early compositions for the Gaiety theatre included [[incidental music]] for ''Dreams'' (1869), a play by [[Thomas W. Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1898), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Miller of Milburg'' (1872).&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; At the same time, [[Christine Nilsson]] performed his scena ''Xenia the Sclavonian Maiden'' (1869), and at the [[Covent Garden]] [[Promenade Concerts]] in 1873, his cantata, ''Legend of the Lys'', was performed.&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; He also composed music for such shows as ''On Condition'' (1882) and ''Posterity'' (1884) for Lila Clay's all-ladies troupe.  He also composed the popular song, "Eyes of English Blue" for Alice Atherton.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

At the Gaiety, Lutz compiled the scores, and later often composed original music, for a series of popular pasticcio entertainments, opera-bouffes and burlesques,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; including ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877); ''Robbing Roy'' (1879 by [[F. C. Burnand]]); a version of ''The Forty Thieves'' (1880, libretto by [[Robert Reece]]; Lutz had conducted [[The Forty Thieves|an 1878 version]] of the same story); ''All in the Downs; or, Black-Eyed Susan'' (1881); ''Aladdin'' (1881); ''Oh! Those Girls'' (1882);&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1898), pp. 462–75&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Beard'' (1882); ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883, with a libretto by [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]]); ''Ariel'' (1883, libretto by Burnand); and ''Mazeppa'' (1884).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

[[George Edwardes]] took over management of the Gaiety in 1885 and expanded the format of the burlesques, commissioning Lutz to write original scores for the "new burlesques" at the theatre: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885, libretto by Stephens); ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886); ''[[Miss Esmeralda]], or The Maid and the Monkey'' (1887); ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887); ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888, libretto by G. R. Sims and Henry Pettitt); ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889, libretto by [[Frederick Hobson Leslie]] and Herbert F. Clark); ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890, libretto by Sims and Pettitt);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm Programme for ''Carmen up to Data''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |date=10 December 2008 }}, ArthurLloyd website&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891, libretto by Leslie);&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; and ''Don Juan'' (1892, book by Leslie, lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).  The "Pas de quatre", a sprightly barn-dance written for ''Faust up to Date'', remained popular for more than fifty years and has had at least two modern recordings.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recordings on CD include those by the London Concert Orchestra, Ronald Corp conductor (Hyperion CDA66868), and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Barry Wordsworth conductor (Warner Classics 2564620202).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, with [[Albert O'Donnell Bartholeyns]], he wrote ''A la Française''.&lt;ref&gt;"Slashes and Puffs", ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', 19 July 1893, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music to a dance from ''[[Faust up to date]]'']]
During these years, Lutz continued in demand as a conductor throughout Britain&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''The Times'', 20 July 1880, p. 10, describing a large-scale "Mozart-Beethoven Festival Concert" directed by Lutz and noting that his services were "always enlisted on such... occasions".&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to compose religious and secular music.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; On 3 May 1886, the Gaiety Theatre hosted a selection of scenes played for Lutz's benefit, including scenes from Lutz's grand opera ''Faust and Marguerite'', his burlesque ''Little Jack Sheppard'' and the operetta ''Karl'' and several recitations and solo pieces.  The performers included [[Nellie Farren]] (who had sung under him in nearly all of his Gaiety pieces), [[Marion Hood]], [[Durward Lely]], [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon.  [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchive.htm Information about Lutz's benefit performance] Gilbert and Sullivan memorabilia archive site&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Lutz left the Gaiety in 1894 and was replaced by [[Ivan Caryll]].  For the [[Opera Comique]] in 1895, Lutz composed ''A Model Trilby, or A Day or Two after du Maurier''.&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; He also wrote additional songs for ''[[Baron Golosh]]'' for the [[Trafalgar Theatre]] (1895).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1UM5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22Baron+Golosh%22+Lutz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mPlA0Cj8Pq&amp;sig=yi470SyutQRrTBlgHJWqE5dJCU4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TL2rSvvKCouXlAeK5OjOBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1# ''A dictionary of the drama''], p. 113, Chatto &amp; Windus, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz wrote a string quartet and ballads such as "Thy Silv'ry Tones", "Enchant Mine Ear" and "Sail on Silver Cloud."  In the last years of the 19th century, Lutz conducted a band playing Summer seasons at the spa in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]].&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; He continued to compose songs into the 20th century, including music for ''Hidenseek'' (1901) and a few numbers for [[Ivan Caryll]] and Cecil Cook's ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1902).  However, Lutz seems to have run low on funds, as another benefit was held for him on 28 November 1901 at the Gaiety Theatre, organised by George Edwardes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 October 1901, announcing the benefit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutz was married in 1856 to Elizabeth Cook (b. 1835) and later to her sister Emily Cook (b. 1847).&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew. "Comic Opera Goes Latin-American, 1890–92: Part 2" in ''The Gaiety'', Winter 2006, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Their brothers were the [[basso|bass]] Thomas Aynsley Cook (1833–1894) and the [[baritone]] [[John Furneaux Cook]], and their sister, Alice Aynsley Cook (c. 1850–1938), was also an opera singer and musical comedy actress.  His niece, Annie, married [[Eugène Goossens, fils|Eugene Goossens, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Lutz
also had a son, Caspar, who became a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 17 December 1908, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In printed works, such as scores and theatre programmes, Lutz was usually credited simply as Meyer Lutz.  Some of Lutz's music was arranged for military band by J. A. Kappey.&lt;ref&gt;Kappey, J. A. ''Reminiscences of The Gaiety'' (Boosey's military Journal, 1891) ASIN: B0000CZ6RL.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lutz is mentioned in a [[P. G. Wodehouse]] novel, ''[[A Damsel in Distress (novel)|A Damsel in Distress]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;Wodehouse, P. G. [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/dmsnd11.txt ''A Damsel in Distress''], chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a character called Herr Toots in the 1912 novel ''Bella'' by Edward Booth is based on Lutz,&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; as is the character Meyer Klootz in the 1940 novel ''Town and Haven'' by Oswald Harland, both novels being set in late Victorian Scarborough (named "Spathorpe" in ''Bella'', and "Whitcliff" in ''Town and Haven'').

Lutz died of bronchitis at his home in [[Kensington]], London at the age of 73.  He was buried in St Mary's, Kensal Green.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

He received an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] nomination for his performance in ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947), as well as two [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best British Actor]] nominations for his performances in ''[[The Night My Number Came Up]]'' (1955) and ''[[Time Without Pity]]'' (1957).

==Youth and education==
Redgrave was born in [[Bristol]], England, the son of the [[silent film]] actor [[Roy Redgrave]] and actress [[Margaret Scudamore]]. He never knew his father, who left when the boy was six months old to pursue a career in Australia. He died when Redgrave was fourteen. His mother subsequently married Captain James Anderson, a tea planter. Redgrave greatly disliked his stepfather.&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Redgrave: My Father'', 1996 BBC documentary film narrated by his son [[Corin Redgrave]], based on his book of the same name; produced and directed by Roger Michell&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at [[Clifton College]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]. Clifton College's theatre, the Redgrave Theatre, was later named after him. He was a schoolmaster at [[Cranleigh School]] in Surrey before becoming an actor in 1934. He directed the boys in ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'', but played all the leading roles himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Great Stage Stars'', Sheridan Morley&lt;/ref&gt; The "Redgrave Room" at the school was named after him. In the new [[Guildford School of Acting]] building, which opened in January 2010, the "Sir Michael Redgrave Studio" was named for him.

==Theatre career==
Redgrave made his first professional appearance at the [[Liverpool Playhouse|Playhouse]] in [[Liverpool]] on 30 August 1934 as Roy Darwin in ''Counsellor-at-Law'' (by [[Elmer Rice]]), then spent two years with its Liverpool Repertory Company where he met his future wife [[Rachel Kempson]]. They married on 18 July 1935.

Offered a job by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], Redgrave made his first professional debut in London at the [[Old Vic]] on 14 September 1936, playing Ferdinand in ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. During 1936–37 he also played Mr Horner in ''[[The Country Wife]]'', Orlando in ''[[As You Like It]]'', Warbeck in ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' and Laertes to [[Laurence Olivier]]'s Hamlet. His hit of the season was Orlando. [[Edith Evans]] was his Rosalind and the two fell very much in love. As he later explained: "Edith always had a habit of falling in love with her leading men; with us it just went rather further."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  ''As You Like It'' transferred to the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in February 1937 and Redgrave again played Orlando.

Redgrave joined the [[Royal Navy]] as an [[ordinary seaman]] in July 1941, ({{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}) but was discharged on medical grounds in November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Redgrave provided his friend the actor and writer [[Godfrey Winn]] (also in the Navy at the time), with a memorable signal his ship made. The aircraft carrier HMS ''Illustrious'' was in collision with another carrier, HMS ''Formidable'' in poor weather visibility in the Atlantic, after the collision ''Illustrious'' signalled: "If you touch me in that place again, I shall scream". {{cite book |title=Home from Sea |first=Godfrey |last=Winn |publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co |location=London |year=1944 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having spent most of 1942 in the Reserve he managed to direct ''Lifeline'' (Norman Armstrong) starring [[Frank Pettingell]] at the [[Duchess Theatre]] in July; and ''[[The Duke in Darkness]]'' ([[Patrick Hamilton (writer)|Patrick Hamilton]]) starring [[Leslie Banks]] at the [[St James's Theatre]] in October, also taking the role of Gribaud.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Stage Stars'', Sheridan Morley, and ''Who's Who in the Theatre'' 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Redgrave joined the [[Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]] company at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and for the 1951 season appeared as Prospero in ''The Tempest'' as well as playing Richard II, Hotspur and Chorus in the Cycle of ''Histories'', for which he also directed ''Henry IV Part Two''. After appearing as Frank Elgin in ''Winter Journey'' at the St James's April 1952, he rejoined the Stratford company in 1953 (together with his actress wife Rachel Kempson) appearing as Shylock, King Lear and Antony in ''Antony and Cleopatra'', also playing Antony when the company transferred to the [[Prince's Theatre]] in November 1953 before touring in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=spoto /&gt;{{rp|p.163}}

At the Apollo in June 1955 he played Hector in ''[[Tiger at the Gates]]'', appearing in the same role at the [[Plymouth Theatre]], New York City in October 1955 for which he received the New York Critics' Award. While in New York he directed ''A Month in the Country'' at the Phoenix Theatre in April 1956, and directed and played the Prince Regent in ''[[The Sleeping Prince (play)|The Sleeping Prince]]'' at the [[Coronet Theatre (Los Angeles)|Coronet Theatre]] in November 1956.

Returning to London in January 1958, Redgrave appeared as Philip Lester in ''A Touch of the Sun'' (N. C. Hunter) at the [[Saville Theatre]]. He won Best Actor in the [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards|''Evening Standard'' Awards]] 1958 for this role. He rejoined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in June 1958, to play Hamlet and Benedick, also playing Hamlet with the company in [[Leningrad]] and [[Moscow]] in December 1958. (His wife Rachel Kempson played Ursula in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and Lady Capulet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').

At the [[Queen's Theatre]] in London in August 1959, he played H.J. in his own adaptation of the Henry James novella ''The Aspern Papers''. His play was later successfully revived on Broadway in 1962, with Dame [[Wendy Hiller]] and [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]]. The 1984 London revival featured his daughter, [[Vanessa Redgrave]], along with [[Christopher Reeve]] and Hiller, this time in the role of Miss Bordereau.

[[File:Michael Redgrave.jpg|thumb|Michael Redgrave in costume for lead role in ''Uncle Vanya'', backstage at Chichester Festival Theatre, 1962. ''Photo: Tony French.'']]Returning to [[UK|Britain]], in July 1962 he took part in the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]]'s opening season, playing the title role in [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' to the Astrov of [[Laurence Olivier]] who also directed.

Alongside [[John Dexter]]'s Chichester staging of ''Saint Joan'', Olivier's ''Uncle Vanya'' was first revived in Chichester in 1963 before transferring to the Old Vic as part of the nascent [[Royal National Theatre]]'s inaugural season, winning rave reviews and Redgrave's second win as Best Actor in the 1963 [[Evening Standard Awards]]. Critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] recalled: "In Redgrave's Vanya you saw both a tremulous victim of a lifetime's emotional repression and the wasted potential of a Chekhovian might-have-been: as Redgrave and Olivier took their joint curtain call, linked hands held triumphantly aloft, we were not to know that this was to symbolise the end of their artistic amity."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Billington ''State of the Nation: British Theatre Since 1945'', London: Faber, 2007, p.142 {{ISBN|978-0-571-21034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redgrave played (and co-presented) Lancelot Dodd MA in Arthur Watkyn's ''Out of Bounds'' at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in November 1962, following it at the Old Vic with his portrayal of Claudius opposite the Hamlet of [[Peter O'Toole]] on 22 October 1963. This ''Hamlet'' was in fact the National Theatre's official opening production, directed by Olivier, but [[Simon Callow]] has dubbed it "slow, solemn, long", while [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]] vividly described it as "brochure theatre."&lt;ref&gt;''The National: 1963–1997'' by Simon Callow, Nick Hern Books (1997) {{ISBN|1-85459-323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1964 at the National he played the title role in ''[[Hobson's Choice (play)|Hobson's Choice]]'', which he admitted was well outside his range: "I couldn't do the [[Lancashire]] accent and that shook my nerve terribly – all the other performances suffered." While still at the National in June 1964 he also played Halvard Solness in ''The Master Builder'', which he said 'went wrong'. At this time he had incipient [[Parkinson's disease]], although he did not know it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In May and June 1965 Redgrave directed the opening festival of the [[Yvonne Arnaud Theatre]] in [[Guildford]], including directing and playing Rakitin in ''A Month in the Country'' (co-starring with [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Natalya Petrovna), and Samson in ''Samson Agonistes'' (co-starring with Rachel Kempson as Chorus). He again played Rakitin in September 1965, when his production transferred to the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in London. For the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] he directed ''[[Werther]]'' in 1966 and ''[[La bohème]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Redgrave|url=http://glyndebourne.com/archive/individual/michael-redgrave|work=Performances|publisher=Glyndebourne|accessdate=6 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131106025912/http://glyndebourne.com/archive/individual/michael-redgrave|archivedate=6 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
At the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in July 1971 he played Mr Jaraby in ''The Old Boys'' (William Trevor) and had an unfortunate experience: "My memory went, and on the first night they made me wear a deaf aid to hear some lines from the prompter and it literally fell to pieces – there were little bits of machinery all over the floor, so I then knew I really couldn't go on, at least not learning new plays."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Nevertheless, he successfully took over the part of Father in [[John Mortimer]]'s ''[[A Voyage Round My Father]]'' at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, also touring Canada and Australia in the role in 1972–73. International touring continued in 1974–75 with a Royal Shakespeare Company production of ''The Hollow Crown'', visiting major venues in the USA, New Zealand and Australia, while in 1976–77 he toured South America, Canada and the UK in the anthology, ''Shakespeare's People''.

Redgrave's final theatre appearance came in May 1979 when he portrayed Jasper in [[Simon Gray]]'s ''Close of Play'', directed on the Lyttelton stage at the National Theatre by [[Harold Pinter]]. It was a silent, seated role, based on Gray's own father, who had died a year before he wrote the play. As Gray has said: "Jasper is in fact dead but is forced to endure, as if alive, a traditional English Sunday, helpless in his favourite armchair as his three sons and their wives fall to pieces in the usual English middle class style, sometimes blaming him, sometimes appealing to him for help and sobbing at his feet for forgiveness, but basically ignoring him. In other words I had stuck him in Hell, which turns out to be 'life, old life itself'."&lt;ref&gt;''An Unnatural Pursuit and Other Pieces'' by Simon Gray, Faber (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

His final work, in 1975, a narrative of the epic poem, ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], a poem that Redgrave taught as a young schoolmaster and visualised by producer-director Raul da Silva, received six international film festival prizes of which five were first place in category. This work was to be his last before the onslaught of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bowker's Complete Video Directory, Volume 4|year=1998|publisher=R.R. Bowker|location=New York|isbn=978-0835240147|page=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television work==
Redgrave first appeared on BBC television at the [[Alexandra Palace]] in 1937, in scenes from ''Romeo and Juliet''. His first major film role was in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938). Redgrave also starred in ''[[The Stars Look Down (film)|The Stars Look Down]]'' (1940), with [[James Mason]] in the film of [[Robert Ardrey]]'s play ''[[Thunder Rock (film)|Thunder Rock]]'' (1942), and in the ventriloquist's dummy episode of the [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]] compendium film ''[[Dead of Night]]'' (1945).

His first American film role was opposite [[Rosalind Russell]] in ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947), for which he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. In 1951 he starred in ''[[The Browning Version (1951 film)|The Browning Version]]'', from [[Terence Rattigan|Sir Terrence Rattigan]]'s play of the same name. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' described Redgrave's performance as Crocker-Harris as "one of the greatest performances ever seen in films".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Wansell, ''Terence Rattigan'', p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s also saw Redgrave in ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest (1952 film)|The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1952), ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dambusters]]'' (1954) with his portrayal of the inventor [[Barnes Wallis]], ''[[1984 (1956 film)|1984]]'' (1956), ''[[Time Without Pity]]'' (1957), for which he was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]], and ''[[The Quiet American (1958 film)|The Quiet American]]'' (1958).

Notable television performances include narration for ''[[The Great War (documentary)|The Great War]]'' (1964), a history of the First World War using stills and 'stretched' archive film, and the less successful ''Lost Peace'' series (BBC Television, 1964 and 1966). Of the latter, [[Philip Purser]] wrote: "The commentary, spoken by Sir Michael Redgrave, took on an unremittingly pessimistic tone from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;''Halliwell's Television Companion'' Third Edition, Grafton Books (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Family===
{{main article|Redgrave family}}
Redgrave was married to the actress [[Rachel Kempson]] for 50 years from 1935 until his death. Their children [[Vanessa Redgrave|Vanessa]] (b. 1937), [[Corin Redgrave|Corin]] (1939–2010) and [[Lynn Redgrave]] (1943–2010), and their grandchildren: [[Natasha Richardson]] (1963–2009), [[Joely Richardson]] (b. 1965) and [[Jemma Redgrave]] (b. 1965) are also involved in theatre or film as actors. Their grandson [[Carlo Gabriel Nero]] is a screenwriter and film director; only Luke Redgrave has taken a path outside the theatre. 

His daughter Lynn wrote a one-woman play for herself called ''Shakespeare for My Father.'' She was nominated for Broadway's [[Tony Award]] for this role. She traced her love for Shakespeare as a way of following and finding her often absent father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vellela|first=Tony|title=From our files: An interview with Lynn Redgrave|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2010/0503/From-our-files-An-interview-with-Lynn-Redgrave|accessdate=6 November 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor:|date=28 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redgrave owned [[White Roding Windmill]] from 1937 to 1946.&lt;ref name=Book4&gt;{{cite book | first = Kenneth| last = Farries|year = 1985| month = | title = Essex Windmills, Millers and Millwrights – Volume Four – A Review by Parishes, F-R| pages= 121–123|location = Edinburgh| isbn = 0-284-98647-X |publisher = Charles Skilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family lived in "Bedford House" on [[Chiswick]] Mall from 1945 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, William P., ''Glimpses of Chiswick's Development'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-9516512-2-6}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; His entry for ''Who's Who in the Theatre'' (1981) gives his address as Wilks Water, [[Odiham]], Hampshire.

===Bisexuality===
Corin helped his father in the writing of his last autobiography. During one of Corin's visits to his father, the latter said, "There is something I ought to tell you". Then, after a very long pause, "I am, to say the least of it, bisexual". Corin encouraged him to acknowledge his bisexuality in the book. Michael agreed to do so, but in the end he chose to remain silent about it.&lt;ref name=spoto /&gt;{{rp|p.274}}  Alan Strachan's 2004 biography of Redgrave discusses his affairs with both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/20937/part_2/one-rung-below-greatness.thtml]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Redgrave had some long-term relationships with men, he also was prone to cruising [[Victoria, London|Victoria]] or [[Knightsbridge]] for what he called "a necessary degradation", a habit of quick pick-ups that left him with a lasting sense of self-disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barber|first=Lynn|title=His necessary degradations|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3616047/His-necessary-degradations.html|accessdate=6 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 Apr 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 BBC documentary film ''Michael Redgrave: My Father'', narrated by Corin Redgrave, and based on his book of the same name, discusses the older actor's [[bisexuality]] in some depth.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=3 January 2013|title=Corin Redgrave, Actor and Activist, Dies at 70 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/theater/07redgrave.html|date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Kempson recounted that, when she proposed to him, Redgrave said that there were "difficulties to do with his nature, and that he felt he ought not to marry". She said that she understood, it didn't matter and that she loved him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/vanessa-redgrave-greiving-glorying-sisters-death/story?id=10639716&amp;page=2|title= Vanessa Redgrave 'Grieving and Glorying' After Sister Lynn Redgrave's Death

During the filming of [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Secret Beyond the Door]]'' (1948), Redgrave met Bob Michell. They became lovers. Michell set up house close to the Redgraves, and he became a surrogate "uncle" to Redgrave's children (then aged 11, 9 and 5), who adored him. Michell later had children of his own, including a son he named Michael.&lt;ref name=spoto&gt;{{cite book|last=Spoto|first=Donald|title=The Redgraves: A Family Epic|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0307720146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUWFhrgu-HgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.193}} [[Fred Sadoff]] was an actor/director who became Redgrave's assistant and lover; they shared lodgings in New York and London.&lt;ref name=spoto /&gt;{{rp|p.178–183}}

A card was found among Redgrave's effects after his death. The card was signed "Tommy, Liverpool, January 1940", and on it were the words (quoted from [[W.H. Auden]]): "The word is love. Surely one fearless kiss would cure the million fevers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Michael Redgrave (1908–1985)|url=http://outstoriesbristol.org.uk/people/biographies/redgrave-michael/|publisher=OutStories Bristol|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and death===
In 1976, after suffering symptoms for many years, Redgrave was diagnosed with rapidly advancing [[Parkinson's disease]]. He began a regimen of therapies and medications that caused disorientation and other [[side effect]]s. Costs for his healthcare expenses and his diminished earning power caused the family to apply for public assistance from the King George's Pension Fund. In an interview on his seventieth birthday, he said: "For a long time, nobody understood the Parkinson's condition, and directors thought I was just forgetful or drunk--and even now the work isn't easy. The difficulty is not just remembering lines but getting from place to place."&lt;ref name=spoto /&gt;{{rp|p.258}}

Redgrave died in a nursing home in [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]], Buckinghamshire, on 21 March 1985, from Parkinson's disease, one day after his 77th birthday. He was cremated at [[Mortlake Crematorium]] and his ashes were scattered in the garden of [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]] (The Actors’ Church), London.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Honours, awards and appointments==
In 1951 Redgrave received the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)]] for ''[[The Browning Version (1951 film)|The Browning Version]]''.  
Redgrave twice (1958 and 1963) won Best Actor trophies in the [[Evening Standard Awards]] and twice received the [[Variety Club of Great Britain]] 'Actor of the Year' award (in the same years).

He was appointed Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1952 and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1959. He was also appointed Commander of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]], Denmark in 1955.

Redgrave became the First President of the English Speaking Board in 1953, and President of the [[Questors Theatre]], [[Ealing]] in 1958.

In 1966, he received an honorary DLitt degree from the [[University of Bristol]].

In 1986, he was inducted posthumously into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/22/theater/9-stage-veterans-enter-theater-hall-of-fame.html|title=9 Stage Veterans Enter Theater Hall of Fame|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 22, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Redgrave Theatre, Farnham|Redgrave Theatre]] in [[Farnham]], Surrey, 1974–1998, was named in his honour.

==Box office ranking==
For a number of years, British film exhibitors voted him among the top ten British stars at the box office via an annual poll in the ''Motion Picture Herald''.

==Flint water crisis==
===Role in exposing lead levels===
On 24 September 2015, in a press conference at Flint's [[Hurley Medical Center]], Dr. Hanna-Attisha revealed that Flint children's blood lead levels doubled after the water was switched from the [[Detroit River]] to the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] in April 2014.

Dr. Hanna-Attisha conducted her research after talking to a high-school friend, Elin Warn Betanzo, a former [[Environmental Protection Agency]] Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water employee and water engineer. Betanzo told Hanna-Attisha that [[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]], a water engineer and professor from [[Virginia Tech]] and his team of Flint Water Study researchers, found high levels of lead in Flint residents' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High school friend sounded first alert to Flint’s Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha|url=http://michiganradio.org/post/high-school-friend-sounded-first-alert-flint-s-dr-mona-hanna-attisha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A long friendship put spotlight on Flint water crisis|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle-riley/2016/02/06/long-friendship-put-spotlight-flint-water-crisis/79774098/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though Hanna-Attisha was not provided the data she sought from the State of Michigan, she used hospital electronic medical records as data for her study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flint doctor used Epic Systems records to expose lead crisis|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/health-med-fit/flint-doctor-used-epic-systems-records-to-expose-lead-crisis/article_ef462592-f27b-5ed0-a2ff-33232902ab74.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flint doctor makes state see light about lead in water|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/10/10/hanna-attisha-profile/73600120/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a risk to her career, Hanna-Attisha revealed her findings at the 24 September 2015 press conference before her research was scientifically peer reviewed, because of the public health implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feed|first1=Ben|title=Flint pediatrician at center of water crisis: 'You have to use your voice'|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2016/02/flint_pediatrician_at_u-m_you.html|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna-Attisha's findings were later published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]''.&lt;ref name="AJPH"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanna-Attisha|first1=Mona|last2=LaChance|first2=Jenny|last3=Sadler|first3=Richard Casey|last4=Champney Schnepp|first4=Allison|title=Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Children Associated With the Flint Drinking Water Crisis: A Spatial Analysis of Risk and Public Health Response|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|date=February 2016|volume=106|issue=2|page=283|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2015.303003|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Hanna Attisha’s findings were confirmed in a ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)]]'' published by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] in July 2016, and is recognized as an underestimate of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6525e1.htm?s_cid=mm6525e1_w |title=Blood Lead Levels Among Children Aged &lt;6 Years — Flint, Michigan, 2013–2016 |first1=Chinaro |last1=Kennedy |first2=Ellen |last2=Yard |first3=Timothy |last3=Dignam |first4=Sharunda |last4=Buchanan |first5=Suzanne |last5=Condon |first6=Mary Jean |last6=Brown |first7=Jaime |last7=Raymond |first8=Helen Schurz |last8=Rogers |first9=John |last9=Sarisky |first10=Rey de |last10=Castro |first11=Ileana |last11=Arias |first12=Patrick |last12=Breysse |date=1 January 2016|work=cdc.gov; MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=65 |issue=25 |pages=650–654 |accessdate=22 January 2017 |doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6525e1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Dr. Hanna-Attisha's 24 September 2015 press conference she urged residents, particularly children, to stop drinking the water, to end Flint River as a water source as soon as possible and urged the City of Flint to issue a health advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fonger|first1=Ron|title=Elevated lead found in more Flint kids after water switch, study finds|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/09/study_shows_twice_as_many_flin.html|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A day after Dr. Hanna-Attisha released her study, Flint issued a health advisory advising residents, particularly children, to minimize exposure to Flint tap water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fonger|first1=Ron|title=Flint to issue lead in water warning after push from doctors, health officials|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/09/flint_will_issue_lead_advisory.html|date=Sep 24, 2015|publisher=[[MLive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The water source was switched back to the Detroit River on 16 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daniel|first1=Bethencourt|title=Flint taps Detroit water; it'll take 3 weeks for safe use|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/10/16/flint-reconnecting-detroit-water-5-pm-friday/74074740/|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the City of Flint, the State of Michigan and the United States made emergency declarations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egan|first1=Paul|title=President Obama declares emergency in Flint|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/01/16/president-obama-declares-emergency-flint/78898604/|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Hanna-Attisha's research was initially ridiculed by the State of Michigan, when a Michigan Department of Environmental 
Quality spokesperson accused her of being an "unfortunate researcher" "splicing and dicing numbers" who was causing "near hysteria."&lt;ref name="light"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erb|first1=Robin|title=Flint doctor makes state see light about lead in water|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/10/10/hanna-attisha-profile/73600120/|website=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About ten days later, after ''[[The Detroit Free Press]]'' published its own findings consistent with Dr. Hanna-Attisha's findings and after Hanna-Attisha engaged in one-on-one conversations with Michigan's chief medical officer, the State of Michigan backed down and concurred with her findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanner|first1=Kristi|title=State data confirms higher blood-lead levels in Flint kids|url=http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/09/26/state-data-flint-lead/72820798/|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State's top doctor admits 'missed opportunity' for earlier Flint response|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/01/23/health-department-flint-water-lead/79174598/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at the press conference in which the State of Michigan acknowledged the lead in water crisis, Department of Environmental Quality officials apologized to Hanna-Attisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodrick|first1=Stephen|title=Who Poisoned Flint, Michigan?|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/who-poisoned-flint-michigan-20160122|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 19 January 2016 State of the State address, Governor Snyder publicly thanked Hanna-Attisha and Edwards for sounding the alarm about the Flint water crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egan|first1=Paul|title=Snyder apologizes for Flint crisis, to release e-mails|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/01/19/snyder-address-flint-water-shut-offs-tonight/78994522/|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Michigan State of the State Transcript|url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/snyder/2016_Michigan_State_of_the_State_Transcript_511676_7.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy and program involvement===
Dr. Hanna-Attisha testified twice before Congress about the Flint Water Crisis and penned an op/ed advocating for federal assistance for Flint children exposed as a result of the crisis published in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanna-Attisha|first1=Mona|title=The Future for Flint's Children|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/opinion/sunday/the-future-for-flints-children.html?_r=1|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, in part due to Dr. Hanna-Attisha's advocacy, $100 million in federal dollars was allocated to Flint in addition to approximately $250 million in state dollars to address the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-awards-100-million-michigan-flint-water-infrastructure-upgrades|title=EPA Awards $100 Million to  Michigan for Flint Water Infrastructure Upgrades|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in response to the crisis, Hanna-Attisha worked to establish, was a founding donor, raises money for and is on the advisory board of the Flint Child Health and Development Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flint Water Crisis Response – Foundation for Flint|url=https://www.cfgf.org/cfgf/GoodWork/FlintArea/WaterCrisis/tabid/855/Default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one year, the Flintkids.org Fund raised over $17 million and awarded over $2 million in grants directly supporting Flint kids' health and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfgf.org/cfgf/GoodWork/FlintArea/WaterCrisis/tabid/855/Default.aspx)|title=Flint Water Crisis Response - Foundation for Flint|last=|first=|date=|website=Community Foundation of Grater Flint|access-date=May 8, 2017}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Raised by his mother in [[Ben Gardane]], Nizar Nawar was a "mediocre" student who never completed high school. His father, who moved to [[Lyon]], France in 1971, visited the family routinely, but was unable to help his son gain an [[Visa (document)|entry visa]] to France in 1999, since he could not prove he had the financial capacity to support him.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt;

Nizar Nawar was not considered religious, as he drank and wore un-Islamic clothing, while traveling to Libya to purchase cheap trinkets that he sold in Tunisian markets.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt;

In 1999, Nizar Nawar told his family he was traveling to South Korea to work in restaurants. Nine months later he phoned his parents "very bitter, very angry", and explained he had no money and said the restaurant had refused to pay him. He asked them to help him fly back to Tunisia.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt;

Upon returning to Tunisia, Nawar moved to Montreal,&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress – Federal Research Division, [[s:Asian Criminal and Terrorist Activity in Canada/terror|Asian Criminal and Terrorist Activity in Canada: Foreign Terrorist Organizations]], July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; where he told his family he'd been accepted into a [[travel agency]] school.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt;

In 2001, his father moved the remaining family members to France.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt;

Nawar remained in Canada until February 2002, when he and several others traveled to Tunisia to prepare for the attack.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; He told his family that the others were from the travel agency.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt;

==Attack==
[[Image:El-Ghriba Synagogue.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Synagogue entrance through which fuel tanker truck drove during attack]]
Nawar worked at a legitimate travel agency under the alias ''Seif el-Islam Ettounsi'' while in Tunisia, where he constructed the "crude" bomb for the attack himself.&lt;ref name="trim"&gt;Hedges, Chris. [[New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/09/world/tunisian-killed-in-synagogue-blast-was-unlikely-convert-to-militancy.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Tunisian killed in Synagogue blast was unlikely convert to militancy], 9 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="app"/&gt; During this time, he often stayed with his uncle Belgasem Nawar, who purchased the truck that was eventually used in the bombing.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt; Just before the attack, he mailed a letter to [[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]] in which he took responsibility for the attack in the name of [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;[[BBC]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1937075.stm Al-Qaeda suspected over Tunisia blast], 18 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on 11 April 2002, he and a colleague drove the truck loaded with natural gas canisters behind a German tourist bus near the synagogue.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt; Nawar then used a cell phone belonging to his brother, to phone [[Christian Ganczarski]],&lt;ref name="bob"&gt;[[BBC]],[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7873543.stm Two jailed over Tunisia bombing], 5 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; whom he asked to pray for him.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command]], [http://file.sunshinepress.org:54445/us-crimintsum-2002-5-3.pdf Criminal Investigation Summary; May 03 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a phone call with [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]].&lt;ref name="bob"/&gt; After his colleague fled the scene on foot, Nawar detonated the explosives.&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt; The truck detonated at the front of the synagogue, killing 14 German tourists, five Tunisians, and two French nationals.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7873543.stm|work=BBC News|title=Two jailed over Tunisia bombing|date=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 others were wounded.

Following the blast, Tunisian officials identified his remains through [[dental records]].&lt;ref name="trim"/&gt; They initially labeled the explosion an accident, until they were made aware of the letter sent to the al-Quds media outlet and re-labeled it as an attack.&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt; His uncle was arrested shortly after the bombing.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Then Tunisian president [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] replaced both ministers in charge of internal security two weeks after the attack, having [[Hedi M'henni]] replace [[Abdallah Kaabi]] as Minister of the Interior, and Mohamed Hedi ben Hassine replace [[Mohamed Ali Ganzaoui]] as head of National Security.&lt;ref name="app"/&gt;

In June 2002, [[Sulaiman Abu Ghaith]] spoke on [[al-Jazeera]] to confirm that the attack was carried out by Nizar Nawar with al-Qaeda's help, since Nawar "could not see his Palestinian brothers killed while Jews walked freely in [[Djerba]] to enjoy themselves and practice their religion".&lt;ref name="app"/&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' stated that his residence in Canada proved "that Canada, despite new antiterrorist measures approved by Parliament under intense pressure from the United States, remains an important haven for bin Laden's operatives"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin|last=Nickerson|title=Terror ties to Canada highlight a US concern|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F424EB48D4E8D14&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613221302/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/164/nation/Terror_ties_to_Canada_highlight_a_US_concern+.shtml|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|date=13 June 2002|archivedate=13 June 2002|accessdate=6 May 2009|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months after the attack, his parents, brother and brother-in-law were arrested in France under anti-terrorism laws, while authorities investigated if they had any connection to the bombing.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Craig.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12199">'''Omar al-Bayoumi''' ({{lang-ar|عمر البيومي}}) is a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] national who claims to have befriended, rather than ran as agents, two of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] hijackers in the [[United States]]. FBI files dating back to before the attacks demonstrate that he is a Saudi Arabian intelligence agent.&lt;ref name="28psl"&gt;{{cite web

Saudi Arabia claims that al-Bayoumi is not an [[spy|agent]] of theirs.&lt;ref name="28psl"/&gt; Per previously-classified memoranda released by the [[National Archives]] in May 2016, as of June 6, 2003, "the FBI "believes it is possible that he was an agent of the Saudi Government and that he may have been reporting on the local community to the Saudi Government officials.  In addition, during its investigation, the FBI discovered that al-Bayoumi has ties to terrorist elements as well."&lt;ref&gt;page 7, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/17/us/document-saudi-memos-9-11.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income==
Al-Bayoumi was probably born around 1958, but virtually nothing is known of al-Bayoumi's early life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Until 1994, he lived in Saudi Arabia, working for the [[Military of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Ministry of Defense and Aviation]], a department headed by Prince [[Sultan bin Abdul Aziz]].

In August 1994, al-Bayoumi moved to the [[United States]] and settled down in [[San Diego, California]], where he became involved in the local [[Muslim]] community. He was very inquisitive, and was known to always carry around a [[video camera]]. According to several sources,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/terror/20020914-9999_1n14connect.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego-online.com/issues/september03/featurec0903.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803045554/http://www.sandiego-online.com/issues/september03/featurec0903.shtml |archivedate=2004-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.com/news/838867.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; al-Bayoumi was strongly suspected by many residents of being a Saudi government spy. The man the FBI considered their "best source" in San Diego said that al-Bayoumi "must be an intelligence officer for Saudi Arabia or another foreign power," according to ''Newsweek'' magazine.

During this time, al-Bayoumi was in the [[United States]] as part of a work-study program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Report on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saudi [[General Authority of Civil Aviation]] paid al-Bayoumi's salary through a government contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Report on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|pages=218, 515 n.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the contractor proposed terminating its relationship with al-Bayoumi in 1999, a Saudi government official replied with a letter marked "extremely urgent" that the government wanted al-Bayoumi's contract renewed "as quickly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://advancement.sdsu.edu/marcomm/news/clips/Archive/Aug2003/081103/081103wsj.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Al-Bayoumi's employment with the project continued.

In June 1998, an anonymous Saudi philanthropist donated $500,000 to have a [[Kurd]]ish mosque built in San Diego, on the condition that al-Bayoumi be hired as maintenance manager with a private office. The donation was accepted, but because al-Bayoumi rarely showed up for work, the mosque's leadership became unhappy with him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Eventually, they moved to fire him.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Some time in late 1999 or early 2000, Omar al-Bayoumi began receiving another monthly payment—this one from [[Princess Haifa bint Faisal]], the wife of [[Bandar bin Sultan]], the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Checks for between $2,000 and $3,000 were sent monthly from the princess, through two or three intermediaries, to al-Bayoumi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/alqaida/story/0,12469,846881,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The payments continued for several years, totaling between $50,000 and $75,000. According to the recent release of documents by 2002 Congressional Inquiry into the September 11 Attacks, Omar al-Bayoumi was not the recipient of the checks Osama Bassnan wife was. He was a close associate of Omar al-Bayoumi, Bassan made comments to an FBI source "That he did more for the hijackers than al-Bayoumi did."   The report further states the even though the money was meant for Bassnan, al-Bayoumi's wife had attempted to deposit three of the checks into her own account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2994059/Sept-11-28-Pages.pdf|title=Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attack on September 11, 2001|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar==
On January 15, 2000, future 9/11 hijackers [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] flew to [[Los Angeles, California]] from [[Bangkok, Thailand]], just after attending the [[2000 Al Qaeda Summit]] in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]. The final [[9/11 Commission]] Report noted:
:''Hazmi and Mihdhar were ill-prepared for a mission in the United States. ... Neither had spent any substantial time in the West, and neither spoke much, if any, English. It would therefore be plausible that they or [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed] would have tried to identify, in advance, a friendly contact for them in the United States. ... We believe it unlikely that Hazmi and Mihdhar ... would have come to the United States without arranging to receive assistance from one or more individuals informed in advance of their arrival."''

Al-Bayoumi met the hijackers at a restaurant after their landing; he claims he met them by accident. He invited the two hijackers to move to San Diego with him, and they did. Al-Bayoumi found them an apartment, co-signed the lease, and advanced them $1,500 to help pay for their rent. The 9/11 Commission, however, concluded that "[n]either then nor later did Bayoumi give money to either Hazmi or Mihdhar." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Report on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Bayoumi also helped the two obtain driver's licenses, rides to Social Security, and information on flight schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Funding Terror |work=In These Times |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/funding_terror/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Bayoumi says he was being kind to fellow Muslims in need, and had no idea of their plans. But according to Newsweek magazine a former top FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "We firmly believed that he had knowledge [of the 9/11 plot], and that his meeting with them that day was more than coincidence." {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Other FBI officials, however, concluded that al-Bayoumi was not a witting accomplice of the hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shannon |first=Elaine |last2=Zagorin |first2=Adam |last3=Duffy |first3=Michael |publisher=Time |url=http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,393590,00.html |title=Feds Doubt Allegations of Saudi Terror Funding}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As one FBI official explained, "We could not find any contact between him and terrorists, any involvement (with al-Qaeda). There was nothing to indicate he's any different from any of the hundreds of people who had contact with the hijackers, who were unwitting to the fact that they were going to be hijackers. It just wasn't there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shannon |first=Elaine |last2=Zagorin |first2=Adam |last3=Duffy |first3=Michael |work=Time |url=http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,393590,00.html |title=Feds Doubt Allegations of Saudi Terror Funding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdar's neighbors later reported that the two struck them as quite odd. They had no furniture, they constantly played flight simulator games, and limousines picked them up for short rides in the middle of the night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/wplot.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2002/national-reporting/works/093001.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, al-Bayoumi lived across the street from them. Throughout this period his salary greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/sep/07/questions-linger-over-two-san-diego-september-11th/&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdar later moved into the house of [[Abdussattar Shaikh]], a friend of al-Bayoumi's, who was secretly working as an FBI informant at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2003/07/25/news/top_stories/7_25_035_34_23.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and release==
In July 2001, Omar al-Bayoumi moved to [[England]] to pursue a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at [[Aston University]]. Ten days after the September 11 attacks he was arrested by British authorities working with the FBI. He was held on an immigration charge while the FBI and [[Scotland Yard]] investigated him. His phone calls, bank accounts, and associations were researched, but the FBI says they found no connections to terrorism. When interrogators asked Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, whether he knew al-Bayoumi, he said that he did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Report on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|pages=515–516 n.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released, and went back to studying at Aston,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/printouth/0,8816,393590,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and later moved to Saudi Arabia.

The issue was reopened when the potential links between al-Bayoumi and the Saudi Embassy were reported in the press. Under pressure from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the FBI re-examined the case. They concluded that the allegations were "without merit," and they "abandoned further investigation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A51669-2003Sep9&amp;notFound=true]&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary news accounts reported that "countless intelligence leads that might help solve [the case] appear to have been under investigated or completely overlooked by the FBI."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego-online.com/issues/september03/featurec0903.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803045554/http://www.sandiego-online.com/issues/september03/featurec0903.shtml |archivedate=2004-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final 9/11 Commission reports stated "we have seen no credible evidence that he believed in [[violent extremism]], or knowingly aided extremist groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Report on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per previously-classified memoranda released by the [[National Archives]] in May 2016, as of June 6, 2003, "the FBI "believes it is possible that he was an agent of the Saudi Government and that he may have been reporting on the local community to the Saudi Government officials.

===IntelliQuest===

{{quote box
|quote  = I was always interested in what motivates human behavior... When I completed my PhD, I realized I had an opportunity to apply what I knew to the emerging world of personal technology, when companies like Apple and Microsoft were just getting started. I started IntelliQuest Information, Inc., which I later took public, to analyze how people were using personal technology and incorporating it into their lives.  What was so interesting about the technology world in the 1980s was that companies were very good at product development but were not so good at tuning in to marketplace needs.  I was able to inform business efforts by providing consumer information that I gathered through some of the first electronic surveys.

==Life account==

[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 89 - Karageorgevitch 02.jpg |thumb|[[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].]]

Prince Bojidar belonged to the senior line of the [[Karađorđević dynasty]] (his older brother was [[Prince Alexis Karageorgevich|Prince Alexis Karađorđević]]). He was the second son of [[Prince George of Yugoslavia (1827–1884)|Prince George Karađorđević]] and his wife [[Sara Karageorgevitch|Sara Karađorđević]] (born Sara Anastasijević). His grandfather Prince Aleksa was the eldest son of [[Karađorđe Petrović]], the founder of the House of Karađorđević and leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]].

Prince Bojidar lived in France for most of his life as the members of the Karađorđević dynasty were in exile after [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Prince Alexander Karađorđević]] lost the Serbian throne in 1858. Bojidar travelled a lot and went on a number of trips around the world. He served in the [[French Army]] and fought in the French campaign at [[Tonking]] and was decorated with the Cross of the [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper=New York Times |pages=2 |date=1913-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; To earn a living he gave singing and drawing lessons before becoming a translator and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knapp | first = Bettina Liebowitz | title = Judith Gautier: Writer, Orientalist, Musicologist, Feminist, a Literary Biography | publisher = University Press of America | year = 2004 | pages = 277 | isbn = 0-7618-3000-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Serbia twice at the turn of the century (1897 and either late 1899 or early 1900), both times semi-incognito, trying to evaluate the general feel in the population about a possible replacement of the [[Obrenović dynasty]] with the [[Karađorđević dynasty|Karađorđevićs]] should King [[Alexander I of Serbia|Alexander Obrenović]] die childless, as was expected to happen at the time, due to the King's marriage with Queen [[Draga Obrenović|Draga]] of an age beyond childbirth years at the time. He also visited Serbia once after his second cousin once removed King [[Peter I Karađorđević]] was enthroned but became disillusioned with the treatment he received (mostly ignored by his regal relative).

During one of his trips abroad, he travelled extensively around [[India]], visiting thirty eight cities. He wrote a book about his experiences called ''Enchanted India'' in which he offered an account of the Indian people, their religious rites, and other ceremonies. He also provided detailed descriptions of the Indian landscape and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Books about India |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |pages=BR501 |date=1898-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated works of [[Tolstoy]] and Hungarian dramatist [[Mór Jókai]].

Taking an interest in art, he visited Munich, Dresden, and Berlin and spent some months in Italy; afterwards he settled at Paris. There he regularly contributed articles to the ''Figaro'', ''La Revue de Paris'', the ''Magazine of Art'' ([[Ilya Repin]], [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]]), including a biography of [[Marie Bashkirtseff]] in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 11th Edition, Vol. III''. Like all [[journalist]]s he was drawn to the [[cabaret]]s of [[Montmartre]], the haunt of artists, writers, poets, philosophers. It was there he met and befriended French stage actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]], pioneer of modern dance [[Loie Fuller|Loïe Fuller]], French poet, novelist and noted orientalist [[Judith Gautier]], Suzanne Meyer-Zundel, Austrian composer [[Hugo Wolf]], painter and illustrator [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and founder of the Ballets Russes [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. Biographer [[Stevan K. Pavlowitch]] claims that the Prince was openly gay and had no relationship with women except purely platonic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gay-serbia.com/press/2003/03-03-06-profil-karadjordjevic-bozidar/index.jsp?aid=664 ''Profil'' magazine, Issue 22, reprinted here in Serbian]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years Prince Karadjordjevitch turned his attention in decoration, and executed panels and medallions for a Paris [[atelier]] as a designer, sculptor, painter and [[silversmith]], and often spent time with [[Georges Lacombe (painter)|Georges Lacombe]], [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], [[Paul Sérusier]] and other members of [[Les Nabis]]. Karageorgevitch's paintings, illustrations, watercolors and silversmith works were first exhibited in Belgrade in 1908.

As a journalist and a publicist he advocated the emancipation of all Slavs and Romanians under the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]; he also favoured the emancipation of the small states in the south-east of Europe, particularly Serbian lands, from Turkish supremacy. Prince Karadjordjevitch, who is known to a wider circle as a friend of writer [[Pierre Loti]] and the great Russian artist [[Marie Bashkirtseff]], published some reminiscences, ''La Vie Multiple,'' and ''Notes sur L'Inde'', both issued posthumously. Marie Bashkirtseff's friend since adolescence, Karadjordjevitch stood by her side during her last days and he was present at her deathbed. She was only 25 when she died, a victim of [[tuberculosis]], in 1884. On the 20th anniversary of her death, in 1904 January edition of ''Revue des Revues'', Karadjordjevitch would describe Bashkirtseff's last moments:

''Marie rises a bit, releases a soft sigh, the sigh of tiny children when waking, and two thick tears roll down her cheek....then her head falls again into the pillow.''

He died at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] on 2 April 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of a Servian Prince |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |pages=C2 |date=1908-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René Grillet de Roven''', also '''René Grilliet''', was a French mechanic and watchmaker who designed a mechanical calculating machine in the 17th century.

== Biography ==
Grillet came from [[Rouen]] in northwestern France, the capital city of [[Normandy]]. He served as watchmaker to [[King Louis XIV]].

[[File:Grillet arithmetical machine-CnAM 798-1-IMG 6493.JPG|thumb|Grillet's arithmetical calculating machine, on display at [[Musée des arts et métiers]].]]
In 1673 Grillet published a small book, ''Curiositez mathematiques de l'invention du Sr Grillet horlogeur a Paris'', in which he announced the invention of an arithmetical calculating machine.  A few years later, in 1678, he wrote a short article in ''[[Le Journal des Sçavans]]'' describing the machine.  According to Grillet, he was inspired by [[Blaise Pascal]]'s work with calculating machines to combine the [[Pascaline]] with [[Napier's bones]], and build a machine that could perform both addition and multiplication.

Grillet displayed his machine at fairs in France and the Netherlands between 1673 and 1681.  He tried to establish a business of manufacturing and selling calculating machines, with unclear success.

In addition to the calculating machine, in his career Grillet invented a [[hygrometer]] (for which he was accused of plagiarism by another inventor); [[graphometer]]s; drawing instrument set; [[protractor]], [[set square]], with [[plumb-bob]].

In 1690, the first textile-printing factory in England was established by a Frenchman named René Grillet, who took out a patent on the process.

Congo]], [[Liberia]], OPT/[[Israel]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Sudan]]. Watchlist strengthens field-level monitoring, reporting and response to violations against children by building [[Partnership|partnerships]], enhancing the technical capacity of local [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and linking local voices with international policy makers.

==Policy Advice==
Watchlist provides policy advice to high-level decision makers towards improving child protection programs and policies, with a focus on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and the UN-led Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on Children and Armed Conflict (MRM).
